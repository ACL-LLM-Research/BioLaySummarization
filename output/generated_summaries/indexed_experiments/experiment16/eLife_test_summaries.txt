Biologists have long known that nervous systems use two main types of communication: chemical and electrical synapses. Chemical synapses involve the release of neurotransmitters, while electrical synapses rely on direct cell-to-cell connections called gap junctions. However, the structure of electrical synapses is not as well understood as chemical synapses. A recent study investigated the organization of electrical synapses in zebrafish, a type of fish commonly used in scientific research.

The researchers focused on a specific type of electrical synapse called the Mauthner cell, which is found in the zebrafish nervous system. They used a technique called expansion microscopy to examine the structure of these synapses in detail. This technique allowed them to visualize the arrangement of proteins and other molecules within the synapse.

The study found that electrical synapses in zebrafish Mauthner cells are composed of multiple gap junctions, which are clusters of intercellular channels that allow direct communication between cells. These gap junctions were found to be closely associated with adherens junctions, which are structures that help cells stick together. In contrast, glutamate receptors, which are responsible for transmitting chemical signals, were found to be confined to small areas of the synapse.

The researchers also found that most of the surface area of the synapse is occupied by gap junctions and adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional relationship between these two structures. This is in contrast to chemical synapses, which have distinct pre- and postsynaptic components.

The study's findings provide new insights into the structure and organization of electrical synapses, which are found throughout animal nervous systems. The results suggest that electrical synapses are more complex than previously thought, with multiple gap junctions working together to facilitate communication between cells. This knowledge can help scientists better understand how electrical synapses function and how they contribute to the overall functioning of the nervous system. The study's findings can also inform the development of new treatments for neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, which are often associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
Biomedical researchers have identified a key group of neurons in the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) that play a crucial role in generating the inspiratory breathing rhythm. These neurons project directly to the facial nucleus (7n) motoneurons, which coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To better understand the function of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons, scientists used a combination of optogenetic and viral transgenic approaches to selectively inhibit these neurons and observe their effects on breathing and orofacial activity.

The results showed that photoinhibition of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons affected mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. However, the effects of photoinhibition varied depending on the type of anesthetic used and whether the animals were anesthetized or conscious. The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also sent collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved in autonomic activity regulation.

The study suggests that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy for understanding the mechanisms that coordinate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is particularly important because abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been linked to the development and progression of various diseases.

The researchers propose that the facial nucleus-projecting preBötC neurons transmit respiratory rhythm, rather than generating it, and that their small effect on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals. To test this hypothesis, the scientists used a combinatorial viral transgenic approach to selectively transduce and photoinhibit preBötC facial premotor neurons. The results showed that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affected orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity.

The study also found that selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to the facial nucleus had small effects on breathing, particularly under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia and its recovery phases. The researchers observed a smaller population of transduced neurons with a more restricted anatomical location using the selective approach. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms that coordinate breathing with orofacial activity and have implications for understanding the development and progression of diseases associated with abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors.

     Biomedical research has shed light on the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in processing aversive information and signaling a general alarm to the forebrain. Recent studies have primarily focused on the involvement of CGRP neurons in passive defensive behaviors, such as freezing responses. However, a new study has explored their role in active defensive behaviors using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice.

     The study found that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, suggesting that these neurons amplify the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning.

     The researchers used a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and other aversive stimuli of varying threat levels to record neuronal activity. They found that CGRP neurons encode different threat intensities through variations in firing duration and amplitude. The study also demonstrated that stimulating CGRP neurons without external aversive stimuli generates rapid, unconditioned freezing behavior in mice.

     The findings suggest that CGRP neurons play a critical role in modulating adaptive defensive behaviors depending on the severity or type of threat. Under heightened threat conditions, such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds, these neurons strengthen active defensive behaviors by amplifying perceived threat. The study expands the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.
Biomedical researchers used diffusion-weighted MRI scans from approximately 30,000 participants in the UK Biobank to investigate the relationship between obesity and brain structure. They found significant associations between obesity, measured by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF) and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF). ISOVF is an index of free water, and ICVF is an index of neurite density.

The researchers identified two distinct brain systems associated with obesity: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system linked to ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system linked to ICVF. The ISOVF-WHR system was found to co-locate with genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. In contrast, the ICVF-WHR system co-located with genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors.

The researchers estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF (rg = 0.026, P = 0.36) and ICVF (rg = 0.112, P < 9×10−4), as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF (P < 0.05). These results suggest a two-way mechanistic model, where genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, while water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.

The researchers also found that maps of ISOVF-WHR and ICVF-WHR were negatively correlated (r = -0.366, P = 2.3×10−13), indicating that obesity is associated with coupled but anatomically distinct changes in measures of brain water and neurite density. Additionally, the researchers used genome-wide association statistics (GWAS) to estimate the genetic correlations between each MRI metric and WHR, and found that WHR had a tighter genetic correlation with ICVF than ISOVF. Finally, the researchers used prior data on human brain distribution of multiple neurotransmitter receptors to investigate the brain systems where obesity was strongly associated with brain micro-structure measured by ISOVF or ICVF. Both ISOVF and ICVF were significantly and mostly positively correlated with WHR in brain systems.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in metastasis, the process by which cancer spreads from its original site to other parts of the body. CSCs undergo a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which allows them to acquire a more invasive and migratory phenotype. However, the relevance of EMT CSCs to human cancer has been uncertain, as they have not been directly observed in human tumour specimens.

     To address this knowledge gap, a team of researchers used a combination of immunofluorescent staining and machine learning to identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens. They examined over 12,000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours and found a significant enrichment of cells co-stained for EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin, which are markers associated with EMT and CSCs. These cells were found to be disseminating beyond the tumour body into the surrounding stromal region.

     The researchers used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict metastasis based on the presence of these EMT CSCs. The ANN was trained on the imaging data and achieved a high accuracy of 87-89% in predicting metastasis. Importantly, the presence of these disseminating stem cells was strongly correlated with tumour metastasis.

     The study found that single EMT CSCs could be identified in human oral cancer specimens, and these cells were highly predictive of metastatic disease. The researchers also showed that the combination of EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin was necessary to accurately identify disseminating EMT CSCs, as EpCAM alone was not sufficient to mark these cells.

     This study provides new insights into the role of EMT CSCs in human cancer and demonstrates the potential of machine learning to predict metastasis based on imaging data. The findings have important implications for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cancer.

     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of apoptosis and efferocytosis in tissue repair. Apoptosis is the process by which cells die and are removed from the body, while efferocytosis is the process by which cells engulf and clear apoptotic cells. However, the mechanisms by which these processes regulate tissue repair are not fully understood.

     A recent study used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. The researchers found that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors were elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident Lyve1+ macrophages, during inflammation. The study also found that human diabetic foot wounds upregulated mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and displayed altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6.

     In mouse wounds, the researchers detected upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in vivo in mice revealed that Axl signaling was required for wound repair but was dispensable for efferocytosis. In contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreased efferocytosis and abrogated wound repair.

     The study provides an atlas for the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level. The researchers found that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways were upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients. Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds, the data show that efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair.

     The study also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds, and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds. The findings highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provide potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues using single-cell sequencing technologies. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identifying specific cell types in single-cell sequencing datasets remains a challenge. To address this issue, a new genetic barcoding approach called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) has been developed. This method utilizes the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. TaG-EM involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct, enabling the barcode sequence to be read out during single-cell sequencing and labeling a cell population of interest. By creating multiple independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables the positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, the identification of multiplet droplets, and the barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements. This approach has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens and improve the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments. The genetic barcodes can be quantified from mixtures of barcoded fly lines using next-generation sequencing, providing a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing. Additionally, these genetic barcodes can be used to multiplex behavioral or other phenotypic measurements. Although TaG-EM barcodes are not observed in all cells in single-cell gene expression data, the method provides a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms. Overall, TaG-EM is a valuable tool for advancing our understanding of biological processes and improving the accuracy of single-cell transcriptomic experiments.
Biologists have long sought to understand how poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae evolved the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense. However, research has been biased towards colorful, defended species, leaving the origins of this trait in inconspicuous, undefended species unclear. A new study provides evidence that species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable, albeit low, amounts of alkaloids. The researchers found that these frogs regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. This suggests that diet alone cannot explain the defended phenotype.

The study proposes a new concept, "passive accumulation," which differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms, yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. Passive accumulation is thought to be an ancestral state in Dendrobatidae and possibly in related taxa. The researchers propose that selection acts on toxin elimination and resistance to result in toxin accumulation and chemical defense.

The study incorporates ideas from pharmacokinetics with data from poison frogs to develop an evolutionary model that could explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals. The model suggests that many animals, including poison frogs, have been exposed to toxins through their diet for a long time. However, few experiments have been done to quantify the relationship between natural toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs.

The study presents a novel alkaloid dataset for dendrobatid frogs and some relatives, but it is limited. The researchers propose that most, if not all, dendrobatids and their most recent common ancestors have long been exposed to toxins through their diet. The study highlights the need for further research on the relationship between natural toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of chemical defenses in animals and the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.
Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the role of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in chemotherapy resistance and advanced breast cancer. EMT is a complex process involving redundant signaling pathways and its reversal, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), which has hindered the development of effective treatments. A recent study utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. The findings revealed that ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) is elevated during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes.

RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis, mediated by ERK and mTOR signaling, are essential for EMT/MET completion. Inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Importantly, combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. The study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.

The researchers employed a unique EMT-lineage-tracing model to discover that the RiBi pathway is transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT/MET. The enhanced activation of the RiBi pathway diminishes as tumor cells accomplish phenotype changes. In general, a lower RiBi activity was observed in mesenchymal tumor cells than in epithelial ones. Consistent with the Tri-PyMT model, a combination of RiBi inhibition and chemotherapy led to a significantly lower metastatic tumor burden than the mock or mono-treatment groups.

The study further investigated the potential association of RiBi activity with EMT status of tumor cells in human breast cancer by analyzing scRNA-seq data of primary tumor cells from two breast cancer patients. The results suggested that the upregulated RiBi pathway is equally needed for mesenchymal tumor cells to undergo MET during their outgrowth in the lungs. Ribosome biogenesis was recognized as a crucial factor in cancer pathogenesis a century ago. The involvement of unwonted RiBi activities during both EMT and MET processes makes RiBi a new and better target for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis. Targeting the RiBi pathway by RNase Pol I inhibitor impaired the EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells and significantly synergized with common chemotherapeutics.

Biomedical research has long sought to understand how the brain processes and encodes language in real-world contexts. A recent study aimed to investigate the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts during movie watching to determine the extent to which brain responses change depending on visual context. The study found that across different contexts, concrete and abstract concepts encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, when multimodal context is considered, these differences are reduced. Specifically, the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organization is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information.

The brain is adept at integrating information across sensory modalities to form coherent conceptual representations, a process critical for navigating the multimodal nature of real-world experiences. The study's findings highlight the role of visual context in modulating the neural representation of abstract and concrete words. The researchers predicted that when abstract concepts are situated in highly related contexts, they engage neurobiological regions that are usually involved in processing concrete concepts and related to processing of external visual information. Conversely, when concrete concepts are displaced from the visual context, they engage more abstract-like regions in the brain that are related to processing of internal/interoceptive/affective information.

The study conducted two sets of analyses to understand the extent to which representations associated with concrete or abstract conceptual processing in the brain change as a function of context. The results show that brain activation underlying concrete and abstract conceptual processing fundamentally changes as a function of visual context. This suggests that the neurobiological organization of concepts is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes and encodes language in real-world contexts and highlight the importance of considering the role of visual context in modulating neural representation. The results also suggest that similar effects may be observed in contexts that engage other sensory modalities.
Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in cancer immunotherapy, but its widespread application is hindered by the limited number of targetable antigens on tumor cells. A key obstacle is the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which conceals neoantigens by destroying RNA products from genes with truncating mutations. To address this challenge, scientists developed a high-throughput screen to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. The screen implicated the kinase SMG1 as a potential disruptor of NMD, leading to the design of a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001.

KVS0001 was shown to elevate the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Notably, KVS0001 increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. This breakthrough provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which it plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.

The researchers demonstrated that KVS0001 effectively blocked the NMD pathway at concentrations as low as 600 nM, leading to equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts. Western blotting confirmed that KVS0001 substantially decreased the amount of phosphorylated UPF1, the downstream target of SMG1 kinase activity, in three different cell lines. Furthermore, treatment of cancer cell lines with KVS0001 resulted in specific increases in the transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, similar to previously reported SMG1-specific small molecule inhibitors.

The development of KVS0001 overcame the challenges associated with previous NMD inhibitors, which were either non-specific or toxic. KVS0001 is a specific inhibitor of SMG1 that is soluble and can be easily administered to mice, making it a promising tool for studying NMD and its role in disease. Overall, the discovery of KVS0001 offers new avenues for cancer immunotherapy and the treatment of diseases associated with NMD.
Biomedical researchers have identified age as the primary risk factor for cancer, but aging rates vary significantly among individuals. To better understand the relationship between aging and cancer risk, a new measure called Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge) was explored in a study of 374,463 participants from the UK Biobank. PhenoAge is calculated using chronological age and nine biomarkers, and Phenotypic Age Acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) is determined by subtracting the effect of chronological age from PhenoAge.

The study found that individuals with older PhenoAge had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer compared to those with biologically younger PhenoAge, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.22 in men and 1.26 in women. The researchers also observed a joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2.29 for men and 1.94 for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared to those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge.

PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors, indicating that adherence to a healthy lifestyle can retard the aging process and reduce cancer risk. Within and across genetic risk groups, older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer, even after adjusting for chronological age.

The study's findings suggest that accelerated aging, as measured by PhenoAgeAccel, is associated with an increased risk of several site-specific cancers and overall cancer. The researchers also found that participants with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge had the greatest incident cancer risk. In stratification analyses, older PhenoAge was significantly associated with a higher incident cancer risk across genetic risk groups, with standardized 5-year incident cancer rates of 5.78% and 4.58% for biologically younger men and women, respectively, compared to 6.90% and 5.17% for those older.

The study's results provide a cost-effective indicator for measuring biological age and a novel biomarker for cancer risk prediction. The findings are consistent with previous studies that have investigated the associations between biological age and cancer risk, suggesting that different measures of biological age may reflect different aspects of aging and could be jointly applied in cancer risk assessment.
Biome, a mobile app launched in Japan, has collected over 6 million species observations since 2019. The app uses species identification algorithms and gamification elements to gather data from the public. However, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. To address this, researchers investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on species distribution models (SDMs).

The study found that species identification accuracy exceeded 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but was below 90% for seed plants, molluscs, and fishes. The researchers built SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan, using both traditional survey data and Biome data. The results showed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved the accuracy of SDMs. For endangered species, traditional survey data required over 2000 records for accurate models, while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300.

The study suggests that the uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain the improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. The researchers conclude that establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.

The study highlights the potential of community-based survey platforms like Biome to improve biodiversity assessment. SDMs are effective statistical tools for assessing biodiversity, but can be further improved by incorporating community-based data. The inclusion of Biome data resulted in improved accuracy of SDMs, with the most accurate model predictions obtained when the training data consisted of 50-70% Biome data. The study demonstrates the importance of combining traditional surveys and citizen observations for a comprehensive understanding of species distributions.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the causes of congenital pulmonary cysts, a condition characterized by abnormal lung development. While previous studies have implicated disrupted airway epithelial cell growth in the formation of cystic lesions, the role of lung mesenchymal cells in this process has remained unclear. In a recent study, scientists used genetic mouse models to investigate the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1a (Bmpr1a)-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development.

The researchers found that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were observed in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. Additionally, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs.

Interestingly, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. This suggests that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.

The study provides solid in vivo evidence that Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchymal cells is indispensable in lung development. Lung mesenchymal deletion of Bmpr1a at an early developmental stage causes abnormal branching morphogenesis and severe lung cysts at late gestation in mice. This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation, as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2+ or expansion of Sox9+ in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching, as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs.

The researchers specifically deleted Bmpr1a in fetal lung mesenchymal cells, which resulted in abnormal airway development and subsequent prenatal cystic malformation. The inverse relationship between Bmpr1a deletion (intracellular BMP signaling) and Bmp4 ligand expression in these fetal lung mesenchymal progenitor cells was further confirmed by comparing Bmp4 expression in isolated fetal lung mesenchymal cells with different Bmpr1a genotypes. Alterations of other key pathways, including Fgf, Wnt, and Shh, were not detected by RNA-seq and RT-PCR through analyzing the related targeted genes.

This pathological phenotype resembles the features observed in pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM). Therefore, investigating the abnormal lung phenotypes caused by lung mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a knockout and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will significantly enhance our understanding of congenital lung diseases.
Biomedical researchers have investigated the role of anionic lipid molecules, specifically phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), in regulating the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell growth and division. However, the dynamics of PI(4,5)P2 in relation to EGFR activity in living cells have not been fully understood due to the difficulty of visualizing the local lipid domains around EGFR.

To address this challenge, researchers used super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to visualize both EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. The results showed that EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), a protein that activates EGFR. After EGF stimulation, the degree of coaggregation between EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 decreased, and this decrease depended on phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), an enzyme that hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2.

The researchers found that reducing the content of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane decreased both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after EGF stimulation. Additionally, inhibiting PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased the phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654, a key step in EGFR activation. These findings suggest that EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI(4,5)P2 around EGFR molecules are mutually regulated.

The study also showed that the local PI(4,5)P2 around EGFR stabilizes EGFR dimers to increase EGFR autophosphorylation upon stimulation with EGF. The subsequent hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by PLCγ plays a crucial role in the deactivation of EGFR. The results suggest that autogenous remodeling of the lipid environments regulates EGFR activity. The researchers propose that the preferential coaggregation of EGFR nanodomains with PI(4,5)P2 rather than phosphatidylserine (PS) is due to the curvature of the membrane, which affects the interactions between RAS proteins and lipids.
summary
     Stramenopiles are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that include multicellular algae, plant and fish pathogens, and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis. In most eukaryotes, glycolysis is a strictly cytosolic metabolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruvate, producing NADH and ATP. In contrast, stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis, where the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Researchers have identified a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocystis that can transport glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis.

Comparative analyses with the phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier and dicarboxylate carrier show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, including complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules.

The glycolytic intermediate carrier identified in Blastocystis represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance. Blastocystis lacks the cytosolic pay-off phase of glycolysis, consistent with the absence of a gene encoding a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier. The only exception is the last enzyme of the pathway, pyruvate kinase, which was also identified as a cytosolic protein. Blastocystis is an anaerobe with highly divergent mitochondria, and the glycolytic intermediate carrier provides a previously undiscovered transport link between cytosolic and mitochondrial glycolysis.
A new framework for human genetic association studies has been proposed, which uses a deep learning model to calculate a functional genomic activity score for each haplotype in an individual. This score, called the Haplotype Function Score (HFS), replaces the original genotype in association studies. The HFS framework was applied to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank and identified 3619 independent HFS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, which is a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis.

The HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait associations and 153 tissue-trait associations with strong biological interpretability. For example, associations were found between the circadian pathway and chronotype, and between the arachidonic acid pathway and intelligence. Additionally, the HFS prediction score was integrated with SNP-based polygenic risk scores using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, which showed an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction.

The HFS framework offers a unique improvement in the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods. This is because the HFS takes into account the functional genomic activity of each haplotype, rather than just the presence or absence of a single nucleotide polymorphism. The results demonstrate the value of the HFS framework in genetic association studies and suggest that it is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits.

The HFS framework was compared to other functionally aware fine-mapping methods, such as PolyFun and SbayesRC, and was found to detect more causal signals for each trait. The HFS framework was applied to 14 polygenic traits in the UK Biobank and identified a large number of significant HFS-trait associations. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the HFS framework to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits and to improve polygenic prediction.
The study investigated the impact of three different types of mental training modules on the hippocampus, a brain region involved in stress regulation, structure, function, and behavior. The training modules focused on either attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective (compassion and care), or socio-cognitive skills. A total of 332 healthy adults participated in the study, which lasted for three months. The researchers used structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity. They also measured diurnal and chronic cortisol levels to evaluate the effects of mental training on stress regulation.

The results showed that the socio-affective training module, which cultivated compassion and care, was associated with an increase in hippocampal CA1-3 subfield volume, as well as alterations in functional connectivity and a reduction in total diurnal cortisol output. In contrast, the attention-based and socio-cognitive training modules did not produce significant changes in hippocampal subfield volume or cortisol levels. The observed increases in CA1-3 volumes following socio-affective mental training were small-sized effects, but were consistent when independently assessing the left and right hippocampus subfields.

The study found a link between the socio-emotional behavioral intervention and changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, as well as reductions in cortisol levels in healthy adults. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. This suggests that the effects of mental training on stress regulation may be more complex and multifaceted than previously thought.

The study provides new insights into the relationship between mental training, hippocampal structure and function, and stress regulation. The findings have implications for the development of interventions aimed at reducing stress and promoting mental well-being. Future studies may directly test the potential specificity of the interrelationship between stress on the hippocampus using further targeted measurements.
summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how species adapt to their environments. A key factor in this process is the presence of genetic variations, or alleles, that provide a fitness advantage in specific locations. These alleles are often found in regions of the genome where recombination, the shuffling of genetic material, is suppressed. One way this suppression occurs is through the presence of inversions, where a segment of the chromosome is flipped end to end. Inversions are commonly associated with adaptive traits, but it is unclear how much of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions versus other genetic factors.

     To investigate this question, researchers conducted genome-wide association studies on three species of sunflowers: Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris. These species have large regions of suppressed recombination, most of which are inversions, and are often associated with adaptive traits. The researchers found evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This suggests that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion.

     The study also estimated the number of regions genome-wide that could potentially contribute to local adaptation for each variable and phenotype, which is related to the genotypic redundancy. The results show that local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve both strong repeatability at a small number of genes, often associated with inversions, coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a much larger number of loci. This suggests that some fraction of the genome contributes to adaptation with low redundancy and high repeatability, while the remainder of the adaptive response is driven by loci with high redundancy and species-specific contributions.

     The observed repeatability associated with inversions further supports the local adaptation model as an explanation for the long-term persistence of segregating inversions, rather than mechanisms based on dominance or meiotic drive. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic basis of local adaptation in sunflowers and highlights the complex interplay between inversions, genetic variation, and adaptation.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that aging affects cells differently at the single-cell level compared to the organ and tissue levels, where aging phenotypes tend to exhibit stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium, a bilayer of luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, undergoes substantial stereotypical changes with age, particularly in luminal epithelial cells, which are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. A study analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from women under 30 and over 55 years old and found age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, as well as increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity.

     The study observed that age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, while directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. The expression of gap junction protein GJB6 in epithelial cells increased with age, and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells.

     The study also found that age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. The researchers speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.

     The study demonstrates how directional and variant responses that contribute to aging biology are integrated in breast tissue of older women, and how these changes could lead to increased susceptibility to cancer initiation. The findings suggest that increased variances in the transcriptomic profiles of mammary epithelial lineages across individuals is a significant outcome of the aging process and is likely central to our understanding of the increased susceptibility to breast cancers with age. The study proposes that increased molecular noise during aging may lead to significant variances in the transcriptomes between aged individuals, which could underlie differences in susceptibility to development of breast cancers, particularly luminal breast cancer subtypes.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand the genetic basis of natural variation in plant resistance to pests and diseases. However, studying this phenomenon typically requires extensive and labor-intensive experiments. Researchers explored an alternative approach using non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing data to serve as phenotyping proxies. They analyzed whole-genome and epigenome sequencing data from 207 natural lines of field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) that were grown in a common environment and colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. The results showed that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to pest species differed between populations, had significant heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, which are less favorable to aphids, had higher aphid DNA loads, indicating decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes and novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA loads. The study also found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, including differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. This research provides insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense, a model species and rising crop, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads can be used to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions. The approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research, particularly with the increasing availability of large sequencing datasets worldwide.

     Biomedical researchers have been working to develop new strategies to combat malaria, a disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite. One approach is to use drug combinations that take advantage of collateral sensitivity, where resistance to one drug makes the parasite more susceptible to another. In this study, scientists explored collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme. They tested a compound called TCMDC-125334, which was effective against multiple mutant lines of the parasite, including one that had developed resistance to a clinical candidate drug called DSM265.

     The researchers found that the most common mechanism of resistance to TCMDC-125334 was an increase in the number of copies of the dhodh gene. However, they also identified a mutation, DHODH I263S, that made the parasite resistant to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. When they selected for parasites that were resistant to TCMDC-125334, they found additional genetic changes in the dhodh gene, including the DHODH C276Y mutation. These double mutant parasites were highly resistant to DSM265.

     To test whether collateral sensitivity could be used to prevent the emergence of resistance, the researchers exposed wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation that were cross-resistant to both compounds and as fit as the wildtype parent in the lab. The emergence of these cross-resistant parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme.

     The study suggests that combining two DHODH inhibitors, DSM265 and TCMDC-125334, based on their collateral sensitivity profiles does not prevent the emergence of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in the lab. The researchers identified a point mutation, DHODH I263S, that made the parasite resistant to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. They also found that sequentially selected parasites with additional mutations in dhodh were highly resistant to DSM265 but not cross-resistant to TCMDC-125334. This suggests that these parasites would still be sensitive to a therapeutic dose of TCMDC-125334.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the relationship between malaria transmission intensity and the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. However, existing models have failed to provide a clear consensus on this relationship, possibly due to neglecting the complex interactions between antigenic diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. To address this knowledge gap, a novel compartmental model was developed to track sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity.

The model revealed a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. This trend was supported by validation using chloroquine-resistant marker data. Furthermore, the study found that post-discontinuation of drugs, resistance remained high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while it steadily decreased in high-diversity, high-transmission regions. These findings underscore the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution.

Strain diversity of Plasmodium falciparum parasites varies significantly among biogeographic zones, driving key differences in epidemiological features. The model's inclusion of strain diversity and associated host immunity provides a new mechanistic explanation for the persistence of resistance to certain antimalarial drugs in Southeast Asia, despite lower transmission intensity than Africa. In regions with low strain diversity, parasites are unable to repeatedly infect hosts, resulting in clinically immune hosts carrying infections infrequently.

The study's results have significant implications for malaria control protocols, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective worldwide. Instead, control strategies should vary from region to region, taking into account local strain diversity and transmission intensity. The model's predictions are supported by empirical data from studies conducted between 1990 and 2000, which showed a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between malaria transmission intensity and drug resistance, highlighting the importance of considering strain diversity in the development of effective malaria control strategies.
Biomedical researchers investigated the effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the most abundant phytocannabinoid in cannabis, on early embryonic development. They used a stepwise in vitro differentiation system to model the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) at three distinct developmental windows: exposure of ESCs, exposure of epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs), and combined ESCs + EpiLCs exposure.

The study found that Δ9-THC increased the proliferation of naive ESCs, but not of their primed counterparts. This increased proliferation was dependent on the CB1 receptor binding and was associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ9-THC increased the glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities of ESCs, a phenomenon known as metabolic bivalence. This metabolic rewiring was retained throughout differentiation to primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) in the absence of direct exposure and was associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile.

The researchers tested a wide dose range of Δ9-THC, from 0.1 nM to 100µM, which corresponds to physiologically-relevant concentrations found in cannabis users. They found that Δ9-THC exposure had a moderate but significant impact on early embryonic processes. The study highlights the importance of metabolic remodelling induced by Δ9-THC and its potential role as a driver of exposure memory through differentiation stages.

The results of this study provide the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development. The findings suggest that Δ9-THC exposure during early embryonic development may have long-lasting effects on the metabolic and transcriptional profiles of primordial germ cells. This research has important implications for our understanding of the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use during pregnancy.
summary
     Biologists have extensively studied copy number variation in plant resistance genes, but similar research is rare in animals. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) has hundreds of NLR immune genes, making it an ideal species for studying this phenomenon. A recent study sequenced 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations and identified a total of 1513 NLRs, many more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of these NLRs are present in all wild populations, but only 4% are found in 80% or more of individual fish. Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains. In contrast to the massive variability of gene copies, nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is very low, with around half of the copies being monomorphic and the remaining ones having very few polymorphisms, likely a signature of purifying selection. This suggests that the evolution of these genes is far from neutral. The study also found that the expression of fish NLRs is often induced by pathogen exposure, but the exact function of most zebrafish NLR-C genes remains unclear. The researchers demonstrated a substantial reduction in single-nucleotide variation in zebrafish laboratory strains compared to wild populations, which they attribute to a recent population bottleneck that marks the establishment of laboratory strains. The study lays the groundwork for future research investigating the molecular basis and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to the diversity of large, vertebrate gene families.
Scientists have discovered a new type of seed, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov., from the Famennian period of the Late Devonian, around 372-359 million years ago. This seed has three integumentary wings that extend outwards and fold inwards along the abaxial side, enclosing most of the nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule, which is a protective and pollinating structure found in most Famennian ovules.

The discovery of Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. This finding indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms, such as seed plumes and pappus, which appeared later in the Permo-Carboniferous and Mesozoic periods, respectively.

Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds, like Alasemenia, are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions. This suggests that three-winged seeds have an advantage in anemochory, or wind dispersal.

The discovery of Alasemenia is significant because it represents the second acupulate ovule in the Famennian period. Alasemenia, along with Guazia and Warsteinia, suggests that the evolutionarily novel wings, as integument outgrowths and the most important mechanism for seed dispersal by wind, appeared early in the spermatophytes and had been manifested in younger lineages.

Alasemenia was found in the Jianchuan mine of China, where Xinhang fossil forest was discovered to comprise in situ lycopsid trees of Guangdedendron. The ovules of Alasemenia are three-winged and clearly acupulate, implying additional or novel functions of integument. The discovery of Alasemenia indicates the diversity of Famennian winged ovules and the evolutionary sequence of ovule wings.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a new mechanism underlying the progression of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, a type of blood cancer. The study reveals that the protein RAPSYN plays a crucial role in stabilizing the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is a hallmark of Ph+ leukemia. RAPSYN achieves this by mediating the neddylation of BCR-ABL, a process that competes with the protein's ubiquitination-dependent degradation. As a result, the stability of BCR-ABL is enhanced, leading to the promotion of leukemogenesis.

     The researchers found that RAPSYN is highly expressed in patients with Ph+ leukemia and that its inhibition significantly suppresses the survival of leukemia cells. This effect is linked to the NEDD8 E3 ligase activity of RAPSYN, which is responsible for mediating BCR-ABL neddylation. The study also showed that the expression levels of BCR-ABL and RAPSYN are correlated, indicating the specificity of RAPSYN-mediated neddylation of BCR-ABL.

     Furthermore, the researchers demonstrated that the depletion of RAPSYN expression or its ligase activity decreases BCR-ABL stability and inhibits tumor formation and growth. In contrast, the use of PROTAC-based degraders, which target the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL, was found to be ineffective. The study suggests that targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation may provide an alternative therapeutic approach for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the pathogenesis of Ph+ leukemia and highlight the potential of RAPSYN as a novel therapeutic target. The research also sheds light on the broader involvement of RAPSYN in hematology and oncology, suggesting that it may be a target for the treatment of other types of cancer. The study's results demonstrate the importance of RAPSYN in stabilizing BCR-ABL and promoting leukemogenesis, and provide a rationale for the development of RAPSYN-targeted therapies for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have been searching for new alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. One promising approach is the use of phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, which directly degrade bacterial cell walls and have a low risk of resistance development. However, the discovery of these enzymes is often hindered by the limited availability of phage genomes.

     To address this challenge, a new strategy has been developed to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptides as a template. This approach was tested on the proteome of Acinetobacter baumannii, a type of bacteria that causes infections in humans. The researchers used a peptide derived from the lysin PlyF307 as a template to search for putative peptidoglycan hydrolases in the A. baumannii proteome database.

     Five peptidoglycan hydrolases were identified, and two of them, PHAb10 and PHAb11, showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens, even after being heated to 100°C for 1 hour. In contrast, the other three enzymes were sensitive to heat. The crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 were solved, revealing that PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme, while PHAb8 formed a monomer.

     Two mouse models of bacterial infection were used to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. The results showed that PHAb10 was effective in treating bacterial infections without causing harm to the host. This study provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs and highlights the potential of lysin-derived antimicrobial peptides as a template for mining new peptidoglycan hydrolases with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties.

Biomedical researchers investigated the development of sleep patterns in children, adolescents, and young adults. They focused on the synchronization of fast sleep spindles (12.5-16 Hz) with slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep. This synchronization is a key feature of adult sleep, but little was known about how it develops in younger individuals.

The study analyzed sleep patterns in four age groups: 5-6, 8-11, 14-18 years, and 20-26 years. The researchers used individualized detection of single events to characterize age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling. They found that the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in younger children, but the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident in all age groups, albeit less precise in children.

The study also linked personalized measures of fast spindle maturity, which indicate the similarity between development-specific and adult-like fast spindles, and slow oscillation maturity, which reflects the extent to which slow oscillations show frontal dominance, with individual slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. The results showed that fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups.

The researchers found that the maturation of dominant, development-specific fast sleep spindles towards adult-like fast spindles may explain age-related differences in the strength and temporal precision of slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. Despite a higher frequency of adult-like fast sleep spindles in younger age groups, the differences in amplitude and density between development-specific and adult-like fast centro-parietal sleep spindles decreased with age. Fast centro-parietal spindles became more numerous and adult-like in their frequency and amplitude characteristics in the course of maturation.

The study suggests that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles enables precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood. The findings provide new insights into the development of sleep patterns and may have implications for understanding sleep disorders and cognitive development.
Biomedical research articles often feature genes that have been studied extensively prior to the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, despite the availability of high-throughput technologies that can identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. A recent analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. This bias is not due to a lack of underlying biological evidence, as understudied genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but are not investigated further by the authors. In fact, publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations.

The study identified 33 out of 45 biological and experimental factors that are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. These factors include evolutionary, chemical, and biological characteristics of the genes. The abandonment of understudied genes could be driven by the concern of biomedical researchers that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact.

To promote the investigation of understudied genes, the researchers developed a tool called Find My Understudied Genes (FMUG). FMUG allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits and identify genes that remain understudied in specific areas, such as vertebrate aging. The tool is available for download as a MacOS/Windows app.

The study's findings suggest that understudied genes are abandoned between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results, rather than being abandoned by later research. This bias is not due to a lack of underlying biological evidence, as understudied genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but are not investigated further by the authors. The researchers propose that the abandonment of understudied genes may be driven by the concern of biomedical researchers that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact. The development of FMUG aims to address this bias and promote the investigation of understudied genes.
Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides have been suggested as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages. However, the potential negative effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function are not well understood. A recent study used a zebrafish model to investigate the effects of glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development. The researchers found that both glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides induced excessive formation of blood vessels, particularly intersegmental vessels, in the zebrafish embryos. This excessive angiogenesis was caused by the activation of quiescent endothelial cells into tip cells.

     Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis revealed that the endothelial cells in the embryos exposed to high glucose had an increased ratio of capillary endothelial cells and proliferating endothelial cells, as well as upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis showed that the foxo1a gene mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides by upregulating the expression of marcksl1a. The study also found that reducing foxo1a activity mitigated the excessive angiogenesis caused by monosaccharides.

     The researchers used a zebrafish model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis similar to the phenotypes observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) induced by glucose treatment. They found that both glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides activated quiescent endothelial cells into proliferating tip cells, leading to excessive angiogenesis. The effects of monosaccharides on inducing excessive angiogenesis were found to be mediated by the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway.

     The study provides new evidence of the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms. The findings suggest that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides can lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent endothelial cells into tip cells through the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway. The study's results have implications for our understanding of the roles of noncaloric monosaccharides in human health.
Biomedical researchers investigated how the brain processes and stores multiple sequences of information in working memory (WM). In a study, participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and were later asked to reproduce the full color and location sequences. The researchers manipulated the consistency between the location and color sequence trajectories, finding that sequences with consistent trajectories showed improved memory performance and a correlation between the reproduced color and location sequences.

     The study used EEG recordings to provide neural evidence for a "compressive" strategy, where the brain reactivates shared trajectories during encoding and retention, and spontaneously replays color sequences during location recall. The findings suggest that the brain leverages shared common structures to store multiple sequences in WM through compressed encoding and neural replay, facilitating efficient information organization.

     The researchers observed that when participants prepared to recall location sequences, the currently task-irrelevant color sequence demonstrated a spontaneous sequential replay profile, highlighting the close bond between color and location sequences when they share a common trajectory. This suggests that replay-based neural mechanisms in WM mediate sequence combinations based on common structures.

     The study provides converging behavioral and neural evidence for spontaneously leveraging common structures to facilitate WM. Sequences with consistent color-location trajectories showed enhanced memory precision and a significant correlation between reproduced color and location sequence trajectories. The findings are consistent with previous research on neural replay, which has been posited to represent abstract structure, structure-based inference, and generalization.

     Notably, the study found that when participants prepared to recall location sequences, neural replay occurred for color sequences but not for location sequences. This supports the spontaneous nature of neural replay, as color features are not task-relevant at that moment. The study's results suggest that the brain uses a shared common structure to store multiple sequences in WM, enabling efficient information organization and retrieval. The findings have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes and stores complex information in WM.
summary
     Biomedical research has identified mutations in the human PURA gene as the primary cause of PURA syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder. Unlike other monogenetic disorders, almost all reported mutations in the PURA gene result in the full expression of the disease. A recent study aimed to understand how these genetic variations affect the structure and function of the PURA protein.

     The study found that patient mutations across the PURA gene impair its ability to co-localize with processing bodies. These mutations either disrupt the protein's folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization. The researchers solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.

     The results showed that the PURA protein has unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity, making it particularly susceptible to mutations that impair its structural integrity. This finding provides an explanation for why even conservative mutations across the PURA gene result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome.

     The study also found that the structural flexibility and folding promiscuity of PURA domains were supported by the crystal structure of a K97E variant, whose mutated residue has a solvent-exposed side chain. Molecular dynamics simulations further indicated high intrinsic motions of the N-terminal PUR domain. In contrast to other genetic disorders, such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence.

     The researchers assessed the structure and function of human PURA and the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein's integrity. The study provides the first functional and experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding, as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. Some of the selected patient variants of hsPURA were previously predicted to have folding defects. The study's findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PURA syndrome and may help explain why there is an underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with the disorder.
Biomedical research has identified a potential interaction between two proteins, TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 (ANO1), that plays a crucial role in the water efflux of exocrine glands, including sweat glands. This interaction may be involved in the process of perspiration. In a study using mouse foot pads, researchers found that TRPV4 colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in secretory cells of sweat glands. The presence of TRPV4 in these cells led to an increase in cytosolic calcium levels, which was inhibited by menthol, a known activator of a related protein, TRPM8.

The study also found that acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in mouse foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type mice, but not in mice lacking TRPV4. Furthermore, menthol inhibited sweating in both wild-type and mice lacking TRPM8, suggesting that TRPV4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration. The researchers also found that basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor, indicating that ANO1 is also involved in this process.

The study suggests that TRPV4 and ANO1 form a complex that promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. This complex may be important for maintaining friction forces in mouse foot pads, as wild-type mice were able to climb up a slippery slope more easily than mice lacking TRPV4. The researchers also found that TRPV4 expression was higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA.

Overall, the study suggests that TRPV4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1, and that targeting TRPV4 or the TRPV4/ANO1 complex may lead to the development of agents that regulate perspiration. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of perspiration and may have implications for the treatment of conditions such as anhidrosis.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the diverse shapes and sizes of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for processing sensory information and controlling movement. Despite this diversity, a new study reveals a universal pattern underlying the structure of primate and mammalian cortices. Researchers have found that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes, which gradually merge to form a common scale-free morphometric trajectory. This trajectory is shared across 11 primate species and overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species.

The study proposes a new way to express cortical morphology as a function of scale, providing a more detailed and informative description than traditional summary morphometric measures. This approach reveals a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and a common set of mechanisms governing cortical folding. The researchers also demonstrate that their novel method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate subtle morphological changes more effectively than traditional methods, with a fourfold increase in effect size.

The study's findings indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape, with a fractal dimension of 2.5. This understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding, the researchers show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology, with a more than fourfold increase in effect size at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses.

The study's results have significant implications for the development of biomarkers for a range of conditions. The researchers propose that their new syntax for characterizing brain morphology and morphological changes could generate superior biomarkers in the future. The study's findings also suggest that some biological processes may only act on specific spatial scales, leaving other scales untouched. This knowledge could lead to a better understanding of the complex relationships between brain structure and function.
Biomedical researchers have investigated the role of the RELA transcription factor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumours. RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses, and its upregulation has been observed in PDAC tumours. Using live single-cell imaging, the study characterised RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines and found that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA.

The researchers used Bayesian analysis to predict that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα.

The study also characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. The researchers used RNA-seq to identify genes with distinct patterns of expression based on dependence on TNFα dose and RELA activation. Live imaging with knockdown of selected targets uncovered novel mechanisms regulating inflammation-associated RELA dynamics in PDAC, including negative feedback loops between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31, and between RELA and the non-canonical NF-κB protein RELB.

The study found that the known actin modulators ARHGAP31/NUAK2 are both RELA targets and regulators of nuclear RELA with TNFα. RELA appears to form NF-κB heterodimers with REL, NFKB1, and NFKB2 in PDAC cells. The researchers evaluated the effect of siRNA knockdown of TNFα-regulated genes on TNFα-stimulated RELA dynamics and found that IκBβ plays a significant role in suppressing TNFα induction of nuclear RELA in PDAC cells. Nuclear RELA AUC in control conditions was affected by all of the tested NF-κB pathway components in PANC1 cells, indicating that RELA is highly modulated by NF-κB/IκB proteins in the absence of stress or inflammatory cues. The study provides computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.
Biomedical research has shown that a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is crucial for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which regulates this equilibrium, are a common feature in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN), the primary negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with ASDs. However, it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling.

    Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, researchers investigated the impact of daf-18/PTEN mutations on inhibitory and excitatory signaling. They found that daf-18/PTEN mutations selectively impact GABAergic (inhibitory) neurodevelopment and function, resulting in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. This selective impact is due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO, a transcription factor, during development.

    The study also explored the potential therapeutic effects of ketogenic diets (KGDs), which have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. Researchers found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, thereby improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. This suggests that β-hydroxybutyrate may act early in development to mitigate neurological GABAergic defects in daf-18/PTEN mutants.

    The findings demonstrate that mutations in daf-18, the C. elegans ortholog of PTEN, lead to defects in inhibitory GABAergic neurodevelopment without significantly affecting cholinergic excitatory signals. The study suggests that decreased activity of DAF-18/PTEN affects GABAergic development due to a downregulation of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor activity. The results also indicate that mutations in daf-18/PTEN and daf-16/FOXO result in developmental defects in GABAergic neurons, leading to altered morphology and function while leaving cholinergic motor neurons unaffected.

    The study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs. The conservation of the main components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans enhances the applicability of this model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment.
Summary of Biomedical Research Article: Innate Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection

     Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, triggers innate immune responses that play a crucial role in the development of the disease. Host factors, including proinflammatory cytokines, are essential for containing the virus. Researchers have discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes can inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in infected cells. Through cytokine screening, the study identified interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a key mediator of inflammation, as a potent inhibitor of syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains.

     The study found that IL-1β activates the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, leading to the enrichment of actin bundles at cell-cell junctions and preventing syncytia formation. In vivo experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium. The study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection.

     The research demonstrated that IL-1β inhibits SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation by activating the RhoA/ROCK pathway to initiate actin bundle formation at the cell-cell interface between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells. Importantly, IL-1β significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission among lung epithelia in experimental mice in vivo. Fluorescence staining showed that SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells fused with neighboring cells, promoting viral transmission in the airway epithelial cells, while IL-1β induced the formation of actin bundles to restrict syncytia formation and further viral transmission.

     Mechanistically, IL-1β activates and enriches RhoA to the cell-cell junction between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells via the IL-1R-mediated signal to initiate actin bundle formation, preventing cell-cell fusion and viral spreading. These findings reveal a critical function for proinflammatory cytokines in controlling viral infection. The study provides potential therapeutic targets for viral control and highlights the importance of innate immune responses in containing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Biomedical researchers have investigated the role of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in Drosophila, which are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells. Using electrophysiological recordings, they found that IPC activity is strongly modulated by the nutritional state of the flies. During starvation, IPC activity decreased, while refeeding with glucose or fructose significantly increased it. In contrast, non-nutritive sugars had no effect, and glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity. This is similar to the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application.

The researchers also discovered that diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (DH44PINs) respond to glucose perfusion, but do not affect IPC activity. However, other DH44Ns inhibit IPCs. This suggests that populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, while activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity.

These findings demonstrate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state. The study highlights the complexity of insulin regulation, emphasizing that insulin secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors. The researchers used an in vivo electrophysiological approach to analyze the nutritional state-dependent modulation of IPCs in Drosophila, revealing that IPC activity is diminished during starvation and rebounds after glucose feeding. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating an accumulation of DILPs.

The study suggests that insulin release is modulated by enteroendocrine signals, and that Drosophila IPCs sense glucose in the circulating hemolymph to release insulin in response to increases in glucose concentration. However, the researchers found that trehalose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, strengthening the idea that IPCs do not directly sense changes in hemolymph sugar levels. This is similar to mammals, where IPC activity and insulin release are not simply modulated by hemolymph sugar concentration.

The study also implicates that IPCs play a role in modulating foraging behavior, as a subset of octopaminergic neurons expressing Drosophila insulin receptor (dInR) are necessary for the regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of metabolic homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to visualize and study native proteins in live cells, but generating human cell lines with endogenous tags has proven challenging due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair. Recently, an engineered split mNeonGreen protein has been used to create a large-scale endogenous tag library in HEK293 cells. This breakthrough has opened the door to studying protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types. To expand on this work, scientists have engineered an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line to express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein, known as mNG21-10. This innovation enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment, mNG211.

The researchers demonstrated that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes, such as cytokinesis, in iPSCs. Cytokinesis is an essential process that occurs during cell division, and studying it in real-time can provide valuable insights into cellular behavior. This work represents the first step towards creating a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells, which will be used to study protein function in human stem cells and across human cell types in vitro.

The split mNeonGreen system was used for endogenous tagging in human iPSCs, and a human iPS cell line was engineered to constitutively express the mNG21-10 fragment. This cell line, named'smNG2-P', was extensively validated and used as a proof-of-concept to efficiently target multiple genes for endogenous tagging with mNG211. Several tagged iPS cell lines were clonally isolated, providing a foundation for a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells.

The split mNeonGreen system has been shown to have a high complementation efficiency and is irreversible once the reconstituted protein has folded. This system allows for easy and efficient endogenous tagging with mNG211 in cells where mNG21-10 is constitutively expressed. The generation of a genome-wide library of tagged proteins in human cells requires higher throughput, and the self-complementing split fluorescent proteins can be used as tools for large-scale endogenous tagging. This work provides the basis for a high-quality endogenous tag library in human iPSCs, which will be used to study protein function in human stem cells and across human cell types in vitro.
Researchers have developed a new method for creating electrolytic lesions in the brain using chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes. This technique allows for controlled and repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology data. A custom-built current source provides stable current, enabling precise control over the extent and location of the injury. The method was validated through histology, current and voltage traces, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning.

The novel lesioning technique offers several advantages over traditional methods. It avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. This technique can be used in various areas of the cortex, in multiple species, and with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can easily be integrated into an existing electrophysiology recording setup.

The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of this method by testing it with a linear multicontact probe in ex vivo rabbit cortex and showed that it can be used with different electrode types and animals. The technique can be used to create small, permanent inactivation volumes while maintaining reliable neuroelectrophysiological recordings. The selection of electrical current pattern, amplitude, and duration, as well as the specific lesion electrodes' shape and location, offers many different combinations for complementary investigations into the causal role of cortical activity.

This method has the potential to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population's role in neuronal circuit function, while providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss. The technique can be used in various species, including rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus macaques, and can be easily adapted for use in smaller species, such as rats. The approach offers a valuable tool for understanding the complex relationships between brain and behavior.
Biologists investigated whether bumblebees can detect and avoid neonicotinoid pesticides in nectar. These pesticides are commonly used in agriculture and have been linked to declining bee populations. The researchers used a combination of behavioral assays and electrophysiology to test whether bumblebees can taste and avoid neonicotinoids in nectar. They found that bumblebees did not avoid consuming solutions containing neonicotinoids, even at concentrations that are lethal to the bees. The study suggests that bumblebees are unable to detect neonicotinoids in nectar using their mouthparts.

The researchers used a sensitive behavioral assay to test whether bumblebees can detect and avoid neonicotinoids in nectar. They also used electrophysiology to record the activity of gustatory neurons in the bees' mouthparts in response to neonicotinoids. The results showed that even extremely high concentrations of neonicotinoids did not alter the activity of the gustatory neurons. This suggests that bumblebees are unable to detect neonicotinoids in nectar using their mouthparts.

Previous studies have reported contradictory evidence on whether bees can detect and avoid neonicotinoids in nectar. Some studies have suggested that bees can detect neonicotinoids in nectar, while others have found no evidence of detection. The current study provides strong evidence that bumblebees are unable to detect neonicotinoids in nectar using their mouthparts.

The researchers also found that bumblebees have highly specialized mechanisms for encoding sugars, which are different from those reported for any other insect species. However, they failed to find evidence that neonicotinoids in water elicited spikes in any gustatory neurons, including those responsible for detecting nutrients and sugars. This suggests that bumblebees are unable to taste neonicotinoids in nectar or in water.

The study's findings have important implications for the use of neonicotinoids in agriculture. If bees are unable to detect and avoid neonicotinoids in nectar, they may be at high risk of unwittingly consuming these pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops. This could have significant consequences for bee populations and the health of ecosystems that rely on bees for pollination.
Biomedical researchers investigated the dynamics of Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria parasite, in non-human primates (NHPs) across Southeast Asia. The study aimed to quantify the parasite's prevalence in NHPs at a macroecological scale and identify geographic determinants of infection in reservoir species. A meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites revealed that P. knowlesi prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. The researchers found that regions with higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots, suggesting a link between parasite transmission in wildlife and humans.

The study used remote sensing data and statistical models to identify relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation. The results indicate that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity, which could explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden. This finding addresses critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and suggests that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk.

The researchers assembled a georeferenced dataset of P. knowlesi in NHPs and evaluated variation in NHP P. knowlesi prevalence by geographic region. They also assessed environmental and spatial risk factors for P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs across Southeast Asia. The study's findings support the hypothesis that prevalence of P. knowlesi in primate host species is spatially heterogeneous and that higher prevalence is partially driven by forest loss and fragmentation.

Previous studies have shown associations between landscape and variation in the prevalence of simian Plasmodium spp. in primates, but this study is the first to systematically assess P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs at a regional scale and across a wide range of habitats. The results highlight the marked spatial heterogeneity and role of landscape complexity in driving P. knowlesi infection rates in NHPs. The study emphasizes the importance of considering infection dynamics within wildlife reservoirs in future public health interventions, given the clear intersection between human epidemiology and wildlife ecology.
summary
     The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic era marked significant transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To understand how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and paleogeographical events, researchers reconstructed a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. The analysis indicates that the crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida (conifer) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead or decaying branches.

Belidae tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana's breakup, surviving on distant and disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to angiosperms and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. The two extant subfamilies, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated in the Australian and Neotropical regions, respectively.

The most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae were reconstructed as Pinopsida or angiosperms. In the Belinae subfamily, Pinopsida were the most likely ancestral host plants. Belidae are indicated to have originated during the Jurassic in association with gymnosperms and subsequently colonized angiosperms as the latter diversified and rose to ecological dominance during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene.

The two subfamilies, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated and diverged during the separation of East and West Gondwana. Both subfamilies have lineages that still develop on their ancestral host plant. In the East Gondwana clade, Belinae, the divergence time between Agnesiotis and Dicordylus was estimated at 44.7 million years ago, during the Paleocene-Eocene separation of South America and Australia.

Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia (Australian region) and Proterhinus (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins. The Gondwanan origin of Belidae was recovered at approximately 138 million years ago, when South America and Australia were connected via Antarctica. However, angiosperm families known to be belid hosts did not diversify until the Cretaceous. During the early evolutionary history of Belidae, conifer lineages were dominant, consistent with Pinopsida being the most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the evolution of tumors, particularly how they grow and change over time. A key challenge has been tracking the past evolution of tumors from current samples. To address this, scientists have analyzed genomic data from bulk samples and multiple regions within tumors. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal dynamics of tumor evolution.

     A recent study used high-resolution genetic data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, a type of liver cancer, to shed light on the early evolution of tumors in the body. The researchers analyzed data from hundreds of samples taken from two and three dimensions within the tumors. By applying spatial metrics of evolution, they found that tumor cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumor volume, rather than at the surface.

     The study also investigated how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumor and how cell death contributes to overall tumor growth. The researchers developed metrics of intra-tumor heterogeneity, which leveraged the information from the spatial position of all samples. This approach allowed them to infer how tumors grew in earlier stages from snapshots of late-stage tumors.

     The findings suggest that tumor growth is not limited to the surface, as previously thought. Instead, cells grow uniformly throughout the tumor volume. The study's methods can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology, providing new insights into the early evolution of tumors in the body. This research has the potential to improve our understanding of cancer development and progression, ultimately informing the development of more effective treatments.

     The study built on previous research that linked spatial tumor sampling with evolution on a larger scale. However, the current study focused on high-resolution data from solid tumors, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the spatio-temporal principles of tumor evolution. By analyzing the spatial distribution of mutations, the researchers were able to infer the dynamics of tumor growth and the interplay between tissue dynamics and genetic evolution.

     The study's findings have implications for our understanding of cancer biology and the development of new treatments. By understanding how tumors grow and change over time, researchers can identify potential targets for intervention and develop more effective therapies. The use of high-resolution data and spatial metrics of evolution has opened up new avenues for research in the field of cancer biology.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the ability of certain organisms to adapt to changing environments through seasonal polyphenism, a phenomenon where an organism's physical characteristics change in response to seasonal cues. Cacopsylla chinensis, a type of insect, exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, transforming from a summer-form to a winter-form with distinct morphological features. Previous research has shown that low temperature and a specific temperature receptor, CcTRPM, play a crucial role in this transformation, affecting the insect's cuticle content and thickness. However, the underlying neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remained unknown.

    A recent study has shed light on the novel function of Bursicon, a hormone responsible for the hardening and darkening of insect cuticles, in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. The researchers identified two subunits of Bursicon, CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β, which are regulated by low temperature and CcTRPM. These subunits form a heterodimer that mediates the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness.

    The study also discovered that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the upstream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Furthermore, the researchers found that miR-6012, a microRNA, directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis.

    The findings of this study reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor. The research suggests that Bursicon genes and their receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development, and that Bursicon may not be necessary for cuticle tanning in all insects. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying seasonal polyphenism and has implications for the development of new strategies to manipulate insect cuticle development.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. A driver mutation in DMGs is the lysine-to-methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M), which reshapes the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway.

Researchers examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in a substantial decrease in cell viability. Transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed a synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulating prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR.

In vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors. The findings emphasize epigenetic dependencies of H3-K27M-driven gliomas and highlight the therapeutic potential of combined treatments for this aggressive malignancy.

Previous studies have underscored the histone acetylation pathway as a potential drug target for this cancer. Pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as Vorinostat and Panobinostat, were found to inhibit growth and restore gene expression alterations observed in H3-K27M malignant gliomas. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of epigenetic pathways affecting post-translational modifications of lysine 27 (methylation and acetylation) and lysine 4 (methylation) on histone H3.

High-level gene amplification of MYC is recurrently observed in pediatric high-grade gliomas. H3-K27M gliomas show high expression of MYC and MYC target genes, due to both epigenetic alterations and structural variants, resulting in a viability dependency on MYC signaling. The PIN1 inhibitor, Sulfopin, was shown to downregulate MYC target genes in vitro and block MYC-driven tumors in murine models of neuroblastoma. To address the increasing need for an effective combination therapy for H3-K27M DMGs, researchers tested whether dual targeting of histone acetylation and MYC activation, using Vorinostat and Sulfopin, would yield beneficial outcomes.
The white-footed deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is a long-lived rodent that serves as a reservoir for several zoonotic diseases, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and viral encephalitis. Despite being persistently infected with these pathogens, the deermouse does not exhibit apparent disability or diminished fitness. To understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, researchers compared the genome-wide transcriptional responses of P. leucopus, Mus musculus (mice), and Rattus norvegicus (rats) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin that elicits inflammation.

The results showed that P. leucopus had a distinct LPS response profile compared to mice and rats, characterized by non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. In contrast to mice and rats, P. leucopus displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics were also observed in a Borrelia hermsii infection model, suggesting that P. leucopus has a unique mechanism for infection tolerance.

Further analysis revealed that P. leucopus and mice had distinct profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the blood, spleen, and liver. The inflammation phenotype of deermice was consistent with an "alternatively activated" or M2-type macrophage polarization phenotype, rather than the expected "classically activated" or M1-type polarization phenotype observed in mice. This was associated with reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors in P. leucopus.

The study also found that P. leucopus had a restrained transcriptional response to LPS, with lower fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes compared to mice. In contrast, P. leucopus had greater fold-changes in genes involved in inflammation, such as Mmp8, Slpi, S100a9, and Il1b. These findings suggest that P. leucopus has a unique transcriptional response to pathogens, which may contribute to its ability to sustain infections without apparent disability or diminished fitness. The results of this study provide insights into the mechanisms underlying infection tolerance in P. leucopus and may have implications for understanding the biology of other animal reservoirs for zoonotic diseases.
summary
     Caspases are a family of proteases that play a crucial role in the activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. In humans, caspase 3 (CASP3) and caspase 7 (CASP7) recognize the same consensus motif, DxxD, present in gasdermin E (GSDME). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7. The underlying mechanism of this observation was unclear.

     Researchers identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. The p10 subunit contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate CASP7, except in mammals.

     In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates, such as mice, but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates. The results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals.

     The study found that a pufferfish GSDME, belonging to the teleost GSDMEa lineage, was specifically cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7 at the site of DAVD to liberate the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment. In teleost, there generally exist two GSDME orthologs, named GSDMEa and GSDMEb. The results suggest mutually independent evolution of GSDME and CASP7 in mice, which likely has distanced GSDME and CASP7 from each other. Similarly, human CASP7 and GSDME may also have undergone independent evolution, leading to the disengagement of GSDME from the substrate relationship with CASP7.

     The study identified a teleost GSDME that can be cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 to trigger pyroptosis. Mutation of the cleavage site inhibited pyroptosis and significantly decreased LDH release and TrGSDME cleavage. These results indicated that TrCASP3/7 cleavage was required to activate TrGSDME-mediated pyroptosis. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates.
Biomedical researchers conducted a single-blind placebo-controlled study to investigate the molecular mechanisms of ketamine, a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression. The study involved 40 healthy participants who received an acute dose of ketamine and underwent resting-state functional connectivity analysis. The results showed that ketamine's effects on the brain and behavior are multi-dimensional, indicating significant inter-individual variability in response to the treatment.

The study found that ketamine's neural effects matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not. Additionally, the researchers discovered that behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine.

The study's results have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry. Ketamine has emerged as a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression over the past two decades, with a response rate of around 65% in patients. However, individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed, and the relationship between ketamine's acute and delayed effects is complex.

Previous studies have shown that ketamine induces a shift from a cortical to a subcortically-centred brain state, particularly in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Additionally, ketamine has been shown to increase global brain connectivity in the prefrontal cortex in healthy controls and normalize reduced PFC GBC in patients with major depressive disorder 24 hours post-ketamine.

The researchers hypothesized that ketamine would result in multiple neural and behavioral axes of variation, reflecting inter-individual variability in response to the treatment. They also investigated the extent to which multi-dimensionality is a property specific to ketamine by comparing it to two other psychoactive substances, psilocybin and LSD, which have shown preliminary clinical efficacy for the treatment of depression but have different pharmacological profiles.
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers during the early evolution of life. However, the autonomous, non-enzymatic, and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem, as product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed, leading to parabolic growth kinetics. This study investigates the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under constant total population size and chemostat conditions.

The researchers found that large population sizes and small differences in replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species, while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification. Sequence properties, such as GC content, and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants. The study suggests that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation.

The researchers used a constant population model to investigate how diversity-maintaining mechanisms operate in the parabolic regime in a finite population of replicators. They demonstrated that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed, enzyme-free replication, proposing a simple biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in hypothetical information storage systems of the RNA world.

In a chemostat model of parabolic replication, the researchers considered monomer building block resources and demonstrated that increased competition, mediated by a decrease in the resource influx rate, can induce a switch from coexistence ensured by parabolic dynamics to survival of the fittest. The diversity-maintaining mechanism of finite parabolic populations can be used as a plug-in model to investigate the coevolution of naked and encapsulated molecular replicators.

The study suggests that replicating individuals in populations displaying parabolic growth kinetics are inherently prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, a feature that can efficiently damp competition and promote coexistence. Parabolic population growth can sustain an unlimited number of competing replicator species in the infinite population size limit. The findings of this study provide insights into the early evolution of functional ribozymes and the preservation of viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis.
summary
     The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5), cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Researchers have found that Nsp5 also cleaves and inactivates human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), a host enzyme required for a common post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. In human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, levels of TRMT1 protein and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications decrease, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The cleavage fragments of TRMT1 exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA. These findings suggest that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with decreased TRMT1 levels and a reduction in m2,2G-modified tRNAs, and that TRMT1 expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. The researchers identified TRMT1 as a novel proteolytic cleavage target of Nsp5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest possible pathological mechanisms associated with perturbations in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications. The study provides evidence that TRMT1 is an endogenous cleavage target of Nsp5, resulting in methyltransferase inactive cleavage products. The cleavage site in TRMT1 matches the consensus sequence of Nsp5 cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The study also found that TRMT1 can be recognized and cleaved by Nsp5 in human cells with cleavage requiring a sequence that matches Nsp5 cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In contrast, the same study found no detectable interaction between TRMT1 and Nsp5 encoded by MERS-CoV, which has 66.8% similarity with SARS-CoV-2. TRMT1 was also identified as a potential interactor with catalytic-inactive Nsp5 using proximity-dependent biotinylation. TRMT1 is a tRNA modification enzyme that catalyzes the formation of dimethylguanosine (m2,2G) at position 26 in more than half of all human tRNAs.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long been puzzled by the existence of microbes that are not inherently pathogenic, yet can cause disease when given the opportunity. One hypothesis is that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. To experimentally test this idea, scientists evolved replicate populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. This selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. When injected into wax moth larvae, these strains were significantly more likely to cause death than non-multicellular strains. The results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, ‘accidental’ pathogens. The study demonstrates that direct selection on one yeast trait can generate a correlated response in other traits, including those associated with virulence. In this case, favoring the ability to adhere to plastic, a common surface in industrial, medical, and domestic settings, led to a suite of aggregative phenotypes and increased virulence. The findings have implications for understanding the evolution of disease-causing microbes and the potential for opportunistic pathogens to emerge in various environments. The study used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, which is commonly used in genetics and cell biology research and is found in various ecological niches around the globe. The results suggest that the evolutionary changes brought about by selection for adherence to a plastic bead led to the incidental evolution of increased virulence. The study provides new insights into the complex relationship between environmental selection and the emergence of disease-causing microbes.
Biomedical researchers have discovered that proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains (PLDs) are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations, which can lead to the formation of abnormal biomolecular condensates. A team of scientists used a computational model called Mpipi to investigate the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins: hnRNPA1, TDP43, FUS, EWSR1, RBM14, and TIA1. The simulations revealed the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations.

The researchers found that these scaling laws are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family of PLDs tested. This suggests that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates. The study demonstrates that there are quantitative rules that explain the changes in thermodynamic parameters of condensates in response to precise amino-acid sequence mutations.

The team employed a systematic approach to vary the amino acid sequence of the PLDs and determine how the phase behavior of PLDs changes with amino acid compositional perturbations. For each type of mutation, they defined and tested three types of scaling laws. The results show that the changes in the critical solution temperatures of PLDs, as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations, can indeed be quantified by scaling laws, which are conserved across the family of PLDs investigated.

The study reveals that interactions involving aromatic residues, such as π–π and cation–π, are dominant in stabilizing condensates formed by PLDs. The researchers have organized the data in a table to facilitate the interpretation of the scaling laws derived in the study. The findings suggest that scaling laws can be used to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates based on amino acid sequence mutations. This work offers a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules. The study provides a new framework to describe the phase behavior of a large set of protein variants via the identification of scaling laws.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to use brain signals to predict an individual's cognitive traits or clinical condition. Traditionally, this has been done by analyzing structural aspects of the brain, such as connectivity or thickness, or by averaging brain activity over time. However, these approaches overlook a crucial aspect of brain function: the unique patterns of brain activity that unfold over time. To address this limitation, a new method has been proposed that uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to describe dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns in the brain.

The HMM-Fisher kernel approach combines the HMM with the Fisher kernel, a mathematical tool that can be used to predict individual traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, preserving the structure of the underlying model. This approach has been shown to be accurate and reliable in predicting traits from brain dynamics models trained on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

The researchers compared the HMM-Fisher kernel approach to other prediction methods, including time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models. The results showed that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach leverages information about an individual's time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction, making it a valuable tool for cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine.

One key advantage of the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is that it preserves the structure of the underlying brain dynamics model, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This is particularly important in studies with small sample sizes or heterogeneous training and test sets, where a researcher may want to fit a model to healthy controls and subsequently test it on patients.

The researchers demonstrated the potential of the HMM-Fisher kernel approach using an example fMRI dataset and simulated data. They focused on models of brain dynamics that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans acquired during wakeful rest. The results showed that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach can accurately and reliably predict individual traits from patterns of brain dynamics.

In summary, the HMM-Fisher kernel approach offers a new and promising method for predicting individual traits from brain signals. By leveraging information about time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity, this approach has the potential to advance our understanding of brain function and improve personalized medicine.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a protein implicated in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Crohn's disease. Recent studies have shown that LRRK2 variants associated with these conditions lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. However, the regulatory mechanisms of LRRK2 activity have remained poorly defined.

     To address this knowledge gap, a targeted siRNA screen was conducted to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity. The screen revealed Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods, researchers demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation.

     The study found that PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. These data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates at the lysosome.

     The researchers hypothesized that enhanced recruitment of LRRK2 to lysosomes may promote Rab phosphorylation by increasing the local concentration of LRRK2 in proximity to its Rab substrates. To test this hypothesis, they examined whether two PD-linked genetic variants associated with increased LRRK2 kinase activity, LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, also had increased levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes.

     The study demonstrated that Rab12, but not Rab29, regulates LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and that Rab12 regulates the localization and activation of LRRK2 on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. The researchers also found that the PD-linked pathogenic LRRK2 variant R1441G and the VPS35 D620N variant increase LRRK2 activity and lead to increased levels of LRRK2 and pT73 Rab10 on lysosomes.

     Overall, the study identifies Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activity and demonstrates that it plays a critical role in mediating LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying LRRK2 activation and suggest a conserved mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is regulated basally and in response to lysosomal damage and genetic variants associated with disease.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the cell cycle at the single-cell level, a crucial aspect of cellular biology and cancer research. However, studying non-adherent cells has proven challenging due to their lack of attachment to surfaces. To address this gap, a new method has been developed that combines a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI (CA)2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enables precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells.

    The method was validated in two acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics. The researchers tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells and found that their cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available. This system provides detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions, making it a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development.

    The cell cycle analysis system relies on the FUCCI (CA)2 technology, which uses fluorescent markers to demarcate cell cycle phases through color-coding. Advanced imaging methods, such as time-lapse microscopy, have shown promise in detailing cell cycle dynamics at the single-cell level. The described work allows researchers to analyze thousands of non-adherent cells per experimental condition, streamlining the cell cycle analysis process and making it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge.

    The image and data analysis workflows rely on two software, Fiji and R, which are widely used by the imaging and data analysis community. The scripts were made publicly available, enabling customization to tailor the workflow according to specific requirements. This not only streamlines the cell cycle analysis of cells expressing the FUCCI (CA)2 indicator but also makes it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge. The complete experimental workflow is explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5, and the original time-lapse images were composed by red and green channels, detecting the mCherry and mVenus markers of the FUCCI (CA)2 indicator.

Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how muscle fibers grow in response to increased mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise. A key aspect of this growth is the radial expansion of muscle fibers, which is characterized by an increase in cross-sectional area. However, it is unclear whether this growth is due to an increase in the size of the myofibrils within the fibers (myofibril hypertrophy) or an increase in the number of myofibrils (myofibrillogenesis).

To address this question, a team of researchers developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils using a standard fluorescence microscope, known as fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution (FIM-ID). This method allows for high-resolution images of myofibrils, which can be used to automate measurements of myofibril size and number. The researchers validated the accuracy of these automated measurements by comparing them to manual measurements obtained using electron microscopy (EM).

Using FIM-ID, the researchers found that the radial growth of muscle fibers in response to increased mechanical loading is largely due to an increase in the number of myofibrils, rather than an increase in the size of individual myofibrils. This was observed in both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading. Specifically, the researchers found that the number of myofibrils per fiber increased significantly in response to resistance exercise, while the size of individual myofibrils remained relatively unchanged.

These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of muscle growth and have important implications for our understanding of skeletal muscle biology. The development of FIM-ID also offers a time- and cost-effective means of studying muscle growth, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field. Overall, this study provides a significant contribution to our understanding of muscle growth and development, and has the potential to inform the development of new treatments for muscle-related disorders.

     Biomedical research has identified three mutations in the SNAP25 gene that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F, D166Y, and I67N. These mutations occur in the synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1)-binding interface of SNAP25, a protein essential for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Experiments in vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons showed that all three mutations impaired Syt1-dependent vesicle docking and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion.

     The V48F and D166Y mutations led to a reduced readily releasable pool (RRP) size due to increased spontaneous release and decreased priming rates. In contrast, the I67N mutation decreased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increased energy barrier for fusion. The RRP size was unaffected in this case.

     The V48F and D166Y mutations increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. This is a gain-of-function feature not seen in Syt1 knockout neurons. In contrast, the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increased energy barrier for fusion.

     The study suggests that pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion. The preserved overall charge of evoked release in V48F and mild reduction in D166Y might point to a compensatory gain-of-function aspect to these mutations. The role of Syt1 and Syt1:SNARE interactions in vesicle priming has been controversially discussed.

     The findings have implications for our understanding of the simultaneous role of the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface in vesicle priming and release clamping. The study demonstrates the challenge faced by finding mechanism-based treatments of these disorders in the presence of multiple effects caused by single-point mutations. The results suggest that part of the role of Syt1:SNARE interaction might be catalytic, lowering the energy level of a transition state along the path to priming. This might happen because transient binding to Syt1 might structure SNAP25 and assist in formation of the SNARE complex, whereas SNAP25 mutants might prestructure the protein, bypassing the need for Syt1.
Summary: 
     A recent study analyzed data from 30 countries and thousands of researchers to investigate the relationship between the proportion of women in a discipline and the quality of research produced in that field. The findings suggest that disciplines with a higher proportion of women tend to have lower research quality evaluations and lower funding success rates, regardless of the gender of the researchers involved. This correlation holds true even when accounting for factors such as age, research institution, and publishing patterns.

     The study used two independent datasets to examine research funding success rates and holistic research quality scores across various disciplines. The results indicate that researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines receive lower evaluations compared to those in male-dominated disciplines. Furthermore, funding success rates also display a similar correlation, with researchers in male-dominated disciplines having higher success rates than those in female-dominated disciplines.

     The study's findings do not imply that research produced in female-dominated disciplines is inherently of lower quality. Rather, it suggests that research from these disciplines is consistently evaluated as lower quality than research from male-dominated disciplines. This disparity has a negative impact on everyone in those disciplines, but disproportionately affects women.

     The study's authors acknowledge that the relationship between the feminization of a discipline and the evaluation of research quality is unclear and would require extensive longitudinal data to explore. However, they propose that the observed correlation may be an outcome of the feminization of a discipline over time. The study's findings contribute to a growing body of research highlighting the undervaluation of women's work, regardless of who performs it.
Summary: 
     Biomedical researchers have developed a new strategy called P3 editing, which enables the control of genome editing in living cells using protein-protein interactions or proximity events. This approach links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA, allowing for the activation of prime editing or base editing in human cells. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, the researchers demonstrated that various known protein-protein interactions and chemically induced dimerization of protein domains can be used to activate genome editing. Additionally, they explored how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. This strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells. The researchers also demonstrated that P3 editing can be coupled to ADAR-based RNA sensors to control genome editing based on RNA expression, expanding the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits. Furthermore, they showed that P3 editing can be used to control genome editing via specific interactions between a pair of tagged protein domains. To improve the efficiency and specificity of P3 editing, the researchers engineered the crRNA-MS2/BoxB-petracrRNA design, which mimics the functional molecules within the native CRISPR-Cas9 system. Overall, the P3 editing strategy provides a powerful tool for controlling genome editing in living cells, enabling the design of synthetic molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs.
Biomedical researchers have identified a potential therapeutic target for long QT syndrome (LQTS), a condition that increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. LQTS is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex, which mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs) during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. The KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex is crucial for maintaining a normal QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG).

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to activate KCNQ1 channels and increase IKs currents. PUFAs bind to two different sites on the KCNQ1 channel, shifting the voltage dependence to more negative voltages and increasing the maximal conductance of the channels. However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the maximal conductance of IKs channels was not well understood.

Recent studies suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 channels is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability of the channels. PUFAs increase the maximal conductance of IKs channels by stabilizing the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state. This finding provides new insights into the mechanism of action of PUFAs on KCNQ1 channels.

The KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex is a voltage-gated K+ channel expressed in the heart, and its dysfunction is associated with LQTS. Loss-of-function mutations of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex reduce the channel current, leading to a prolonged QT interval on the ECG. Restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex.

PUFAs have been shown to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week. PUFAs increase IKs currents by a dual mechanism of action, described as a "lipoelectric mechanism." This mechanism involves shifting the voltage dependence of activation and increasing the maximal conductance of the channels. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of PUFAs on KCNQ1 channels and their potential therapeutic applications for LQTS.
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in various human brain disorders, but the molecular mechanisms behind this association are not well understood. A key enzyme, pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), regulates the levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6. Researchers sought to explore PDXP as a potential therapeutic target for vitamin B6-associated pathologies. To do this, they needed a pharmacological inhibitor of PDXP, but none existed.

    The study found that PDXP and PLP levels decline with age in the murine hippocampus, providing a rationale for developing PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, the researchers identified 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds to PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency, reversibly inhibiting the enzyme.

    In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increased PLP levels in a PDXP-dependent manner, validating PDXP as a druggable target. Notably, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action has been debated. The discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers new insights into the controversy surrounding its effects in the brain.

    Vitamin B6 deficiency has been associated with human brain disorders for decades, but the causal links remain unclear. Pharmacological strategies to elevate intracellular PLP levels are lacking, aside from vitamin B6 administration. The study identifies 7,8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor that increases PLP levels in hippocampal neurons, validating PDXP as a target to control intracellular PLP levels in the brain.

    The researchers observed that PDXP expression is upregulated in the hippocampi of middle-aged mice, suggesting that vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not be sufficient to elevate intracellular PLP levels when the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive. The discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how the development of organs, such as the gonad in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, is coordinated. The gonad's mirror-symmetric structure is guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which arise from the asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs) Z1 and Z4. Research has shown that the polarity of Z1 and Z4 is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins: CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20. These Wnt proteins have distinct functions, with CWN-2 promoting normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, CWN-1 promoting reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively, and EGL-20 inhibiting the polarization of both Z1 and Z4.

In the absence of LIN-17, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while in the absence of CWN-2, CWN-1 promotes reverse polarity in Z1 and normal polarity in Z4. This suggests that the distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 are crucial for their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis. Furthermore, the study found that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 (RNAi) animals, which produce ectopic DTCs.

The results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ. The study also found that the ectopic positions of DTCs in the center of the gonad cause mis-migration. The distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 appear to be a key factor in their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis. This research provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of mirror-symmetric organs and the importance of Wnt signaling in this process.
Biomedical researchers have been exploring the concept of multidrug therapies that exploit tradeoffs to combat resistance. Tradeoffs occur when resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. However, the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable remains unclear. Specifically, it is uncertain whether mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs. To address this question, scientists conducted evolution experiments using yeast cells and the antifungal drug fluconazole. The goal was to capture a broader spectrum of mutations that provide a fitness advantage in the presence of the drug.

     The researchers used a technique called lineage-tracking to monitor the evolution of yeast cells over time. They then quantified the fitness tradeoffs for each of the 774 evolved mutants across 12 different environments. The results showed that the mutants group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs. This suggests that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms.

     The study found that some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do. Additionally, mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings highlight the complexity of relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. However, the study also demonstrates the potential of grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs to empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance.

     By reducing the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from over 774 to a manageable panel of six types, the researchers were able to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which mutations impact fitness. The study's findings suggest that multidrug regimens that exploit tradeoffs may not be as straightforward as previously thought. The key requirement for implementing this approach is having a large collection of barcoded mutants and the ability to re-measure their fitness in multiple environments.

     The study's primary goal was to count the number of different types of adaptive mutations, each defined by its unique tradeoffs, that exist in a population of drug-resistant yeast. The results show that there are at least six distinct groups with characteristic fitness tradeoffs across the 12 environments surveyed. This study demonstrates the utility of a high-throughput evolutionary approach to enumerate classes of drug-resistant mutants and their associated tradeoffs. The findings have implications for the development of multidrug therapies that exploit tradeoffs to combat resistance.
Biomedical researchers have long observed a phenomenon known as central tendency bias, or contraction bias, where the brain's judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations. This bias is thought to be an optimal strategy for the brain to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. However, another type of bias, recency bias, has also been observed, where the brain's judgment is influenced by the most recent sensory stimuli.

Recent studies have suggested that both biases may be more closely related than previously thought. A study using an auditory delayed comparison task in rats found that when the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. This suggests that the PPC plays a key role in modulating contraction bias.

The researchers propose a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating contraction bias. According to this model, a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience produces short-term sensory history biases, which naturally lead to contraction bias. The errors that occur at the level of individual trials are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory toward the sensory distribution's mean.

The researchers' model is consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provides predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. To validate their model, the researchers performed a set of human psychophysics experiments using an auditory parametric working memory task. The results of these experiments support the researchers' model and suggest that contraction bias is a statistical effect of errors in working memory, occurring due to the persisting memory of stimuli shown in the preceding trials.

The integration of this persisting memory in the working memory module competes with that of the stimulus in the current trial, giving rise to short-term history effects. The researchers' findings have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes sensory information and how working memory influences perception. The study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying contraction bias and suggests that the PPC plays a key role in modulating this bias.

     Biomedical researchers have identified a potential new target for improving lung cancer therapy: the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2). PDLIM2 acts as a tumor suppressor that is often repressed in lung cancer, contributing to cancer development and resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. To investigate the therapeutic potential of PDLIM2, the researchers used human clinical samples and a mouse model of lung cancer to study PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes.

     The study found that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. To restore PDLIM2 expression, the researchers used a nano-delivery system to administer PDLIM2-expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2) to mice with lung cancer. The results showed that nanoPDLIM2 had low toxicity, high tumor specificity, and antitumor activity, and significantly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs.

     The combination of nanoPDLIM2 with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs led to complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, making the tumors sensitive to immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

     The study established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other "cold" cancers. The researchers believe that this therapy could be applicable to other cancers, as PDLIM2 repression has been linked to numerous human cancers beyond lung cancer. The findings provide a firm basis for combining immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how animals assess the quality of their food and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. A recent study has made significant progress in this area by establishing a low-quality food evaluation assay system and identifying the underlying mechanisms that regulate this process. The study found that heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli), a low-sugar food, triggers a cellular response known as the unfolded protein response (UPRER) and immune response, which encourages animals to avoid low-quality food.

     The researchers discovered that the physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER-innate immunity axis, particularly its neuronal function, which regulates feeding behaviors. This system assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals. The study also found that animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPRER-innate immunity regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis.

     The study used a low-quality food evaluation assay system established by Qi et al. (2017) to elucidate the mechanism by which the cellular stress response pathway operates as a physiological food evaluation system. The researchers identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals recognize food quality through the UPRER-innate immunity regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors. This slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by the quick sensory nervous system.

     The study also investigated which nutrients/metabolites are sensed by animals through the XBP-1-PMK-1 axis for food quality evaluation. The results suggest that animals may assess the quality of food through the UPRER and innate immune pathway. The activation of the UPRER by HK-E. coli was found to be dependent on the known signaling components of the UPRER branches, including IRE/XBP-1, PERK/ATF-4, and ATF-6. The study provides new insights into the role of the cellular stress response pathway as a physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments.
Biomedical researchers have long recognized the importance of carbohydrates in various biological processes, but the mechanisms by which they interact with key drug targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, scientists investigated the activation of P2Y purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a receptor involved in inflammation and immune responses, by sugar nucleotides.

Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and functional studies, the researchers identified a specific binding site on P2Y14 for uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugars, including UDP-glucose. They found that UDP-glucose activates the receptor by bridging two transmembrane helices, TM2 and TM7. Furthermore, a conserved salt bridging chain, KDKE, was identified between TM2 and TM7, which distinguishes different UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.

The researchers also discovered that the KDKE chain is a conserved functional motif for sugar binding in both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2Y12). Building on this finding, they designed and validated three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12. These results not only expand our understanding of the activation of purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the development of carbohydrate-based drugs targeting GPCRs.

P2Y14 is a member of the P2Y purinoceptor subfamily, which responds to nucleotides, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and UDP. Unlike other purinoceptors, P2Y14 is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, known as UDP-sugars. The researchers' findings suggest that the different arrangements of UDP-sugar-binding sites between P2Y14 and other sugar transferases may be responsible for their sugar selectivity.

The study's results have significant implications for the development of carbohydrate-based drugs targeting GPCRs. The researchers' molecular models of different sugar nucleotides provide detailed insights into carbohydrate activation and recognition of these receptors, which could inspire further research in this area. However, further investigations are needed to determine whether other carbohydrate-binding motifs exist in GPCRs.
Biomedical researchers have identified a crucial role for glial cells in regulating the behavior of neural stem cells (neuroblasts, NBs) in the fruit fly Drosophila. Specifically, glial cells produce ferritin, a protein that stores and transports iron, which is essential for the energy production and self-renewal of NBs. The study found that knockdown of glial ferritin-encoding genes leads to energy shortages in NBs, resulting in reduced proliferation and premature differentiation. This is mediated by the entry of the protein Prospero into the nuclei of NBs.

The researchers also discovered that ferritin produced by glial cells is the primary source of iron for NBs, relieving them from the need to produce ferritin themselves and reducing the risk of iron overload-induced oxidative stress. Glial cells can clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets, ensuring normal NB function during neural development. The study suggests that a bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism exists between glial cells and NBs, where glial cells act as the main pool for ferritin production and iron allocation.

Interestingly, the researchers found that glial ferritin is required for tumor development in Drosophila. Knockdown of glial ferritin-encoding genes led to a significant decrease in tumor size in larval brains. Furthermore, adding an iron chelator to the Drosophila food decreased tumor size, suggesting that iron is involved in tumor suppression induced by blocking glial ferritin. These findings highlight the potential of glial ferritin as a target for tumor treatment.

The study provides new insights into the role of glial cells in maintaining the self-renewal of NBs and brain development. The bicellular iron homeostasis mechanism between glial cells and NBs is a novel aspect of neural stem cell regulation. The findings also suggest that this mechanism may exist in other stem cells and their niches. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between glial cells and neural stem cells and has implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

     Biologists have long known that R-loops, a type of transcriptional by-product, can have significant effects on health and disease. However, the cellular processes responsible for removing R-loops from eukaryotic genomes were not well understood. A recent study has shed light on this process, revealing a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription.

     The Smc5/6 complex, a core regulator of chromosome architecture, was found to bind strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation. This binding promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity. The study demonstrated that the Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by various genomic transactions, including gene transcription and telomere length regulation.

     R-loops are most frequently observed at highly transcribed genes but can also be formed at telomeres and near DNA replication forks. The study found that yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes. This suggests that the Smc5/6 complex plays a crucial role in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres.

     In vitro experiments demonstrated that the Smc5/6 complex promotes RNase H2-mediated degradation of the RNA component of R-loops. This suggests that the Smc5/6 complex acts at two distinct levels in the cellular response to R-loop formation. First, it contributes to RNase H-dependent removal of RNA-DNA hybrids from genomic DNA. In the execution of this function, the Smc5/6 role is substantial but not as extensive as that of RNase H enzymes.

     Overall, the study reveals a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. The findings provide new insights into the cellular processes responsible for removing R-loops from eukaryotic genomes and highlight the importance of the Smc5/6 complex in maintaining genome stability.
Biomedical researchers investigated the relationship between preserved communication abilities and healthy ageing in a study of 105 individuals aged 39-82 years. The study aimed to determine whether the age-typical loss of sensory acuity could be compensated for by an individual's preserved attentional neural filtering ability. The researchers used electroencephalographic and behavioural data to examine the longitudinal stability of this compensatory brain-behaviour link and its predictive power for individual change in listening behaviour.

The study found that despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance remained stable over a two-year period. Additionally, neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint, but not longitudinally. This suggests that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories.

The researchers aimed to replicate their key findings and test whether the previously observed between-subjects brain-behaviour relationship would hold across time. They expected an individual's neural filtering ability to impact their listening performance independently of age or hearing status. However, when analysed in the longitudinal sample of ageing listeners, the study did not find evidence for a predictive role of neural filtering despite supporting brain-behaviour links observed within each timepoint.

The study characterised how hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance change across the middle to older adult lifespan. The researchers used linear mixed-effect models to test cross-sectional effects of age and longitudinal changes with time. They also quantified each measure's test-retest reliability as their T1-T2 Pearson's correlation. The study found no systematic longitudinal change in neural filtering, as previously observed inter-individual differences in neural filtering were independent of age and hearing status.

The study focused on one candidate neurobiological implementation of an auditory attentional filter to help explain inter-individual differences in listening behaviour and its lifespan trajectories. The behavioural outcome of interest, the speed and accuracy with which an ageing individual solves a difficult listening situation, involves the orchestration of different perceptual and cognitive processes. The study's results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour, as neither neural filtering at T1 nor its two-year change could predict individual two-year behavioural change under a combination of modelling strategies.

     Biomedical researchers investigated the relationship between the perception of taste and flavour, also known as chemosensation, and the use of botanical drugs in ancient Greece and Rome. They found that the intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as specific tastes and flavours, can predict the therapeutic uses of these drugs. The study used a tasting panel to determine the chemosensory qualities of 22 botanical drugs and applied phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models to test whether these qualities were associated with their recorded therapeutic uses. The results showed that 21 out of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use, and that drugs with high therapeutic versatility had simple yet intense tastes and flavours.

     The researchers also found that certain chemosensory qualities, such as starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy, were associated with versatility in therapeutic use. This challenges the common notion that bitter-tasting medicines are the most versatile. The study suggests that the use of botanical drugs in ancient times was based on observed physiological effects, which are often consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology.

     The researchers propose that chemosensation and underlying physiological effects mediated by chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology co-explain the diversity of therapeutic uses of botanical drugs in ancient times. They also suggest that the theory of humours, which was the principal underlying concept of Western medicine from ancient Graeco-Roman times until the Industrial Age, may be linked to modern medicine through the perception of taste and flavour of botanical drugs. The study demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods applied to human behaviour and assessment of plant properties, and shows that chemosensory perception connects ancient therapeutic knowledge with modern science.

     The researchers acknowledge the limitations of their study, including the impossibility of addressing all associations found and the dependence on published pharmacological data for the explanatory part. However, their approach provides an unprecedented insight into how chemosensation in combination with physiological effects guided human behaviour in pre-historic times and conditioned therapeutic expectations and humoral theory in historic times.
summary
     Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri, are known to cause gastrointestinal bleeding and bacteremia, leading to sepsis and death in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying their ability to enter the bloodstream remain poorly understood.

     Researchers have discovered that these bacteria are rapidly attracted to sources of human serum, which is sufficient to induce bacterial attraction even in femtoliter volumes. This response is mediated through chemotaxis, a process by which bacteria move towards chemical stimuli, and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum. The chemoreceptor Tsr is responsible for recognizing L-serine, and its direct binding to L-serine is essential for the bacterial attraction response.

     Crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine have been obtained, revealing a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. Tsr is widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections.

     The researchers found that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth, and chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. This behavior has been termed "bacterial vampirism," which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

     The study suggests that L-serine functions as a molecular cue that directs Salmonella toward serum, but nutrients present in serum other than L-serine provide the major growth advantages. The attraction to serum is not limited to Salmonella, as other bacterial species, including E. coli and C. koseri, also exhibit rapid taxis toward serum.

     The researchers developed an enterohemorrhagic lesion model to investigate if chemotaxis and Tsr can mediate bloodstream entry. They found that the bacterial attraction response to serum is robust and rapid, with the motile population reorganizing within 1-2 minutes of serum exposure to be significantly biased toward the serum source. This response occurs through the cooperative action of multiple bacterial chemoreceptors, including Tsr, which recognizes L-serine. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the ability of Enterobacteriaceae to cause bloodstream infections.
Biomedical researchers have identified a conserved genetic program that defines the cellular identity of male germ cells across animal species. This program is thought to have originated over 600 million years ago and has been retained throughout evolution. The study used network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome from vertebrate and invertebrate species to uncover the molecular basis of metazoan male germ cells.

The researchers found that approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes are required for the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell, with a third of these genes forming a deeply conserved genetic scaffold. This scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis.

By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, the researchers uncovered 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies.

The study suggests that the transcriptional identity of metazoan male germ cells is built around a relatively small network of deeply conserved gene interactions with an overarching functional impact. Despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ and a preferential birthplace for new genes, deeply conserved genes remain central components in the male germ cell transcriptome of evolutionarily distant species.

The researchers propose that the conserved male germ cell gene expression program can provide clinical insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. The study's findings significantly expand the breadth of previous observations in the mammalian lineage and provide a new understanding of the conserved molecular basis of metazoan spermatogenesis.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the way eukaryotic cells, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, swim and steer using their flagella. These whip-like structures beat in a coordinated manner to propel the cell forward and change direction. In C. reinhardtii, the flagella beat in a breaststroke-like motion, with one flagellum leading the other. However, the exact role of each flagellum in this coordinated motion has remained unclear.

    Researchers used a combination of experiments, computations, and modeling to investigate the role of each flagellum in synchronous beating. They employed a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum and found that the coordinated beating only responds to the load exerted on the cis flagellum. This asymmetry in response is due to a unilateral coupling between the two flagella.

    Dynamic modulation of flagellar dominance during synchronous beating is crucial for C. reinhardtii's tactic motility. Calcium has been speculated to play a role in this modulation, as it is involved in switching the beating mode. The researchers used oscillatory flows to apply biased loads on one flagellum and found that the flagella have differential roles in coordination.

    A reduced stochastic model was developed to elucidate the mechanisms behind this asymmetry. The model showed that selective hydrodynamic loading and flagellar dominance in the coordinated beating are represented by different parameters. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to clarify the interplay between flows and flagella, reproducing all experimental observations.

    The findings of this study highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implications for biflagellates' tactic behaviors. The results suggest that the cis flagellum plays a leading role in the coordinated beating, while the trans flagellum responds to the load exerted on the cis flagellum. This asymmetry in response is due to a unilateral coupling between the two flagella. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of flagellar coordination and motility in eukaryotic cells.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the mechanisms underlying the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting. A recent study has made significant progress in this area by identifying the role of type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in promoting beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue during intermittent fasting. Beigeing is a process by which white adipose tissue is converted into a more metabolically active brown-like tissue, leading to improved insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.

The study found that intermittent fasting stimulates the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by ILC3s in the intestine. IL-22 is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the regulation of immune responses and tissue homeostasis. The adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s into diet-induced-obese mice increased beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3s are critical for this process. Furthermore, exogenous IL-22 was shown to increase beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue, indicating that IL-22 is a key mediator of this process.

The study also found that deficiency of the IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting, highlighting the importance of the IL-22/IL-22R axis in this process. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s, which may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages.

These findings establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue and suggest that the ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between the gut, immune system, and adipose tissue, and highlights the potential therapeutic applications of targeting ILC3s and the IL-22/IL-22R axis in the treatment of metabolic diseases.
Biomedical researchers have long studied Pavlovian fear conditioning to understand how animals learn to associate certain stimuli with threats or dangers. However, most studies have focused on freezing behavior, a common response to perceived threats. A new study aimed to investigate the role of associative and non-associative mechanisms in defensive responses by using a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm in mice. The researchers paired a compound stimulus consisting of a tone and white noise with footshock to elicit a range of defensive behaviors, including freezing, jumping, and darting.

The study found that mice in the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period and explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the white noise period. In contrast, mice in control groups that received unpaired or reversed presentations of the compound stimulus showed less tone-induced freezing and rarely exhibited jumping or darting. During extinction sessions, the paired group's tone-induced freezing decreased, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during white noise to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the compound stimulus, with minimal freezing and jumping.

The findings suggest that non-associative factors contribute to some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are necessary for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression. The study highlights the importance of considering both associative and non-associative mechanisms in understanding defensive responses. The researchers used a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that elicits a range of defensive behaviors, including freezing, jumping, and darting, which are seldom observed in classical Pavlovian conditioning.

The study's results demonstrate that associative and non-associative factors combine to produce distinct behavioral transitions between freezing and flight. The findings have implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying defensive responses and may inform the development of new treatments for anxiety disorders. The study's use of a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm provides a more comprehensive understanding of defensive behavior and highlights the need to consider both associative and non-associative mechanisms in future research.
Biologists have long been interested in understanding how insects navigate their environment and keep track of their orientation. A key component of this process is the encoding of head direction, which has been shown to be represented by a sinusoidal activity pattern in a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding is an evolutionary coincidence or if it provides a specific functional advantage. To address this question, researchers have established the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and found that many circuits can perform this function with different activity patterns. Among these patterns, the sinusoidal one is the most resilient to noise, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons.

The researchers compared their predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and fruit fly, finding a strong agreement. They also demonstrated that the predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, suggesting that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect. Instead, it can develop during the insect's development. Furthermore, the researchers showed that the consistent presence of the eight-column organization of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance occurrence, but rather can be explained by basic evolutionary principles.

Previous studies have shown that the position-integrating neurons in insects also exhibit sinusoidal activation patterns. Electrophysiological and calcium imaging studies have consistently demonstrated that the neural population encoding head direction in insects has a sinusoid-shaped activation pattern. Various models of heading integration circuits in insects have been proposed, ranging from simplified conceptual networks to sophisticated models constrained by biological data. However, previous theoretical work has argued that a sinusoidal activity encoding is a common motif in insect navigation because it facilitates element-wise vector addition. However, this cannot be the only reason, as the researchers have shown that there is a family of circuits with different encoding patterns that enable easy vector addition.
Summary of Biomedical Research Article
     Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination.

     In this study, researchers discovered that CISD1 has a heightened propensity to form dimers in PINK1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by a disulfide bridge, rendering CISD1 unable to coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpression of Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila resulted in reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This effect was more pronounced in mutant Cisd and aggravated in PINK1 mutant flies.

     Conversely, complete loss of Cisd rescued all detrimental effects of PINK1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. The results suggest that Cisd, likely in its iron-depleted form, operates downstream of PINK1, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target.

     The study identified CISD1, specifically its iron-depleted form, as a potential downstream mediator of the pathophysiological effects arising from the loss of PINK1 function, and to a certain extent, Parkin loss of function. Both dopaminergic neurons from familial PD patients with PINK1 mutations and PINK1 mutant flies exhibited increased levels of a slower-migrating form of CISD1/Cisd on immunoblots.

     Immunoblotting revealed increased dimer formation and even the presence of a CISD1 multimer under these conditions. The researchers conclude that the increased dimer formation in PINK1 mutant neurons likely represents the presence of apo-CISD1, a form of CISD1 devoid of its iron-sulfur cluster, caused by changes in iron homeostasis.

     Overexpression of Cisd was found to be neurotoxic, disrupting mitochondrial morphology and leading to an accumulation of phospho-ubiquitin, which may also block mitophagy, resulting in the accumulation of more defective mitochondria. The study suggests a role for CISD1 in redox imbalance and iron dysregulation, particularly implicating the iron-depleted form of CISD1.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that obligate parasites often trigger significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes remain unclear. A recent study explored the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants, but previous research demonstrated that the insects were attracted to leaves, not the leaf-like flowers.

     The current study made a surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, SAP54 alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. The study found that SAP54 effectively suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to males.

     The host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase (SVP) emerged as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed SVP null mutant plants over those not exposed to males. The research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction, integral to the phytoplasma life cycle.

     SAP54 acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. The study provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes and opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions. The research also expands the mechanistic understanding of insect gender-specific factors targeted by parasites.

     The study found that female leafhoppers prefer to reproduce on both SAP54 and SVP mutant plants exclusively in the presence of leafhopper males, underscoring a sophisticated regulatory effect of SVP and other MADS-box transcription factors targeted by SAP54 on plant responses to the different sexes of the herbivores. This intricate interaction is detailed in the mechanism proposed in Figure 7. The study suggests that SAP54 promotes the abundance of phytoplasma-carrying insect vectors and facilitates phytoplasma transmission, illustrating how a bacterial gene extends its influence beyond its primary plant host to modulate the host choice and reproductive behavior of the insect vector.
Summary: Candida albicans, a common human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and causes substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments often fail due to the fungus's ability to develop a tolerance response, allowing some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimum inhibitory concentration. To better understand this tolerance response, researchers used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs.

The study found that untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression patterns that correlate with cell cycle stage, with distinct metabolic and stress responses. When exposed to the antifungal drug fluconazole, surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: the Ribo-dominant (Rd) state, characterized by upregulated genes related to ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity; and the Stress-dominant (Sd) state, enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment.

The researchers also found evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response (RASTR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying antifungal drug tolerance in Candida albicans and highlights the importance of understanding phenotypic heterogeneity in the response to antifungal drugs. The use of a nanoliter droplet-based assay enabled a detailed single-cell analysis of C. albicans in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs, providing a more comprehensive understanding of community structure and population heterogeneity.

The findings of this study align with previous reports associating cell cycle phase with the expression of stress response and metabolism-related genes. The study's focus on antifungal tolerance to fluconazole, a well-known fungistatic drug, provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms and implications of antifungal drug tolerance, which differ from those of bacterial heteroresistance. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between Candida albicans and antifungal drugs, with potential implications for the development of more effective treatments.
The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution suggests that the effectiveness of selection varies among species. A new metric, the Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS), has been proposed to measure the effectiveness of selection at the molecular level. CAIS is based on Kullback-Leibler divergence and corrects for two confounders: GC content and amino acid composition. This new index can be calculated from a single complete genome without requiring data on polymorphism, mutation rate, or demographic history.

Previous metrics that compared codon bias across species were confounded by variations in GC content and amino acid composition. CAIS overcomes these limitations and provides a more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection. The authors demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations and the Effective Number of Codons (ENC) to show that protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder.

The CAIS is an extension of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), which measures the degree of bias in synonymous codon usage driven by selective preference. However, CAI is confounded by GC content and amino acid composition. The new CAIS metric corrects for these confounders using Kullback-Leibler divergence. The authors propose that more highly adapted species have a higher proportion of genes and sites subject to effective selection on codon bias.

CAIS and ENC can be estimated for more species than previous metrics because they do not require polymorphism or mutation rate data, nor tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances. CAIS has the additional advantage of not being confounded with amino acid frequencies. The authors developed CAIS as a new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level, capable of quantifying degrees of codon adaptation even among vertebrates. Vertebrates were chosen as a test case due to the abundance of suitable data and the limited evidence for codon adaptation in previous studies.

The degree of bias in synonymous codon usage driven by selective preference offers a more direct way to assess how effective selection is at the molecular level in a given species. CAIS can be estimated from a single genome, without requiring polymorphism or mutation rate data. The authors demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations and ENC to show that protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder.
Sepsis is a global health priority that causes millions of deaths worldwide each year. It is characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory immune response, which highlights the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. A key mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), which is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, as well as by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. This study investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP and its role in sepsis pathogenesis.

    The researchers used genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) to demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. They also found that impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, the local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase that hydrolyzes ATP to be released. The results showed that abrogating bacterial ATP release suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival.

    The study also found that bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulate the expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. The researchers isolated sepsis-associated bacteria and measured the amount of ATP they release, finding that E. coli released the highest amount of ATP in a standardized mouse model of abdominal sepsis.

    The study demonstrated that ATP released by bacteria suppresses abdominal inflammatory responses and worsens survival in a model of abdominal sepsis. ATP is rapidly metabolized in the extracellular space, limiting its mode of action to the immediate cellular vicinity. However, the role of ATP released by bacteria invading non-colonized compartments, such as the abdominal cavity or blood, remains to be determined. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis.
Biomedical researchers investigated the relationship between psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in children and the risk of developing psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. They used data from 6,602 children in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study to examine how genetic and environmental factors, such as family and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and supportive environments, influence PLEs. The study found that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs were associated with lower polygenic scores (PGSs) for cognitive phenotypes, lower family SES, lower neighborhood SES, and less supportive environments. The researchers also discovered that cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs.

The study employed linear mixed models and a novel structural equation modeling (SEM) method to estimate the joint effects of genetic and environmental factors on cognitive intelligence and PLEs. The researchers adjusted for ethnicity, schizophrenia PGS, and unobserved confounders using computational confound modeling. They found that higher PGSs for cognitive phenotypes, higher family SES, higher neighborhood SES, and more supportive environments were associated with higher cognitive intelligence and lower PLEs.

The study's findings suggest that improving school and family environments, as well as promoting local economic development, may enhance cognitive and mental health in children. The researchers also demonstrated the mediating role of cognitive intelligence in the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and PLEs. This study advances our understanding of the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in the development of PLEs and highlights the importance of cognitive intelligence as a mediator of this relationship.

The study's results have implications for policy and intervention efforts aimed at reducing the risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders in children. By targeting cognitive intelligence and supportive environments, interventions may be able to mitigate the effects of genetic and environmental risk factors on PLEs and promote better mental health outcomes in children.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) in the development of the human brain. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebral organoids, a 3D in vitro platform, the study aimed to understand how FGF8 signaling affects neural identity and differentiation during early fetal telencephalic development.

     The results show that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to the formation of distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains within the organoids. Within the telencephalic regions, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. This, in turn, impacts spontaneous neuronal network activity.

     Transcriptomic analysis revealed that FGF8 treatment induces the expression of ventral telencephalic genes, such as ASCL1, DLX2, and PBX3, while suppressing dorsal genes like EMX1, NEUROG2, SOX5, and LHX2. This suggests that FGF8 signaling promotes ventral identity in telencephalic territories.

     The study also found that FGF8 efficiently modulates genes associated with brain disorders, including NR2F1, in human FOXG1+ telencephalic cells. This highlights the critical role of FGF8 in fine-tuning key neurodevelopmental and pathogenic pathways.

     The researchers propose that FGF8-mediated modulation of developmental genes guides the developmental trajectories of human brain cells along the dorsoventral and anteroposterior telencephalic axes. Interestingly, the ability of FGF8 to modulate target genes varies based on the regional identity of the FGF8-exposed cells, leading to the co-presence of various regional domains in FGF8-treated organoids.

     Overall, the study demonstrates that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and modulates genes associated with normal and pathological neural development. The findings provide new insights into the role of FGF8 in human brain development and its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that sleep and feeding patterns in young animals, such as Drosophila (fruit flies), lack a strong daily rhythm. As these animals mature, feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. However, the cues that trigger the development of this daily rhythm are not well understood. A recent study investigated the role of nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae.

     The study found that in the second instar larval stage (L2), sleep and feeding are spread across the day, but by the third instar larval stage (L3), these behaviors become organized into daily patterns. When mature (L3) animals were forced to adopt immature (L2) feeding strategies, their sleep-wake rhythms and ability to exhibit long-term memory (LTM) were disrupted. Furthermore, the development of the clock (DN1a) -arousal (Dh44) circuit, which is responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness, was influenced by the larval nutritional environment.

     The study also demonstrated that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive the onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. This suggests that changes in energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors. The researchers propose that developing larvae detect changes in their nutritional environments through Dh44 neurons, which act as nutrient sensors to regulate food consumption and starvation-induced sleep suppression.

     In adult Drosophila, sleep and feeding behaviors are consolidated to specific times of day, with flies eating more during the day than at night. However, early in development, sleep in L2 larvae lacks a circadian pattern. The study found that the emergence of daily sleep-wake patterns is regulated by developmental changes in energetic capacity, and that Dh44 neurons may be necessary for sensing larval nutritional environments.

     The development of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit promotes deeper sleep in L3, resulting in the emergence of LTM capabilities at the L3 stage but not before. The study identifies the cues that trigger the emergence of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit and the consolidation of sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae. The findings suggest that the development of circadian sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae is advantageous, enabling long-term memory capabilities at the L3 stage.
Biologists have long observed that many animals moving through fluids, such as fish swimming in schools, exhibit highly coordinated group movement that is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion. However, direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements have remained elusive. A recent study on giant danio fish (Devario aequipinnatus) has shed light on this phenomenon by characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of fish.

The study found that fish schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism-speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at approximately 1 body length per second. This means that fish swimming in schools reduce their total energy expenditure (TEE) per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed, fish swimming in schools had a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65% less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, resulting in a 53% lower TEE and total cost of transport.

The study also found that fish in schools recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance, which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators. These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes.

The researchers used a high-drag viscous aquatic medium as a model to understand how group movement by animals can be more energy-efficient than movement by isolated individuals. By increasing maximum aerobic performance, fish schools save anaerobic energy and reduce the recovery time after peak swimming performance. The study's findings support the hypothesis that fish in schools can reduce the total cost of high-speed locomotion relative to solitary movement, leading to reduced non-aerobic energetic costs and time of recovery for schooling fish swimming at speeds occupying the majority of their aerobic capacity.

The study directly measured both aerobic and non-aerobic energy used by schooling fishes over a wide range of water velocities and compared the swimming performance curve to that of solitary fish. The results show that both solitary fish and fish schools have a concave upward shaped aerobic metabolic rate-speed curve over the lower portion of their speed range. However, fish schools swimming at approximately 1 body length per second consume less energy than at slower speeds, indicating a minimum metabolic cost at this speed.
Summary of Biomedical Research Article
     Airway macrophages (AM) play a crucial role in preventing infection in the lung and are a target for host-directed therapy. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, particularly in lung-resident AM. To address this, researchers examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in their resting state and after priming with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin-4 (IL-4) to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung.

     The study found that human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. However, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM, which shifted to a "Warburg"-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM, and blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ-driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis.

     Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. The study provides evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.
summary
     For the first time, a study has shown that nocturnal bull ants use the polarized light pattern produced by the moon to navigate at night. This ability allows them to find their way home even when the sun is hidden by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. The moon's polarized light pattern is much dimmer than the sun's, but the ants can still detect it and use it as a compass cue.

     Nocturnal bull ants typically leave their nest at twilight and rely on the overhead solar polarized light pattern to navigate. However, when the sun is no longer visible, they use the polarized moonlight to find their way home. The study demonstrates that the ants can detect polarized moonlight throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons when the polarized light levels are at their lowest.

     The researchers rotated the overhead polarized light pattern above homing ants and found that they altered their headings in response. This suggests that the ants are using the polarized moonlight to navigate. The study also shows that the ants incorporate the polarized moonlight pattern into their path integration system throughout the night, similar to how they incorporate polarized sunlight during the day.

     While it has been theorized that other nocturnal insects, such as bees and crickets, may also be able to detect polarized moonlight, this study provides the first behavioral evidence of its use in goal-directed navigation. The researchers suggest that the ability to detect polarized moonlight may be widespread among nocturnal insects, but further research is needed to confirm this.

     The study focused on the Myrmecia midas ant species, which is known to restrict most of its navigation to evening and morning twilight. The researchers found that these ants use polarized moonlight in the same way they use polarized sunlight, suggesting that the two cues are processed through the same visual pathways. This means that the ants can use the same underlying neural architecture for both polarized solar light and polarized moonlight cues. The study provides new insights into the complex navigation abilities of nocturnal insects and highlights the importance of polarized light in their navigation systems.
Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, had unique tail structures that played a crucial role in their flight control. Early pterosaurs, known as non-pterodactyloids, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base, similar to some dinosaurs like Velociraptor. These tails ended in a soft tissue vane, which may have contributed to passive stability in flight. The length and stiffness of the tails suggest that they were important for control based on mass shifting or inertial control, similar to terrestrial theropods with convergent tails.

However, the soft tissue vane would have compromised aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane was crucial for early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved was unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats.

Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF) imaging to examine the tail vanes of over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils. Four exceptional specimens were imaged under LSF, revealing a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. This lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system that maintained vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.

The LSF imaging technique allowed researchers to visualize the vane's structural properties and explore its usage, evolutionary origins, and the context for its disappearance in later pterodactyloids. The findings provide new insights into the flight capabilities of early pterosaurs and the evolution of their unique tail structures. The discovery of the cross-linking lattice and dynamic tensioning system sheds light on how early pterosaurs maintained stiffness in their tail vanes, which was essential for their flight control and maneuverability. This research contributes to our understanding of the evolution of flight in vertebrates and the unique adaptations of early pterosaurs.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that adolescence is a critical period of development marked by significant changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making. These changes are essential for transitioning into adulthood but also increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. A key factor underlying these changes is the reorganization of the dopamine system, particularly in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core.

     A recent study used fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to investigate differences in dopamine release in adolescent (P28-35) and adult (P70-90) male rats. The results showed baseline differences in dopamine release between adult and adolescent rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood.

     The study also found that blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that the α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. Using microdialysis, the researchers confirmed the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo. The results suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release.

     The study's findings indicate that the dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence, and this reorganization is driven by multisynaptic regulation of dopamine release through both acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs and GABA tone. The results also suggest that GABA and nAChRs have a complex and reciprocal regulation of dopamine release that may be age/developmental stage-dependent. The study's conclusions provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the age-related differences in dopamine release in the NAc core of male rats, which may have implications for understanding the development of psychiatric disorders.
Summary of Biomedical Research Article
     Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a range of behavioral symptoms. Despite its heterogeneity, research suggests that common underlying mechanisms may contribute to the development of ASD. A recent study used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to investigate the neural precursor cells (NPCs) of individuals with ASD from two distinct subtypes: idiopathic and 16p11.2 deletion.

     The study found that NPCs from both subtypes exhibited reduced neurite outgrowth and migration, despite the absence of genetic overlap between the two groups. To identify potential signaling differences contributing to these developmental defects, an unbiased phospho-proteome screen was conducted. The analysis revealed hundreds of shared phospho-peptides between the two ASD subtypes, including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in NPCs across both subtypes, and modulation of the mTOR pathway rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism-associated phenotypes in control NPCs.

     The study also found enrichment of the ERK/MAPK and PKA pathways in the phospho-proteome analyses, suggesting that altered cellular signaling plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Importantly, the study indicates that mTOR dysregulation drives autism-associated phenotypes in ASD NPCs.

     To investigate the role of mTOR signaling in ASD, the researchers conducted gain and loss of function studies on NPCs from both subtypes. Increasing mTOR pathway activity rescued ASD defects in low-mTOR ASD patients, while reducing mTOR pathway activity reproduced autism NPC phenotypes. Conversely, decreasing p-S6 in high-mTOR ASD NPCs rescued ASD NPC phenotypes. These findings suggest that mTOR signaling dysregulation is a shared pathogenic mechanism across genetically distinct ASD subtypes.

     The study's results have significant implications for the understanding and treatment of ASD. By identifying a common underlying mechanism contributing to the development of ASD, researchers may be able to develop targeted therapies that address the root cause of the disorder, rather than just its symptoms. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential of mTOR modulation as a therapeutic approach for ASD.
summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of neural diversity in the encoding capacity of circuitry, particularly in the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. A recent study aimed to bridge the gap between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity by conducting ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons.

     The study found that synapses with high spontaneous rates of release (SR) were predominantly located on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses exhibited larger and more temporally compact spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates compared to low SR synapses.

     The researchers used acutely explanted organs of Corti from hearing mice to record the postsynaptic SGN response to glutamate release at a single afferent synapse. This approach tightly controlled IHC Ca2+ influx and mimicked in vivo SGN characterization conditions. The study's findings indicate that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

     The study's results provide support for the presynaptic hypothesis of functional SGN diversity and highlight the importance of synaptic heterogeneity in the cochlea. However, the study also notes that caution should be applied when comparing ex vivo and in vivo data due to the partial disruption of the physiological milieu and incomplete synaptic maturation. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of SGN firing diversity in the cochlea.
summary
     The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, undergoes significant environmental challenges as it progresses through its lifecycle stages. To overcome these challenges, the parasite relies on effective and highly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across various kingdoms, including plants and animals. Recent studies have highlighted the role of MORC proteins as transcriptional switches in apicomplexan parasites.

     This study used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, along with molecular and genomics approaches, to investigate the function of PfMORC in Plasmodium falciparum. The results demonstrate that PfMORC modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite's erythrocytic cycle and is essential for its survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments revealed that PfMORC binds to sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation, suggesting a role in modulating stage transition.

     Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies showed that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite's heterochromatin structure, leading to its death. These findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.

     Previous studies have identified PfMORC as one of the most abundant chromatin-bound proteins in Plasmodium falciparum. However, the genome-wide distribution and exact function of this protein throughout the parasite life cycle remained elusive. This study used CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing technologies to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of PfMORC throughout the parasite's intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC).

     Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validated the role of PfMORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance. The study also assessed the genome-wide distribution of PfMORC using ChIP-seq in duplicate at the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages. The results showed that PfMORC is not only critical for parasite cell cycle progression and survival but also has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation. Disparities observed in the essentiality of PfMORC for parasite survival in previous studies were resolved using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an investigation into the role of nerves infiltrating tumors in these alterations. A study using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors, including decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running. Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos and increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running, indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. The study suggests that tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior, independently of pain. This cancer-brain circuit drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice. The elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, but also highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. The absence of nociceptor neurons in tumor-bearing animals decreased cFos and ΔFosB in the PBN and ΔFosB in the SpVc, suggesting that the tumor-brain communication was disrupted. The study demonstrates that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit that extends from the tumor bed to the TGM ganglion, connects to the SpVc, and projects into the brain, influencing behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways. The findings have implications for the development of targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer. Cancer patients and survivors often experience poor mental health, and the neural connection between tumor and brain, together with the finding that TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons within this circuit become functionally altered, might contribute to these changes. The study highlights the importance of unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain to develop effective treatments for cancer-related mental health issues.
Summary: 
     Biomedical researchers have analyzed the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its impact on the biophysical properties of the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein is a multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in the virus's life cycle. The researchers used a large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2 to examine how mutations in the protein's amino acid sequence affect its biophysical properties. They found that variations in the protein's intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) allow for local plasticity, but also impose functional constraints that are similar to those found in related coronaviruses.

     The researchers conducted biophysical experiments on several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants of the virus. They found that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal effects on the protein's thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects that shift the balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties.

     The study suggests that genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, particularly in the IDRs. The researchers used computational methods to evaluate the range of biophysical traits resulting from diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein folded domains and IDRs across the observed mutant spectrum. They found that a large biophysical parameter space is available for viable N-protein, with the potential for mutations to exert nonlocal effects modulating overall protein biophysical properties.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of the N-protein's many functions and the biophysical fitness landscape underlying evolution. The research also highlights the importance of understanding the biophysical properties of viral proteins in the context of genetic diversity and evolution. The study's results have implications for the development of new treatments and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.
Biologists have long been fascinated by hibernation, a state of metabolic suppression that allows small and large mammal species to survive harsh winter conditions. To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind hibernation, researchers investigated how skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency change during this period. Myosin is a protein that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and energy production.

    The study isolated muscle fibers from two small hibernators, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus, and two larger hibernators, Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus. The researchers used a combination of techniques, including loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments and X-ray diffraction, to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. They also performed multiple proteomics analyses to examine changes in myosin structure and function.

    The results showed that myosin structure was preserved in the larger hibernators, U. arctos and U. americanus, during hibernation. However, in the smaller hibernators, I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor led to increased energy expenditure in type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures. When the researchers repeated the experiments at a lower temperature, closer to the body temperature of torpid animals, they found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods.

    The study also observed myosin hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemlineatus, which may help stabilize the myosin molecule and mitigate increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. The findings suggest that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes in ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, the study highlights myosin as a potential contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis, a process that generates heat without shivering. The results provide new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hibernation and may have implications for understanding energy metabolism in mammals.
summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of chondrocyte columns in growth plate architecture and their role in driving bone elongation. However, a new study has challenged this understanding by revealing that chondrocytes in the embryonic growth plate of mice are rarely arranged in columns. Instead, successive incomplete rotations during cell division result in non-stereotypic cell stacking that gives rise to elongated clusters oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal bone axis. The researchers analyzed the 3D structure of cell clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice using a modified version of 3D MAPs. They found that uniclonal and multiclonal columns are rare in the embryonic growth plate and that the core mechanism underlying chondrocyte column formation, namely a complete rotation of the division plane during chondrocyte proliferation, is also rare in the embryonic growth plate. The study reveals the temporal dynamics of division plane rotations and their effect on the formation of columns and clusters in the pre- and postnatal growth plate, as well as the correlation of these morphogenetic processes with different growth behaviors. The presence of clusters and columns correlated temporally with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that these structures support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development. The study highlights the imperative role of 3D analysis when studying complex cellular arrangements and provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development. Overall, the findings suggest that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determine the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth.
Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the mechanism of proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs), which play a crucial role in the oral bioavailability of various drugs. POTs are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Recent cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have provided new insights into the conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1 and SLC15A2. However, these studies have left open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling.

     To address these questions, researchers employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. The simulations computed conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the presence or absence of peptide substrate. The results identified a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. Key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs were also identified, which were validated experimentally in cell-based transport assays.

     The simulations also established a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underlying secondary active transport in POTs. The study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and paves the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.

     The researchers constructed a model of the alternating access mechanism of POTs, explaining how the movement of two protons through the transporter drives accompanying conformational changes. They also established distinct effects of the presence of substrate, coupling ligand binding with protein conformational changes and linking it to protonation of the E56 and E622 titratable residues. The study provides a detailed model of a plausible sequence of steps for substrate and proton-coupled alternating access in mammalian POTs.

     To investigate the mechanism of peptide-proton coupling, the researchers calculated the affinity of a bound Ala-Phe substrate molecule using absolute binding free energy (ABFE) simulations in different protein states. The results showed that the affinity is similar in the OF and IF states, indicating that the binding of substrate alone does not thermodynamically drive the transporter from OF to IF. Enhanced sampling simulations were then employed to obtain conformational free energy landscapes in dependence on a range of protonation state and substrate binding conditions. The results indicate distinct and additive roles played by two protons in the conformational cycle mechanism.
Biomedical research has long suggested that neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization across the animal kingdom, including humans. This suppression is thought to increase sensitivity to auditory feedback, allowing for the detection of vocalization errors. However, a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring has remained elusive. To investigate this relationship, researchers obtained intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production.

The study characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression, which varied across the superior temporal gyrus (STG). The researchers then performed a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations. The results showed that overlapping sites exhibited enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. Importantly, there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting that suppression might be a key mechanism underlying speech monitoring.

The study also found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm. This suggests that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity. The researchers predicted that if speech-induced suppression enables detection and correction of speech errors, suppressed auditory sites should be sensitive to auditory feedback and exhibit enhanced neural responses to feedback perturbations. The results supported this hypothesis, revealing that overlapping sites in the STG exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback with a strong correlation between the two measures.

The study used intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in neurosurgical participants, which offers a level of spatial detail and temporal precision that would not be possible to achieve using non-invasive techniques. The findings provide evidence for a shared mechanism between auditory suppression and speech monitoring, and suggest that increased attention to auditory feedback under adverse speaking conditions can increase feedback sensitivity and elicit larger responses in the auditory cortex compared to normal speech production. Overall, the study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human speech monitoring and the role of auditory suppression in detecting and correcting speech errors.
A comprehensive census of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, specifically McrBC systems, has been conducted, revealing their widespread presence in diverse prokaryotes and numerous genomic associations. A previously uncharacterized branch of these systems, denoted as coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoCoNuTs), has been identified. CoCoNuTs are distinguished by their extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases, and they exhibit extraordinary variety, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes.

Further analysis of CoCoNuTs has shown that they contain domains capable of interacting with translation system components, such as SmpB-like OB-folds, Hsp70 homologs, and YTH domains, as well as RNases like HEPN. This suggests that CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs may also target DNA via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, including Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are often encoded in the same predicted superoperons as CoCoNuTs.

In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides or RNA fragments with cyclic termini that bind associated CARF domains. It is hypothesized that CoCoNuTs, along with ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy similar to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems. This strategy involves an initial immune response to eliminate viral DNA and/or RNA, followed by an abortive infection response leading to programmed cell death or dormancy via host RNA cleavage if the initial response fails.

Phylogenetic analysis of CoCoNuTs has revealed a complex structure, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes differing in their domain compositions and genomic associations. The RNA targeting capability of certain CoCoNuTs can be inferred from their similarity to Type III-A in encoding CnuD Hsp70-like proteins. Higher-order associations of Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuT systems with various DNA restriction systems suggest a two-pronged DNA and RNA restriction strategy reminiscent of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems. The conserved association of CDC48-like ATPases with Type III-A CoCoNuTs, which encode the potentially tmRNA-binding SPB domain, provides support for the scenario of tmRNA interaction. Structural analysis of the bacteriocin-like protein encoded in these loci indicates that it adopts an inactivated PD-(D/E)xK-type restriction endonuclease fold, potentially nucleic acid-binding.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have investigated the role of calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase, in regulating the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. Calcineurin is known to be involved in various cellular processes, including thermotaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan. Inhibition of calcineurin has been shown to enhance the lifespan of C. elegans through multiple pathways, including autophagy and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs). However, the specific role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity in C. elegans has not been well understood.

     To study the role of calcineurin in innate immunity, researchers knocked down the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, tax-6, in C. elegans. Surprisingly, they found that tax-6 knockdown enhanced the susceptibility of C. elegans to bacterial infection, despite enhancing lifespan. Further investigation revealed that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in C. elegans. Calcineurin activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, which activate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin via the binding of calmodulin.

     The researchers discovered that inhibition of calcineurin leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. Notably, intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Additionally, the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan.

     These findings uncover a new role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension. The study highlights the complex interplay between lifespan and innate immunity and suggests that calcineurin plays a critical role in regulating the C. elegans response to pathogen infections. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between calcineurin, innate immunity, and lifespan.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how the brain resolves conflicts between task-relevant and -irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. A key challenge lies in determining how a limited set of cognitive control processes can effectively address diverse conflicts arising from different sources, such as sensory input or internal representations. The cognitive space theory proposes that different conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can then be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions.

To test this theory, researchers designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. The study aimed to investigate the geometry of cognitive space in conflict representation, specifically hypothesizing that different types of conflicts are represented as points in a cognitive space. The distance between these points, reflecting the geometry of the cognitive space, was expected to scale with the difference in the sources of the conflicts being represented.

The researchers proposed that the dimensions in the cognitive space of conflicts can be the aforementioned domains, in which domain-specific cognitive control processes are defined. For a specific type of conflict, its location in the cognitive space can be parameterized using a limited number of coordinates, reflecting how much control is needed for each of the domain-specific cognitive control processes. The cognitive space can also represent different types of conflicts with low dimensionality, allowing for domain-general cognitive control as conflicts from different sources can be resolved using the same set of cognitive control processes.

The study further hypothesized that the cognitive space representing different types of conflicts may be located in the frontoparietal network due to its essential roles in conflict resolution. Two solutions to resolving different conflict types were proposed, differing based on whether the same cognitive control mechanisms are applied across domains. The domain-general cognitive control theories posit that the frontoparietal cortex adaptively encodes task information and can thus flexibly implement control strategies for different types of conflicts. This is supported by the generalizable control adjustment, which suggests that the frontoparietal cortex can adjust control strategies based on task demands.

The study used a task with five types of conflicts and measured human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results supported the hypothesis that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity, suggesting that cognitive space is a principle for representing conflicts. The findings provide evidence for the geometry of cognitive space in conflict representation, shedding light on how the brain resolves conflicts between task-relevant and -irrelevant information.
Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the causes of preterm birth, a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. A study conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch of the National Institutes of Health aimed to investigate the vaginal immune response in pregnant women at high risk for spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). The researchers collected vaginal swabs from 739 women at different stages of pregnancy and analyzed 31 immune mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides.

The study found that the vaginal immunoproteome, or the collection of immune molecules in the vagina, undergoes significant changes throughout pregnancy. In women who delivered at term, the vaginal immunoproteome remained in a homeostatic, or balanced, state. However, in women who experienced spontaneous preterm labor (sPTL) or preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), the vaginal immunoproteome shifted towards a pro-inflammatory state. This shift was characterized by increased levels of monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides.

The researchers constructed predictive models using the immune mediator concentrations and found that the vaginal immunoproteome had improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early (less than 34 weeks) sPTB. The study's findings suggest that the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB, a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes.

The study's longitudinal design and comprehensive analysis of 31 immune mediators make it the largest and most comprehensive profiling of the soluble immune response in vaginal fluid to date. The results highlight the importance of the vaginal immunoproteome in predicting sPTB and provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of preterm birth. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential clinical applications of the vaginal immunoproteome as a biomarker for sPTB.
Biomedical researchers have developed a new computational model, known as the Hernandez-Hernandez model, to study the electrical and calcium signaling mechanisms in the smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian systemic arteries and arterioles. These cells play a crucial role in regulating blood flow and blood pressure by controlling the diameter of the vessels. The model is based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries.

The Hernandez-Hernandez model suggests that the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular calcium signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels are sex-specific. Although experimental data show that KV1.5 channel currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, simulations suggest that the KV1.5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes. In contrast, KV2.1 channels play a primary role in the control of membrane potential in female myocytes, which have larger KV2.1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes.

The model predicts that the gating of a small number of voltage-gated potassium channels and L-type calcium channels drives sex-specific differences in intracellular calcium and excitability over the physiological range of membrane potentials. Additionally, the model suggests that female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used calcium channel blockers compared to male.

The Hernandez-Hernandez model also predicts that clinically used antihypertensive calcium channel blockers cause larger reductions in calcium currents in female than in male arterial myocytes. Furthermore, a one-dimensional vessel representation of electrotonically coupled arterial myocytes connected in series suggests that calcium channel blockers are more potent in females, resulting in a more substantial reduction in intracellular calcium levels in female arterial smooth muscle compared to male.

The Hernandez-Hernandez model demonstrates the importance of sex-specific differences in calcium and potassium channels in the control of membrane potential and intracellular calcium signaling in arterial myocytes. The model provides a new framework for investigating the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs and highlights the need for further research on sex-specific differences in cardiovascular physiology.
Summary: 
     Biologists investigated how climate affects the breakdown of plant litter by decomposers of different sizes. They placed baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, from very dry to very wet. The researchers found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size. Smaller decomposers, such as microorganisms, broke down litter more quickly in wetter environments, while larger decomposers, such as insects and worms, broke down litter more quickly in drier environments. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient, except in extremely dry sites where decomposers were less active. The study suggests that larger decomposers play a crucial role in breaking down plant litter in arid environments, resolving a long-standing puzzle in the field. The findings highlight the importance of considering the size of decomposers when studying the breakdown of organic matter in different ecosystems.

     The researchers used pitfall traps to collect macro-decomposers, such as insects and worms, and found that their richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. In contrast, smaller decomposers, such as microorganisms, broke down litter more quickly in wetter environments. The study suggests that the opposing climatic dependencies of micro- and macro-decomposers lead to similar or even higher annual decomposition rates in arid sites compared to those measured in more mesic sites. The findings support a long-suggested but largely overlooked hypothesis that macro-decomposition governs plant litter decomposition in deserts. The study's results have important implications for understanding the breakdown of organic matter in different ecosystems and highlight the need to consider the size of decomposers when investigating zoogeochemical processes.
Biomedical researchers have identified a protein called CYRI-B as a potential mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of cancer with a poor prognosis, characterized by high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. The KRAS gene is hyperactivated in almost all PDAC tumors, leading to enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity, as well as a process called macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a nutrient-scavenging mechanism, but its role in trafficking signaling receptors is not well understood.

In a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer, CYRI-B was found to be highly expressed in tumors. Deletion of the Cyrib gene, which encodes the CYRI-B protein, accelerated tumor formation and increased the area of the pancreas showing lesions with high levels of phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK, two key downstream targets of KRAS and RAC1 that drive proliferation and expansion. However, as the disease progressed, loss of CYRI-B inhibited metastasis.

Further investigation revealed that CYRI-B-depleted tumor cells showed reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumor spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. This suggests that CYRI-B plays a role in mediating growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, particularly in the early stages of tumorigenesis. The study also found that CYRI-B localizes to macropinosomes in pancreatic cancer cell lines, indicating a possible mechanism by which CYRI-B loss could affect tumor progression.

The researchers used a mouse model of metastatic PDAC, known as the KPC model, to study the role of CYRI-B in pancreatic cancer. In this model, PanIN (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia) develops by around 10 weeks and progresses to later stages towards 15 weeks, with full-blown PDAC appearing at this stage. The study found that loss of CYRI-B in the KPC model accelerated PanIN formation and progression, likely due to the loss of CYRI-B's capacity to buffer RAC1 activation downstream of active KRAS, leading to abnormal architecture and hyperactivation of ERK and JNK to drive proliferation. Overall, the findings implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis.
Biomedical researchers have identified a group of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) called HERV-K (HML-2) in rhesus macaques, a type of non-human primate. These viruses are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have been integrated into the macaques' genome over time. The study found 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions that suggest recent or ongoing infectious activity in the animals.

Further analysis revealed that 106 of these proviruses form a clade characterized by a specific sequence between the env gene and the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR). This sequence is derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K (HML-8)-related virus and is found in Old World monkeys (OWM) but not great apes, indicating it originated after the ape/OWM split. Similar proviruses were also identified in white-cheeked gibbons, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons.

The study also found that the LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in the U3 region, which disrupts the Rec Response Element (RcRE) required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. However, the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE), indicating that the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.

The researchers characterized a clade of HERV-K HML-2-related ERVs in rhesus macaques and other OWMs that include an ~750 bp non-coding region between env and the 3' LTR, derived from a recombination with a HERV-K11 HML-8 retrovirus. This characteristic indicates that SERV-K1 is a relatively young insertion, less than about 500,000 years old, and suggests that rhesus macaques may harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses.

The study's findings provide a valuable model for investigating viral evolution over deep time and for HERV-K HML-2 virology and pathogenesis. Previous studies have identified HML-2 proviruses in rhesus macaques, including one study that detected expression of env mRNA and identified an Env-specific immune response in a macaque. The current study's findings support the possibility that HML-2 viruses were recently or are currently active in rhesus macaques.
Biomedical researchers investigated the role of Enterococcus faecalis in wound infections using a mouse model. They employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of infected and uninfected wounds. The study revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, including dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes that contribute to an anti-inflammatory environment. The researchers found that E. faecalis infection prompted a premature and incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes and modulated M2-like macrophage polarization, inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution.

The study also discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways and promotes anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. The findings suggest that E. faecalis infection induces immunosuppression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, delaying the immune response. The researchers generated a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the host response to persistent E. faecalis wound infection, providing new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections.

The study compared the transcriptomic and cellular communication profiles between uninfected and E. faecalis-infected full-thickness mouse skin wounds at 4 days post-infection. However, the study lacked a reference dataset of uninfected, unwounded dorsal skin transcriptome, which would have allowed for a more comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic changes induced by wounding alone. The researchers reaffirmed the known functions of fibroblasts during uninfected wound healing, consistent with predicted ligand-receptor interactions.

The study highlights the importance of immune cells in wound healing, including their role in eliminating pathogens, promoting keratinocyte and fibroblast activity, and resolving inflammation and tissue repair. The findings provide a foundation for future studies aimed at investigating bacterial factors contributing to wound pathogenesis and understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with delayed healing. Overall, the study offers new insights into the complex interactions between E. faecalis and the host response during wound infections.
Biologists have long known that plants can communicate with each other through the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when attacked by herbivores. These VOCs can trigger defense responses in neighboring plants, but the timing and mechanisms of this phenomenon are not well understood. A recent study used a custom-built mass spectrometry system to investigate the temporal patterns of VOC transfer and response between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants.

The researchers found that continuous exposure to natural blends of VOCs from herbivore-attacked plants resulted in a predictable temporal response pattern in neighboring plants. Specifically, a burst of terpene release occurred at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst was not due to terpene accumulation during the night, but rather coincided with the accumulation of jasmonate, a hormone involved in plant defense, in the receiver plants.

Further experiments revealed that this delayed burst occurred independently of day-night light transitions and was not solely explained by the dynamics of VOC release from the sender plants. Instead, it was found to be the result of a stress memory from VOC exposure during the first day, combined with secondary exposure to bioactive VOCs on the second day.

The study suggests that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced VOCs can result in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This finding provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress VOCs predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, revealing that they can do both in sequence.

The researchers propose several hypotheses to explain the ecological relevance of the clocked temporal kinetics of defense activation in neighboring plants. One possibility is that responding most strongly to VOC cues on the second day may avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. The study also highlights the importance of tracking plant defense responses in real-time as they perceive the dynamic natural VOC blend of herbivore-attacked neighbors.
Biologists have long been interested in understanding the origins of human language and music. A key feature of human language is recursion, or the ability to place a vocal signal inside another of a similar kind. However, there is currently no evidence of recursive vocal patterns in nonhuman primates, suggesting that this ability may be unique to humans.

Recent research has found that wild flanged male orangutans produce long calls that feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences, consistent with two hierarchical strata. This finding is significant because it suggests that recursive vocal structures may have evolved in hominids before the development of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music.

The study analyzed the long calls of flanged male orangutans in the wild and found that three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples. This suggests that the recursive structures in the orangutans' calls were not the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures or anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances.

The discovery of recursive vocal combinatorics in orangutans has implications for our understanding of the evolution of human language. It is possible that recursive vocal structures were first a feature of proto-musical expression in human ancestors, later recruited and "re-engineered" for the generation of linguistic combinatorics. Further studies on primate vocal combinatorics, particularly those that take a structural approach and are conducted in the wild, could help test this idea and provide new insights into the evolution of recursion in the hominid family.

The study's findings also highlight the importance of a structural approach to understanding vocal combinatorics in wild primates. This approach allows researchers to identify signal patterns that were recursive in some degree or kind in an extinct past and molded subsequently into the recursive structures observed today in humans. By examining the vocal patterns of wild great apes, researchers may be able to uncover previously unrecognized bona fide combinatoric possibilities within the human clade.
summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the ongoing battle between viruses and their hosts, which has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life's evolution. A key aspect of this arms race is the interaction between viral receptors and host cells, where viruses exploit cell surface proteins to initiate infection. In a recent study, researchers investigated the relationship between the MDA5 receptor and the 5'ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, Miichthys miiuy.

The study found that the frequent loss of the RIG-I receptor in vertebrates prompted the evolution of alternative immune substitutes, including the homology-dependent genetic compensation response (HDGCR) pathway. Further analysis revealed that the MDA5 receptor in M. miiuy and Gallus gallus, a homolog of RIG-I, can recognize 5'ppp-RNA viruses, potentially leading to the redundancy of RIG-I and its loss from the species genome during evolution.

The researchers also discovered that the 5'ppp-RNA SCRV virus can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, promoting its own replication and immune evasion. This finding highlights the complex arms race between virus replication and the innate immunity of its reservoir hosts in vertebrates.

The study provides valuable insights into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrates and viruses, shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system. The findings suggest that the loss of RIG-I in vertebrates is a widespread event, and that MDA5 has evolved alternative functions to recognize and resist 5'ppp-RNA viruses in the absence of RIG-I. This research offers a new perspective on the evolutionary strategies employed by vertebrates to counter viral infections and highlights the importance of understanding the complex relationships between hosts and viruses.
The study aimed to investigate the relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and body composition in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in a phase IV study and underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix. Body composition parameters, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone turnover markers were evaluated at baseline and after 12 months of ADT.

At baseline, a weak, non-significant relationship was found between FSH serum levels and fat body mass (FBM) at arms and legs. However, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM, fat mass at arms, and fat mass at trunk after 12 months of ADT. An inverse relationship was also found between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio.

The study suggests that FSH serum levels after ADT may have an impact on body composition, particularly on FBM. The findings indicate that FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and guide clinicians in evaluating body composition in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT. The study's results are considered hypothesis-generating and cannot be generalized due to its limitations as an ancillary study.

The study's findings are consistent with previous research showing that FSH levels are associated with increased body weight and visceral adiposity in postmenopausal women. The study's results also support the idea that FSH may play a role in the changes in body composition observed in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential use of FSH as a marker for monitoring body composition in prostate cancer patients. The study was partially funded by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, but the funder had no role in the design, conduct, or analysis of the study.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven effective in preventing SCD. Recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) Ca2+ release channels play a key role in the pathophysiology of SCD.

A study used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic heart failure (HF), including a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. The animals were randomized to receive dantrolene (DS) or placebo in early or chronic HF. The study found that DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function.

The study suggests that inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD.

The study used a pressure overload guinea pig model of HF/SCD with spontaneous arrhythmias, which is characterized by a high incidence of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and VT/VF, leading to SCD in about two-thirds of the animals within 4 weeks. The SCD occurs early on, in the first 2 weeks, over the course of cardiac hypertrophy, even before the heart dilates or progresses into failure. The study found that inhibition of Ca2+ leak via RyR2 pauses the transition to heart failure by reducing cardiac fibrosis, increasing repolarization lability, and decreasing QT heterogeneity, improving chronotropic competency, ultimately improving LV contractility, and mitigating lethal VT/VF.
summary
     Biologists have long known that the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family of proteins, including the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes. However, the specific genes targeted by these proteins have not been well characterized. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates body size through a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. Researchers have now identified functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri in C. elegans using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis. They found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes, with SMA-3 acting as a transcriptional activator and SMA-9 directing both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppressed the small body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size regulation for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11. These findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that regulate the secretion of extracellular components, such as collagen, into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation. The researchers used genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq integrated through a novel software analysis pipeline to untangle the roles of Smad and Schnurri transcription factors in the developing C. elegans larva. They found that SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri have target genes that are co-regulated by both factors, as well as separate target genes that they independently and exclusively regulate. ChIP-seq data demonstrated that 73.7% of SMA-3 binding peaks overlap with SMA-9 binding sites, while approximately half of all SMA-9 binding sites did not overlap with SMA-3 sites. The researchers identified SMA-3 direct targets by comparing differentially expressed genes from the RNA-seq comparison of wild-type versus sma-3 mutants with the genomic coordinates of SMA-3 peaks from the ChIP-seq analysis. They found that SMA-9-exclusive target genes imply Smad-independent roles for SMA-9 in functions such as immunity, which is consistent with the pronounced role of vertebrate Schnurri homologs in immunity.
Biomedical researchers have identified a common feature of metastatic cancers: the expression of the embryonic transcription factor DUX4. DUX4 is found in approximately 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers. In a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients, DUX4 expression was significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and a decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade, a type of immunotherapy. Furthermore, DUX4 expression was a significant predictor of survival, with patients expressing DUX4 having a median reduction in survival of over 1 year compared to those without DUX4 expression.

The study found that DUX4 expression in urothelial carcinoma tumors was linked to an immune-excluded or immune-desert phenotype, where immune cells are excluded from the tumor. This is consistent with previous observations in primary cancers and cancer cell line models. DUX4 expression was also correlated with reduced anti-tumor immunity and decreased patient survival under immunotherapy treatment. The researchers hypothesized that DUX4 expression induces an immunosuppressive gene expression program, which is consistent with its established function in inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling in primary cancers.

The study analyzed five metastatic cancer cohorts and found that urothelial cancers exhibited the highest frequency of DUX4 expression, with 54% of patients expressing DUX4. This suggests that DUX4 may be particularly important in this tumor type. The researchers also demonstrated that the high rates of DUX4 expression observed in metastatic cancers are not due to technical biases introduced by studying formalin-fixed tissues, but rather reflect true DUX4 expression in both primary and metastatic cancers.

Overall, the findings of this study suggest that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic cancers and may be an important driver of immune evasion. The results motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism governing DUX4 de-repression in cancer and to explore the potential of DUX4 as a therapeutic target.
Summary
     Livestock abortion is a significant disease syndrome affecting livestock productivity and public health in Africa. However, there is a lack of data on the causes of livestock abortion, which hinders effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and public health. A surveillance platform was established in Tanzania to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in pastoral, agropastoral, and smallholder systems. Between 2017 and 2019, 215 abortion events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated, with attribution achieved for 19.5% of cases. The study found that delays in obtaining samples significantly affected attribution, and histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system through community-based field officers, practical sample collection, and molecular diagnostic platforms. The findings suggest that livestock abortion surveillance can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses, and identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. The study highlights the utility, acceptability, and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for both syndromic and event-based surveillance, and demonstrates the potential for an effective reporting and investigation system to be operationalized across a range of settings in Tanzania, including remote rural areas. The study's results have implications for establishing a livestock abortion surveillance framework to support evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa. Non-infectious conditions, such as nutritional, metabolic, and toxic conditions, are also likely causes of livestock abortions in Tanzania, and recent stressful events, including drought and wild predator attacks, may play a role in unattributed abortion cases. The study's findings contribute to the limited information available on current practices, effectiveness, and challenges/opportunities of livestock abortion surveillance in low- and middle-income countries.
summary
     Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC), the primary constituent of cigarette smoke, has been shown to increase the abundance and proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in both in vivo and ex vivo studies. This effect is mediated through the activation of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and protein kinase C (PKC), leading to the induction of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs. Notably, this effect was not observed in Paneth cells.

     The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) abolished the effects of NIC on ISCs, suggesting that Notch signaling plays a crucial role in NIC-induced ISC proliferation. Furthermore, NIC was found to enhance in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after the loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, and DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. These findings indicate that NIC triggers a pathway that regulates the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs.

     The study's results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of colon cancer in cigarette smokers. The development of drugs that block the α7-nAChR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling pathways may offer a potential therapeutic strategy for treating colon cancers. The findings also suggest that extrinsic factors, such as NIC, can increase the risk of cancer by promoting stem cell division. The study's model is consistent with DBZ-induced suppression of Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling in ISCs from NIC-treated mice.

     The study's conclusions are supported by the validation that NIC affects ISCs rather than Paneth cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling activated through nAChRα7. The crosstalk between Hippo, Notch, and Wnt signaling regulates mammalian intestinal homeostasis, and the study's findings contribute to the comprehensive knowledge on the pathway by which stem cells respond to NIC, a major component of cigarette smoke. The study suggests an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer.
Biomedical researchers have investigated the role of Hsp70 in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, which is associated with stress, aging, and disease. Hsp70 is a key cellular system that solubilizes aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones, including J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). A recent study has elucidated the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes on Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing.

The study found that Hsp110 plays a major role in the initial stages of disaggregation, determining the final efficacy of the process. Hsp110 catalyzes the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto the aggregate surface, modifying aggregates into smaller species that are more readily processed by chaperones. The study also showed that Hsp110 stimulation of Hsp70 is stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif.

Furthermore, the study demonstrated for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. This destabilization of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface may improve disaggregation but also lead to inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. The study suggests that a balanced interplay between co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential.

The researchers found that Hsp110-dependent stimulation of disaggregation is limited to its initial stages, including chaperone recruitment to aggregates and their disassembly, but not final protein folding. The initial Hsp110-dependent loading of more Hsp70 onto aggregates correlates with their remodelling into smaller aggregated species, which improves their recognition by the Hsp104 disaggregase. The study also showed that the positive effect of the Hsp110 NEF on protein recovery from aggregates is substantially more pronounced when the Hsp70 chaperone system comprises a class B JDP. Theoretically, the stimulation by Hsp110 might occur at one or many stages of protein disaggregation, starting from the association of the Hsp70 system with an aggregate surface, through polypeptide disentanglement, to the final folding of the released substrate.
Biomedical researchers have long used gait analysis to diagnose and monitor musculoskeletal conditions, such as knee arthropathy. However, traditional gait analysis methods rely on subjective visual observation and are limited by the need for expensive equipment, large facilities, and highly trained staff. To address these challenges, scientists have explored the use of wearable digital insoles, which are relatively low-cost and can provide objective gait data. In a recent study, researchers demonstrated that a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures can yield similar results to the clinical gait-lab standard.

The researchers constructed a machine learning model trained on force plate data collected from participants with knee arthropathy and controls. The model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (auROC) of 0.86 and an area under the precision-recall curve (auPR) of 0.90. The model also performed well on a separate, independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects, with an auROC of 0.83 and an auPR of 0.86.

To further validate the use of digital insoles, the researchers showed that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject, highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics. This work provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods and adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding wearable technology analytical pipelines.

The study also aimed to quantify how well force plate data can identify disease using gait signatures and to understand if a wearable insole could detect similar characterizations. To differentiate controls versus knee arthropathies using vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) data, the researchers divided the complete vGRF force plate dataset into a training/validation set and a test set and trained a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict these classes.

The researchers also clinically validated the measurement of gait with digital insoles in those with knee arthropathy through the development of a novel machine learning framework for application within digital insoles to detect knee arthropathy status and processed digital insole-derived gait outcomes and raw sensor signals to identify disease-specific gait patterns in knee arthroscopy. The study found that an SVM model trained only on force plate data performed as well on the digital insole data as it did on the hold-out force plate test data, with an auROC of 0.93 and an auPR of 0.94. A potential benefit of a digital insole relative to a force plate is that many more variables can be derived, thus enabling a more comprehensive assessment of gait.
Biomedical researchers have identified a potential non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain using a human amniotic membrane (AM) product called Clarix Flo (FLO). FLO, a naturally derived biologic from human birth tissues, was found to attenuate established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity in mice without causing the severe side effects associated with opioid analgesics. The researchers isolated the major matrix component of FLO, known as heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3), which exhibited greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated the pain-inhibiting effects of FLO and was found to directly inhibit nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways.

The study used cultured DRG neurons to examine the receptor mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in neuron inhibition by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. The results showed that HC-HA/PTX3 induced an acute cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibition of sodium and calcium currents in a CD44-dependent manner. This suggests that HC-HA/PTX3 is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. The researchers also found that HC-HA/PTX3 may attenuate the activation of key receptors involved in pain control, such as TRPV1, TRPA1, and MrgprD, and fundamentally decrease nociceptor excitability by inducing membrane hyperpolarization and altering intrinsic membrane properties.

The findings of this study highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. HC-HA/PTX3, in particular, shows promise as a promising non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain due to its ability to inhibit pain behavior and its higher purity and greater water solubility compared to FLO. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of action of HC-HA/PTX3 and to explore its potential as a treatment for post-surgical pain in humans.
Biomedical researchers have investigated the relationship between the pigmentation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and their functional characteristics. RPE cells, derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-RPE), were analyzed for their color intensity and gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. The Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System (ALPS) was used to photograph each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis. The results showed that the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells did not correlate with specific gene expression profiles. This suggests that the color of RPE cells may not be a reliable indicator of their functional characteristics.

Further analysis of the transcriptome of iPSC-RPE cells revealed that the degree of pigmentation is dynamically regulated in each cell, and there is a time-lag between mRNA expression, production of enzymes, and synthesis of melanin. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that the degree of pigmentation is not strongly correlated with the expression levels of RPE markers. However, a weak correlation was found between the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells and gene sets related to retinoid recycling, which is an important feature of RPE cells to supply the photoreceptor with retinal.

Previous studies have also suggested that in vitro pigmentation of stem cell-derived RPE cells may not necessarily reflect their levels of functional maturation. For example, bone marrow-derived RPE cells that are poorly pigmented in vitro become highly pigmented when transplanted, and iPSC-RPE cells that are not pigmented when prepared become heavily pigmented after engraftment. These findings imply that the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition and not a strong indicator of their functional characteristics. Overall, the results of this study highlight the complexity of RPE cell biology and the need for further investigation into the relationship between pigmentation and function in these cells.
Summary: 
     The field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) has emerged as a pivotal model for this effort due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this critical gap, researchers developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ), a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets. MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting. The apparatus also provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism. The MarmoAAP and associated automated cooperative pulling paradigm are expected to make a significant contribution to the study of marmoset social behaviors in the field. The combination of a highly modular and adaptable design, high-resolution behavioral data, and integration with neural recordings positions the paradigm as a robust and versatile tool for unraveling the complexities of primate behavior. By incorporating behavioral metrics from video and audio recordings with the timing of marmosets’ pulling behaviors and reward delivery, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between behavior, vocal communication, and cooperative interactions in this species. MarmoAAP significantly increases the number of trials available for analysis and thus ensures ample statistical power when investigating the relationship between neural activity and behaviors. The apparatus and associated behavioral paradigms create an avenue for simultaneous neural recordings while freely moving marmosets are engaged in tasks implemented by MarmoAAP.
Biomedical researchers investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the developing offspring's genome regulation. They used a mouse model that mimics common patterns of alcohol consumption during human pregnancy. The study found that early moderate PAE affected DNA methylation in newborn pups, but did not alter behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed that DNA methylation changes were mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations occurring as early as gastrulation. These changes were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential, suggesting broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation.

The researchers replicated their findings in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and found that some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits, including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. The study also showed that a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation.

The researchers used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to assess CpG DNA methylation in newborn brain and liver, two target organs affected by ethanol. They found that regions identified as sensitive to gestational alcohol exposure were replicated in human cohorts. The exposure period covered the equivalent of pre-conception up until the first trimester in humans, reflecting a typical situation in which women may consume alcohol up until pregnancy recognition.

The primary outcome of the study was differences in offspring DNA methylation, and secondary outcomes included behavioral deficits across neurodevelopmental domains relevant to FASD. The researchers also conducted candidate gene testing of regions identified in prior studies as sensitive to early moderate PAE. In a validation study, DNA methylation array data from 147 newborn buccal swabs from the Asking Questions About Alcohol in Pregnancy (AQUA) cohort were used to compare 'never exposed' newborns to 'any exposure' and found no evidence of differential DNA methylation at specific CpG sites.

The study suggests that early moderate exposure to alcohol is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation, even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes. The findings highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions, such as a diet high in folate and choline, to protect against some of the damaging effects of PAE on DNA methylation.
summary
     Biologists have long considered all genes to be equivalent targets for RNA interference (RNAi), a process in which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is used to silence gene expression. However, research in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has revealed that some regulators of RNAi can selectively impair the silencing of certain genes. A new study has identified an intersecting network of regulators, including the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3, which work together to silence genes with differences in their RNA metabolism.

The study found that any two of these regulators are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene. Notably, the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. The researchers used quantitative models and simulations to explore the dynamics of RNAi and found that changing the cis-regulatory elements of a target gene can reduce its dependence on NRDE-3. They also discovered that animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells and that cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within 'pUG zones' matching the dsRNA.

These findings suggest that crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs. The study used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to examine how differences between target genes and reliance on specific regulators contribute to the efficacy and resistance of RNAi. The researchers characterized the skeletal pathway required for gene silencing in response to the addition of dsRNA and found that the requirement for NRDE-3 but not for MUT-16 or RDE-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA.

A dynamic model of RNA changes during silencing by dsRNA revealed several criteria for efficient RNA silencing. The study also found that similar mechanisms could be used to generate other 22G RNAs that are independent of RDE-10. The findings have implications for the use of RNAi as a tool for gene silencing in plants, insects, and humans, and suggest that gene-specific factors can influence the functional outcome of RNAi. Future studies are needed to test each aspect of the model and explore the molecular mechanism of RNAi in more detail.
Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms of tuberculous meningitis (TBM), a severe form of tuberculosis that affects the brain and spinal cord. A recent study published in a scientific journal aimed to identify genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality. The researchers analyzed whole-blood RNA sequencing data from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and 30 healthy controls.

The study used weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality. The analysis revealed distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. The researchers also employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, followed by logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose the best predictors.

The study found that increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. The researchers identified four hub genes—MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4—that were strong predictors of TBM mortality.

The study also highlighted differences in the pathways involved in TBM mortality between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. In HIV-positive adults, death was associated with increased expression of angiogenesis genes, while in HIV-negative adults, it was associated with TNF signaling and downregulated extracellular matrix organization. The researchers identified a four-gene signature as a potential host response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status.

The study's findings suggest that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death. The researchers believe that these findings offer insights for potential therapeutic targets and a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes. The study's results have significant implications for the development of new treatments and diagnostic tools for TBM.
summary
     Biomedical research relies heavily on antibodies to detect and characterize proteins, but many commercial antibodies fail to recognize their intended targets. To assess the scope of the problem, researchers developed a standardized characterization approach to evaluate the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 neuroscience-related proteins. The study found that more than 50% of the antibodies failed in one or more applications, such as Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. However, around 50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, suggesting that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant.

The researchers used parental and knockout cell lines to assess the performance of the antibodies and found that recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The study also identified hundreds of underperforming antibodies that had been used in published articles, highlighting the need for more rigorous antibody validation. Encouragingly, many manufacturers reassessed these underperforming antibodies and made changes to their recommended usage or removed them from the market.

The study provides an unbiased and scalable analytical framework for representing and comparing antibody performance, estimating the coverage of human proteins with renewable antibodies, and assessing the scientific value of common antibody characterization methods. The researchers tested 614 commercially available antibodies targeting 65 proteins and found that approximately two-thirds of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, and half was covered by at least one high-performing renewable antibody. This suggests that coverage of human proteins by high-performing antibodies is significant.

The study's findings inform a strategy to identify renewable antibodies for all human proteins by mining the existing commercial antibody repertoire and using the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts. The raw data from the study are openly available, providing a valuable resource for the research community. Overall, the study highlights the importance of rigorous antibody validation and provides a step toward a comprehensive and standardized ecosystem to validate commercial antibodies.
Biomedical researchers have long sought the ability to independently control gene expression in multiple tissues within the same animal, particularly in the context of inter-organ communication studies. To address this need, scientists have developed technologies that combine the GAL4/UAS system with a second binary expression system, such as the LexA system or QF system. A new resource has been created to facilitate the combined use of these systems in various Drosophila tissues. This resource includes a set of over 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions generated by CRISPR knock-in, which have been verified for tissue specificity in larvae. Additionally, constructs have been built that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector. These constructs can be integrated into the fly genome, allowing for the isolation of fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Furthermore, new compatible shRNA vectors have been evaluated for in vivo gene knockdown, and a library of such RNAi fly lines is being generated as a community resource. This new set of tools will enable researchers to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal. The LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will greatly expand the ability of Drosophila researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously. By combining the GAL4/UAS system with the LexA or QF system, researchers can now study complex biological processes, such as inter-organ communication, with greater precision and control. This resource is expected to have a significant impact on the field of Drosophila research, enabling new discoveries and a deeper understanding of gene function and regulation.
The transcription factor Bcl11b plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Recent studies have shown that Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is essential for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Bcl11b's function remained unclear.

     Researchers have identified a synaptic organizer molecule called C1ql2 as a direct functional target of Bcl11b. C1ql2 regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Furthermore, the study found that C1ql2 exerts its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 (25b+).

     The researchers demonstrated that interruption of the C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+) interaction by expressing a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or deleting Nrxn3 in dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b and C1ql2 mutant phenotypes. This suggests that the C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent signaling pathway is essential for the control of mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function.

     Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that Bcl11b is essential for synapse function in the mossy fiber circuit of the adult murine hippocampus. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Bcl11b's function remained unclear.

     The study identifies a novel Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent regulatory mechanism that is essential for the control of mossy fiber synapse function. The researchers found that conditional ablation of Bcl11b in the adult hippocampus leads to structural and functional changes of mossy fiber synapses, characterized by an overall reduction in synapse numbers, loss of bouton complexity, and loss of long-term potentiation.

     Reintroduction of the synaptic organizer protein C1ql2, which is a direct transcriptional target of Bcl11b and is downregulated in Bcl11b mutant dentate gyrus granule neurons, restored the structural and functional properties of mossy fiber synapses. This study provides important insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. The identification of the Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent signaling pathway may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for these disorders.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries must communicate effectively to function as an integrated system. The zinc-finger protein Sfp1, known to regulate the transcription of proliferation-related genes, plays a crucial role in this communication. Sfp1 can regulate transcription by binding to promoters, similar to most known transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions of genes, also known as gene bodies. The study found that Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects the configuration of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), leading to dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking.

     Further investigation revealed that Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1's dissociation from chromatin. Notably, Sfp1's dissociation from chromatin correlates with the extent of backtracked Pol II. The study proposes that Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking following promoter recruitment. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1's relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability.

     Sfp1's co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs. The interplay between Sfp1's two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined. Sfp1 impacts the mRNA life cycle, from transcription to degradation, and its effect on transcription elongation is linked to its function on mRNA stabilization. The study suggests that Sfp1's functions are connected, and its binding to gene bodies correlates with Pol II occupancy in all genes.

     The study also found that Sfp1 alters elongating Pol II in the context of Rpb4 and affects backtracking, leading to increased backtracking frequency. The binding of Sfp1 to gene bodies correlates with Pol II activity, particularly within CRAC+ genes. This indicates that Sfp1's function in a subset of its target genes extends beyond transcription initiation and encompasses transcription elongation. The interaction of Sfp1 with chromatin has an effect on both Pol II elongation and mRNA half-lives, suggesting a mechanistic linkage. Backtracking is associated with co-transcriptional binding of Sfp1 to nascent RNA, and RiBi genes that exhibit Sfp1-dependent backtracking also imprint Sfp1. In addition, Sfp1 binds a subpopulation of mRNAs whose transcription is stimulated by Sfp1, known as CRAC+ mRNAs.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that programmed cell death (PCD) plays a crucial role in plant development and reproduction. A recent study investigated the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. The researchers focused on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1.

     The study found that mutations in both SMB and BFN1 regulators increased colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. The smb-3 mutants exhibited hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay in S. indica-induced root-growth promotion. This suggests that root cap PCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root.

     Reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells. This indicates a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots. The researchers propose that a tight regulation of host PCD and rapid clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem.

     The study also showed that S. indica downregulates BFN1 in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. This suggests that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant PCD processes to enhance host colonization. The researchers propose that some adapted microbes manipulate host PCD processes by affecting the transcriptional expression of BFN1 to facilitate accommodation in the root.

     Transcriptome analysis was performed to track developmental cell death-marker gene expression during different colonization stages. The major regulator in LRCs, SMB, showed no significant changes in expression during fungal colonization. However, in Arabidopsis colonized by S. indica, there was a significant decrease in BFN1 expression observed after 6 days post-inoculation (dpi). The study suggests that BFN1 expression and nuclear localization in the root cap or xylem was not affected by S. indica colonization.

     Overall, the study highlights the complex relationship between PCD and microbial accommodation in roots. The findings suggest that beneficial microbes can modify plant PCD processes to enhance host colonization, and that a tight regulation of host PCD and rapid clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem.
summary
     Biomedical research has identified large vesicle extrusion from neurons, known as exophers, as a potential contributor to neurodegenerative diseases. Exophers can spread pathogenic protein aggregates and trigger inflammatory responses. However, the factors that regulate exopher production are not well understood. A recent study investigated the role of mechanical force in exopher extrusion from neurons in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans).

     The study found that mechanical force can significantly enhance exopher production from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period.

     Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. The study also found that genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths, while interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths.

     The research suggests that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. The study's findings draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.

     The study also investigated the role of fertilized eggs in exopher production and found that the presence of fertilized eggs is not required for exophergenesis. Instead, the mechanical force of uterine occupation, including the presence of oocytes, dead eggs, or fluid, can induce exopher production. The study used RNAi knockdown approaches to test the impact of embryonic development genes on neuronal exopher levels and found that egg retention can induce high exopher production, regardless of the expression levels of exogenous proteins in the ALMR neuron.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of exopher production and highlights the potential importance of mechanical signaling in neurodegenerative disease. The findings suggest that the mechanical force of uterine occupation can potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons, contributing to the spread of pathogenic protein aggregates and inflammatory responses.
Biomedical research has identified a potential link between the Wnt signaling pathway and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) has been found to colocalize with amyloid plaques in AD patients. To investigate the role of DKK3 in AD, researchers examined its expression and function in healthy and AD brains.

The study found that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD subjects and that its protein levels increase at early stages of the disease. In mouse models of AD, extracellular DKK3 levels are elevated, and the protein accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. Functionally, DKK3 was shown to trigger the loss of excitatory synapses through the blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling pathway, while simultaneously increasing inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway.

In contrast, knocking down DKK3 in mouse models of AD restored synapse number and improved memory. The researchers also found that DKK3 regulates the stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus through different signaling pathways. Furthermore, knocking down DKK3 in mouse models of AD ameliorated changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse number in the hippocampus, both before and after plaque deposition.

The study suggests that DKK3 is a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD. Synapse loss is a key feature of AD, and the mechanisms that trigger this loss are not well understood. The findings of this study provide new insights into the role of DKK3 in AD and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of the disease. Overall, the research supports the hypothesis that DKK3 is a key contributor to synaptic changes in AD and that its loss-of-function can ameliorate synaptic defects in mouse models of the disease.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have been searching for new ways to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One approach is to identify natural compounds produced by microbes that can inhibit the growth of pathogens. A recent study focused on pyoverdines, iron-chelating compounds produced by certain species of Pseudomonas bacteria found in the environment. These compounds have been shown to have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens.

     The study involved screening 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates against 12 human pathogens, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The researchers found several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced the growth of these pathogens in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner.

     The study also demonstrated that pyoverdine increased the survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Furthermore, experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. This suggests that pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens.

     The researchers propose that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. could be potent agents to reduce the growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition. They screened pyoverdines from a library of 320 environmental Pseudomonas strains isolated from soil and freshwater habitats for their activity against 12 strains of human opportunistic bacteria. For the most promising pyoverdine candidates, they elucidated the chemical structure to assess diversity and understand the chemical properties important for iron competition.

     The study applies the concept of siderophore-mediated iron competition observed in natural communities to human opportunistic pathogens. Pyoverdines, a class of siderophores with high iron affinity, are produced and secreted by fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. When administered as treatment to infected G. mellonella larvae, the researchers observed significantly increased host survival rates in infections with A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, demonstrating that pyoverdine exhibits antibacterial activity in hosts. Overall, the results suggest that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how disruptions in synaptic function contribute to the development of schizophrenia, a complex mental disorder characterized by failures in prefrontal networks. A key gap in current knowledge is the lack of understanding of how synaptic-level disruptions lead to network-level failures. To address this question, a team of researchers developed a computational model of prefrontal local circuits to investigate the link between NMDA receptor (NMDAR) synaptic function and oscillatory spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia.

The model revealed that the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influences oscillatory spike synchrony. Specifically, reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, such as those that occur during behavior. This finding parallels the dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this synchrony by administration of NMDAR antagonists.

Results from the study establish a theoretical basis and circuit mechanism explaining how reduction of NMDAR synaptic function implicated in schizophrenia could lead to the desynchronization of neural activity in prefrontal recurrent circuits. The model shows that spiking networks situated close to a boundary in the synaptic parameter space separating asynchronous and synchronous activity states can explain a variety of biological observations. Notably, reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents these networks from transitioning into oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, thereby preventing the emergence of 0-lag spike synchrony.

This study builds upon prior modeling work that has addressed the relationship between NMDAR function and oscillatory activity in prefrontal networks. However, these studies did not address the specific topic of how slow NMDAR recurrent excitation and external input jointly influence spike timing dynamics at the neuron level and oscillatory dynamics at the population level in the presence of fast AMPA. The current study provides new insights into the circuit mechanisms responsible for the link between NMDAR synaptic malfunction and neural dynamics, including the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking between individual prefrontal neurons and the failure of synchronous spiking to emerge when NMDAR synaptic currents are reduced.
Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the process of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones. A crucial step in this process is the differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication. However, the dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are not yet fully understood.

    A recent study used a controlled experimental angiogenesis model combined with mathematical and computational analyses to investigate the spatial patterning of Tip and Stalk cell differentiation. The researchers found that the regular spatial patterning of Tip and Stalk cells can undergo an order-disorder transition at a relatively high input level of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. This transition results in a robust but temporally unstable differentiation of cells, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions.

    The study also found that sprouts form in a manner that maximizes their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. The researchers suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation that enables but does not instruct subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis, which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms.

    The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex process of angiogenesis and the role of NOTCH signaling in cell differentiation. The researchers propose a dynamic view of angiogenic induction, where VEGF input can induce NOTCH signaling and formation of Tip cells that can behave as mini-sprouts. The study also highlights the importance of considering the interconnections between biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-Stalk fate in future models of angiogenesis.

    The study's mathematical model was calibrated to match the experimentally observed Tip-Stalk fractions at a VEGF input of 100 ng/ml. The researchers quantified the spatial patterning characteristics of the inferred positions of the Tip cells in the experimental angiogenesis model and found that the model's predictions were consistent with experimental observations. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of complex multicellular processes, including collective epithelial migration, and highlight the need for more refined models that integrate biochemical and mechanical regulation of cell fate.
The locus coeruleus (LC), a small region in the brain, plays a crucial role in learning and memory, particularly in the hippocampus. However, the exact timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and the specific neurotransmitters involved in memory formation in the hippocampus are not well understood. Traditionally, the LC is thought to modulate neural activity through the release of norepinephrine, but recent studies suggest it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. In some cases, dopamine release from the LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine.

    Researchers investigated the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. They found that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. The study also demonstrated that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus, and the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity.

    The results suggest that LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning-related events and that this LC activation can enhance long-term memory formation. However, it remains unclear which neurotransmitter the LC releases into the hippocampus during these responses. The study provides direct evidence that LC activity increases both dopamine and norepinephrine content in the hippocampus and shows that dopamine release is important for trace fear memory formation, but the release of norepinephrine is not.

    The findings indicate that the release of dopamine from the LC enhances learning-related plasticity in regions supporting trace fear conditioning. The LC and its interaction with the hippocampus are known to be critical for hippocampus-dependent memory formation, but the precise temporal dynamics of learning-related LC and LC-HPC activity remain poorly understood. This study provides new insights into the role of the LC in learning and memory and highlights the importance of dopamine release in the hippocampus for memory formation.
