     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the mechanisms underlying cell-fate reprogramming, the process by which one cell type is converted into another. A recent study in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has shed new light on this process, revealing an unexpected role for the Notch signaling pathway in promoting reprogramming of germ cells into somatic cells.

     In C. elegans, the Notch signaling pathway, mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, is known to maintain the undifferentiated state of germline stem cells and progenitors. However, this study found that increased GLP-1/Notch signaling actually facilitates the reprogramming of germ cells into somatic cells, a process that requires chromatin perturbation.

     Through a combination of genetic, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, the researchers identified a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. They found that GLP-1/Notch signaling activates specific genes that are silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a chromatin regulator that maintains gene silencing.

     The study also identified the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target that facilitates reprogramming. UTX-1 is a key regulator of gene expression, and its activation by GLP-1/Notch signaling is essential for the reprogramming process.

     Notably, the researchers found that GLP-1/Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions, with GLP-1/Notch promoting reprogramming and PRC2 maintaining the undifferentiated state of germline stem cells and progenitors. This antagonistic relationship is supported by the observation that many genes activated by GLP-1/Notch signaling are also repressed by PRC2.

     The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of development and disease. Abnormal Notch signaling has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The discovery of a reprogramming-promoting role for GLP-1/Notch signaling in C. elegans provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying these diseases and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

     Biomedical research has identified the adaptor protein SKAP2 as a crucial component in the defense against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) infections. K. pneumoniae is a pathogen that affects the respiratory, blood, liver, and bladder systems and poses a significant clinical concern. Studies have shown that mice lacking SKAP2 (Skap2-/-) have a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice when infected with K. pneumoniae (ATCC 43816). SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, is essential for controlling the bacterial burden. Neutrophils from Skap2-/- mice are present in infected lungs and degranulate normally in response to K. pneumoniae infection. However, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to K. pneumoniae is abolished in Skap2-/- neutrophils.

     Further investigation revealed that K. pneumoniae-induced ROS production in neutrophils requires the activity of several key proteins, including Src family kinases (SFKs), Syk, Btk, PLCγ2, and PKC. The loss of SKAP2 significantly hinders the phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2, indicating that SKAP2 is proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways. This suggests that SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K. pneumoniae-activated ROS production and promoting bacterial clearance during infection.

     The sensitivity of K. pneumoniae to ROS is supported by increased bacterial burden in mice lacking the gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase (Cybb-/-) and observations in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients. SKAP2 is required for full phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2 in murine neutrophils, demonstrating a critical role in K. pneumoniae-induced signaling pathways required for ROS production. These findings indicate that SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for host defense against K. pneumoniae infections.
Biomedical researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand the role of the hypnozoite reservoir in the transmission of Plasmodium vivax malaria. The hypnozoite reservoir is a group of latent liver-stage parasites that can reactivate weeks to months after the initial infection, causing new blood-stage infections and contributing to the spread of the disease.

The researchers created a within-host model of liver-stage hypnozoites, which was validated against data from tropical strains of P. vivax. This model demonstrated that the hypnozoite reservoir is over-dispersed, meaning that many individuals have few or no hypnozoites, while some have intensely infected livers. The model also showed that individuals with more hypnozoites are more likely to experience relapses and contribute to the transmission of P. vivax.

The researchers then embedded the within-host model into a P. vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death. The model predicted that incorporating hypnozoite-killing drugs, such as primaquine, into first-line treatment regimens would cause substantial reductions in P. vivax transmission. This is because individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.

Relapse infections caused by the activation of hypnozoites in the liver have significant consequences for the transmission dynamics of P. vivax. In the absence of effective diagnostics for detecting liver-stage parasites, models like the one developed by the researchers will play a crucial role in estimating and predicting the effectiveness of interventions that target the hypnozoite reservoir.

Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver. However, the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P. vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection or as up to two broods of hypnozoites. Mathematical models of malaria transmission that account for P. vivax relapses can provide valuable insights into the impact of malaria control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector, the blood, and the liver.

The researchers' within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes demonstrated that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate. This model was integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P. vivax malaria.

Biomedical researchers have long used neurosphere formation as a marker for neural stem cell (NSC) function. However, the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs) and NSCs has remained unclear. A recent study aimed to prospectively identify and isolate adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) NICs. Using flow cytometry, the researchers identified a specific cell population, referred to as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− (GEPCOT) cells. These cells were found to be highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo, based on fate-mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 and Dlx1CreERT2.

In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent, expressed higher levels of Glast, and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2. Pre-GEPCOT cells were unable to form neurospheres but expressed stem cell markers such as Slc1a3-CreERT, GFAP-CreERT2, Sox2CreERT2, and Gli1CreERT2, and were long-lived in the SVZ. The researchers found that GEPCOT NICs were highly enriched for multipotent NICs and were highly mitotically active in vivo, but persisted only transiently in the SVZ. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were unable to form neurospheres and were long-lived in the SVZ.

Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted both pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, although pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent on Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a (p16Ink4a) repression. The study's findings distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo. The researchers identified two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of neural stem/progenitor cells from the adult mouse SVZ. GEPCOT cells were highly enriched for NICs and were highly mitotically active in vivo, while pre-GEPCOT cells were unable to form neurospheres but expressed stem cell markers and were long-lived in the SVZ.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have investigated the properties of Piezo1 ion channels, which are responsible for sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the structure of Piezo1 was found to be bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature. This suggests that Piezo1 ion channels may interact functionally and influence each other's spatial distribution.

     To examine this further, the researchers used cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to study Piezo1 ion channels in cells expressing the channels at low and high levels. The results showed that the density of Piezo1 ion channels had no effect on their pressure sensitivity or open probability, even at non-physiological densities that would cause significant overlap between channels.

     The researchers also used stochastic simulations to model the spatial distribution of Piezo1 ion channels. These simulations, combined with the electrophysiological data, revealed that Piezo1 ion channels behave as independent mechanotransducers at densities likely to be physiologically relevant. This means that Piezo1 channels do not have a strong tendency to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other's mechanical sensitivity.

     This property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane. Cells are constantly exposed to mechanical forces and have evolved diverse molecular mechanisms to detect these forces. Piezo1 is a mechanically gated cation channel that directly senses membrane tension with high sensitivity. The researchers propose that the independent behavior of Piezo1 ion channels enables cells to transduce mechanical forces with high spatial homogeneity.

     The study provides new insights into the properties of Piezo1 ion channels and their role in mechanotransduction. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells sense and respond to mechanical forces, and may contribute to the development of new treatments for diseases related to mechanotransduction dysfunction.
Biomedical research has long suggested that decisions are made through the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. In perception, this mechanism explains how the strength of a stimulus, characterized by its signal-to-noise ratio, affects decision speed, accuracy, and confidence. A recent study aimed to test the predictions of this mechanism by introducing a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex.

The study used a well-studied motion task and verified the effect of the manipulation by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of macaque monkeys. The results showed that increasing the noise, or volatility, of the momentary evidence bearing on a decision led to faster decisions and greater confidence in both humans and monkeys. Notably, the accuracy of the decisions was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model.

To test the influence of volatility on decision-making, the researchers applied a manipulation that changed the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus. They verified that the manipulation had the desired properties by recording from direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of the macaque visual cortex. These areas are known to represent the momentary evidence in tasks similar to the one used in the study.

The study used a reaction-time version of the random-dot motion discrimination task to examine the relationship between volatility and decision speed. Three human participants and one macaque completed a large number of trials, and the results showed that increasing volatility led to faster decisions and greater confidence, with minimal impairment in accuracy. The findings support the predictions of the bounded evidence accumulation model and provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of decision-making under uncertainty. The study's results have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes sensory information and makes decisions in the presence of noise.
summary
     The insulin-like signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans maintains a relatively short lifespan by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors in mammalian cells. DAF-16 is phosphorylated by AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin, a PP2B phosphatase, also limits the lifespan of C. elegans, but its mechanism of action was previously unknown. This study shows that TAX-6•CNB-1, the C. elegans Calcineurin ortholog, and UNC-43, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII) ortholog, regulate lifespan through DAF-16. UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting its nuclear localization, while TAX-6•CNB-1 removes the phosphoryl group, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, resulting in DAF-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin. The study found that UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 regulate C. elegans lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16. The data suggest that CAMKII (UNC-43) and Calcineurin (TAX-6•CNB-1) extend or shorten the lifespan of C. elegans by phosphorylating or de-phosphorylating serine 286 of DAF-16. The direct, antagonistic nature of these two enzymes raises the possibility that they would constitutively negate each other and have no control over DAF-16. However, the insulin signaling pathway appears to dominate in conditions where there is a conflict between IIS and CAMKII/Calcineurin signaling toward DAF-16. The study also found that multiple signaling pathways, including insulin/IGF-1 signaling, germline signaling, mitochondrial signaling, and dietary restriction, regulate aging in C. elegans. The insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, which includes the upstream insulin/IGF-1 receptor DAF-2 and the downstream FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, is the best characterized. The study provides new insights into the regulation of DAF-16 by insulin signaling, UNC-43 (CAMKII), and TAX-6•CNB-1 (Calcineurin) in C. elegans.

     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how the nervous system organizes motor sequences, or the series of movements that occur in a specific order. A recent study in fruit flies, or Drosophila, has shed light on this process by examining how these insects groom their bodies with sequential movements. The researchers found that the motor programs responsible for cleaning individual body parts are organized into a suppression hierarchy, where the motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. This means that cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program, which in turn relieves suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy.

     To study this process, the researchers used genetically targeted activation of neural subsets to drive distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. They found that dust on the body elicits different independently evoked cleaning motor programs for five body parts that progress in series. By controlling each cleaning motor program, the researchers demonstrated that they are organized into a suppression hierarchy.

     A computational model was also developed to demonstrate how a suppression hierarchy can mediate the sequential selection of the cleaning motor programs. This model suggests that the evolutionarily ancient ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence. The study's findings provide the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences.

     The researchers anticipate that identifying the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and determining how these circuitries interact will reveal how the serial organization of grooming behavior is encoded in the nervous system through a hierarchical suppression mechanism. This study contributes to our understanding of how the nervous system organizes motor sequences and has implications for understanding the neural basis of behavior in other animals. The findings also highlight the importance of hierarchical suppression in the emergence of sequential behavior.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how cells ensure accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis I in oocytes. A key process is the coordination between cohesion resolution and kinetochore-microtubule interactions, which is regulated by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). However, how these processes are coordinated remains unclear. A recent study has identified Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) as a regulatory platform that coordinates essential cell cycle processes during meiosis I in oocytes.

     Sgol2 plays a crucial role in turning off the SAC, promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, facilitating the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments (K-fibers), and limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2's ability to protect cohesin and silence the SAC depends on its interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). In contrast, its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by the recruitment of the kinesin MCAK and the inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity, respectively.

     The study found that Sgol2 helps to silence the SAC by binding directly to PP2A and the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) protein Mad2. Sgol2 also moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting MCAK to kinetochores and likely promotes K-fiber formation by down-regulating Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores. Depletion of Sgol2 in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences, including inefficient SAC silencing, increased bivalent stretching, and alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments.

     The study demonstrates that Sgol2's multiple interactions link many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation. A single protein, Sgol2, regulates sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and Aurora B/C kinases. The study also shows that different point mutations in Sgol2 alter the regulation of some but not other processes, indicating that the pleiotropy observed in Sgol2-deficient oocytes is not due to secondary or tertiary pathology.

     Furthermore, the study found that Sgol2's ability to protect centromeric cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A. However, Sgol2's deficiency causes striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics, suggesting that Sgol2 has additional functions beyond protecting cohesin. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Sgol2 as a regulatory platform that coordinates essential cell cycle processes during meiosis I in oocytes.
summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of RNA localization and protein synthesis in the persistence of experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity. Recent studies have shown that local translation plays a crucial role in altering the structure and function of synapses during synapse formation and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. A new study investigated whether local stimulation also triggers the directed trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses. The study used imaging techniques to observe RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons and found that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron, but translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. This suggests that spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than directing the delivery of mRNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues.

     The study also investigated the mechanisms that trigger local translation and found a role for calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling. Netrin-1 is a protein that is released from synapses during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity, and the study found that its release triggers translation at sites of synaptic but not non-synaptic contacts. The researchers tested this idea by incubating Aplysia sensory-motor neuronal cultures with recombinant Fc-netrin-1 and found that it indeed regulates the synthesis of localized transcripts.

     The study's findings suggest that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is primarily mediated at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. This is in contrast to previous studies that have reported that activity can regulate the localization of mRNAs within neurons. The study's results indicate that local translation is a key mechanism for regulating gene expression in response to local cues, and that netrin-1/DCC signaling plays a crucial role in this process. Further research is needed to validate the idea that mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuronal arbor, but the study's findings provide new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity.
Biomedical researchers have developed a new method to study how cells interact and organize into complex patterns and structures during development. This process, called morphogenesis, is crucial for the formation of tissues and organs in the human body. However, current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over the emergence of different cell types and the ability to selectively perturb specific cell subpopulations.

     To address this limitation, scientists employed an inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension. By creating mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system, researchers induced mosaic knockdown (KD) of specific genes, such as ROCK1 and CDH1, which are involved in cell-cell adhesion and cortical tension.

     The results showed that mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 led to differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. The induction of mosaic KD stimulated a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations, which stabilized in coordination with observed self-organization. This approach enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, facilitating a better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis.

     The study demonstrates a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations and control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells. This method has the potential to create robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation. By selectively perturbing specific cell subpopulations, researchers can gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying morphogenic events, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of human development and disease.
Biomedical researchers have long observed that the precision of visual working memory (VWM) decreases as the number of items to be remembered increases. A new study proposes a normative theory to explain this phenomenon, known as the set size effect. The theory suggests that the brain aims to minimize a weighted sum of two costs: an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost.

    The researchers developed a model based on this theory and found that it accurately predicts the set size effects observed in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Notably, the model shows that the effects of set size on encoding precision are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model also accounts for the non-monotonic relationship between set size and the total amount of resource invested in item encoding.

    The study's findings suggest that cognitive limitations in VWM may arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints. The theory may apply beyond working memory tasks, potentially explaining set size effects in attention tasks as well. The researchers propose that the selectivity of attention arises from a need to balance performance against the costs associated with neural activity.

    The model was tested on data from nine previous experiments and found to account well for the effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision. The study also predicts a non-monotonic relationship between population-level spiking activity and set size, which can be tested using neuroimaging experiments. Furthermore, the theory makes predictions about the effects of incentive manipulations on encoding precision, as such manipulations affect the expected behavioral cost function.

    The study's findings have implications for our understanding of cognitive limitations and the neural mechanisms underlying VWM. The theory provides a formal framework for understanding how the brain optimizes performance in the face of limited resources, and may lead to new insights into the neural basis of attention and working memory.
summary
     Biologists have long known that plants use a process called autophagy to protect themselves against infectious diseases. However, it was unclear how plant pathogens, such as the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans, interfere with autophagy-related processes. In a recent study, researchers discovered that PexRD54, an effector protein secreted by Phytophthora infestans, binds to a host autophagy protein called ATG8CL. This binding stimulates the formation of autophagosomes, which are membrane-bound structures that engulf and recycle cellular components.

     The researchers found that PexRD54 also depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 from ATG8CL complexes. Joka2 is a protein that plays a positive role in plant defense against pathogens. By removing Joka2 from ATG8CL complexes, PexRD54 interferes with Joka2's ability to help the plant defend against the pathogen. This suggests that PexRD54 has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses.

     Autophagy is a complex process that involves the selective degradation and recycling of cellular components. In plants, autophagy plays a crucial role in defense against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate defense-related autophagy and the selective nature of this process are not well understood. This study provides new insights into how plant pathogens manipulate autophagy-related processes to their advantage.

     The researchers used a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to study the interaction between PexRD54 and ATG8CL. They found that PexRD54 has a high affinity for ATG8CL and stimulates the formation of ATG8CL-marked autophagosomes. This is distinct from the behavior of another pathogen effector, RavZ, which inhibits autophagy. Instead, PexRD54 activates selective autophagy, possibly to eliminate defense-related compounds or to reattribute cellular resources by promoting nutrient recycling.

     The discovery of PexRD54's ability to bind to ATG8CL and deplete Joka2 from ATG8CL complexes has important implications for our understanding of plant-pathogen interactions. It suggests that pathogens can activate autophagy for their own benefit, rather than simply inhibiting it. This study highlights the complex and dynamic nature of plant-pathogen interactions and the need for further research into the mechanisms of defense-related autophagy.
Summary of Human Cardiac Fibroblasts Adaptive Responses to Controlled Combined Mechanical Strain and Oxygen Changes in Vitro

     Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) play a crucial role in cardiac tissue adaptation and inflammation during pathological conditions such as ischemia. However, the mechanisms underlying CF responses to environmental changes are not yet fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers developed a novel microdevice that applies combined mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension to human primary CFs.

     The study aimed to investigate how CFs respond to different combinations of mechanical strain and oxygen changes. The results showed that individual stimuli, such as mechanical strain or oxygen deprivation, triggered distinct responses in CFs, including proliferation and collagen production. However, only the combination of hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and simulated loss of contractility (2% strain) induced the release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.

     This study provides new insights into the adaptive responses of human CFs to environmental changes, which are relevant to cardiac fibrotic disease. The findings suggest that the combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility is critical in eliciting inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling responses in CFs. In contrast, individual stimuli only regulated proliferative and collagen-related responses.

     The researchers propose an innovative in vitro model that recreates a pathological environment for understanding CF responses during cardiac injury. This model can be used to study the effects of environmental stimuli on CF behavior and to develop reparative strategies for cardiac disease. The study highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of mechanical strain and oxygen changes in the development of cardiac fibrosis.

     The results of this study have implications for future research on pathological myocardial remodeling and the development of in vitro models for cardiac disease. By understanding how CFs respond to environmental changes, researchers can design more effective therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat cardiac fibrosis. The novel microdevice used in this study provides a valuable tool for investigating the complex interactions between CFs and their environment.
summary
     Biologists have long known that histone acetylation and the deposition of a specific type of histone called H2A.Z are crucial for active transcription in cells. In fruit flies (Drosophila), a single complex called DOMINO is thought to perform both of these functions, but the exact mechanism was unclear. Researchers have now identified two distinct forms of the DOMINO complex, called DOM-A and DOM-B, which are generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. These two complexes have different functions: DOM-B incorporates H2A.Z into chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. In contrast, DOM-A functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, similar to the yeast NuA4 complex, and targets lysine 12 of histone H4 for acetylation. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation, but through different mechanisms. This study provides an example of how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separation, as seen in yeast and humans, where nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. In Drosophila, the same diversity is generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. The researchers used RNA sequencing to explore the functional differences of the two DOM isoforms on transcription and found that knockdown of either DOM-A, DOM-B, TIP60, or H2A.V had significant effects on transcription. The study also suggests that the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A complex, a principle that might be conserved across metazoans. Overall, this work illustrates how alternative splicing generates functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators.

     The formation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) between motoneurons and muscle cells is a complex process that requires precise communication between the two cell types. A key player in this process is β-catenin (Ctnnb1), a protein found in muscle cells that is critical for the differentiation of motoneurons. However, the mechanism by which muscle Ctnnb1 sends signals to motoneurons to facilitate NMJ formation is not well understood.

     Researchers used an in vivo transgenic approach to investigate the functions of muscle Ctnnb1 in NMJ formation. They found that a mutant form of Ctnnb1 that lacked the ability to regulate gene expression was unable to rescue the presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation. In contrast, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 was found to be dispensable. These results suggest that muscle Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation by controlling the expression of muscle-derived proteins.

     The researchers then screened for proteins that may serve as a Ctnnb1-directed retrograde factor and identified Slit2, an environmental cue that repels or collapses neuronal axons. They found that overexpression of Slit2 in muscle cells was able to diminish the presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation in mice. Furthermore, Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce the formation of synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants.

     These observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation. The researchers also found that muscle Ctnnb1 associates with Tcf/Lef cis-elements in the promoter region of the Slit2 gene, and that Slit2 expression in muscle cells is promoted by elevating Ctnnb1. Transgenic mice expressing Slit2 specifically in the muscle were able to diminish presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation, including poor innervation, reduced vesicle density, and depressed miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs).

     Overall, these findings provide new insights into the mechanism of NMJ formation and suggest that muscle Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation by controlling the expression of muscle-derived proteins, including Slit2. This research has important implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between motoneurons and muscle cells during NMJ formation.
Biomedical researchers have developed a new method to study the dynamics of force transmission at cell-cell junctions in epithelial clusters. These cell-cell junctions play a crucial role in regulating tissue development, maintenance, and adaptation. The researchers used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to quantify the forces transmitted between cells with both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution.

    The study found that basal force fluctuations at cell-cell junctions are coupled to the localization of E-cadherin, a key protein component of adherens junctions in epithelial cells. At the level of individual cell-cell junctions, the researchers observed that local mechanical stresses correlated with the localization of E-cadherin molecules. This suggests that E-cadherin plays a critical role in regulating force transmission at cell-cell junctions.

    The researchers also found that force transmission through a cell requires coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. This means that cells must work together to regulate the forces transmitted between them. The study also showed that force transmission across a cell cluster is short-ranged, typically on the length scale of one cell diameter, due to the anchoring and scrambling of forces by cell-matrix adhesions and basal actomyosin contractility.

    The researchers applied their method to spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters and observed that cell-cell force exchange depended on the cell position within a cluster. The study also found that force transmission was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms that control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues.

    The study highlights the importance of coordinated cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in regulating force transmission and tissue mechanics. The researchers' method provides a powerful tool for studying mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions, which could lead to a better understanding of tissue development, maintenance, and adaptation. The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of various biological processes, including tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the structure and function of the huntingtin protein, which is associated with Huntington's disease. A polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein is a hallmark of this neurodegenerative disorder. To investigate the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion, researchers used various biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy, and cross-linking mass spectrometry.

     The study found that huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid structure. The amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the protein fold to create a central cavity. Interestingly, the researchers discovered that the polyglutamine expansion increases the α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. This suggests that the polyglutamine expansion may modulate the structure and function of huntingtin.

     The researchers used a panel of highly purified human recombinant huntingtins with varied lengths of polyglutamine tracts to conduct systematic biophysical and biochemical analyses. They found that the impact of the polyglutamine tract on huntingtin's basic structural features suggests that the protein may undergo dramatic conformational changes upon interaction with its binding partners. Single-particle electron microscopy of recombinant human huntingtins with polyglutamine tract lengths of 23- and 78-residues revealed that the protein's shape may enable a structural impact of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract.

     The study provides a satisfying solution to the mystery of how the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract may modulate huntingtin structure and function. The researchers found that the α-helical properties of huntingtin increase with the length of the polyglutamine tract, suggesting that the protein's structure and function may be modulated by the size of the polyglutamine tract. This finding has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.
summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of ferritinophagy, the autophagic turnover of ferritin, in regulating intracellular iron bioavailability. However, the mechanisms controlling ferritinophagy flux and the role of NCOA4, a selective cargo receptor for ferritin, in iron-dependent processes have remained poorly understood. A recent study has shed light on the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and the regulation of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy.

     The study found that NCOA4 interacts directly with ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on FTH1. This interaction is essential for the delivery of ferritin to lysosomes via autophagosomes. Furthermore, the study revealed that NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The ubiquitin-dependent turnover of NCOA4 is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between NCOA4 and the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase.

     The study also demonstrated that NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation in zebrafish and cultured cells. When iron levels are high, NCOA4 abundance is low, promoting ferritin accumulation and iron capture. Conversely, when iron is low, NCOA4 levels increase to promote ferritinophagy. The study showed that the HERC2 ligase uses its CUL7-homology domain to recognize NCOA4 under high iron conditions, mediating NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system and reducing steady-state NCOA4 levels.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the regulation of ferritinophagy and the role of NCOA4 in iron-dependent processes. The study highlights the importance of NCOA4 in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and suggests that aberrant degradation of ferritin in lysosomes could be deleterious to the cell when intracellular iron is high. Overall, this research has significant implications for our understanding of iron metabolism and the regulation of ferritinophagy.
The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) plays a crucial role in higher-level cognition, but its functional organization has remained unclear. A long-standing theory proposes that the LPFC is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing increasingly abstract information to facilitate efficient and flexible cognition. However, previous support for this theory has been limited.

     Recent human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed a rostral-caudal gradient of abstraction in the LPFC, indicating that progressively rostral areas of the LPFC process more abstract information. Dynamic causal modeling showed asymmetrical interactions among LPFC sub-regions, suggesting hierarchical processing. Contrary to expectations, the relative strength of efferent (output) versus afferent (input) connections positioned the mid-LPFC as the apex of the hierarchy.

     The study also found that cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations towards the mid-LPFC, consistent with a role in integrating information for control operations. Furthermore, the strengths of these dynamics were related to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability. This suggests that the LPFC is hierarchically organized, with the mid-LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior.

     The researchers confirmed the rostral-caudal axis of the LPFC operates according to abstraction principles by examining gradients of stimulus domain-generality/specificity and temporal control over action. They also modeled interactions among LPFC sub-regions to examine how cognitive control demands elicit asymmetrical influences indicative of hierarchical processing.

     The study found that both the hierarchical orientation of the mid-LPFC in fixed connectivity and the top-down influences from rostral LPFC to mid-LPFC during the engagement of cognitive control were positively related to higher-level cognitive ability. This indicates that the functional organization of the LPFC is closely tied to cognitive capacity.

     The researchers examined interactions within the LPFC by varying demands on stimulus domain and cognitive control. They found that progressively rostral areas processed progressively abstract levels of cognitive control, with demands on feature control, contextual control, and temporal control eliciting increasingly rostral activations. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that hierarchical asymmetries in connectivity were strongest in the mid-LPFC.

     Cognitive demands elicited both top-down influences from rostral to mid-LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal to mid-LPFC. Analyses of effective connectivity and its modulations suggest that the mid-LPFC forms a nexus where information converges to influence action. These findings collectively suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized, with the mid-LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior.
Summary
     A recent study has identified a gene called TBC1D3 that plays a crucial role in the development of the brain's outer layer, known as the cortex. This gene is specific to hominoids, a group that includes humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Researchers found that when TBC1D3 is expressed in the brains of mice, it promotes the generation of a type of cell called outer radial glia (oRG). These cells are important for brain development and are more abundant in primates than in other animals.

     The study used a technique called in utero electroporation to introduce the TBC1D3 gene into the brains of mice. This allowed the researchers to observe the effects of the gene on brain development. They found that the expression of TBC1D3 caused the delamination of ventricular radial glia cells and promoted the generation of oRG cells. These cells have a high proliferative ability, similar to those found in primates.

     The researchers also found that the expression of TBC1D3 led to the formation of cortical folding in the brains of mice. Cortical folding is a characteristic of the human brain and is thought to be linked to higher intelligence. The study suggests that TBC1D3 may play a key role in the evolution of the human brain.

     The researchers propose that TBC1D3 acts as a candidate gene that controls many other genes involved in cortex expansion and folding. This study provides evidence that brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during hominoid evolution. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of the human brain and the development of neurological disorders.

     The study also found that the expression of TBC1D3 reduced the expression of a gene called Trnp1, which is involved in stemness signaling pathways. This suggests that TBC1D3 may play a role in regulating the intrinsic stemness of neural progenitor cells.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cortical folding and the evolution of the human brain. The findings highlight the importance of TBC1D3 in regulating brain development and suggest that it may be a key player in the evolution of higher intelligence.
summary
     The plant immune coactivator NPR1 plays a crucial role in activating systemic acquired resistance in plants by reprogramming the transcriptome. Previous research suggested that immune-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NPR1 facilitate continuous delivery of active NPR1 to target promoters, maximizing gene expression. However, a new study reveals that ubiquitination of NPR1 has transcriptional roles prior to its proteasomal turnover.

     The study found that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive event initiated by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase, which promotes chromatin association and expression of target genes. The E4 ligase UBE4 then enhances polyubiquitination of NPR1, leading to its targeting for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases, UBP6/7, oppose ubiquitin ligase activities and enhance NPR1 longevity.

     The study showed that loss of UBE4 uncouples NPR1 target gene expression from proteasome activity, highlighting the importance of progressive ubiquitination for NPR1 activity. Initial CRL3-mediated ubiquitination is required for NPR1 to attain its full transcriptional activity, while the stepwise formation of long ubiquitin chains mediated by UBE4 inactivates NPR1 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome.

     The research indicates that initial ubiquitination boosts NPR1 transcriptional coactivator activity by enhancing target promoter occupancy in the short term and potentially promoting genomic mobility of NPR1 in the longer term. The study suggests that ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of unstable eukaryotic activators without strict requirement for sacrificial turnover.

     The findings provide new insights into the complex regulation of NPR1 and its role in plant immune responses. The study reveals that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a stepwise event requiring the actions of CRL3 and the E4 ligase UBE4, and that deubiquitinases UBP6/7 oppose ubiquitin ligase activities to fine-tune NPR1 activity. The research has implications for understanding the mechanisms of plant immune responses and the regulation of unstable eukaryotic activators.
Biologists have identified the precursors of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana. These siRNAs are 24 nucleotides long and play a crucial role in silencing transposons and a subset of genes. The biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2), and DICER-like 3 (DCL3). However, the precursors of these siRNAs were previously undefined.

     Researchers have now identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) that accumulate in DCL3 mutants. These P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nucleotides long and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at the 3' termini of P4R2 RNAs.

     The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5' or 3' ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model in which siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events. This model is supported by the observation that dozens of P4R2 RNAs can overlap at a given locus, but individual P4R2 RNAs represent individual Pol IV-RDR2 transcription units.

     The researchers also found that P4R2 RNAs are dependent on both Pol IV and RDR2, as they do not accumulate in nrpd1 (Pol IV) or rdr2 mutants. Furthermore, P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in DCL2/DCL3/DCL4 triple mutants are substrates for DCL3, which can cut them into 24 nt RNAs in vitro. These findings provide new insights into the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and their role in guiding DNA methylation in Arabidopsis.
Biomedical research has long sought to understand how immature neural networks develop into their mature form, enabling complex computations underlying cognition. A recent study investigated the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development in immature mice using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology. The findings reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development.

This transition is characterized by a relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. The study demonstrates a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. The researchers hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks.

The study found that the transition between immature and mature network dynamics was marked by unexpectedly decreased coordinated cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second postnatal week. After this timepoint, precise neuronal synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time robustly emerged. The researchers observed that neural spiking was more efficiently recruited to oscillatory activity with consistent, strong phase-locking, and higher temporal precision, features characteristic of adult neural networks engaged in information processing.

The study suggests that a transient period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations. The findings provide new insights into the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations and highlight the importance of a transient quiescent period in the development of mature cortical dynamics. The study's results have implications for our understanding of brain development and the emergence of cognitive functions in both rodents and humans.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how multiple strains of a pathogen, such as Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria, coexist and circulate within a population. This is a crucial question in epidemiology, as it has significant implications for disease control. A new agent-based model has been developed to address this issue, focusing on the var gene family of P. falciparum, which encodes the parasite's major surface antigen, PfEMP1.

The model considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation through sequential, mutually exclusive expression. It tracks the dynamics of all unique var repertoires in a population of hosts and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of var genes. The degree of antigenic overlap between these repertoires depends on transmission intensity.

Previous mathematical models have demonstrated that immune selection can lead to the maintenance of discrete, non-overlapping, antigenic repertoires, even when antigenic variability is driven by several unlinked genes that undergo recombination. The "var strain" model suggests that vector control strategies that reduce transmission will not always drastically reduce var gene diversity, as a reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse, highly non-overlapping var repertoires will remain.

The new model extends earlier strain theory by considering the effects of immune selection in populations of pathogens whose antigen-encoding loci are multi-copy and recombining. It explores whether structured parasite populations resulting from the selection pressures exerted by competition among distinct var repertoires for hosts, mediated by cross-immunity, can emerge. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports the role of immune selection in structuring parasite diversity.

This research provides an opportunity to extend existing strain theory in a way that can be tested empirically. The findings have significant implications for malaria research and control, as they suggest that vector control strategies may not always lead to a drastic reduction in var gene diversity. Instead, a reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse, highly non-overlapping var repertoires may remain, complicating efforts to control the disease.
summary
     The article reports on the mechanism by which the deamidase OspI from the enteric bacteria Shigella flexneri disrupts the interaction between the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 and the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. OspI deamidates a glutamine residue in UBC13, converting it to glutamate (Q100E), which silences the polyubiquitination activity of the UBC13/TRAF6 complex and inhibits the downstream NF-κB inflammatory response. The precise role of deamidation in silencing the UBC13/TRAF6 complex was unknown, but the study reveals that deamidation inhibits the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 RING-domain (TRAF6RING) by perturbing both native and transient interactions.

     Deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6RING interface. This competition prevents transient interactions necessary to form a typical UBC13/RING complex. Additionally, repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged surface of TRAF6RING prevents transient interactions in the UBC13/RING complex.

     Further studies showed that deamidation disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING by three mechanisms: i) a new intramolecular R14/E100 salt-bridge appears in dUBC13, which competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge in the native complex; ii) the salt-bridge competition also perturbs the UBC13/TRAF6RING transient complexes to inhibit association; and iii) transient repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6RING reduces the interaction.

     The study highlights a mechanism by which a post-translational modification, deamidation, perturbs the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association. The findings have implications for understanding how Shigella flexneri suppresses the inflammatory response (NF-κB pathway) via deamidation of UBC13 at Q100. Deamidation of Q100 to E100 inhibits the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, preventing the downstream activation of NF-κB pathway. These chains serve as a scaffold to bring together TAK1/2 and IKK kinases, eventually leading to phosphorylation and activation of the IKK kinases, IκB degradation, and nuclear translocation of transcription factor Nf-κB.
Biomedical researchers have long used a technique called optogenetics to activate or inactivate specific types of neurons in the brain to understand their functions. However, a new study suggests that this approach may not always provide a complete picture of how these neurons work. The study, conducted in the auditory cortex of awake mice, found that activating and inactivating two types of interneurons, called somatostatin-positive (Sst+) and parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb+) interneurons, had different effects on neural responses.

When Sst+ interneurons were inactivated, the responses of other neurons in the auditory cortex increased, indicating that these interneurons play a role in regulating the strength of neural signals. In contrast, inactivating Pvalb+ interneurons weakened the tuning of neural responses to specific sounds and reduced the amount of information transferred between neurons. However, when Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons were activated, no such differences were observed. This suggests that these two types of interneurons support distinct computational functions in the auditory cortex.

The researchers used a simple network model to understand why activating and inactivating interneurons produced different results. They found that small changes in the parameters of the model, such as the level of spontaneous activity or the strength of the light manipulation, could determine whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions about interneuron function.

The study's findings have implications for the interpretation of recent causal data on interneuron function. The researchers suggest that the abundance of recent data may not be as straightforward as previously thought, and that the effects of activating and inactivating interneurons may depend on the specific context and parameters of the experiment. The study highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of how to use causal strategies to gain insight into interneuron function.

The researchers used optogenetics to manipulate Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons in the auditory cortex of awake mice, while recording neural responses to tones. They found that inactivating Sst+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivating Pvalb+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer. The study's findings suggest that Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons support specific, separable functions in the auditory cortex, and that the effects of activating and inactivating these neurons depend on the specific context and parameters of the experiment.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that working memory (WM) is an emergent property of large-scale network interactions in the brain. However, the causal relationship between oscillatory activity and WM performance is not fully understood. To investigate this relationship, researchers used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports WM. The study aimed to provide causal evidence for the role of oscillatory synchronization during demanding WM performance.

     The researchers conducted two experiments using tACS to selectively entrain endogenous brain rhythms. They tested four hypotheses: (1) behavioral WM performance is enhanced by entraining synchronous activity within a right frontoparietal network activated by WM demands; (2) regional brain activity in this frontoparietal network is modulated in a phase-dependent manner; (3) changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activity induced by phase-dependent network stimulation correlate with behavioral performance; and (4) functional connectivity across distant brain regions is modulated in a phase-dependent manner.

     The results showed that externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed that tACS effects depended on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state. Specifically, synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity results indicated that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network.

     The study demonstrated a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization across a right frontoparietal network activated by the task. The researchers found that manipulations of tACS phase modulate the underlying brain activity and that tACS can influence long-range connectivity in a phase- and brain state-dependent manner. The results suggest that external manipulations of large-scale brain synchronization can be used to shape activity and connectivity within brain networks, and those modulations are detectable using fMRI. Overall, the study provides a direct demonstration of the role of phase synchronization in cognitive demanding WM processes and shows the neural correlates associated with this process.
summary
     Biologists have long known that invertebrates and some vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, establish embryonic polarity through the localization of maternal determinants in the egg. However, mammals and birds, including chickens, have a more flexible development process that allows them to form multiple individuals from a single embryo, a process known as twinning. Researchers have been trying to understand how embryonic polarity is determined in these species.

     A recent study has identified a transcription factor called Pitx2 as a key regulator of embryonic polarity in chicken embryos. The study found that Pitx2 is essential for determining the position of the embryonic axis, which is the orientation of the head, tail, and other body parts. Pitx2 acts by directly regulating the expression of a gene called cVg1, which is involved in the formation of the embryonic axis.

     The researchers used a molecular screen to identify Pitx2 as a candidate regulator of cVg1 expression. They found that Pitx2 is expressed in the same domain as cVg1 in whole embryos and in isolated anterior halves, and that it is expressed before cVg1. This suggests that Pitx2 is an upstream regulator of cVg1 expression.

     The study also found that Pitx2 is involved in left-right asymmetry, which is the process by which the left and right sides of the body develop differently. This suggests that Pitx2 has been co-opted to different functions during evolution, including the regulation of embryonic polarity and left-right asymmetry.

     The identification of Pitx2 as a key regulator of embryonic polarity has important implications for our understanding of development and twinning. It suggests that Pitx2 plays a critical role in determining the position of the embryonic axis, and that it acts by directly regulating the expression of cVg1. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which Pitx2 regulates embryonic polarity and twinning.

     The study also highlights the importance of Pitx2 in left-right asymmetry, which is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple genes and signaling pathways. The identification of Pitx2 as a key regulator of left-right asymmetry suggests that it may play a critical role in the development of the left and right sides of the body.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of embryonic polarity and twinning, and highlights the importance of Pitx2 as a key regulator of these processes. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which Pitx2 regulates embryonic polarity and twinning, and to explore its potential role in human development and disease.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors in response to odor gradients. To investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variations of olfactory stimuli, researchers subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs). The study found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, with PNs strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change.

A simple two-dimensional model was developed to predict the PN output based on the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. The model closely predicted the PN output, indicating that PNs primarily signal the acceleration and rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers. This allows animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.

PNs relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn. Recent studies have shown that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time. Building on this advance, the researchers asked how PNs further contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments.

The study tested first- and second-order neurons in the Drosophila olfactory system with a wide range of dynamically varying odor concentrations. A simple 2D LN model was constructed for the temporal processing of olfactory information. The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input.

The researchers found that Drosophila's early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers. This encoding mechanism allows an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase. The study suggests that acceleration encoding in the Drosophila antennal lobe enables higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli. This is crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes.
summary
     In flowering plants, seed development begins with the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, resulting in the formation of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group (PcG) protein family prior to fertilization. However, a new study reveals that fertilization of the central cell leads to the production of auxin, a plant hormone, which is likely exported to the maternal tissues, driving seed coat development by removing the PcG block.

     The researchers found that mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, resulting in seed abortion. They propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development. The study suggests that auxin production in the developing endosperm is the trigger for seed coat development.

     The researchers investigated plants mutant for AGL62 and found that they abort early after fertilization, correlating with early endosperm cellularization and failure to develop a seed coat. They also found that the agl62 mutant has defects in both seed coat development in fertilized ovules and endosperm development in autonomous seeds, suggesting that AGL62 is involved in mediating both endosperm and seed coat developmental pathways.

     The study provides multiple lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that auxin production in the fertilized central cell/endosperm drives seed coat development. This includes the rapid accumulation of auxin in the integuments after fertilization, impaired auxin biosynthesis but not auxin signaling in the endosperm causing defects in seed coat development, ovules of transgenic lines producing auxin ectopically in the central cell initiating seed coat development without fertilization, and failure of seed coat development in the agl62 mutant correlating with failure to export auxin from the endosperm.

     The study shows that seed coat development requires production of auxin in the fertilized central cell/endosperm and most likely the transport of auxin to the ovule integuments in an AGL62-dependent manner. The fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin that is exported to the integuments, lifting the PRC2 block on seed coat development and allowing for cell elongation and differentiation. However, this process is highly dependent on the activity of the transcription factor AGL62, since agl62 seeds fail to export auxin from the endosperm, leading to auxin accumulation and consequently, failure to develop a seed coat.
Summary
     The interaction between a bacteriophage and its host is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein (RBP), which plays a crucial role in governing phage activity and host range. Despite its importance, the molecular rules of RBP function remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers developed a high-throughput method called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library Expression) to systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP.

     Using ORACLE, the researchers created a large, unbiased library of phage variants at a targeted gene locus, making all single amino acid substitutions at every site (1660 variants) and quantifying the functional role of all variants on multiple bacterial hosts. This approach generated high-resolution functional maps delineating regions concentrated with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific substitutional patterns, many of which were previously unknown.

     The study revealed that single amino acid substitutions alone can generate broad functional diversity, highlighting the evolutionary adaptability of the RBP. The researchers also discovered T7 variants with far greater virulence than wild-type T7, demonstrating that even naturally adapted phages can be engineered for higher efficacy. Furthermore, the study identified gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts.

     To demonstrate the therapeutic value of ORACLE, the researchers engineered T7 variants that avert the emergence of spontaneous resistance in pathogenic Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections. The study explains the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip domain and identifies key functional regions determining activity and host range. The results indicate that ORACLE can generate phage variants superior to wild-type phage, which could serve as starting points for further engineering therapeutic phages. Further experiments will be required to assess the in vivo efficacy of the T7 variants. The study presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in many phage-bacterial systems.
Individuals with congenital amusia, a lifelong condition characterized by unreliable pitch processing, have been found to rely less on pitch cues during speech perception and more on other dimensions such as duration. A recent study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural basis for this strategy. Fifteen individuals with amusia and 15 controls participated in the study, which involved reading sentences with a comma indicating a grammatical phrase boundary and then selecting the best match for the written sentence from two spoken sentences that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues.

The results showed that individuals with amusia exhibited reduced functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions. This difference in connectivity was not present during a control task. The study suggests that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, and that individuals with amusia may have developed a compensatory mechanism to down-weight pitch cues due to its unreliability.

The study's findings are consistent with previous research showing that individuals with amusia rely less on pitch than controls to process spoken language. The results also support the idea that right hemisphere auditory areas are not only abnormally connected to right frontal areas during tonal tasks, but are also less integrated with frontal left hemisphere regions when processing speech and language. The study's null results for group differences in activation during speech processing are consistent with prior reports that amusics and controls do not differ in pitch representations within sensory regions.

Brainstem encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli has been shown to be unimpaired in individuals with amusia. The study's findings suggest that amusics neglect pitch because they have implicitly learned that their memory for pitch is unreliable, and that this down-weighting of pitch is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas that integrate information from perceptual regions. Overall, the study provides new insights into the neural basis of congenital amusia and the compensatory mechanisms that individuals with this condition may use to process speech and language.
summary
     A newly discovered contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2), has been found in the Tasmanian devil, a species that already harbors a widespread contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1). In contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which play a crucial role in the immune system. However, the MHC class I alleles expressed by DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing their immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles. This suggests that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumor and host, but loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate the widespread transmission of DFT2.

     The researchers found that DFT2 cells express both classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules in vitro and in vivo, in contrast to DFT1, which has lost expression of MHC class I. The non-classical MHC class I molecule expressed by DFT2 cells is non-polymorphic, likely reducing the immunogenicity of these tumor cells. Additionally, the classical MHC class I allele with the highest expression in DFT2 cells is shared with host devils. The researchers also observed that MHC class I expression varies among DFT2 tumors in vivo, suggesting that MHC class I-negative subclones could emerge as DFT2 transmits more widely.

     The study's findings indicate that DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules, unlike DFT1 and the contagious cancer circulating among dogs, CTVT. Further analysis is needed to define the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumor evolution. The similarity of MHC class I alleles between DFT2 and host devils may reflect a shared geographical range and genotype pool to the cancer founder. The frequency of this allele among the wider population may impact the ability of DFT2 to spread further. The heterogenic expression of MHC class I molecules in DFT2 biopsies suggests that MHC class I expression is not fixed and may be gradually lost in DFT2.
summary
     Biomedical research has shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying spatial and non-spatial behaviors in the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG). A recent study used optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to investigate the neural codes underlying RSG function. The results reveal a double dissociation between parallel circuits in superficial RSG, which process disparate inputs.

     The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, selectively recruit small low-rheobase (LR) pyramidal cells in RSG. In contrast, neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information. This parallel processing is enabled by the precise sublaminar organization of distinct principal neuronal subtypes and axonal afferents within RSG layer 1.

     The study found that LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum. The synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs to LR cells allow for the robust encoding of angular speed, even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction, not speed. This suggests that LR neurons are ideally suited to integrate head direction input from the thalamus and spatial inputs from the hippocampal formation via the dorsal subiculum.

     The integration of various types of directional and distance information is a key computational function of the retrosplenial cortex as a whole. The distinct morphology and intrinsic properties of LR neurons make them well-positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG. Further research is needed to determine how these parallel streams of information are integrated in downstream neurons within both the ipsilateral and contralateral granular and dysgranular retrosplenial cortices.
Summary
     Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for dementias, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a type of tauopathy. However, the mechanisms that promote the spread of tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood. Researchers used a novel approach to investigate the role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy after TBI. They developed a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor in zebrafish larvae that reports the accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections.

     The researchers subjected zebrafish larvae to a novel TBI paradigm, which produced various TBI features, including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. They found that bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. These results suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI.

     The study used zebrafish larvae as a model system, which offered a potent complement to rodent models of TBI and cellular models of tauopathy. The researchers engineered a novel in vivo Tau biosensor model in zebrafish that can visualize pathological Tau spreading and accumulation within the intact and vibrant CNS. They found that post-traumatic seizures correlate strongly with spreading tau pathology following TBI and that manipulating this seizure activity mitigated Tau aggregation.

     The results of the study implicate seizures and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the spread of Tau seeds, offering potential therapeutic targets. The findings suggest that anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures may be a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy. Further work is warranted to explore this potential therapeutic approach. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the progression of tauopathy after TBI and highlights the potential of zebrafish as a valuable model system for studying neurotrauma.
Biomedical researchers have long studied the connections between different brain regions and how they relate to behavior and lifestyle. Typically, these studies focus on the strength of communication between distinct brain areas, known as functional connectivity. However, a new study suggests that the spatial arrangement of these brain regions, or their topography, plays a significant role in determining functional connectivity.

The researchers used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) to investigate the relationship between the spatial configuration of brain regions and measures of brain connectivity. They found that the shape and exact location of brain regions interact strongly with the modeling of brain connectivity. Furthermore, the spatial arrangement of functional regions was strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle.

The study's findings have important implications for interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits. The researchers suggest that cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions may be misinterpreted as changes in functional connectivity. This could lead to inaccurate conclusions about the relationship between brain activity and behavior.

To address this issue, the researchers propose that it is essential to disambiguate the influence of spatial topography when estimating functional connectivity. They note that recent advances have improved the alignment of brain regions across individuals, but more work is needed to tackle this challenge.

The study's results also highlight the importance of considering the organization of the brain into large-scale functional networks. These networks are composed of distinct brain regions that show temporal correlations with each other, revealing complex patterns of functional connectivity. The researchers used partial canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to investigate the relationship between network matrices and spatial topography.

Their results showed that network matrices contain little unique trait-level cross-subject information that is not also reflected in the spatial topographical organization of functional regions. This suggests that the cross-subject information represented in commonly adopted "connectivity fingerprints" largely reflects spatial variability in the location of functional regions across individuals, rather than variability in coupling strength.

Overall, the study's findings emphasize the need for a better understanding of the relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity in the brain. This knowledge is crucial for accurately interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the mechanisms controlling cell type-specific gene expression. A recent study investigated the role of TBP/TFIID-dependent activation of MyoD target genes in skeletal muscle cells. The study aimed to determine whether the replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP2 is required for muscle-gene expression.

     The research found that TBP2 is not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cells or primary mouse muscle stem cells (MuSCs). In contrast, TBP is the essential component of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles. TBP2-deficient mice displayed an intact regeneration potential, and MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild-type MuSCs.

     The study compared the RNA expression profile of Tbp and Tbpl2 genes in MuSCs isolated from skeletal muscles of wild-type mice and in the C2C12 myogenic cell line. Tbp expression was detected in both MuSC-derived myotubes and in C2C12 myotubes. The results suggest that TBP, but not TBP2, is required for muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles.

     The research also explored the integrity of the regeneration potential of skeletal muscles in TBP2 null mice during adult life. The study found that MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild-type MuSCs, indicating an intact capacity of adult MuSCs to proliferate, self-renew, and differentiate during ongoing muscle regeneration in the absence of TBP2.

     Furthermore, the study detected comparable numbers of MuSCs in muscles of wild-type and TBP2 null mice 12 days after injury, indicating an intact capacity of adult MuSCs to proliferate, self-renew, and differentiate during ongoing muscle regeneration in the absence of TBP2. The results demonstrate that TBP, but not TBP2, is the essential component of the PIC that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles.
Summary
     Researchers used a technique called optogenetics to study how brain stimulation affects the connections between different areas of the brain in non-human primates. They used a large-scale optogenetic interface to stimulate excitatory neurons in the primary somatosensory ( S1 ) and motor ( M1 ) cortices of two macaques. At the same time, they recorded electrical activity across these areas using electrocorticography ( ECoG ).

     The researchers found that stimulation in either S1 or M1 strengthened the connections between these areas within minutes. They also observed heterogeneous changes in connectivity across the network, which reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity. These findings are consistent with Hebbian plasticity models, which suggest that "neurons that fire together, wire together".

     To test the Hebbian model, the researchers compared the correlations directly induced by stimulation with the changes in network correlations observed after conditioning. They found a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network. This suggests that large-scale stimulation-induced changes are consistent with Hebbian plasticity.

     The researchers used two measures of functional connectivity to provide complementary views of the mechanisms of plasticity. They found that both measures supported a key role for Hebbian learning in sensorimotor cortical plasticity. However, they note that a deeper understanding of the relationship between these bodies of work would require further study of intermediate time-frames and detailed cortical mapping.

     The large-scale optogenetic interface used in this study enabled robust estimation of functional connectivity and stimulation-evoked correlations. This work has significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation strategies and extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits.
summary
     A rare case of a Rhesus macaque monkey, born without primary visual cortex (V1), was studied to understand the neural consequences of such damage. The monkey, named S, showed unremarkable in-group behavior, but was impaired in visual task training. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that visual structures outside of the lesion were normal, and stimulation under anesthesia activated the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. Visual cortical activation was sparse, but included face patches.

     Functional connectivity analysis showed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. However, there was little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena. The monkey's visual structures, both cortical and subcortical, outside of the large lesion remained intact, suggesting a role in residual visual function.

     The structural connectivity between subcortical regions and area V5/MT was weak, but the microstructure was intact. A connectivity analysis was performed to understand the nature of the response in area V5/MT, which showed no significant activation to either checkerboard or moving dots stimuli. However, foci of activation were found in the region of V5/MT in dorsal STS of both hemispheres, suggesting sub-threshold activation.

     A functional network of cortical areas showing a similar BOLD response over time to V5/MT was mapped out, even without strong visually-evoked V5/MT responses. Retinal information may reach the dorsal visual areas via weak pathways with LGN and pulvinar, but the lack of consistent visual cortex activation makes this question difficult to answer. The lack of significant differences between monkey S and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests either or both could support residual visual abilities.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how the human innate immune system distinguishes between foreign and host DNA in the nucleus. A key player in this process is the innate immune sensor IFI16, which recognizes foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA and assembles into supramolecular signaling platforms to initiate an immune response. However, the mechanism by which IFI16 distinguishes between foreign and host DNA has remained unclear.

     A recent study used biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques to investigate how IFI16 recognizes foreign dsDNA in the nucleus. The researchers found that IFI16 scans along exposed foreign dsDNA in a one-dimensional manner, tracking long stretches of DNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. This scanning mechanism allows IFI16 to efficiently and selectively assemble into oligomers on foreign DNA.

     The study also showed that nucleosomes, which are the basic units of chromatin, act as barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA. Nucleosomes directly interfere with the one-dimensional movements of IFI16, preventing it from binding to host DNA. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism enables IFI16 to distinguish between foreign and host DNA in the nucleus.

     The researchers used time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays to demonstrate the scanning mechanism of IFI16. They found that IFI16 scans along exposed dsDNA to assemble into distinct clusters, and that chromatinization is sufficient to inhibit IFI16 from targeting host dsDNA for assembly. In vivo, this one-dimensional scanning mechanism allows a limited number of IFI16 molecules to allocate to large genomes of invading pathogens.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of IFI16-mediated immune responses. The researchers propose that the one-dimensional diffusion-mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating the overall IFI16-mediated immune responses. The study highlights the importance of chromatinization in allowing IFI16 to distinguish between foreign and host DNA in the nucleus, and provides a unifying molecular mechanism that explains how IFI16 resolves central issues in initiating its foreign-dsDNA sensing pathways.
Summary
     A new technique called spatially targeted optical microproteomics (STOMP) has been developed to analyze the composition of small protein deposits in tissues. This method uses a combination of two-photon laser scanning microscopy, photochemical affinity labeling, and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins present in specific regions of interest (ROIs) within tissues. The technique does not require genetic manipulation and can be applied to various biological samples, including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue.

     To perform STOMP, specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize the ROIs, which are then soaked in a solution containing a photo-tag. The photo-tag is a molecule that forms covalent bonds with proteins when exposed to laser light. Confocal imaging and two-photon excitation are used to couple the photo-tag to all proteins within the ROI, allowing for the identification of proteins at a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. After tissue solubilization, the photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry.

     In a test case, STOMP was used to examine amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case. The results confirmed known plaque constituents and discovered new ones, demonstrating the potential of STOMP to provide insights into the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases. The technique also has the potential to advance research in cell biology by allowing for the analysis of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification.

     The photo-tagging procedure used in STOMP offers single-micron-scale three-dimensional resolution, which is an order of magnitude better than the current state of the art. The predominant protein photo-tagged in the STOMP sample was Aβ, which is not visible in the non-plaque experiment due to its low overall abundance. The total volume of tissue required for photo-tagging to obtain sufficient material for mass spectrometry analysis is a subjective matter and depends on various factors, including instrument sensitivity, fixation method, and sample complexity.
summary
     The Frizzled3 (Fz3) gene plays a crucial role in the development of axons in cranial and spinal motor neurons. Research has shown that disruption of the Fz3 gene leads to defects in axonal growth in specific motor nerves, including the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, the phrenic nerve, and the dorsal motor nerve in fore- and hindlimbs. In Fz3-deficient limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus and do not reroute to other trajectories, unlike other axon path-finding mutants.

     The study found that affected motor neurons undergo cell death two days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death, which coincides with innervation of muscle targets. This suggests that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. The research also implicates planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in motor axon growth and highlights the question of how PCP proteins, which form cell-cell complexes in epithelia, function in the dynamic context of axonal growth.

     In the limb, the absence of Fz3 leads to a specific stalling defect among lateral motor column (LMCL) axons that is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance. Affected cranial and spinal motor neurons die shortly after their axons stall, providing in vivo evidence for the idea that as growing axons arrive at intermediate targets, essential survival signals are relayed to their cell bodies.

     The study investigated whether the primary cause of motor axon deficiency in Fz3-deficient mice is defective motor neuron differentiation, excessive motor neuron death, or defective axon growth and/or guidance. Since the majority of Fz3-deficient motor axons do not follow erroneous trajectories, aberrant path-finding is unlikely to be the primary cause. Instead, the research suggests that controlling axonal growth may be the only function of Fz3 in motor neurons.

     The study found that a discrete subset of motor neurons exhibits both axon growth defects and apoptotic cell death at E11.5-E12.5 in Fz3-deficient embryos, but not in Fz3-heterozygous controls. This suggests that Fz3 plays a critical role in regulating axonal growth and survival in motor neurons, and that its absence leads to premature cell death. The findings have implications for our understanding of PCP signaling in motor axon growth and development.
Summary
     Biologists have long believed that transposable elements (TEs) play a significant role in establishing gene regulatory networks in the early mouse embryo. TEs are repetitive DNA sequences that can jump from one location to another in the genome, and they have been co-opted by the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the early mouse embryo as enhancers. Enhancers are regions of DNA that increase the expression of nearby genes. However, there is limited evidence that TEs actually contribute to gene regulation.

     To investigate the role of TEs in gene regulation, researchers tested a set of long terminal repeat (LTR) TE families in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. They used a combination of epigenomic and transcriptomic data to identify TEs that were associated with tissue-specific gene expression programs. The results suggested that a large number of TEs were involved in establishing these gene expression programs.

     To confirm the regulatory relationships between TEs and genes, the researchers used genetic editing to remove individual TEs from the genome. They found that a subset of TEs was indeed important for gene regulation in early mouse development. However, a wider survey of TEs using CRISPR interference revealed that only a minority of TEs played significant roles in gene regulation.

     The study highlights the importance of functional experiments in evaluating the gene regulatory roles of TEs. It also suggests that TEs may be used to support lineage-specific expression of a subset of genes in early development. However, the results also indicate that many TEs play only minor, redundant, or no role in gene regulation, despite strong correlative evidence at the level of chromatin composition and conformation.

     The researchers used CRISPR interference to test the regulatory roles of multiple TE+ enhancers in embryonic stem cells. They found that TE+ enhancers may be used to support lineage-specific expression of a subset of genes in early development. However, the correlations observed may emerge in the absence of causal links between TEs and gene expression.

     To directly test for a functional role of TE+ enhancers in gene regulation, the researchers performed CRISPR-mediated genetic excision of selected TEs. They validated the relatively small effect of some TE+ enhancers on gene expression by performing additional genetic editing experiments. The study identifies a number of TEs that are important for driving expression of lineage-specific genes, and highlights the need for extensive genetic work to evaluate the proportion of TE+ enhancers that act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements.
summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that has independently emerged in at least 60 plant lineages. C4 photosynthesis is a more efficient way for plants to convert sunlight into energy, but its evolution is not well understood. A new study has used a combination of data analysis and mathematical modeling to uncover the evolutionary paths that led to the development of C4 photosynthesis.

     The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3-C4 forms of photosynthesis. They then developed a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model to predict how the C4 phenotype evolved. This approach allowed them to infer the likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data.

     The study found that the emergence of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. The researchers also discovered that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers. This means that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was influenced by factors other than photosynthesis itself.

     The study suggests that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space. The researchers propose that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C4 photosynthesis, which may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits.

     The findings of this study have implications for efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C4 photosynthesis through genetic engineering of C3 species. The researchers suggest that including additional early traits in the analysis did not alter the predicted order of the original 16 traits, indicating that their conclusions are robust. Overall, this study provides new insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and highlights the importance of considering non-photosynthetic drivers in the evolution of complex traits.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have reengineered the ATPase active site of a bacterial protein called SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. SpoIVA is a cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to form static polymers during the sporulation process in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The protein evolved from a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases, but the reason for the switch from GTP to ATP hydrolysis is unclear. By modifying the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA, the researchers created a functional GTPase, SpoIVAGTPase, which could hydrolyze both ATP and GTP. However, SpoIVAGTPase failed to polymerize in the presence of GTP, suggesting that the nucleotide base, not just the energy released from hydrolysis, is crucial for its function.

Further experiments showed that SpoIVAGTPase could only polymerize in the presence of ATP, indicating a specific requirement for the nucleotide base. The researchers also found that physiological levels of intracellular ATP, but not GTP, facilitate the necessary conformational changes in SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase. This suggests that the switch from GTP to ATP hydrolysis in SpoIVA may have been driven by the high levels of ATP present during the sporulation process.

The study reveals that the nucleotide base can play a critical role in specific biological functions, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis. The researchers propose that the increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation may have driven the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA. This finding has implications for our understanding of the evolution of protein function and the importance of nucleotide specificity in biological processes. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation of static polymers in bacteria and highlights the complex interplay between nucleotide hydrolysis and protein function.
Biomedical research has shown that leptin plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and exhibits neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. However, the actual role of leptin during development is not yet fully understood. A recent study investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life by restoring leptin signaling in mice formerly null for the leptin receptor (LepR) gene at either the fourth or tenth week of age.

The study found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, LepR deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. Additionally, LepR reactivation in adulthood resulted in persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cartpt, and Prlh mRNA expression and to defects in the reproductive system and brain growth.

These findings suggest that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems. Leptin signaling during development may affect the organization of critical neural circuits that regulate energy homeostasis, favoring the incidence of metabolic diseases later in life. Previous studies have shown that changes in leptin signaling during development can lead to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity.

The study used knockout mice for the Lepr gene that grew without leptin's effects to investigate the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life. Leptin or LepR deficiency leads to reduced brain mass, disruption of the projections from ARH neurons to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, as well as behavioral and cognitive problems. The study aimed to evaluate the possible consequences of the lack of leptin signaling in early life on brain development.

The results of the study contribute to the understanding of the metabolic programming by indicating which specific metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental consequences arise from the absence of leptin signaling in early life. The findings have implications for the alarming growth of childhood obesity worldwide and highlight the importance of leptin signaling during development for long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin.
summary
     Arabidopsis plants have a complex system to defend against bacterial infections, which involves the immune receptor FLS2 and the central cytoplasmic kinase BIK1. Recent research has shown that heterotrimeric G proteins, composed of the non-canonical Gα protein XLG2, the Gβ protein AGB1, and the Gγ proteins AGG1 and AGG2, play a crucial role in FLS2-mediated immune responses. However, the exact mechanism by which these G proteins regulate immunity was unknown.

     This study reveals that XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1 before activation by the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22. In this pre-activation state, XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2 work together to prevent the degradation of BIK1 by the proteasome, allowing for optimal immune activation. When flg22 binds to FLS2, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in its N-terminus. This phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD.

     The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms. The introduction of a transgenic copy of BIK1 restored flg22-triggered immune responses and disease resistance in xlg2 and agb1 mutants, highlighting the importance of the G proteins in maintaining the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex.

     Furthermore, the study shows that the G proteins dynamically interact with the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex during FLS2 signaling. The findings are consistent with the observed defects in flg22-induced responses and RbohD phosphorylation in the G protein mutants. Overall, this research provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of plant immunity and the role of heterotrimeric G proteins in regulating FLS2-mediated immune responses.
summary
     Biologists have long studied the Arabidopsis circadian clock, a complex system that regulates gene expression across the day-night cycle. While previous research has identified a multiple feedback loop circuit that generates the 24-hour rhythm, it remained unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells and how clock timing is coordinated across the plant. To address this question, researchers examined clock activity at the single-cell level in Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions.

     The study revealed robust single-cell oscillations, but these oscillations were desynchronized, meaning they occurred at different times in different cells. The researchers observed two waves of clock activity: one traveling down the root and the other up the root. They also found evidence of cell-to-cell coupling, particularly in the root tip, suggesting that cells communicate with each other to coordinate their clock activity.

     By analyzing the data, the researchers estimated the coupling strength between cells and found that it was strongest in the root tip. A simple model suggested that the observed period differences between cells, combined with cell-to-cell coupling, could generate the observed waves in clock gene expression. This finding reveals the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggests that, unlike the centralized mammalian clock, the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points.

     The study's results also support a more decentralized model of clock coordination in plants, contradicting earlier studies that suggested cellular oscillations were uncoupled. The researchers used a reporter for the core clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) to examine the dynamics of the Arabidopsis clock across the whole plant at the single-cell level over several days. They found that the coherent waves of gene expression suggested that the plant clock signal could be coupled, and estimated the coupling strength based on a technique developed for mammalian circadian cells.

     The study's findings reveal that the damping of rhythms at the whole-plant level is mainly due to desynchronization of oscillating single cells with different periods, rather than noise in gene expression or damping of individual oscillations. Overall, the research provides new insights into the structure and robustness of the plant circadian clock system, highlighting the importance of cell-to-cell communication in coordinating clock activity across the plant.

     Biomedical researchers investigated how the brain processes speech in noisy environments, specifically in adults with clinically normal hearing. In everyday life, speech from multiple speakers can overlap, making it difficult to focus on a single conversation. Normally, the brain uses a combination of fast processing and active listening to separate the attended speech from background noise. However, some adults with normal hearing struggle to follow conversations in noisy settings, despite having no apparent hearing impairments.

     The study analyzed data from over 100,000 patient records and found that about 10% of adults with clinically normal hearing visited a clinic due to reduced hearing, only to be told that their hearing was not the cause of their communication difficulties. To better understand this phenomenon, the researchers used a combination of behavioral and physiological tests to identify neural biomarkers associated with poor multi-talker speech perception.

     The study found that multi-talker speech intelligibility thresholds varied widely among adults with normal hearing, but could be predicted from neural phase-locking to frequency modulation (FM) cues measured using ear canal EEG recordings. By combining neural temporal fine structure processing, pupil-indexed listening effort, and behavioral FM thresholds, the researchers were able to account for 78% of the variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility.

     The study also identified disordered bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multi-talker speech perception, which could inform the design of next-generation clinical tests for hidden hearing disorders. The researchers used parallel psychophysical and neurophysiological tests to converge on a set of neural biomarkers that identify poor multi-talker speech intelligibility in adults with clinically normal hearing.

     The study's findings have implications for the development of new diagnostic measures and interventions for individuals who struggle to follow conversations in noisy social environments. The researchers present a simple battery of behavioral and physiological tests that can account for nearly 80% of the variability in a test of multi-talker speech intelligibility that does not involve linguistic cues. The study's results suggest that the strong association between psychophysical tests for FM detection and speech-in-noise intelligibility can be attributed, at least in part, to encoding of FM cues at early stages of auditory processing.

     Biomedical researchers have long faced a challenge in visualizing the microvascular network deep inside the living mammal due to tissue light scatter. However, the transparency of the mammalian eye provides a unique opportunity to study the microvessels of the retina, a part of the central nervous system, noninvasively. Despite the clarity of the eye, imperfections in its optics blur microscopic retinal capillaries and single blood cells flowing within, limiting early evaluation of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries. To overcome this limitation, a team of researchers used 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow in the C57BL/6J mouse, a widely used research animal.

     The researchers employed ultrafast imaging and an automated analysis pipeline to measure the flow of millions of blood cells across the full spectrum of retinal vessel diameters, ranging from 3.2 to 45.8 micrometers. This was achieved without the need for surgery or contrast dye, enabling the measurement of flow rates that spanned four orders of magnitude, from 0.0002 to 1.55 microliters per minute. The study demonstrated the capability to image single blood cells noninvasively in the smallest to largest vessels of the mouse retinal circulation, using near-infrared backscatter without the need for foreign contrast agents.

     The findings of this study have significant implications for the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the central nervous system and systemic microvascular health. The eye may serve as a window to supplement the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the CNS, and the imaging capabilities developed in this study may be directly applicable to clinical approaches using the same instrumentation. The researchers also demonstrated the ability to image single blood cells in both tight and sparsely packed formations inside microvessels, enabling sub-micrometer precision when measuring the lumen diameters of retinal vessels. In total, 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied, providing a comprehensive understanding of single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels of the living mouse retina.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how plants form symbiotic relationships with other organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, to acquire essential nutrients like phosphate and nitrogen. A key receptor-like kinase called Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase (SYMRK) plays a crucial role in two distinct symbiotic relationships: phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. However, the mechanisms that determine which type of symbiosis develops have remained unclear.

     Researchers have now discovered that ectopic expression of the receptor-like kinase genes Nod Factor Receptor 1 (NFR1), NFR5, and SYMRK can initiate spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia, the bacteria that typically trigger root nodule formation. Furthermore, overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 associated with endogenous SYMRK in roots of the legume Lotus japonicus. Epistasis tests revealed that the dominant active SYMRK allele initiates signaling independently of either the NFR1 or NFR5 gene and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking in both symbioses.

     The researchers also found that only SYMRK overexpression triggered the expression of AM-related genes, indicating that the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis development. The SYMRK-mediated loss of signaling specificity may be explained by simultaneous complex formation of SYMRK with NFR1 and NFR5, and related LysM-RLKs that mediate recognition of signals from the AM fungus. This complex formation may result in the release of both negative regulatory mechanisms, or by an unbalanced stoichiometry of SYMRK and putative specific negative regulators of AM- and root nodule symbiosis signaling.

     The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of symbiotic relationships between plants and other organisms, and highlights the importance of SYMRK in determining the type of symbiosis that develops. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between SYMRK, NFR1, NFR5, and other genes involved in symbiosis signaling.
Summary
     A new software toolkit called DeepPoseKit has been developed to estimate the locations of an animal's body parts from images or videos using deep learning methods. This toolkit addresses the limitations of current animal pose estimation methods in terms of speed and robustness. The DeepPoseKit uses an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model called Stacked DenseNet and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm to estimate keypoint locations with subpixel precision. This approach improves processing speed by more than two times compared to existing methods without compromising accuracy. The toolkit is designed to be easy to use and has broad applicability across the behavioral sciences.

     The DeepPoseKit is built on the state-of-the-art for individual pose estimation using convolutional neural networks and achieves fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization ability. The new pose estimation model, Stacked DenseNet, offers significant improvements over existing models. The code, documentation, and examples for the software package are freely available under a permissive open-source license.

     The DeepPoseKit can run inference at a rate of 30-110 Hz, depending on the resolution of the predicted confidence maps, making it suitable for real-time applications. In contrast to conventional computer-vision methods, deep-learning-based methods can achieve near-human-level accuracy in various scenarios by manually annotating data and training a general-purpose image-processing algorithm. The DeepPoseKit has been demonstrated on multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals.

     The development of DeepPoseKit reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has the potential to lead to larger, higher-resolution, and more reliable behavioral datasets. This could revolutionize our understanding of relationships between behavior, the brain, and the environment. The toolkit's ease of use and broad applicability make it a valuable resource for researchers across the behavioral sciences.

     Biomedical research has identified a new mechanism by which the body's immune cells respond to infection or environmental stress. When immune cells, such as macrophages, are challenged by pathogens or stress, they activate a complex called an inflammasome, which triggers an inflammatory response and a form of cell death called pyroptosis. A recent study has found that the disruption of glycolytic flux, the process by which cells break down glucose for energy, is a key trigger for inflammasome signaling and pyroptotic cell death.

     The researchers discovered that when glycolytic flux is disrupted, it leads to a decrease in NADH levels and an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This signal is essential for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is responsible for producing the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. The study found that this signal can be rescued by adding products that restore NADH production.

     The researchers also found that the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium can disrupt glycolytic flux by taking up host-cell glucose, leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis. This suggests that the body's immune cells can sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens through the disruption of glycolytic flux.

     The study's findings reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to respond to metabolic dysfunction or infection. The researchers suggest that innate immune cells sense perturbed metabolite production and flux through the glycolytic pathway, leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the initiation of inflammatory responses.

     The study's results also indicate that glycolytic perturbation is a mechanism by which innate immune cells sense altered homeostasis during S. typhimurium infection and induce a pro-inflammatory response via NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death. The researchers found that blocking glycolytic flux serves as a trigger for inflammation and cell death in macrophages, and that supplementation with the glycolytic product pyruvate can prevent inflammasome formation and reduce cell death.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which the body's immune cells respond to infection and environmental stress, and highlights the importance of glycolytic flux in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the initiation of inflammatory responses.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a new function of the PALB2 protein, a tumor suppressor linked to breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. PALB2 plays a critical role in DNA repair, specifically in homology-directed repair (HDR), by interacting with other proteins and binding to DNA. The study identified a major DNA-binding site on PALB2 and found that mutations in this site reduce the efficiency of HDR in cells by 50%. The researchers also discovered that the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (N-DBD) of PALB2 stimulates the function of RAD51 recombinase, a protein involved in DNA repair. Surprisingly, the N-DBD of PALB2 can facilitate strand exchange without the presence of RAD51 and can even use RNA as a substrate. This novel activity of PALB2 highlights the importance of its DNA-binding function in chromosome maintenance. The study suggests that PALB2's interaction with DNA is critical for the recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and efficient DNA repair in cells. The researchers propose that mutations in PALB2's DNA-binding site can lead to a failure to repair a subset of DSBs, contributing to cancer development. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of DNA repair and the role of PALB2 in maintaining chromosomal integrity. The PALB2 N-DBD's ability to stimulate RAD51-mediated strand exchange in vitro and its capacity to use RNA as a substrate reveal a versatile DNA interaction property of PALB2, underscoring its importance in DNA repair processes. The study's results have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA repair and the development of cancer.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have made a significant discovery about the structure and function of MreB, a protein found in bacteria. MreB is an actin-like protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining the shape of bacterial cells. Unlike other actin-like proteins, which form filaments with parallel protofilaments, MreB forms filaments with antiparallel protofilaments. This unique arrangement allows MreB to interact with the bacterial cell membrane and other membrane-bound components.

     The researchers used a combination of techniques, including crystallography and electron microscopy, to study the structure of MreB filaments. They found that the antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments is essential for the protein's function in cell shape maintenance. In fact, deleting the N-terminal amphipathic helix of MreB or mutating the residues in the hydrophobic loop made the protein less prone to aggregation and reduced its ability to maintain cell shape.

     The researchers also used crystallography to study the structure of MreB in different nucleotide and polymerization states. They found that the protein undergoes conserved conformational changes as it forms antiparallel filaments. Additionally, they discovered that the antimicrobial agents A22/MP265 bind close to the bound nucleotide of MreB, preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilizing the double protofilaments.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the structure and function of MreB and its role in bacterial cell shape maintenance. The antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments is unprecedented among actin-like proteins and ensures that each subunit can interact with the membrane and membrane-bound components of the elongasome. The study also sheds light on the mechanism of protofilament formation and the inhibitory mechanism of the antimicrobial agents A22/MP265. Overall, this research has significant implications for our understanding of bacterial cell biology and the development of new antimicrobial therapies.
summary
     Biologists have long recognized the importance of invariant floral forms in ensuring reproductive success and robustness to natural perturbations. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant, petal number is consistently four. However, in the closely related species Cardamine hirsuta, petal number varies. To understand the genetic basis for this difference, researchers investigated the role of APETALA1 ( AP1 ), a pleiotropic floral regulator. They found that divergence in AP1 can account for the species-specific difference in petal number robustness between Arabidopsis and Cardamine hirsuta. This large effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions, where Arabidopsis AP1 masks the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) controlling petal number in Cardamine hirsuta, thereby conferring robustness. In contrast, Cardamine hirsuta AP1 fails to complement this function of Arabidopsis AP1, resulting in variable petal number. The researchers also discovered that upstream regulatory regions of AP1 contribute to this divergence. Furthermore, they found that variable petal number is maintained in Cardamine hirsuta despite sufficient standing genetic variation in natural accessions to produce plants with four-petalled flowers. This suggests that AP1 divergence likely exposed cryptic genetic variation in Cardamine hirsuta that contributes directly to maintaining variable petal number within natural accessions of the species. The study highlights the importance of AP1 as a gene of major effect in the evolutionary transition from a robust phenotype of four petals to a variable petal number in Cardamine hirsuta. The findings also suggest that there may be variability in the gene regulatory network controlling petal number in Arabidopsis that is hidden beneath the uniformity of wild-type development.
summary
     Biomedical research has identified an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes: the misfolding of proinsulin in the pancreas. Proinsulin is a precursor to insulin, a hormone critical for metabolic homeostasis. Normally, proinsulin is folded correctly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of pancreatic islet cells, forming three internal disulfide bonds. However, a subset of proinsulin molecules in healthy islets contains unpaired cysteine residues, which can lead to the formation of aberrant disulfide-linked complexes with other proinsulin molecules.

     Studies in human and rodent islets have shown that a perturbed ER folding environment can lead to the formation of non-native proinsulin complexes. In genetically obese mice with otherwise normal islets, disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin are more abundant, and this increase tracks with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. In leptin receptor-deficient mice, which are prone to obesity and diabetes, the abundance of disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes is further increased.

     Research has also identified specific cysteine residues, Cys(B19) and Cys(A20), as necessary and sufficient for the formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes. Proinsulin Cys(B19)-Cys(B19) covalent homodimers are particularly stable and resistant to reductive dissociation, providing a structural basis for aberrant proinsulin complex formation.

     The study found that proinsulin misfolding is an early event associated with prediabetes, which worsens with β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. In islets from prediabetic mice, a large proportion of proinsulin molecules are entangled in disulfide-linked dimers and higher-order complexes. These findings suggest that proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is a key event in the progression to type 2 diabetes. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying proinsulin misfolding and its role in the development of type 2 diabetes.
summary
     Biologists have long understood that a protein called Suv39h1 plays a crucial role in forming a type of chromatin called heterochromatin, which is involved in gene silencing. Suv39h1 achieves this by methylating histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9), a process recognized by the protein's chromodomain (CD). However, the mechanisms by which Suv39h1 targets specific chromosomal regions without pre-existing H3K9 methylation are not well understood.

     Recent research has shown that Suv39h1's chromodomain (Suv39h1-CD) binds to nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, and that this binding is essential for its function in heterochromatin assembly. The study found that Suv39h1-CD has a higher affinity for RNA than DNA and that its ability to bind nucleic acids is independent of its H3K9 methylation recognition. Furthermore, Suv39h1 was shown to bind major satellite RNAs in living cells, and knocking down these RNAs reduced Suv39h1's retention on pericentric heterochromatin.

     The study also demonstrated that Suv39h1's nucleic acid-binding activity cooperates with its recognition and binding of methylated H3K9 to establish and maintain pericentric heterochromatin. The results suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to creating Suv39h1's target specificity. In addition to its role in establishing H3K9 methylation, Suv39h1's RNA-binding activity also contributes to its stable association with H3K9-rich pericentromeric regions.

     Mutational studies revealed that both the nucleic acid-binding and H3K9 methylation-binding activities of Suv39h1-CD are crucial for its pericentric heterochromatin assembly. The study also found that the HP1-binding and chromatin-binding activities of Suv39h1's N-terminal region contribute to Suv39h1-mediated pericentric H3K9 methylation formation. Overall, the research demonstrates that Suv39h1's multiple activities, including nucleic acid-binding, H3K9 methylation-binding, HP1-binding, and chromatin-binding, cooperatively regulate Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin assembly.
Summary of the article: Entorhinal cortex receptive fields are modulated by spatial attention, even without movement

     Researchers have long been interested in the role of the entorhinal cortex, a region of the brain involved in spatial navigation and memory. One type of cell in this region, called grid cells, is known for its ability to precisely decode an animal's position in space. Recent studies have suggested that grid cells may play a broader role in mental operations, such as attention and perception. However, for this hypothesis to be true, grid cell activity must not be dependent on physical movement.

     To test this idea, scientists recorded the activity of individual cells in the entorhinal cortex of two rhesus macaque monkeys. The monkeys were trained to perform a task that required them to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a small dot moving around a computer monitor. The researchers found that a significant population of entorhinal cells (14% of 141 neurons) exhibited spatially structured receptive fields, similar to those seen in grid cells. These cells were activated by the movement of the dot, even though the monkeys were not physically moving.

     This finding is significant because it suggests that grid cells in the entorhinal cortex do not rely on physical movement to function. Instead, their activity can be modulated by spatial attention, even in the absence of movement. This challenges the idea that grid cells are solely involved in navigation and supports the hypothesis that they play a more general role in mental operations.

     The researchers also compared their findings to previous studies on the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in memory and spatial navigation. In contrast to the entorhinal cortex, grid-like representations were not observed in the hippocampus. This difference highlights the unique properties of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex and their potential role in attention and perception.

     Overall, the study provides strong evidence that the activation of cells in the entorhinal cortex with spatially structured firing fields does not require physical movement. This finding has implications for our understanding of the neural basis of attention and perception, and suggests that grid cells may play a more general role in mental operations than previously thought.
Summary
     Researchers have developed a standardized task to measure decision-making in mice, which can be reproduced across multiple laboratories. The task, designed for head-fixed mice, assesses perceptual and value-based decision-making. To ensure reproducibility, the researchers standardized the training protocol, experimental hardware, software, and procedures. They trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries and collected over 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database.

     The results show that learning speed varied across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories relied similarly on visual stimuli, past successes and failures, and estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These findings demonstrate that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories, establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior.

     To facilitate reuse and reproducibility, the researchers adopted an open science approach, sharing the hardware and software components and experimental protocols. This approach allows the broader community to access and build upon the research. The study provides an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice, which can be used to advance our understanding of neural correlates of decision-making.

     The researchers' collaboration, International Brain Laboratory, aims to leverage genetic, imaging, and physiological tools available for mouse brains to explore the neural basis of the same mouse behavior in multiple laboratories. By comparing results across laboratories, researchers can identify differences that are unlikely to be due to variations in behavior. The study's resources are expected to catalyze the development of new adaptations and variations of the approach, accelerating the use of mice in high-quality, reproducible studies of neural correlates of decision-making.
summary
     Biologists have created a detailed map of the gene expression in the intestine of the planarian flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea. This species is capable of regenerating all its organs, including the gut, making it an ideal model for studying digestive system function and repair. The researchers used a technique called laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze the intestinal transcriptome of the planarian.

     The study identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression that were not detected by previous approaches. These genes are involved in various physiological roles, such as metabolism, nutrient storage and transport, and innate immunity, demonstrating a high degree of functional homology with the digestive systems of other animals, including humans. The researchers also identified 22 intestine-enriched transcription factors, including several required for the production and maintenance of goblet cells, a type of cell found in the intestine.

     The study revealed regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, particularly among intestinal goblet cells. Two intestine-enriched transcription factors, gli-1 and RREB2, were identified as playing distinct roles in goblet cell differentiation and maintenance. Depletion of goblet cells was found to reduce the planarians' willingness to feed and viability, but had negligible effects on the regeneration of other intestinal cell types or non-intestinal tissues.

     The characterization of the planarian intestinal transcriptome provides a framework for further investigation of mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration. The study's findings reinforce the evolutionary conservation of intestinal gene expression and indicate that physiological roles performed by multiple human digestive organs are consolidated in the planarian intestine. The development of methods for applying LCM to planarian tissue has enabled the definition of gene expression and cell types in the intestine, facilitating further studies of digestive cell types.
summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how organisms adapt to their environments through modifications to their sensory systems. A recent study has shed light on this process by investigating how different species of weakly electric fish perceive and respond to electric communication signals. The researchers found that two distinct types of sensory receptors are responsible for detecting these signals: spiking receptors and oscillating receptors.

     Spiking receptors, found in species that can detect subtle variations in electric communication signals, encode signal waveform into spike-timing differences between sensory receptors. In contrast, oscillating receptors, found in species that are insensitive to waveform variation, produce spontaneously oscillating potentials and respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase. This results in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform.

     The researchers discovered that oscillating receptors are most sensitive to frequencies found only in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics, and this sensitivity is correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. This suggests that different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies. The study's findings provide the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony.

     The researchers also found that oscillating receptors are tuned to much lower frequencies than the peak power frequencies of conspecific electric organ discharges (EODs). Furthermore, these oscillation frequencies confer enhanced sensitivity to interpulse intervals (IPIs) that can only be produced by groups of fish. This suggests that oscillating receptors are specialized for detecting signals from a large group, whereas spiking receptors are specialized for detecting signals from individuals.

     To test this hypothesis, the researchers performed behavioral playback experiments in which they presented a single fish with a train of 10 conspecific EODs at constant IPIs. The results showed that species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond IPIs within the range of enhanced receptor sensitivity, while species with spiking receptors did not. These findings suggest that oscillatory electrical activity in sensory receptors may represent an adaptation for detecting communication signals from large groups of fish.
summary
     A new structure of the bacteriophage BPP-1 has been determined using cryo-electron microscopy at a resolution of 3.5 Å. BPP-1 is a virus that infects and kills Bordetella species, which cause whooping cough in humans and respiratory diseases in other mammals. The virus has a T = 7l icosahedral capsid, approximately 670 Å in diameter. The structure of the BPP-1 head reveals two distinct protein folds: a jellyroll fold for the cement protein (CP) and an HK97-like fold for the major capsid protein (MCP). Notably, the fold topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted from the previously known Johnson fold topology, which has been observed in other viral and cellular proteins. This new topology is likely the only feasible alternative to the old topology. The structure also shows that β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1, unlike the covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail. The termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering. The atomic description of the BPP-1 head will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal non-covalent molecular interactions conducive to stable bacteriophage capsid formation, and clarify evolutionary relationships of BPP-1 MCP and CP with proteins in other viruses. The structure of the BPP-1 head provides new insights into the diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) system, which is a naturally occurring phage-display system. The BPP-1 MCP and CP adopt two of the three characteristic folds of major virus lineages, jellyroll and HK-97/Johnson. The Johnson fold in BPP-1 MCP is non-circularly permuted compared to the previously known topology of the Johnson fold, which has been observed in the Siphoviridae and Myoviridae families of the three tailed-bacteriophage families. The BPP-1 structure is the first atomic model of a Podoviridae family member and provides a basis for understanding the evolutionary relationships of BPP-1 MCP and CP with proteins in other viruses.
Summary of the article "Principles of dengue virus evolvability derived from genotype-fitness maps in human and mosquito cells"

     Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that cycles between mosquito and mammalian hosts. To understand how DENV populations adapt to these different host environments, researchers used a combination of serial passage in human and mosquito cell lines and ultra-deep sequencing to estimate the fitness effects of all single-nucleotide variants in these populations. This approach allowed the researchers to determine the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population.

     The analysis revealed that the continuous influx of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations, shaping the path of adaptation. Beneficial mutations were found to preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and cluster to defined regions in the genome. These phenotypically redundant adaptive alleles may facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation.

     The researchers used a technique called CirSeq to characterize the fitness landscapes of DENV populations adapting to human and mosquito cells by tracing individual allele trajectories for almost all possible single nucleotide variants across the DENV genome. This analysis revealed the influence of both positive and negative selection in shaping the evolutionary paths of DENV in these distinct cellular environments.

     Notably, many beneficial mutations were clustered at a few specific locations in the genome, suggesting adaptation relies on hotspots of host-specific selection. To further analyze these hotspots, the researchers mapped the allele fitness values on the three-dimensional structure of dengue protein E, a well-studied transmembrane protein that forms the outermost layer of the viral envelope.

     The findings of this study quantify the cost of deleterious mutation across the dengue genome and highlight how negative selection shapes diversity in viral populations. The results also suggest that adaptation relies on host-specific beneficial mutations that are clustered in specific regions of the DENV genome and enriched in regions of the proteome that exhibit structural flexibility.

     Importantly, the evolutionary constraints described in this study mirror trends observed across DENV and Zika strains, indicating that this simple system recapitulates key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term viral evolution. The study provides new insights into the principles of DENV evolvability and highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between beneficial and deleterious mutations in shaping the evolutionary paths of viral populations.
summary
     Biomedical researchers used a technique called single-particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) to study the behavior of KRasG12D, an active mutant of the KRas protein, on cell membranes. They found that KRasG12D exists in three distinct states on the membrane: an immobile state, an intermediate mobility state, and a fast diffusion state. The immobile state occurs in domains approximately 70 nanometers in size, while the intermediate mobility state occurs in domains approximately 200 nanometers in size. The rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion of KRasG12D.

     The researchers observed that KRasG12D is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, similar to the process of Ras internalization and recycling. Importantly, the partitioning of KRasG12D into these three states remains invariant over a wide range of protein expression levels. This suggests that the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRasG12D are maintained in a homeostatic condition.

     Further analysis revealed that the intermediate and immobile states of KRasG12D are each associated with distinct membrane domains. The measured sizes of these domains are consistent with previous beliefs that nanoscopic membrane domains regulate Ras organization on the membrane. The researchers propose a new model to describe the membrane dynamics of KRasG12D, where nested membrane nanodomains dictate the diffusion and trafficking of the protein.

     The study provides new insights into how complex nanodomains organize on the membrane to dictate Ras diffusion and trafficking. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling. Future experiments can build on these results to determine the molecular and structural identities of the Ras-associated membrane nanodomains and define the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling patterns the dorsoventral (DV) axis of vertebrates and invertebrates during embryonic development. A key aspect of this process is the formation of a BMP signaling gradient, which is crucial for proper patterning of the embryo. Previous research has proposed several mechanisms for BMP gradient formation, including a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists and ligand shuttling. However, a new study in zebrafish has shed light on the underlying mechanism.

     The researchers used a combination of quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling to investigate BMP gradient formation in zebrafish embryos. They developed a robust method to directly measure the BMP signaling gradient and integrated the results with a computational model to test hypotheses for gradient formation. The study found that the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish is not established by a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists or by ligand shuttling, as previously thought.

     Instead, the researchers discovered a new mechanism, known as the source-sink mechanism, which relies on a restricted distribution of BMP antagonists acting as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. This mechanism was supported by measurements of Bmp2 diffusion, which showed that it is consistent with the source-sink model. The study suggests that the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish is shaped by the interplay between BMP ligands and antagonists, with the antagonists acting as a sink to drive BMP flux and gradient formation.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of BMP signaling and gradient formation during embryonic development. The source-sink mechanism identified in zebrafish may have implications for our understanding of BMP signaling in other organisms, including vertebrates. Further research is needed to explore the generality of this mechanism and its role in patterning the DV axis during development.
Biomedical researchers have identified a crucial component of the lysosome, a cellular organelle responsible for breaking down and recycling cellular waste. The lysosomal transporter MFSD1, a member of the major facilitator superfamily, plays a vital role in maintaining liver homeostasis. MFSD1 is a polytopic transmembrane protein that facilitates the export of low-molecular-weight catabolic end-products from lysosomes. However, the function and regulation of MFSD1 have remained poorly understood until now.

     A team of scientists conducted a detailed analysis of MFSD1 and found that it is not N-glycosylated and contains a dileucine-based sorting motif necessary for its transport to lysosomes. Mfsd1 knockout mice, which lack the MFSD1 gene, developed severe liver disease and splenomegaly, indicating the importance of MFSD1 in maintaining normal liver function. Further investigation revealed that GLMP, a highly glycosylated lysosomal protein, is an essential accessory subunit of MFSD1. The two proteins physically interact, and GLMP is necessary for maintaining normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes.

     The researchers isolated lysosomes from wildtype and Mfsd1 knockout mice and performed proteomics analysis to identify the composition of the lysosomal proteome. They found that GLMP is drastically reduced in lysosomes from Mfsd1 knockout mice, and vice versa. This suggests that MFSD1 and GLMP form a tightly linked complex that is essential for lysosomal function. Glmp knockout mice exhibited a similar phenotype to Mfsd1 knockout mice, further supporting the critical role of the MFSD1/GLMP complex in maintaining liver homeostasis.

     The study provides new insights into the function and regulation of MFSD1, a poorly characterized lysosomal transporter. The findings highlight the importance of the MFSD1/GLMP complex in maintaining normal liver function and suggest that dysregulation of this complex may contribute to liver disease. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the MFSD1/GLMP complex and its role in human health and disease.

     Biologists have made significant progress in understanding the mechanism of kinesin, a motor protein essential for various cellular processes in eukaryotes. Kinesin's ability to transport cargo along microtubules, powered by ATP hydrolysis, is crucial for cell division, intracellular transport, and other vital functions. To gain insight into this process, researchers used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain high-resolution structures of the kinesin motor domain attached to microtubules in two different states: without nucleotides (ATP or ADP) and with ATP.

     The cryo-EM reconstructions revealed atomic models of the kinesin-microtubule complex at a resolution of 5-6 angstroms. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin, the researchers inferred a mechanistic scheme for kinesin's nucleotide-gated force-generation. This scheme proposes that microtubule attachment triggers a "clamshell" opening of the nucleotide cleft and the release of ADP. The binding of ATP then re-closes the cleft, tightly coupling to the translocation of cargo via kinesin's "neck linker" element.

     The researchers also identified a universally conserved "linchpin" residue in kinesin (N255) that mediates microtubule attachment and triggers the clamshell opening. This mechanism is reminiscent of the nucleotide-exchange steps in myosin and F1-ATPase motors. Furthermore, the study found that microtubules can regulate kinesin's affinities for ADP and ATP by modulating the conformation of the switch loops, providing a structural basis for kinesin's nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules.

     The researchers also solved high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions of the human monomeric kinesin motor domain attached to microtubules in two different chemical states, representing the motor before and after ATP binding. The no-nucleotide and ATP-bound models of the kinesin-microtubule complex revealed a clamshell-like closure of the nucleotide cleft triggered by ATP binding. Additionally, cryo-EM analysis of the ADP and ATP analog-bound states of a kinesin point mutant supported this hypothesis, revealing two previously unidentified binding modes of kinesin in which the motor domain attaches tightly to the microtubule but is rotationally mobile.
Biologists have long known that mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, require mechanisms to remove damaged or misfolded proteins to maintain their essential functions. However, the quality control (QC) pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins have remained poorly understood. A recent study in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shed light on a novel QC pathway at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM).

    Researchers identified two temperature-sensitive (ts-) proteins, sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts, which are degraded from the MOM by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This process involves the attachment of ubiquitin molecules to the proteins, marking them for destruction. The ubiquitination of sen2-1HAts is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, while sam35-2HAts is primarily ubiquitinated by San1.

    The study found that the degradation of these proteins requires the involvement of chaperone proteins, specifically the SSA family of Hsp70s and the Hsp40 Sis1. This is the first evidence of chaperone involvement in mitochondrial-associated degradation (MAD). Additionally, the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex, Doa1, and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor Ubx2 are also implicated in the degradation process.

    The researchers further investigated the role of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in the turnover of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts. They found that ubiquitinated forms of these proteins accumulate in the mitochondrial pellet fraction under conditions of proteasome impairment. Deletion of the proteasome shuttling factor Ddi1 did not affect the degradation of these proteins, distinguishing MAD from ER-associated degradation (ERAD).

    Overall, this study reveals a unique QC pathway at the mitochondrial outer membrane that involves a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors. This pathway is distinct from other cellular QC pathways and provides new insights into the mechanisms of protein quality control in mitochondria. The findings have implications for our understanding of mitochondrial function and dysfunction in various diseases.

     Biomedical researchers have long understood the importance of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in regulating cell growth and tissue homeostasis. However, the mechanisms by which ERK activity is generated and propagated throughout tissues have remained unclear. To address this knowledge gap, a team of scientists used advanced imaging techniques to visualize ERK activity in the skin of living mice.

     The researchers created a special biosensor that allowed them to track ERK activity at the single-cell level in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. Under normal conditions, the epidermis occasionally exhibited bursts of ERK activity that spread radially from cell to cell. This phenomenon, dubbed "Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution" (SPREAD), was found to occur at a frequency that correlated with the rate of cell division in the epidermis.

     Further investigation revealed that SPREADs were stimulated by a compound called 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), which activates epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and their cognate ligands. The researchers also found that SPREADs were associated with the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, suggesting a link between ERK activity and cell proliferation.

     When the skin was wounded, ERK activation propagated as a "trigger wave" parallel to the wound edge, indicating that ERK activation can be superimposed on existing patterns of activity. These findings provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are coordinated in a living tissue.

     The study's results have significant implications for our understanding of tissue homeostasis and the regulation of cell growth. By visualizing ERK activity in real-time, the researchers have shed light on the complex dynamics of growth signal activation and propagation in the epidermis. This knowledge may ultimately contribute to the development of new treatments for skin disorders and other conditions characterized by abnormal cell growth.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how living organisms synchronize their internal biological clocks with the 24-hour day-night cycle. A team of researchers has made significant progress in this area by studying the circadian clock of cyanobacteria, a type of photosynthetic bacteria. The study found that the cyanobacterial circadian clock can be driven both in living cells and in a laboratory dish using purified proteins.

     The researchers discovered that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in response to light-dark cycles, tracking midday across conditions with variable day length. This means that the clock can adapt to changes in the day-night cycle, such as those that occur with the seasons. The study also found that the core biochemical oscillator, comprised of the Kai proteins, behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in a laboratory dish, indicating that the dynamics of the clock are intrinsic to these proteins.

     To understand how the circadian clock aligns with external cycles, the researchers developed a mathematical framework based on the instantaneous transformation of the clock cycle by external cues. This framework successfully predicts the behavior of the clock under many different cycling environments. The study suggests that the entrained behavior of the circadian clock can be captured quantitatively by a mathematical framework with a small number of parameters.

     The findings of this study have implications for understanding the molecular origins of key mathematical features of the circadian clock. The precisely defined nature of the cyanobacterial clock facilitates experiments that probe the molecular mechanisms underlying the clock's behavior. The researchers expect that the mathematical framework developed in this study will be useful for understanding the circadian clocks of other organisms as well. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of the circadian clock and its ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
Biomedical research has long sought to understand the causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD), a leading cause of premature death in the general population. Genome-wide association studies have identified the transcription factor Meis1 as a risk factor for SCD. A recent study investigated the role of Meis1 in the development and function of sympathetic neurons, which play a crucial role in regulating heart rhythm.

The study found that inactivating Meis1 in the neural crest of mice led to altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity in adults. This resulted in chronotropic incompetence and cardiac conduction defects, increasing the susceptibility to SCD. Further investigation revealed that Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation and that Meis1-deficient sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis from early embryonic stages to perinatal stages.

Meis1 was found to regulate the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery, and the traffic of Rab5+ endosomes was severely altered in Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons. This suggests that Meis1 interacts with various trophic factors signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons differentiation. The study also demonstrated that Meis1 acts independently of the well-studied network of transcription factors governing early specification of sympathetic neurons to orchestrate later phases of neuronal differentiation.

The loss of Meis1 function in early sympathetic neurons leads to an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions in adult mice, resulting in increased susceptibility to SCD. Following specific inactivation of Meis1 in peripheral neurons, the traffic of Rab5+ early endosomes is impaired, and sympathetic target-field innervation is compromised. These findings complement previous research demonstrating Meis1's role in regulating neonatal cardiomyocytes mitosis, particularly following myocardial infarction.

The study highlights the importance of Meis1 in the development and function of sympathetic neurons and its potential role in mediating susceptibility to unexplained SCD. The results suggest that Meis1 is a novel actor in sympathetic neurons differentiation and that its dysfunction may contribute to the development of cardiac conduction defects and SCD. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying Meis1's role in cardiac regulation and its potential as a therapeutic target for preventing SCD.
summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the diverse shapes and structures of biofilms, complex communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces. Despite knowing the essential components required for biofilm formation, the mechanisms driving their surface morphology remained unclear. A recent study used a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate biofilm morphogenesis in Vibrio cholerae, a type of bacteria that causes cholera. The researchers found that mechanical instabilities, such as wrinkling and delamination, play a crucial role in shaping the surface morphology of growing biofilms. They also identified interfacial energy as a key driving force behind these mechanical instabilities, which dictate the creation and annihilation of new and existing interfaces within the biofilm.

     The study used a range of techniques, including mechanical measurements, theory and simulation, quantitative image analysis, and mutagenesis, to demonstrate the importance of mechanical instabilities in biofilm morphogenesis. The researchers showed that as biofilms grow, they can wrinkle and delaminate due to compressive stress, leading to changes in their surface topography. By manipulating the spatial distribution of mechanical stress, the researchers were able to alter the biofilm's surface morphology.

     The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of morphogenesis, the process by which tissues and organs take shape during development. The researchers suggest that the principles underlying biofilm morphogenesis, which rely on mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies, may be generally applicable to morphogenesis processes in higher organisms. This idea is supported by the fact that similar mechanical instabilities have been observed in other types of biofilms, such as those formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

     The study also highlights the potential of biofilms as a model system for investigating the role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis. By manipulating the mechanical properties of biofilms, researchers may be able to discover new genes and compounds that can alter biofilm morphology and address biofilm-related problems. Overall, the findings of this study provide new insights into the complex processes underlying biofilm morphogenesis and suggest that mechanical forces play a critical role in shaping the surface morphology of these complex bacterial communities.
Biomedical research has long sought to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of epileptic neuronal networks following severe seizures. A recent study has shed light on the role of the transcription factor NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor) in this process. NRSF is a crucial regulator of neuronal phenotype, and previous research has shown that interfering with its function can attenuate the development of epilepsy.

The study found that epilepsy-provoking seizures led to a significant increase in NRSF levels in the mature hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in seizure activity. However, surprisingly, this increase in NRSF levels resulted in the repression of only a small subset of potential NRSF target genes, approximately 10%. These repressed genes were rescued when NRSF binding to chromatin was blocked, indicating that NRSF is directly responsible for their repression.

Further investigation revealed that the subset of genes repressed by NRSF had mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, making them sensitive to moderate fluctuations in NRSF levels. This dynamic and selective regulation of NRSF target genes may play a critical role in influencing neuronal properties in both pathological and physiological contexts.

The study used large-scale transcriptome arrays, qPCR validation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to examine the basis of NRSF-dependent gene expression changes during epileptogenesis. The results showed that NRSF-regulated hippocampal genes included ion channels, receptors, calcium-related molecules, and other transcription factors that govern neuronal function and plasticity. These findings suggest that the repression of these genes by NRSF may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

The key findings of this study are that NRSF contributes to epileptogenesis by regulating a group of genes that critically influence neuronal function, and that only a small subset of potential NRSF target genes are actually repressed by the transcription factor in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy. The study also highlights the importance of dynamic and selective regulation of NRSF target genes in influencing neuronal properties in both pathological and physiological contexts.
Summary
     The mammalian olfactory system processes sensory information through parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb. To understand how these parallel pathways maintain or enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features, researchers investigated the differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tufted cells in mice. The study found that mitral and tufted cells have distinct lateral inhibitory circuits that reflect differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. These circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways.

     The olfactory system is similar to other sensory systems, such as the visual system, in that it uses parallel pathways to process sensory information. In the retina, feature selectivity in each ganglion cell type emerges due to its connectivity to specific bipolar and amacrine cell types. Similarly, in the olfactory system, differences in odor-evoked responses in mitral and tufted cells emerge due to differences in connectivity to olfactory sensory neurons and external tufted cells. The combination of activity-dependent lateral inhibition at both low and intermediate rates enables tufted and mitral cells to collectively encode odors better than either population alone and supports novel computations that are unlikely to occur with a single neuron type.

     The proposed mechanism of activity-dependent lateral inhibition in mitral and tufted cells involves the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges. This suggests that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways. The study provides new insights into how local circuits support feature selectivity in parallel streams and highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind parallel processing in sensory systems.
Summary
     The M2 muscarinic receptor is a prototypic model of allostery in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). However, the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allostery in this receptor are not well understood. To investigate this, researchers compared monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor to identify the allosteric properties gained in oligomers. Allosteric interactions were monitored using a FRET-based sensor and pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to prevent intramolecular effects.

     The study found that allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and primarily derived from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. In contrast, allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending on the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.

     The researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to examine electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery at the atomic level. The simulations started from the crystal structure of the monomeric M2 receptor occupied by the agonist iperoxo (4MQS). The ligand and accessory proteins were removed, and conformations of the receptor were sampled from a canonical ensemble accessible within a period of 30 ns.

     The study provides new insights into the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allostery in the M2 muscarinic receptor. The findings suggest that the complex behavior of oligomers is a key feature of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations. The study also highlights the importance of considering the oligomeric nature of GPCRs in understanding their allostery. The results have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting GPCRs.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a crucial role for the enzyme SETD2 in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the activation of the p53-mediated checkpoint. SETD2 is a histone-modifying enzyme that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a chromatin state that coordinates the DNA damage response. The study found that SETD2 is necessary for the activation of the ATM protein, a key regulator of the DNA damage response, following DNA damage. Additionally, SETD2 is required for the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments, which are essential for homologous recombination repair of DSBs.

The researchers used reporter assays to demonstrate that SETD2 is necessary for the DNA damage response (DDR) and that depletion of SETD2 impairs ATM activation and delays the recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DSBs. They also found that SETD2 is required for the recruitment of RAD51 to resected DNA 5' ends and that SETD2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of DSBs.

SETD2 mutations have been found in several cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The study found that SETD2-mutant ccRCC cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling and failed to activate p53, a master guardian of the genome that is rarely mutated in ccRCC. Despite the persistence of DNA lesions, SETD2-deficient cells showed decreased cell survival after DNA damage.

The researchers propose that SETD2 provides a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. They suggest that the loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53. This study provides new insights into the role of SETD2 in the DDR and highlights the importance of chromatin states in maintaining genome integrity. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanistic basis of the SETD2 impact on the DDR.
summary
     A recent study has identified a new mutation in the Rasgrp1 gene, known as Rasgrp1Anaef, which leads to the accumulation of a distinct population of T cells and the production of autoantibodies in mice. The Rasgrp1Anaef mutation is a missense variant that affects the EF-hand of the Rasgrp1 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor. This mutation results in the overexpression of CD44 on naïve T cells and the gradual accumulation of Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cells, which is dependent on the presence of B cells.

     In contrast to previously described autoimmune mutations in Rasgrp1, Zap70, or Lat, the Rasgrp1Anaef mutation has no detectable effect on thymocyte development in mice with normal TCR repertoires. However, it leads to the peripheral accumulation of a distinct population of Helios+ PD-1+ T-helper cells and the production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies. Unlike Rasgrp1 deletion, the Rasgrp1Anaef missense variant increases tonic mTOR signaling in naïve CD4+ T cells.

     The study reveals a new role for Rasgrp1 in the cell-intrinsic regulation of peripheral CD4+ T cells, dissociating this function from its well-known role in thymic positive selection. Biochemical and genetic studies identified overactive mTOR signaling within naïve CD4 T cells as a key component driving two abnormalities: the constitutive increase in CD44 expression in naïve CD4 T cells and the gradual accumulation of peripheral Helios+ CD44hi CD4 cells and autoantibodies.

     Genetic reduction of mTOR function in Rasgrp1Anaef mice normalizes CD44 expression on naïve CD4+ T cells and abolishes excessive accumulation of effector T cells and autoantibodies, demonstrating a central role for increased mTOR activity in driving immune dysregulation in Rasgrp1Anaef mice. The study highlights the importance of mTOR signaling in the regulation of CD4+ T cells and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases.
Biomedical researchers have investigated the role of Arid1a, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC is a common and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer, often driven by mutations in the Kras gene. The study used a mouse model to suppress Arid1a in adult acinar cells with oncogenic Kras mutations and found that this led to rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. In contrast, silencing Arid1a during embryogenesis, concurrent with KrasG12D activation, resulted in retention of acinar cell fate. These findings suggest that Arid1a acts as a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity.

Suppression of Arid1a in adult acinar cells with oncogenic Kras mutations accelerated acinar-to-ductal reprogramming and specification of mucinous pancreatic cancer precursor lesions, which could not be reversed by restoring endogenous Arid1a expression. This indicates that Arid1a can provide a potent barrier to Kras-driven acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and early-stage pancreatic neoplasia. The study also found that Arid1a loss enables a non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate that is dependent on cellular and genetic context.

The researchers sought to understand the mechanism by which Arid1a regulates pancreas cell identity. They found that perturbation of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex impacts the expression of SWI/SNF target genes. This implies that genomic areas rendered accessible by Arid1a harbor elements involved in preventing acinar-to-ductal trans-differentiation in the context of mutant Kras, a critical rate-limiting step in Kras-driven pancreatic neoplasia. The study's transcriptional and chromatin profiling data suggest that Arid1a disruption, in the presence of oncogenic Kras, reduces the chromatin accessibility of key transcription factors to the enhancers of genes needed to sustain acinar cell fate.

These findings collectively suggest that acute loss of Arid1a in the setting of a pre-existing Kras mutation rapidly perturbs the identity and function of pancreatic acinar cells, enhancing their sensitivity to metaplastic and PanIN-inducing signals stemming from oncogenic Kras. The study demonstrates that Arid1a depletion can modulate the early stages of pancreatic neoplasia in a context-specific manner that depends on the timing of Arid1a inactivation and the presence of oncogenic Kras.
Biomedical research has shown that social networks play a crucial role in buffering the effects of stress in many species. However, the absence of a social network can also be stressful. A recent study examined the effects of social isolation on neuroendocrine responses in mice and found that it alters the intrinsic properties of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in a sexually dimorphic fashion.

The study found that isolating preadolescent female mice from their littermates for less than 24 hours increased the first spike latency (FSL) and decreased the excitability of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons. In contrast, age-matched male mice did not exhibit these changes. Furthermore, subjecting either male or group-housed female mice to acute physical stress, such as swimming, increased FSL in both groups.

However, the increase in FSL following social isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone, and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. This suggests that the increase in FSL results in a decrease in the excitability of CRH neurons. The study's findings demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute physical stress, has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons.

The researchers used acute brain slices to examine the synaptic and intrinsic properties of identified CRH neurons in the PVN. They found that social isolation altered the biophysical properties of these neurons in female mice, but not in male mice. Specifically, social isolation increased FSL and decreased neuronal excitability in female mice, while acute physical stress increased FSL in both male and female mice.

The study also found that social isolation occluded the effects of acute physical stress on female mice, but had no effect on FSL in male mice. This suggests that female mice may interpret social isolation as a stress, while male mice do not. The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of the sex-specific effects of social isolation on neuroendocrine responses and highlight the need for further research in this area.
Biologists have long studied the protein hemoglobin (Hb) to understand how it adapts to different environments and body sizes in mammals. Hb plays a crucial role in delivering oxygen to tissues, and its ability to bind and release oxygen is influenced by two key factors: affinity and cooperativity. Affinity refers to how strongly Hb binds to oxygen, while cooperativity describes how the binding of one oxygen molecule affects the binding of subsequent molecules.

    Researchers have previously thought that only Hb affinity determined molecular adaptations in vertebrates. However, a new study suggests that both affinity and cooperativity are important for optimizing tissue oxygen delivery. The study used a mathematical model to analyze the relationship between cooperativity and affinity in Hb, creating a "biophysical Hill landscape." This landscape revealed that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all fall on a ridge of maximum cooperativity, allowing for fine-tuning of oxygen delivery to meet the distinct needs of different tissues.

    The study found that the maximum cooperativity point of Hb has been tuned during evolution to satisfy the particular physiological requirements of different tissues for oxygen supply. For example, Hb in small animals with high metabolic rates has lower affinity for oxygen than in large animals, reflecting the adaptive adjustment of tissue oxygen unloading by Hb. The study also found that the greater an animal's metabolic rate, the higher the observed maximum Hill cooperativity value of oxygen binding by Hb.

    Furthermore, an inverse linear correlation was found between the metabolic rate and Hb affinity. This means that as an animal's metabolic rate increases, its Hb affinity decreases, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery to tissues. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanism underlying body-size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb and highlight the importance of both affinity and cooperativity in optimizing tissue oxygen delivery. The results have significant implications for our understanding of how Hb adapts to different environments and body sizes in mammals.
summary
     Malaria infection begins when Plasmodium sporozoites are injected into the skin of a mammalian host by an Anopheles mosquito. To understand how sporozoites locate and enter a blood vessel, researchers used intravital microscopy in mice to study sporozoite motility and their interaction with dermal blood vessels. The study found that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: 'avascular motility' and 'perivascular motility'. Avascular motility is characterized by high speed and less confinement, allowing sporozoites to move freely in areas far from blood vessels. In contrast, perivascular motility is more constrained and occurs when sporozoites are near blood vessels.

     The researchers observed that the curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlighted the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site. The study found that mutant sporozoites with modest changes in motility pattern or speed had dramatic decreases in blood vessel invasion and infectivity. This suggests that exit from the inoculation site presents an important barrier for the sporozoite and is therefore an opportune time to intervene.

     The researchers used intravital microscopy to visualize sporozoites over the first 120 minutes after inoculation and found significant changes in their motility during this time frame. They also rendered sporozoites fluorescent to study the function of surface proteins in dermal parasite motility and blood vessel recognition. The study found that CSΔN sporozoites spent more time engaging with blood vessels but were unable to enter the blood circulation. In contrast, TRAP-VAL sporozoites had a slow gliding speed that significantly decreased the volume of tissue explored, resulting in a reduced ability to encounter blood vessels.

     The gliding motility of Plasmodium sporozoites is essential for their infectivity, and previous studies have observed sporozoite motility in the dermis. However, this study provides the first in-depth analysis of sporozoite motility over time. The findings suggest that sporozoites in the dermis exhibit two types of motility and that their motility can change in response to environmental signals encountered by the sporozoite. This study refines our understanding of how the sporozoite navigates through and out of the dermis and highlights the importance of modulating adhesive properties and gliding speed for successful exit from the inoculation site.
summary
     Biologists have long known that cells are organized into functional modules, which are groups of components that work together to perform specific tasks. These modules are crucial for cell function, but they are not always conserved across different species, suggesting that cells can evolve to perform the same functions with different proteins. A recent study investigated how cells adapt to the loss of a key component of the polarity module in budding yeast, a type of fungus. The researchers deleted the BEM1 gene, which is essential for cell polarization, and allowed the cells to evolve over 1,000 generations.

     Initially, the cells without BEM1 showed a rapid increase in fitness, followed by a slow recovery to nearly 90% of the fitness of their BEM1-containing ancestors. Genome sequencing and monitoring of cell polarization revealed a common evolutionary trajectory, with a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations that improved cell polarization by inactivating proteins. This suggests that cells can be robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions.

     The study found that the cells adapted to the loss of BEM1 by following a reproducible evolutionary trajectory, which could be largely explained by the interactions among the mutated genes. This led to a substantial recovery in the speed and accuracy of cell polarization. The researchers also observed that bem1∆ cells often contained more than one polarity site, suggesting that the positive feedback that ensures a single site of polarization is weaker.

     The deletion of BEM1 allowed the cells to reveal alternative, more evolutionarily ancient polarization modules. The study's results demonstrate that the multiple layers of regulation that allow cells to polarize rapidly and accurately also make it possible for them to adapt to strong perturbations. Under strong selective pressure, the larger target size for mutations that inactivate proteins favors evolutionary trajectories that remove components from modules over those that quantitatively alter their properties. This suggests that cells can evolve to perform the same functions with different proteins, and that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions.
Biomedical research has long sought to understand the neural mechanisms underlying economic decision-making. A recent study investigated the neural basis of economic commitment in humans, focusing on the role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in integrating value signals over time. In the study, participants made successive choices between goods or gambles with lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. The researchers found that the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) encoded stimulus value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value signals over time.

In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encoded stimulus value only when participants rejected or deferred accepting a prospect. Notably, dACC BOLD signals reflected two decision biases: a tendency to defer commitments to later and a tendency to weight potential losses more heavily than gains. These biases paradoxically maximized reward in the task. The findings offer new insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions and the computation of value in the mPFC.

Previous studies have examined the neural mechanisms of economic behavior by offering participants a succession of independent gambles or unrelated consumer choices. However, these studies did not account for the lasting consequences of economic decisions. The current study addressed this limitation by devising a task in which decisions involved commitment to an asset with enduring financial consequences. The researchers aimed to understand the computational mechanisms by which economic commitments are made in humans and to investigate their neural implementation in the reward circuitry of the mPFC.

The study used a multi-alternative choice task in which decisions had financial ramifications that persisted over prolonged episodes and could not be reversed. In half of the blocks, participants had to choose between accepting and deferring acceptance of a prospect. The results showed that the dACC encoded value when a prospect was excluded, while the rmPFC encoded value only during deferral. Joint consideration of the behavioral data and dACC activity allowed the researchers to pinpoint two pressures that shaped decisions in the task: a bias to defer until a later date and a bias to weight unfavorable options more heavily. These findings provide fresh insights into the neural mechanisms of economic decision-making and the computation of value in the mPFC.

     Biomedical researchers have discovered that paraspeckles, a type of nuclear body found in cells, play a crucial role in controlling gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. Paraspeckles are composed of long non-coding RNA, Neat1, and RNA-binding proteins, and are involved in the nuclear retention of mRNA containing inverted repeats of Alu sequences (IRAlu) in their 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). A recent study found that in pituitary cells, all components of paraspeckles, including four major proteins and Neat1, display a circadian expression pattern, meaning they follow a daily rhythm.

     The researchers inserted IRAlu into the 3'-UTR of a green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and found that it led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the EGFP mRNA. This effect was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted. In contrast, the insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, the researchers showed that IRAlu drove a circadian expression of EGFP protein.

     The study suggests that paraspeckles control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level due to their circadian expression. The researchers propose that paraspeckle bodies can rhythmically retain RNAs in the nucleus, leading to a rhythmic expression of the corresponding gene. This mechanism provides an additional layer of gene regulation by sequestering mature mRNAs within the nucleus.

     Previous studies have shown that two protein components of paraspeckles, NONO and SFPQ, display a circadian expression pattern in primary cultures of pituitary cells and a rat pituitary cell line. Furthermore, the disruption of paraspeckles led to a loss of rhythmic pattern in a few circadian genes, suggesting that paraspeckle retention plays a relevant role in circadian gene expression. The study highlights the importance of post-transcriptional circadian regulation in determining oscillations at the mRNA level.

     The researchers used a rat pituitary cell line to investigate whether paraspeckle bodies can rhythmically retain RNAs in the nucleus, leading to a rhythmic expression of the corresponding gene. They found that paraspeckles were rhythmically expressed in the cell line and that the insertion of IRAlu into the 3'-UTR of the EGFP gene led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the EGFP mRNA. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of circadian gene expression and highlights the role of paraspeckles in controlling gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.

     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in converting electrical signals into chemical communication. However, the molecules in the active zone that regulate VGCC function have remained poorly understood. A recent study has shed light on the role of Munc13, an active-zone protein essential for exocytosis, in controlling VGCC function.

     The study found that Munc13 interacts with VGCCs via a pair of basic residues in its C2B domain. This interaction is crucial for VGCC function, particularly during high-frequency action potential bursts and single action potential stimuli. The researchers demonstrated that eliminating this interaction by removing Munc13 or replacing it with a Munc13 C2B mutant altered VGCC's response to and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts and altered calcium influx from single action potential stimuli.

     The study's findings have significant implications for understanding how synaptic transmission is controlled. Munc13's ability to modulate VGCC function on millisecond to second time scales suggests that synaptic throughput can be actively controlled by VGCC-active-zone protein interactions. The researchers pinpointed a critical interaction site to two basic residues within the C2B domain of Munc13, which is orthogonal to the potential membrane-interacting loops of this domain.

     To test the significance of the Munc13-VGCC interaction, the researchers examined the impact of removing Munc13 on action potential-driven calcium influx in nerve terminals. They found that expression of an shRNA targeting the major cortical isoforms Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 led to a 94% or greater depletion of this protein at nerve terminals, resulting in complete block of exocytosis.

     The study's results suggest that Munc13's interaction with VGCCs is essential for VGCC channel reactivation in nerve terminals. The researchers conclude that this interaction site in Munc13's C2B domain mediates VGCC channel reactivation, highlighting a novel form of synaptic modulation. The findings have broad implications for understanding how synaptic transmission is controlled and how Munc13 impacts information transfer at nerve terminals.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the intricate shapes of plant cells, particularly the puzzle-shaped cells found in the epidermis of many plant species. These cells, characterized by their lobes and indentations, have been observed in various plant organs and species, but their functional benefit has remained unclear. A new study proposes that these complex cell shapes serve as an effective strategy to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis.

The researchers suggest that in tissues that grow isotropically, or in all directions, puzzle-shaped cells emerge to prevent the formation of large, isodiametric cells that would bulge under the stress produced by turgor pressure. Turgor pressure is the force exerted by water within plant cells, which can reach up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaf cells and up to 50 bar in specialized cells such as stomata.

To test this hypothesis, the researchers analyzed data from various plant organs and species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, and used simulation models to show that a mechanism actively regulating cellular stress plausibly reproduces the development of epidermal cell shape. The results suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis.

The study proposes that the puzzle-shaped cells seen in the epidermis of many plant species emerge from a mechanism that evolved to limit mechanical stress in tissues that grow isotropically, such as the epidermis of leaves and cotyledons. Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis of 3D pressurized cells shows that cell shape influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell wall. When an epidermal cell becomes large in two directions, stress is greatly increased.

In contrast, puzzle-shaped cells with lobes and indentations provide a solution to this problem by avoiding large open areas in the cell and the high stresses they induce. The researchers found a strict correspondence between fruit shape and puzzle-shaped epidermal cells, which fits the prediction of their model that puzzle shapes are required to allow cells to enlarge in isotropically growing tissues, but are not required in elongated organs.

The study's findings suggest that plant cells regulate their shape to prevent their LEC, a proxy for stress, from becoming too large. The researchers propose a different function for the puzzle shape, that it is an adaptation to a developmental constraint related to the mechanical forces that act on turgid plant cells that reside in the epidermis.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how human cells accurately assemble the complex molecular machinery needed to remove non-coding regions (introns) from pre-mRNA molecules and connect the remaining coding regions (exons). A crucial step in this process is the assembly of pre-spliceosomes, which are composed of various subcomplexes that work together to facilitate splicing. Recent research has shed light on how these subcomplexes interact with each other and with the pre-mRNA molecule to promote accurate and efficient splicing.

     The study found that the U1 subcomplex, which binds to the 5' splice site of an intron, plays a key role in recruiting the U2 subcomplex to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. Interestingly, the presence of U1 bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron significantly increases the rate and efficiency of U2 recruitment, suggesting a synergistic effect between cross-intron interactions. This synergy is thought to be important for promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.

     The researchers used a technique called CoSMoS to observe the dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplexes on individual pre-mRNA molecules in human cell extracts. They found that the binding of U1 to the 5' splice site is largely unaffected by the presence of U2 binding sites positioned either downstream or upstream of the 5' splice site. This suggests that pre-spliceosomes can form on multi-intron pre-mRNAs through at least two different pathways: direct cross-intron interactions or cross-exon interactions, where the exons flanking an intron are first defined, followed by cross-intron interactions between adjacent cross-exon complexes.

     The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying accurate and efficient splicing. The findings suggest that the collaboration between flanking 5' splice sites is a major contributor to exon inclusion and that this collaboration dramatically increases the rate of stable U2 recruitment during pre-spliceosome formation. This research has important implications for our understanding of the complex process of splicing and may ultimately contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for genetic disorders related to splicing defects.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a novel folding assistance system for membrane proteins that operates on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This system relies on ubiquitination, a process where a molecule called ubiquitin is attached to a specific lysine on the protein. In the case of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6, ubiquitination on a specific lysine, Lys-1403, helps the protein fold correctly. If folding is successful, the ubiquitin is removed by a deubiquitinating enzyme called USP19, allowing the protein to exit the ER. This process is similar to the glucosylation-deglucosylation cycle that occurs in the ER lumen during the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle.

     The researchers found that if LRP6 fails to fold correctly, it is polyubiquitinated on other lysines and targeted for degradation. However, if the protein is successfully folded, it undergoes palmitoylation, a process that helps it exit the ER. This ubiquitin-dependent folding system is not unique to LRP6 and appears to operate on other membrane proteins, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the anthrax toxin receptor 2. These proteins are involved in severe human diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and hyaline fibromatosis syndrome.

     The researchers propose that the ubiquitination of LRP6 on Lys-1403 interacts with a ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaperone, providing the protein with time to fold correctly. If folding is successful, the ubiquitin is removed by USP19, allowing the protein to exit the ER. This discovery highlights the importance of ubiquitination in the folding of membrane proteins and provides new insights into the regulation of protein quality control in the ER. The ubiquitin-dependent folding system may have implications for the treatment of diseases caused by misfolded membrane proteins.
Biomedical research has shown that sex differences in cognitive processes can contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. A key area of interest is value-based decision making, where sex differences have been proposed but often result in minimal differences in overall performance between sexes. However, computational tools can uncover latent variables that define different decision-making approaches, even in animals with similar correct performance.

     In a study using mice, researchers examined sex differences in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision-making task, the restless two-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, often getting "stuck" in exploration once they started. In contrast, female mice explored less but learned more quickly during exploration.

     The results suggest that sex exerts a stronger influence on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. This is significant because exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities. The neural mechanisms of exploration may be a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

     The study used a combination of computational modeling approaches to characterize sex differences in a canonical explore/exploit task. While males and females had similar performance, they used different latent explore-exploit strategies to learn about the dynamic environment. Post-hoc win-stay lose-shift analyses revealed that female mice displayed more win-stay behaviors, indicating that they were more likely than males to repeat behaviors that produced reward on the previous trial.

     The findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences in cognitive processes, particularly during periods of learning and exploration. The results have implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of exploration and how they contribute to sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between sex, explore-exploit states, and reward outcomes that influence animal choices.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the process of endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD), where misfolded or damaged membrane proteins are extracted from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and degraded by the proteasome. A crucial step in this process is the movement of hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments from the phospholipid bilayer into the cytosol, often accompanied by hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts. However, the mechanism by which this occurs has remained unclear.

    A recent study used a reconstituted system with purified proteins from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the role of the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 in ERAD. The results show that Doa10 acts as a retrotranslocase, facilitating the extraction of membrane proteins from the ER. The study found that the TM segment of a substrate protein interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10, allowing it to passively move into the aqueous phase. In contrast, luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, with their unfolding occurring on the luminal side of the membrane due to the action of the cytoplasmic Cdc48 ATPase.

    This study provides new insights into the ERAD process, revealing how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains. The findings have implications for our understanding of protein quality control pathways in the ER and other organelles, where membrane proteins are removed from the organelle for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol. The study also sheds light on the long-standing question of whether luminal domains are moved across the membrane in a folded state or if they are unfolded prior to retrotranslocation.

    The researchers used a reconstituted system to investigate ERAD mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 from S. cerevisiae. Doa10 is a 150 kDa protein with 14 transmembrane segments, and the study shows that it is a retrotranslocase that facilitates the extraction of membrane proteins from the ER. The results demonstrate that Doa10 cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains, providing new insights into the ERAD process. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of protein quality control pathways in the ER and other organelles.
summary
     Biologists have long understood that Hedgehog (Hh) proteins play a crucial role in guiding development and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. However, the exact mechanisms by which Hh proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells have been unclear. A recent study in Drosophila (fruit flies) has shed new light on this process.

     In Drosophila wing imaginal discs, Hh proteins are expressed in posterior compartment cells and signal to a band of anterior cells at the anterior-posterior (AP) border. Normally, Hh proteins inhibit the proteolytic processing of full-length Cubitus interruptus (Ci) protein, a transcriptional repressor, and activate the full-length Ci protein to induce transcriptional changes. However, a new study has found that Hh can signal normally in the absence of regulated Ci processing.

     The researchers created Ci variants that cannot be processed and expressed them at physiological levels in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. They found that these Ci variants supported a normal pattern of graded target gene activation and the development of adults with normal wing morphology, provided a constitutive source of Ci repressor was present to suppress ectopic dpp expression in anterior cells. This suggests that Ci can mediate normal Hh morphogen action in wing discs in the complete absence of regulated processing.

     The study also found that processing-resistant Ci variants were significantly activated in the absence of Hh by elimination of Cos2 or PKA, revealing separate inhibitory roles of these two components in addition to their well-established roles in promoting Ci processing. Furthermore, the researchers found that wing patterning by Hh does not require regulation of the level of either repressor or full-length Ci protein by processing.

     These findings have significant implications for our understanding of Hh signaling and its role in development and disease. Aberrant Hh protein production, distribution, and responses are common causes of developmental birth defects and cancer, including holoprosencephaly, limb and digit abnormalities, medulloblastoma, and basal cell carcinoma. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying Hh signaling may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for these diseases.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the complex neuronal circuits in the spinal cord dorsal horn that process sensory information and contribute to pain perception. A recent study used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate spinal interneurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR). The results show that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling, directly relaying signals to lamina I projection neurons.

     The study found that photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in significant nocifensive behavior, which was sensitive to morphine and caused a conditioned place aversion. This behavior was also enhanced by spared nerve injury. In contrast, halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition of these interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. These findings suggest that dorsal horn circuits involving excitatory CR neurons play a crucial role in the generation and amplification of pain signals.

     The research confirms that CR neurons form an excitatory dorsal horn network that contributes to spinal pain signaling and can amplify pain signals in the absence of peripheral input. The strong interconnectivity of this neurochemically-defined subpopulation in the dorsal horn positions them to alter incoming sensory information prior to its relay to higher brain centers. This capacity is demonstrated in the nocifensive responses elicited by spinal photostimulation.

     The study's findings are consistent with current models of dorsal horn microcircuitry, which place CR neurons in a polysynaptic circuit that signals through SOM neurons to activate lamina I projection neurons and initiate pain signaling. The research extends our understanding of excitatory interneurons in spinal sensory processing, which has traditionally been seen as playing a limited role in linking low-threshold modality (innocuous) tactile input to excite more dorsal nociceptive circuitry.

     The study's optogenetic approach allowed for the selective activation of CR interneurons, providing new insights into their functional roles in sensory experience. Future work will focus on determining how these circuits respond during peripherally evoked sensory processing, as well as exploring the potential of CR interneurons as a future analgesic target.
summary
     Biomedical research has shed light on the role of Ras-associated binding protein 23 (RAB23) in regulating early osteogenesis, the process of bone formation. Mutations in the RAB23 gene cause Carpenter Syndrome, a condition characterized by developmental abnormalities, including polysyndactyly and skull morphogenesis defects. To understand how RAB23 regulates skull development, researchers generated mice deficient in RAB23 and studied their skeletal development.

     The RAB23-deficient mice exhibited premature fusion of multiple sutures, resulting from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. Further investigation revealed that FGF10-driven FGFR1 signaling was elevated in RAB23-deficient mice, leading to an imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog signaling, and RUNX2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling normalized osteoprogenitor proliferation, reduced osteogenic gene expression, and prevented craniosynostosis.

     The study found that RAB23 regulates the sutural stem cell niche marker GLI1, represses Hedgehog signaling, and inhibits osteoprogenitor expansion. RAB23 also represses FGF10-driven pERK1/2 signaling, which directly regulates osteoprogenitor development, RUNX2-mediated differentiation, and represses GLI1. These findings suggest that RAB23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating FGF-ERK1/2-RUNX2 activity and the activation of GLI1.

     RAB23 controls suture morphogenesis and patency through three mechanisms: FGF10-pERK1/2 signaling, the repression of Hedgehog targets through a canonical pathway, and the repression of GLI1 by pERK1/2. GLI1 contributes to the regulation of the mesenchymal stem cell niche, while FGF10-pERK1/2 and Hedgehog-GLI1 signaling regulate osteoprogenitor cell proliferation. The study's findings provide new insights into the role of RAB23 in regulating early osteogenesis and suggest potential therapeutic targets for conditions characterized by abnormal bone formation.
Biologists have long sought to understand how cells "remember" past events, such as environmental or developmental cues, to influence gene expression. A key player in this process is the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants. PRC2 modifies chromatin at its targets, and these modifications can be inherited through cell division. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance directs long-term memory of individual gene expression states (cis memory) or if local chromatin states are dictated by diffusible factors (trans memory).

    To address this question, researchers studied the Arabidopsis gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a Polycomb target gene involved in vernalization, the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure. Vernalization is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of FLC. By monitoring the expression of two copies of FLC in the same plants, the researchers found that one copy can be repressed while the other is active, and this "mixed" expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop. These data demonstrate that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored not in trans but in cis, meaning that the local chromatin environment of the gene itself instructs its own epigenetic inheritance.

    The researchers used an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of FLC expression states at the single-cell level. They crossed FLC-mCherry to FLC-Venus plants to generate F1 hybrids carrying a single copy of each transgene. In a trans-based memory system, the only possible heritable expression states of FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry are ON/ON and OFF/OFF, because epigenetic information is stored as a diffusible signal. However, the researchers found that FLC repression requires PRC2 but is independent of DNA methylation, making it a useful system for studying the cis-memory storage capability of Polycomb at a single gene. In vernalized plants, FLC expression is bistable, with the number of cells in which FLC is stably repressed increasing quantitatively with the duration of prior cold exposure.

    These findings provide evidence that Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own inheritance and constitute a cis memory system. This challenges the idea that epigenetic memory is solely stored in trans, through the concentrations of diffusible regulatory factors. Instead, the local chromatin environment of individual genes, such as FLC, can store epigenetic memory, allowing cells to "remember" past events and influence gene expression accordingly.
BiP, a heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) chaperone located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis. Recent research has shed light on the physiological modulation of BiP activity through its oligomerization. Using site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking, scientists have found that BiP oligomers consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, which attenuates the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP.

Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapid and reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers. This suggests that the oligomeric form of BiP is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone that is accessible on a short timescale. The findings are consistent with a model where competition between oligomerization and substrate binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load.

Calcium depletion in the lumen of the ER causes rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding. This indicates that the oligomers are relatively inert. The equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale, which is not attainable by inter-conversion of active and covalently-modified BiP or the conventional unfolded protein response.

The research suggests that BiP oligomerization is rapidly tuned to the physiological state of the cell. Given that oligomerization inactivates participating BiP protomers, the oligomeric form is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone. The findings are consistent with a scenario where BiP favors itself as a client (oligomerizing) over other clients when calcium levels in the ER decline. This shift in equilibrium between unfolded proteins and active chaperones would favor the former.

The inverse correlation between unfolded protein burden and BiP oligomerization appears to break down in the context of ER calcium depletion, which is both a strong inducer of the unfolded protein response and promotes rapid oligomerization of BiP. The study provides a coherent picture of how enhanced production of unfolded proteins rapidly draws on the pool of inactive, oligomeric BiP to service its growing clientele.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have determined the near-atomic structure of a flexible filamentous plant virus called Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) using a technique called electron cryomicroscopy. PepMV is a representative of the genus Potexvirus, which includes economically important plant pathogens. The virus particle is composed of several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein (CP) that protects a single-stranded RNA molecule.

     The researchers found that the structure of PepMV CP is similar to that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the genus Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped viruses with a segmented single-stranded RNA genome. The NPs from phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) protected inside an envelope.

     The main difference between the CP of PepMV and the NP of phleboviruses is in their C-terminal extensions, which determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies. The CP of PepMV forms a flexuous, helical rod, while the NP of phleboviruses forms a loose ribonucleoprotein.

     The homology between the CP of PepMV and the NP of phleboviruses suggests that there may have been gene transfer between eukaryotic positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Flexible filamentous viruses are ubiquitous plant pathogens that have a significant impact on agriculture. Their infective particles are non-enveloped and flexible rod-shaped virions that contain several hundred copies of a CP arranged in a helical fashion protecting a positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecule.

     The researchers were able to model the CP of PepMV and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of NPs from the genus Phlebovirus. The study provides new insights into the structure and function of flexible filamentous viruses and highlights the potential for gene transfer between different types of viruses.
Biomedical researchers have developed a new method for precisely locating the binding sites of antibodies on cell surfaces. This technique, called SiteLoc, uses topological image averaging to achieve nanometer-scale resolution and can be applied to various molecular distance estimations. The method involves calculating the average distance between a bound ligand and a reference surface, allowing for accurate localization of binding sites on native cell surfaces.

Traditional methods for epitope identification are often costly, time-consuming, and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis. These limitations hinder the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. The new SiteLoc method addresses these challenges by providing a fast and efficient way to screen epitope locations on cell surfaces. This is particularly important for understanding the immunological outcome of host-target interactions, as the location of an epitope can significantly impact the effectiveness of an antibody or vaccine.

The SiteLoc method uses high-resolution images to determine the location of binding sites on cell surfaces. By averaging the fluorescent signal along a cell contour, the method can accurately estimate molecular heights on both spherical and non-spherical cellular surfaces. This is a significant improvement over existing techniques, which are often designed for identical or spherical particles and are not suited for unaltered cells with varying surface morphology.

The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of SiteLoc by localizing the binding site of a non-specific monoclonal IgG antibody (Xolair) on the M protein of bacteria. The results agreed well with previously reported data, indicating that the antibody Fc binding site is located at the S region of the M protein. The SiteLoc method has the potential to revolutionize the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines by providing a fast and efficient way to screen epitope locations on cell surfaces. This could lead to improved understanding of the immunological outcome of host-target interactions and the development of more effective treatments.
summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of systemic vascular pressure regulation in vertebrates, with peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds playing a key role. However, the relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance remains unclear, particularly in the context of hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation. A recent study has shed light on this relationship by investigating the role of peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing in the skin, a large vascular bed, in response to hypoxia in mice.

     The study found that the skin's response to hypoxia, mediated by the HIF (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor) transcription factors, has a significant impact on systemic cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature. Specifically, the study demonstrated that the loss of HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression in keratinocytes, the primary cell type in the skin, resulted in altered cardiovascular responses to hypoxia, including changes in systemic blood pressures and cutaneous temperatures.

     The researchers used a 10% oxygen challenge to induce hypoxia in mice and observed the effects on cardiovascular parameters. They found that mice lacking HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NOS2, and Arg-1 expression in the epidermis showed significant changes in systemic blood pressures and cutaneous temperatures compared to littermate control animals. The study also proposed a model for hypoxic responses involving HIF isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in the skin, which suggests that hypoxia results in an initial HIF-1α/NOS2/NO-mediated increase in vascular diameter and resulting increases in perfusion, followed by a HIF-2α/Arginase-induced reduction of intracellular L-arginine.

     These findings represent the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in a peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to the challenge of hypoxia. The study highlights the importance of peripheral tissues, such as the skin, in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia and provides new insights into the complex relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance. The results have significant implications for our understanding of how the body responds to oxygen deprivation and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating hypoxia-related disorders.
Biomedical researchers have developed a new method for mapping the connections between individual neurons in the brain with high precision. This technique, called cellular resolution circuit mapping, uses a light-sensitive protein called channelrhodopsin (ChR2) to activate specific neurons and study their connections. By combining ChR2 with a technique called temporal focusing, which expands a beam of light in the imaging plane, researchers can selectively target individual neurons and their proximal dendrites. This approach allows for the reliable generation of action potentials in single neurons, which can be verified using a calcium indicator called GCaMP6s. Additionally, patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings can be used to determine the presence or absence of synaptic connections between neurons.

The previous methods for optogenetic mapping, which use ChR2 and other light-sensitive proteins, have limitations. These methods can activate not only the targeted neuron but also nearby fibers of passage or local axonal boutons, making it difficult to obtain accurate circuit maps. Furthermore, the expression of ChR2 throughout the dendritic and axon terminal fields can lead to unintended light-induced electrical responses.

The new method described in this study overcomes these limitations by restricting ChR2 expression to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. This allows researchers to selectively target individual neurons and their immediate connections, providing a reliable method for evaluating synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution. The synaptic organization of individual neurons into circuits is essential for interpreting sensory input and producing behavioral responses. Understanding the precise patterns of connectivity among different types of neurons is critical for elucidating circuit function, and this new method provides a valuable tool for achieving this goal. By enabling the mapping of functional connectivity with single-cell resolution, this technique has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of neural circuits and their role in various physiological and pathological processes.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand how transcription factors (TFs) interact with DNA in eukaryotic genomes. Two TFs, Sox2 and Oct4, have been studied extensively, with previous research suggesting an ordered assembly of these proteins on DNA. However, a new analysis of single-molecule data from living cells reveals that the interaction between Sox2 and Oct4 is not ordered assembly, but rather negative reciprocity.

     Negative reciprocity means that the expression of Sox2 increases the genomic binding of Oct4, but the expression of Oct4 decreases the binding of Sox2. This finding was unexpected and suggests that TFs like Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit different cooperativities at different genomic loci. The analysis also implies that single-molecule methods can provide novel detection capabilities for understanding the complex interactions between TFs and DNA.

     The genomic-diversity model, which accounts for the variation in sign of cooperativity across the genome, suggests that Sox2 and Oct4 sometimes help and sometimes hinder each other across the genome. This finding has significant ramifications, indicating that single-molecule data can provide more information than previously expected. In fact, a single number, Γ=-0.22, can suggest that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit both positive and negative cooperativity across genomic loci in vivo.

     The implications of this finding are that there may be energy expenditure behind the scenes that maintains loci at which Sox2 and Oct4 bind away from thermodynamic equilibrium, or there may be mixed cooperativity across the genome, with Sox2 and Oct4 helping each other through positive cooperativity at some loci and hindering each other through negative cooperativity at other loci. These possibilities suggest unexpected complexity in how TFs interact on DNA, and future studies will be needed to address the implications of this finding. The single-molecule methods used in this research offer exciting capabilities for unraveling such mechanisms and understanding the complex interactions between TFs and DNA.
Biomedical researchers have long understood the importance of detecting pathogens and mounting an immune response to prevent infection. However, this response comes at a high metabolic cost, and avoiding pathogens before infection may be advantageous. A team of scientists investigated whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect bacterial endotoxins, specifically lipopolysaccharides (LPS), before infection. They focused on Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, to study this phenomenon.

The researchers found that Drosophila display strong aversive responses to LPS and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors mediate avoidance of LPS in feeding and egg-laying assays. They discovered that the expression of the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. Furthermore, LPS stimulates Drosophila neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells. These findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation as a conserved molecular mechanism.

The study showed that LPS is avoided during feeding and oviposition, and that dTrpA1 expression in bitter-sensing gustatory neurons is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. This suggests that a TRPA1-dependent mechanism of avoidance of LPS may serve flies to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria. The researchers also found that control animals, but not dTrpA1-/- mutants, preferred laying eggs on control food rather than on food contaminated with LPS.

The team tested whether TRPA1 mediates gustatory avoidance of LPS in flies and found that blocking neurotransmission in gustatory neurons by expressing the light chain of tetanus toxin abolished avoidance of LPS. This indicates that flies can detect LPS through a gustatory mechanism. The study demonstrates that fruit flies possess a gustatory mechanism underlying the detection and avoidance of LPS. The avoidance of LPS-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals. The findings suggest a broadly conserved principle whereby dTRPA1 channels play a crucial role in LPS detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of the particular sensory modality involved.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the mechanisms governing the maturation of naïve T lymphocytes, a critical component of the immune system. A recent study has identified a zinc finger protein, Zfp335, as an essential regulator of this process. Mice with a hypomorphic mutation in Zfp335 exhibit a deficiency in naïve T cells due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins in the thymus and continues into the periphery. This defect affects T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress.

     The effects of Zfp335 mutation are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation, or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target gene, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation.

     The study analyzed mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation in a C2H2 zinc finger of Zfp335, revealing a selective defect in the accumulation of naïve T cells resulting from a maturation block in SP thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants. Zfp335 regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes, and a set of Zfp335 target genes was identified in thymocytes. Decreased Zfp335 occupancy at a subset of these targets alters gene expression in mutant thymocytes, providing evidence that Zfp335 functions as a transcription factor and key regulator of a transcriptional program required for T cell maturation.

     Ankle2 was identified as a functional target gene of Zfp335, and its dysregulation by Zfp335 contributes to the maturation defect in mutant T cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed reduced Ankle2 transcript levels in thymocyte and naïve T cell populations from mutant mice. Western blot analysis confirmed reduced Ankle2 protein levels in mutant thymocytes. Restoring Ankle2 expression partially rescues T cell maturation, indicating its functional relevance to the T cell maturation defect in Zfp335 mutant mice.
Summary
     Biologists have long assumed that the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) in a cell directly correlates with the amount of protein produced. However, research has shown that this is not always the case. A team of scientists has identified a new factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, which plays a significant role in controlling protein expression levels in bacteria and archaea.

     mRNA:ncRNA avoidance refers to the tendency of mRNAs to avoid interacting with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The researchers found that this avoidance increases translational efficiency, or the rate at which mRNAs are translated into proteins. They also discovered that the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions has a greater impact on protein abundance than other factors, such as mRNA structure and codon usage.

     The team generated synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions and found that GFP levels correlated well with interaction avoidance. This suggests that taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account can enable precise modulation of protein abundance.

     The researchers analyzed data from 97% of species and found a reduced capacity for interaction between native RNAs relative to controls. They also generated synonymously variant GFP mRNAs that differ in their potential to interact with core ncRNAs and demonstrated that GFP expression levels can be both predicted and controlled.

     The study found that there is strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes. However, the complete avoidance of stochastic interactions is combinatorially unlikely, suggesting a tradeoff between avoidance and optimal expression. The researchers predict that taking crosstalk between mRNAs and ncRNAs into account will enable the design of constructs where protein expression levels can be precisely controlled.

     A meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data revealed a strong correlation between mRNA:ncRNA avoidance and protein abundance. The study suggests that mRNAs with low avoidance values will produce fewer proteins for each mRNA transcript than those with high avoidance. Overall, the research provides new insights into the regulation of protein expression in bacteria and archaea and highlights the importance of considering mRNA:ncRNA interactions in the design of genetic constructs.
summary
     Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons. A key pathological event in ALS is the denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), which is observed in both patients and animal models of the disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of NMJ denervation in ALS are not well understood.

     Researchers used in vivo imaging to study the dynamics of NMJ denervation in a mouse model of ALS over a three-month period. They found that single motor units (MUs) are dismantled asynchronously, meaning that the loss of NMJs occurs at different times within a single MU. This suggests that NMJ denervation is a complex and dynamic process, rather than a simple manifestation of global motor neuron degeneration.

     The study revealed that weeks before complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by new axonal sprouting, resulting in the formation of new synapses onto nearby NMJs. This indicates that NMJ denervation is not a one-way process, but rather a continuous process of denervation and new innervation.

     The researchers also found that denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, suggesting that factors extrinsic to motor neurons, such as neuromuscular factors, contribute to NMJ denervation. Additionally, distal branches of axons are more susceptible to denervation than proximal branches.

     These findings have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for ALS. The study highlights a long temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global motor axon degeneration, which could be exploited to prevent or slow disease progression. However, the rescue of neuronal loss in SOD1 mice does not necessarily improve NMJ denervation, suggesting that local branch-specific events may play a key role in NMJ denervation.

     Overall, this study provides new insights into the complex and dynamic process of NMJ denervation in ALS, and highlights the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms of this disease.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the mechanisms behind the side effects of tamoxifen, a hormone therapy used to treat breast cancer. While tamoxifen improves survival rates, long-term treatment can lead to unpleasant symptoms such as hot flashes, bone density changes, and fatigue. However, the tissues and cells responsible for these side effects have remained unclear due to a lack of suitable animal models.

     A recent study used mice to investigate the effects of tamoxifen on physiology. The researchers found that mice treated with tamoxifen exhibited changes in body temperature, bone density, and movement. To understand the underlying mechanisms, the researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-POA) of the mice. This analysis revealed widespread changes in gene expression in response to tamoxifen treatment.

     The researchers discovered that estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA. Conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA abolished or reversed the gene expression changes induced by tamoxifen. Furthermore, ERα-deficient mice did not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in body temperature, bone density, or movement. These findings suggest that ERα signaling in the central nervous system is necessary for the physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment.

     The study also found that ERα expression in the hypothalamus-POA is necessary for the effects of tamoxifen on thermoregulation, bone density, and movement. The researchers propose that tamoxifen treatment modulates ERα signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology and health. Given the known roles of ERα in mediating various physiological processes, the study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms behind the side effects of tamoxifen treatment.

     The study's results have significant implications for understanding the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and the role of ERα in mediating these effects. The findings suggest that ERα signaling in the central nervous system is a key mediator of the physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind the side effects of tamoxifen and to develop strategies to mitigate these effects in patients undergoing hormone therapy.
summary
     ISG15, a protein produced in response to interferon, has been found to play a crucial role in defending against Listeria monocytogenes infection. Research has shown that ISG15 expression is dramatically induced in non-phagocytic cells upon Listeria infection, and this induction can occur independently of type I interferon. The induction of ISG15 is mediated by the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA and triggers a signaling cascade involving STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7.

     The study found that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo. To understand the mechanism behind this restriction, the researchers used stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC) to identify proteins that are modified by ISG15. They discovered that ISG15 modification of ER and Golgi proteins leads to increased secretion of cytokines that counteract infection.

     Specifically, the researchers found that ISG15 modification of ER and Golgi proteins results in the increased secretion of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, which are known to counteract Listeria infection. This suggests that ISG15 plays a key role in the innate immune response to Listeria infection.

     The study also found that ISG15 expression is induced in an interferon-independent manner in human non-phagocytic cells. This is significant because it suggests that ISG15 can be induced in response to Listeria infection without the need for interferon signaling. The researchers used a viral protein, B18R, to block interferon signaling and found that ISG15 expression was still induced in response to Listeria infection.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of ISG15 in defending against Listeria infection and highlights the importance of ISG15 in the innate immune response. The findings suggest that ISG15 is a key component of the host defense against Listeria and that its modification of ER and Golgi proteins plays a critical role in restricting infection.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers use a technique called single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, analyzing the large amounts of data produced by this method has been a challenge. To address this issue, a new software called DeepFRET has been developed. DeepFRET uses deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to rapidly and accurately classify smFRET data.

     DeepFRET is an open-source software that can analyze raw microscope images and output histograms of biomolecule behavior. The only human intervention required is setting a quality threshold for the data. The software integrates standard features of smFRET analysis and outputs common kinetic information metrics. In tests, DeepFRET achieved an accuracy of over 95% in classifying ground truth data, outperforming human operators and other commonly used threshold methods. It also required significantly less time to analyze the data, taking only about 1% of the time needed by human operators.

     DeepFRET's neural network was trained using simulated or high-quality annotated experimental data. The software can be used for various applications, including biomolecular recognition, protein folding and dynamics, and super-resolution imaging. Its development is expected to enable new fully automated analysis methodologies in structural biology. DeepFRET is available as a free-to-use standalone executable for both Windows and Mac users, making it accessible to researchers with limited programming skills.

     Deep learning-based analysis has several advantages over other approaches. It can recognize abstract patterns and learn useful features directly from raw input data, reducing the need for extensive data preprocessing or empirically defined rules. This leads to reproducible and less opinionated evaluation of single-molecule data. DeepFRET's improved classification was achieved without any preprocessing or post-inspection of data, demonstrating its potential to benchmark the reproducibility of smFRET data acquisition methods for multiple biomolecular systems across laboratories. The software's performance was quantified using a confusion matrix, which showed a high level of agreement between the ground truth data and the data selected and classified by DeepFRET.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a key protein called SCML2 that plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. SCML2 is part of a complex called Polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1), which helps determine which genes are turned on or off in cells. The study found that SCML2 binds to PRC1 through a specific region called the SPM domain and also interacts with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) through a novel region called the RNA-binding region (RBR). This interaction with ncRNAs is essential for SCML2's ability to target specific genes and repress their expression.

     The researchers discovered that SCML2's ability to bind to chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes, relies on the coordinated action of its MBT domains, RNA-binding activity, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduced the occupancy of SCML2 at target genes, and overexpression of a mutant SCML2 lacking the RBR caused defects in PRC1 recruitment. These findings suggest that ncRNAs play a role in regulating SCML2 function and that SCML2 participates in the epigenetic control of transcription directly and in cooperation with PRC1.

     The study also found that SCML2 can enforce repression directly, independent of PRC1 recruitment, at a subset of genes. This suggests that SCML2 has multiple mechanisms for repressing gene expression. The identification of SCML2 as a Polycomb group protein that binds RNA and contributes to repression of Polycomb targets sheds new light on the interplay between ncRNAs and epigenetic regulation.

     The researchers propose a model in which the RBR contributes to the localization of SCML2 to chromatin, where it interacts with PRC1 and creates a chromatin environment that is refractory to transcription. This model suggests that SCML2 is recruited to target genes through a process that requires its RNA-binding activity and that the presence of mutant SCML2 lacking the RBR causes a partial release of PRC1 from chromatin. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation and the role of ncRNAs in controlling gene expression.
summary
     Biologists have long understood that ribosomes play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by controlling the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins. In Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria, the SecM protein regulates the SecA-dependent secretion pathway by causing ribosomes to stall during translation. However, the exact mechanism of this stalling process was not well understood until now.

     Researchers used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the structure of ribosomes stalled by SecM at a resolution of 3.3-3.7 angstroms. This allowed them to identify two distinct mechanisms of stalling that occur at different stages of the translation cycle. The first mechanism involves the inactivation of the peptidyl-transferase center (PTC), which is responsible for forming peptide bonds between amino acids. The second mechanism involves the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site, which prevents the full-scale translocation of transfer RNA (tRNA).

     The researchers used an in vitro translation system from E. coli to purify ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) stalled by SecM and analyzed their structures using cryo-EM. They found that the SecM protein interacts with the ribosome in a way that causes conformational changes in the 23S rRNA nucleotides, leading to the inactivation of the PTC. This inactivation prevents the stable binding and accommodation of the incoming A-site tRNA, causing the ribosome to stall.

     The researchers also identified two predominant forms of stalled ribosomes, one in the post-state and the other in the hybrid rotated state. They found that a collection of interactions between SecM and the exit tunnel cooperatively induce conformational changes of the PTC, leading to translation arrest at distinct elongation steps. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of SecM-dependent translational stalling and demonstrate how regulatory peptides can control the translation cycle by dynamically reshaping the functional center of the ribosome.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers used a new imaging technique called Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to study the cone photoreceptors in the fovea of the human eye. The fovea is the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision. The study found that the density of cone photoreceptors in the fovea varies with the length of the eye. In longer eyes, the foveal cone mosaic is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to the eye length. This means that longer eyes have more cone photoreceptors packed into a smaller area at the fovea.

     The researchers also found that people with myopia, or nearsightedness, have a higher angular sampling density of cone photoreceptors in and around the fovea compared to people with normal vision. This suggests that myopes may have better visual acuity than emmetropes, or people with normal vision, despite reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes. The study's findings contradict the idea that increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression is the cause of visual deficits in myopes.

     The researchers used a new generation of Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The study provides the first measures of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes. The findings have implications for our understanding of the physical and visual effects of eye length on vision.

     Previous studies have implicated retinal stretching as a possible cause of myopic visual deficits, but the structural changes at the foveal center during myopic progression were not well understood. The current study aimed to investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density at and near the foveal center. The researchers found that the foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. This suggests that the retina is not stretched uniformly during myopic progression.

     The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the relationship between eye length and visual acuity. The results suggest that myopes may have better visual acuity than emmetropes, despite reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes. The study's findings also contradict the idea that increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression is the cause of visual deficits in myopes. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between eye length and visual acuity.
Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the factors that influence the duration of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage in the nasopharynx. This bacterium is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, particularly in low-income settings, and asymptomatic carriage is a prerequisite for disease. A new study has developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combined these results with whole genome sequence data.

The analysis revealed that genomic variation in S. pneumoniae accounted for 63% of the variation in carriage duration, while host traits such as age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The study further partitioned this heritability into lineage and locus effects, identifying serotype, drug-resistance, and other significant locus effects as the largest sources of variation in carriage duration. Specifically, serotype accounted for 17% of the variation, drug-resistance accounted for 9%, and other locus effects accounted for 7%.

A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration, independent of serotype. This suggests that prophage sequences may disrupt the competence mechanism, which is essential for the bacterium's ability to acquire new genetic material. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.

The study's analysis of heritability shows that variants other than serotype affect carriage duration, consistent with recent theoretical work. The researchers have identified candidates for the loci that contribute to this effect and suggest that variants in the pneumococcal genome alter carriage duration, which is linked to antibiotic resistance. The study provides a quantitative estimate of how closely transmission pairs share their carriage duration and shows evidence for differences both between and within serotypes.

The findings imply that the genetics of S. pneumoniae is an important factor in determining carriage duration in this population. However, the heritability estimate may differ if environmental conditions, such as host vaccination status, are associated with streptococcal genotype between populations. The study's results have significant implications for our understanding of pneumococcal disease and the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies.
Summary
     The slow delayed rectifier current (IKs) plays a crucial role in stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration in the heart. This current is conducted by the tetrameric voltage-gated ion channel KCNQ1 and its β-subunit KCNE1. However, the stoichiometry between α and β-subunits has been a topic of controversy, with some studies suggesting a strict 2:4 ratio and others proposing a variable ratio up to 4:4.

     To clarify this issue, researchers created fusion channels where KCNE1 was linked to one, two, or four KCNQ1 subunits. These channels were evaluated in mammalian cells using whole cell patch clamp, single-channel recordings, and UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid approaches. The results showed that channels with two or four KCNQ1 subunits linked to KCNE1 (EQQ and EQQQQ) had increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to channels with one KCNQ1 subunit linked to KCNE1 (EQ). These effects were abolished by the addition of KCNE1.

     Furthermore, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, the researchers found that EQQQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates were progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, indicating that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex. This suggests that the flexibility in KCNQ1's β-subunits association allows for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression.

     The findings of this study demonstrate a KCNE1:KCNQ1 stoichiometry of up to 4:4, resolving the controversy surrounding the ratio of α and β-subunits in the IKs channel complex. This discovery has important implications for understanding the regulation of repolarization in the heart and may provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying cardiac arrhythmias and other heart conditions.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the cellular responses to injury that enable complete tissue regeneration. A recent study in zebrafish has shed light on the role of interleukin-1 beta (Il1b) in this process. Il1b is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is typically associated with inflammation and tissue damage. However, the study found that Il1b plays a crucial role in the regeneration of the zebrafish fin fold.

     The researchers discovered that Il1b is expressed by epithelial cells in response to tissue injury and initiates an inflammatory response. This response is necessary for the survival of regenerative cells, which are essential for tissue regeneration. The study also found that macrophages, a type of immune cell, are responsible for attenuating Il1b expression and resolving the inflammatory response. This process is critical for the proper progression of tissue regeneration.

     The study revealed that Il1b signaling acts as a double-edged sword in tissue regeneration. While it is necessary for regeneration, excessive Il1b signaling can impair tissue regeneration. The researchers found that a proper level of Il1b expression and the inflammatory response, which are tuned by macrophages, are necessary for the progression of tissue regeneration.

     The study also highlighted the importance of macrophages in tissue regeneration. Macrophages were found to play a critical role in attenuating Il1b expression and resolving the inflammatory response. The researchers demonstrated that genetic ablation of macrophages in adult zebrafish affects fin ray patterning and fin growth, underscoring the importance of these cells in tissue regeneration.

     The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of tissue regeneration and the role of Il1b in this process. The study suggests that a delicate balance of Il1b expression and the inflammatory response is necessary for proper tissue regeneration. This knowledge may have important implications for the development of therapies aimed at promoting tissue regeneration in humans.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the surface properties of ribosomes may impose limits on the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome in prokaryotic cells. The study used surface-modified fluorescent proteins (FPs) to investigate the dependence of protein mobility on protein surface properties and ionic strength in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Haloferax volcanii. The results indicate that the translational diffusion coefficient (D) of proteins in E. coli depends on the net charge and its distribution over the protein surface, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative ones. This effect is weaker in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening.

In E. coli, the decrease in mobility is primarily caused by the interaction of positive FPs with ribosomes, as shown in in vivo diffusion measurements and confirmed in vitro with purified ribosomes. The binding of positive proteins to ribosomes is a non-selective interaction, with dissociation constants (KD) on the order of micromolar. This finding suggests that ribosome surface properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome.

The study also found that in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii, the slowdown in diffusion with increasing positive surface charge is less pronounced due to electrostatic screening. The diffusion coefficients of proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli depend on their net charge and the distribution of charge over the protein surface, with positive proteins moving up to 100-fold slower. The diffusion becomes even slower when cells are exposed to an osmotic upshift.

The researchers analyzed the proteomes of E. coli, L. lactis, Hfx. volcanii, and four endosymbiotic bacteria to determine the consequences of their findings. They found that ribosomal proteins with a net charge of more than +10 experience a drop in diffusion coefficient of more than 5-fold. The study highlights the importance of ribosome surface properties in limiting the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome and has implications for understanding the functioning of prokaryotic endosymbionts.
summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the ability of certain animals, such as planarians, to regenerate lost body parts. However, the mechanisms that trigger this regenerative process are not yet fully understood. A recent study has shed new light on this process by identifying a key molecule called Smed-follistatin, which is required for regeneration in planarians. Smed-follistatin is a homolog of a protein called follistatin, which is known to inhibit the activity of another protein called Activin.

     The researchers found that when Smed-follistatin is inhibited, planarians are unable to regenerate lost tissue, but are still able to undergo normal tissue turnover. This suggests that Smed-follistatin plays a specific role in triggering the regenerative response. The study also found that two Activin homologs, Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2, are required for the Smed-follistatin phenotype, indicating that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-Activin proteins to trigger regeneration.

     The researchers also discovered that Smed-follistatin is wound-induced and is expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence. This suggests that Smed-follistatin is specifically activated in response to injuries that result in the loss of tissue. The study proposes that wound-induced Smed-follistatin expression allows for regenerative responses to be initiated specifically as a consequence of tissue absence.

     The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of regeneration in animals. Regeneration is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple cell types and signaling pathways. The identification of Smed-follistatin as a key regulator of regeneration provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. The study suggests that the inhibition of Activin signaling by Smed-follistatin is a critical step in triggering the regenerative response, and that this response is specifically activated in response to injuries that result in tissue absence.

     The results of this study have broad implications for our understanding of regeneration across the animal kingdom. Regeneration is an essential process that allows animals to recover from injury and maintain tissue homeostasis. The identification of Smed-follistatin as a key regulator of regeneration in planarians provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, and highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between different signaling pathways in the regulation of regeneration.
Biomedical researchers have identified a distinct genetic signature in tumors that are deficient in mismatch repair (MMR), a process that corrects errors in DNA replication. This signature is characterized by a high frequency of indel mutations, which are insertions or deletions of one or more nucleotides, particularly in mono- and di-nucleotide repeats. The researchers used whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing to analyze 33 tumor-normal pairs, of which 25 were MMR-deficient. They found that MMR-deficient tumors had a significantly higher number of somatic mutations, with an average of 2015 mutations per tumor, compared to 39 in MMR-proficient tumors.

The researchers also identified a set of recurrent indels that may serve as markers for microsatellite instability (MSI), a condition associated with MMR deficiency. They developed a novel marker set that can detect MSI with greater specificity and selectivity than standard tests. Furthermore, they found that recurrent indels are enriched for the DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination pathway, suggesting that MMR-deficient tumors may be more sensitive to DNA double-strand break inducers.

The study's findings have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of MMR-deficient tumors. MMR-deficient tumors are often resistant to standard chemotherapy, but the researchers showed that they are sensitive to DNA double-strand break inducers. This suggests that targeting MMR-deficient tumors with DNA double-strand break inducers may be an effective therapeutic strategy. Additionally, the novel marker set developed in this study may improve the detection of MSI and MMR deficiency in tumors.

The researchers also found that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises from mutations that escape MMR. This suggests that MMR plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability and that its deficiency can lead to a unique set of mutations. The study's findings provide new insights into the biology of MMR-deficient tumors and may lead to the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these tumors.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have developed an improved version of a tool called Magnets, which is used for optogenetics in mammalian cells. Optogenetics is a technique that uses light to control biological processes in a non-invasive way. Magnets are small modules made from a protein called Vivid, which is found in the fungus Neurospora crassa. They work by forming a dimer, or pair, when exposed to light, allowing for precise control over biological processes.

     The original Magnets required concatemerization, a process where multiple copies of the protein are linked together, to function efficiently. They also needed to be preincubated at a low temperature of 28°C to work properly. To overcome these limitations, the researchers engineered an optimized version of Magnets, called eMags, which do not require concatemerization or low-temperature preincubation.

     The eMags were validated by using them to recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, induce organelle contacts, and reconstitute a process called OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering, which is involved in the transport and metabolism of a type of lipid called phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. The results show that eMags are a highly effective tool for optogenetically manipulating physiological processes in mammalian cells.

     The eMags were engineered by introducing complementary charges to the Vivid homodimer, resulting in two components called nMag and pMag. These components are small, fast-acting, and can be fused to a wide range of proteins. The eMags have greater thermal stability and dimerization efficiency, as well as faster association and dissociation kinetics compared to the original Magnets.

     The researchers used a variety of applications to test the effectiveness of eMags, including protein recruitment to different organelles, the generation and expansion of organelle contact sites, and the rapid and reversible reconstitution of VAP-dependent inter-organelle tethers. The results demonstrate that eMags are a powerful tool for optogenetic manipulation of biological processes in mammalian cells.
Activation of GCN2 Kinase by Ribosome Stalling Links Translation Elongation with Initiation
     Researchers have long known that ribosome stalling during protein synthesis can lead to neurodegeneration, but the underlying signaling pathways were unknown. A recent study investigated the effects of ribosome stalling in mice with a genetic mutation that causes elongation complexes to stall at specific codons. The study found that the GCN2 kinase is activated in response to ribosome stalling, leading to the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the induction of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway.

     The researchers used a unique mouse model with the Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mutation to study the effects of ribosome stalling. They found that GCN2 is activated in the brain of these mice in a tRNA-deacylation-independent manner, prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. Activation of GCN2 results in the phosphorylation of eIF2α and the induction of ATF4-target genes in the cerebellum and hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice.

     The study also demonstrated that GCN2 activation functions to attenuate neurodegeneration in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain. This suggests that ribosome stalling activates GCN2 as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that links the elongation and initiation steps of translation. Failure to resolve stalled elongation complexes in mammalian neurons results in degeneration of these cells, but the signaling pathways evoked by these complexes were previously unknown.

     The researchers found that the eIF2α/ATF4 pathway is vital for the survival of neurons during ribosome stalling. In the hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-; Gcn2-/- mice, they observed degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells that is not observed in B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice. ATF4 activation also occurs in the brains of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice in which the n-Tr20 is entirely deleted and thus no unprocessed tRNA is produced. These results raise the possibility that ribosome stalling may also contribute to GCN2 activation in other conditions, such as amino acid deprivation, in which lower levels of acylated tRNA are present. The exact mechanism for GCN2 activation by ribosome stalling remains unclear.

     Over the past century, adult height has changed substantially and unevenly across the world's countries, with no indication of convergence. A reanalysis of 1472 population-based studies involving over 18.6 million participants found that the largest gains in adult height occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm and 16.5 cm taller, respectively, over the past century. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia.

     The tallest people over the past century were men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, with an average height of 182.5 cm, while the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896, with an average height of 140.3 cm. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was approximately 19-20 cm a century ago and has remained the same for women and increased for men over the past century.

     Changes in adult height varied drastically across countries. While European men's heights increased significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries, the largest gains since the 1896 birth cohort occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men. Women in Norway, Iceland, the USA, and American Samoa were also taller than 158 cm. In contrast, women in El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, South Korea, and Japan were among the shortest, with an average height of 140.3 cm.

     The tallest populations a century ago lived in Central and Northern Europe, North America, and some Pacific islands. Men born in Sweden, Norway, and the USA surpassed 171 cm, while Swedish women had an average adult height of 160.3 cm. In contrast, men born in 1996 in the Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, and Denmark surpassed an average height of 181 cm, with Dutch men being the tallest people on the planet at 182.5 cm. The gap with the shortest countries, including Timor-Leste, Yemen, and Laos, increased by approximately 4 cm over the past century.

Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite virus, hepatitis D virus (HDV), infect liver cells. These viruses cause significant public health problems worldwide, and co-infection with both viruses can lead to more severe disease. A key step in the infection process is the binding of the viruses to a receptor on the surface of liver cells. However, the identity of this receptor has remained unknown.

     To identify the receptor, scientists used a combination of biochemical and virological approaches. They created a synthetic peptide that mimics a region of the HBV and HDV proteins and used it to probe the surface of liver cells. This revealed a specific interaction between the peptide and a protein called sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). NTCP is a multiple transmembrane transporter that is predominantly expressed in the liver.

     Further experiments confirmed that NTCP interacts with the large envelope protein of HBV and HDV and functions as a common receptor for both viruses. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for entry of both viruses, and it is believed to mediate viral interaction with the cellular receptor on hepatocytes.

     To test the role of NTCP in viral infection, scientists silenced the gene that encodes NTCP in liver cells and found that this inhibited HBV and HDV infection. Conversely, expressing NTCP in cells that are normally resistant to these viruses made them susceptible to infection. This suggests that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.

     The researchers also identified a specific region of NTCP, amino acids 157-165, that is crucial for binding to the receptor-binding region of the pre-S1 domain of the HBV and HDV proteins. This region is highly conserved among different strains of the viruses, which may explain why NTCP is a common receptor for both viruses. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HBV and HDV infection and may lead to the development of new treatments for these diseases.

     Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to an infection, can have long-lasting effects on the body's immune system, particularly on memory CD8 T cells. These cells play a crucial role in fighting off infections by rapidly recognizing and killing infected cells. Research has shown that sepsis can impair the function of memory CD8 T cells, making individuals more susceptible to re-infection.

     A recent study investigated the effects of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells in patients and mice. The study found that sepsis leads to an increase in the proliferation of central memory CD8 T cells (TCM), a type of memory CD8 T cell, in both patients and mice. This increase in proliferation results in a change in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool, with TCM becoming over-represented.

     The study also found that the increased proliferation of TCM leads to changes in the localization of memory CD8 T cells, with some cells moving to different tissues. Furthermore, the study showed that memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors have an altered transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility, indicating long-lasting changes in the cells.

     These changes in the memory CD8 T cell pool and transcriptional landscape result in altered T cell function and a reduced capacity to control infections. Specifically, the study found that memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors were less effective at controlling Listeria monocytogenes infection.

     The study's findings suggest that sepsis leads to long-term changes in the phenotype, function, and localization of memory CD8 T cells, potentially changing the host's ability to respond to re-infection. The increased proliferation of TCM and the resulting changes in the memory CD8 T cell pool may contribute to the increased susceptibility to re-infection observed in sepsis survivors. Overall, the study provides new insights into the long-term effects of sepsis on the immune system and highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying these changes.
Biomedical researchers have long been aware of the threat posed by Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition to human genomes. To counter this threat, human cells have evolved mechanisms to regulate L1 retrotransposition. One such mechanism involves the APOBEC3 (A3) gene family, which consists of seven enzymes that catalyze the deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides in single-strand DNA substrates. Among these enzymes, APOBEC3A (A3A) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retrotransposition in cultured cell assays. However, the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained unclear.

Previous studies have shown that over-expression of the wild-type APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase protein (A3A) can potently inhibit L1 retrotransposition in cultured human cells. However, deamination events were not detected in L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of wild-type A3A. This has left the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition a mystery.

To elucidate this mechanism, researchers employed an in vitro assay that recapitulates the first strand cDNA synthesis step of the L1 integration. They found that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. This deamination leads to inexact TSDs (target site duplications) in the post-integration site.

Further experiments demonstrated that engineered L1 retrotransposition events derived from cultured human cells that co-express A3A and the uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (UGI) contain strand-specific, A3A-mediated C-to-U deamination events. These data indicate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration.

The degradation of deaminated retrotransposition intermediates could reduce L1 retrotransposition levels in cultured cell assays and eliminate evidence of A3A-mediated deamination events in the resultant retrotransposed L1 sequences. This scenario could explain why previous studies failed to detect A3A-mediated deamination events in engineered L1 retrotransposition events. Overall, these findings provide a mechanistic explanation of how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that sensory experience plays a crucial role in shaping neural circuitry by influencing synaptic connectivity and intrinsic properties of individual neurons. To understand how external stimuli are converted into altered neuronal output, it is essential to identify the molecular players involved in experience-dependent plasticity and circuit function. A recent study investigated the role of the activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity.

     The study found that mice lacking the Rem2 gene (Rem2-/- mice) failed to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, the research established a cell-autonomous role for Rem2 in regulating the intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. In vitro and in vivo recordings revealed increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. These findings demonstrate that Rem2 is a key molecule that regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience.

     Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity to preserve proper circuit function in the face of changing sensory experience. The study suggests that Rem2 may play an important role in regulating the absolute responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation, such as through regulation of neuronal excitability or synaptic scaling. To gain more insight into the circuit mechanisms underlying the observed ocular dominance plasticity deficits of Rem2-/- mice, the researchers examined adult ocular dominance plasticity.

     The study's findings provide an important step forward in connecting molecular regulators of neuronal morphology with broader circuit function. Given that Rem2 expression is acutely regulated by visual experience, the researchers sought to determine if Rem2 plays a role in activity-dependent processes in the visual cortex following sensory deprivation by investigating ocular dominance plasticity. The activity-regulated Ras-like GTPase Rem2 is an excellent candidate to link the activity of a neural circuit with functional plasticity. Rem2 is a member of the Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem/Kir (RGK) protein family, a Ras-related subfamily of small GTPases, whose expression and function are regulated by neuronal activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels.
Biomedical researchers have been exploring the possibility of using magnetic fields to control biological molecules and cells, a concept known as magnetogenetics. Recent studies have reported promising results, including the identification of a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals and the use of magnetic fields to control membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein. However, a closer examination of these claims reveals significant discrepancies with basic laws of physics.

The forces, torques, and temperatures produced by magnetic fields on biological molecules are too small by many orders of magnitude to achieve the desired effects on molecular orientation or membrane channels. If the reported phenomena were to occur, they would require entirely different mechanisms than those proposed by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes, such as ferritin, limits their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells.

One study reported the design of a molecular system intended to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane. The system consisted of a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel fused to two subunits of ferritin. The authors hoped that the paramagnetic protein would enable magnetic torque to tug open the channel and depolarize cells. Experimental results suggested that neural activity could be modulated by static magnetic fields, but the evidence was limited and difficult to interpret.

The biophysical mechanism underlying these effects is unclear. Ferritin is a large protein complex with 24 subunits that forms a spherical shell about 12 nm in diameter. Its paramagnetic nature would require extremely strong magnetic fields to produce significant effects, which is unlikely given the forces and torques produced by magnetic fields on biological molecules.

The study concludes that the proposed routes to magnetogenetics, based on either pulling or heating a ferritin/channel complex with magnetic fields, have no chance of success without dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter. The analysis highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the biophysical basis for magnetosensation and magnetogenetics, including the effects of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how stem cells switch between self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence, a state of dormancy. Drosophila neural progenitors, also known as neuroblasts, have been a valuable model system for studying self-renewal and differentiation. However, the mechanisms governing quiescence in these cells have remained poorly understood.

     A recent study has shed light on this process by investigating the role of the differentiation factor Prospero in Drosophila neuroblasts. The researchers found that when neuroblasts enter quiescence, the Prospero protein is transiently detected in the nucleus at low levels. This pulse of Prospero precedes the establishment of a unique molecular profile characterized by the absence of most progenitor and differentiation markers.

     The study demonstrated that loss of Prospero prevents neuroblasts from entering quiescence, while a pulse of low-level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. This suggests that Prospero levels may distinguish between three progenitor fates: the absence of Prospero for self-renewal, low levels for quiescence, and high levels for differentiation.

     The researchers used Drosophila neuroblasts as a model system to study the relationship between Prospero and quiescence. They found that nearly all neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hours after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers by 24 hours. Additionally, they showed that precocious low-level nuclear Prospero could advance the timing of neuroblast quiescence.

     The study also investigated whether Prospero is required for neuroblast entry into quiescence. By quantifying the number of EdU+ neuroblasts in prospero null mutant embryos, the researchers found that loss of Prospero can delay the timing of neuroblast quiescence. Furthermore, they observed that the pulse of nuclear Prospero precisely matched the timing of neuroblast quiescence, suggesting a functional relationship between the two.

     Overall, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms governing quiescence in Drosophila neuroblasts and highlights the importance of Prospero in regulating this process. The findings have implications for our understanding of stem cell biology and may inform the development of stem cell-based therapeutics.
Biomedical researchers have developed a new method to study the process of HIV-1 capsid uncoating, a critical step in the virus's life cycle. Using single-particle fluorescence microscopy, they were able to observe the uncoating kinetics of individual HIV capsids in real-time. This approach allowed them to identify the rate-limiting step of uncoating as the opening of the first defect in the capsid lattice, which is followed by a rapid and catastrophic collapse.

The researchers found that the capsid-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates the opening of the capsid but stabilizes the remaining lattice. In contrast, binding of a polyanion to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice delays the initiation of uncoating but does not prevent subsequent lattice disassembly. These findings suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently, and the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators determines the overall uncoating kinetics.

The study used an in vitro single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay to follow the uncoating kinetics of hundreds of individual HIV capsids in a single experiment. This approach allowed the researchers to resolve intermediates in the disassembly pathway that are otherwise averaged out in traditional ensemble assays. They observed that the integrity and stability of capsids in a population is highly heterogeneous, with the majority containing defects and/or uncoating immediately after removal of the viral membrane.

In the absence of capsid binders, uncoating is an all-or-none process that proceeds rapidly after the first defect is created. The researchers also found that the half-life of the HIV capsid is sufficiently long to use PFO-permeabilized viral particles as a platform to quantify the binding of labeled proteins to authentic viral capsids at the single-particle level. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 capsid uncoating and suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently with the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators determining the overall uncoating kinetics.
Biomedical research has identified the cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway as a potential tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Contrary to expectations, loss-of-function mutations in the JNK pathway are frequently found in breast cancer genomic DNA. These mutations were thought to be associated with reduced cell proliferation, but studies have shown that JNK signaling actually promotes cell growth by activating the AP1 transcription factor.

     To investigate the role of JNK signaling in breast cancer, researchers examined the effect of JNK deficiency in the murine breast epithelium. The results showed that loss of JNK signaling caused genomic instability and the development of breast cancer. Furthermore, JNK deficiency accelerated tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer, characterized by widespread early neoplasia and genomic instability.

     The study found that JNK plays a key role in the initiation of tumor development, rather than the growth of established tumors. This suggests that JNK pathway defects are 'driver' mutations that promote genome instability and tumor initiation. The frequent loss-of-function mutations in the JNK pathway in human breast cancer may therefore represent 'driver' mutations that promote tumor development.

     In contrast to the expected role of JNK signaling in promoting tumor growth, the results of this study indicate that JNK actually acts to prevent tumor initiation. The JNK signaling pathway may be suppressed in many breast cancers, and the association of breast cancer with reduced JNK signaling represents a correlation rather than a causal relationship.

     The study's major conclusions are that JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium can cause murine breast cancer, and that JNK deficiency rapidly accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of breast cancer. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the role of JNK signaling in breast cancer development and suggest that JNK pathway defects may be a key factor in the initiation of breast cancer.
summary
     A recent study has identified a crucial enzyme called peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) as essential for the formation of cilia in various cell types. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that play a vital role in sensing the environment and transmitting signals. The researchers found that PAM is necessary for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamydomonas, a type of algae, planaria, a type of flatworm, and mice.

     In Chlamydomonas, PAM knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered levels of cilia assembly components. Similarly, in planaria, decreased PAM gene expression reduced the density of motile cilia on the ventral surface and resulted in the appearance of cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. In mice, the architecture of primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in PAM-deficient embryos was also aberrant.

     The study suggests that PAM activity and alterations in post-Golgi trafficking contribute to the observed ciliogenesis defects. The researchers propose that PAM plays a key conserved role during the early steps of ciliogenesis, revealing a novel link between amidation and cilium assembly in multiple cell types. Amidation is the process of adding an amino group to a molecule, and PAM is responsible for this process in bioactive signaling peptides.

     The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of ciliogenesis and the role of PAM in this process. Cilia defects have been linked to various human diseases, including polycystic kidney disease and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Further research on PAM and its role in ciliogenesis may provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying these diseases and potentially lead to the development of new treatments. The study highlights the importance of PAM in ciliogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target for cilia-related disorders.
summary
     Biologists have long known that class III myosins (Myo3) and the actin-bundling protein Espin play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells. Defects in these proteins can lead to hereditary hearing impairments. Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif (THDI), but the exact mechanism of this interaction was unclear.

     Researchers have now discovered that Myo3 THDI contains two repeat sequences that can independently bind to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1 with high affinity. This binding mechanism, known as cross-linking, allows Myo3 to regulate the assembly and stabilization of actin bundles in stereocilia. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 have been elucidated, revealing a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism.

     The study also found that Myo3-mediated cross-linking can enhance the actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1. This is consistent with previous research suggesting that Myo3 binding can release auto-inhibition and increase the diameter of Espin1-promoted actin bundles. Myo3 and Espin1 have been shown to co-localize at the tips of stereocilia in hair cells, and co-expression of Myo3 and Espin1 can stimulate the elongation of stereocilia in cultured organ of Corti hair cells.

     The researchers propose that a key function of the Myo3/Espin1 interaction is to promote the formation of thicker parallel actin bundle fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia. The THDI region of Myo3 mediates binding to Espin1, allowing Myo3 to transport Espin1 to the tips of actin bundle-based structures. Once localized, Espin1 promotes the elongation of actin protrusions.

     The study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin binding-induced actin bundling activity regulation mechanism of an actin filament cross-linker protein. The full-length Myo3/Espin1 complex may have even higher actin fiber bundling activity than the Myo3-ABR12/Espin1 complex studied in this work. The findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of the Myo3 and Espin1 interaction and its role in the development and maintenance of stereocilia.
Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in various cellular functions, including synaptic transmission, muscle contraction, and gene expression. These channels translate membrane depolarization into calcium influx, enabling cells to respond to electrical signals. Researchers have long sought to understand the molecular mechanisms governing the specific voltage-sensing properties of these channels.

     To address this question, scientists used a combination of structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1.1. The study aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms governing specific voltage-sensing properties in these channels.

     The researchers generated advanced structure models of the activated and resting states of CaV1.1 VSDs, filling a gap in the understanding of voltage-sensing mechanisms in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels. The models were based on the cryo-EM structure of CaV1.1 and used the Rosetta computational modeling software to build a homology model of the human eukaryotic CaV1.1 channel.

     The study found that both VSDs displayed the typical features of the sliding helix model, but differed significantly in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed the kinetics. This mechanism provides a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.

     The researchers tested the interaction partners suggested by the model and found that they showed the predicted effects on channel gating when experimentally tested by mutagenesis and electrophysiology analysis. Conversely, alterations of kinetic properties first recognized experimentally were reliably reproduced and explained by the computer model. The structures of the lowest energy states of CaV1.1 VSDs display the basic features of the sliding helix model, supporting the understanding of voltage-sensing mechanisms in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels.
summary
     Biomedical research has long been interested in the adult brain's ability to undergo plastic changes, particularly in the context of recovery from injuries or improving learning and cognition. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been linked to juvenile experience-dependent primary visual cortex (V1) plasticity, but their role in this process in the adult V1 remains poorly understood. A recent study investigated the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected adult mice.

     The study found that 7-day application of an MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity in healthy animals. However, treatment with the MMP-inhibitor once, but not twice, following a stroke rescued plasticity, which is normally lost under these conditions. These findings suggest that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur.

     The study's results highlight a critical role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and suggest that upregulation of MMP-activity shortly after a cortical lesion compromises experience-induced visual plasticity, which can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. Precise regulation of MMP-activity appears to be essential for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain, offering new opportunities in treatment and recovery after stroke.

     The study's objective was to examine if MMPs are crucial for adult visual plasticity and if inhibition of their upregulation following cortical stroke may be beneficial for rescuing lost plasticity. A combination of in vivo optical imaging and behavioral vision tests revealed that an optimal level of MMP-activity is essential for adult visual plasticity to occur in the healthy and stroke-affected brain.

     The study's findings are consistent with previous research showing that MMP-activity supports healthy brain development and function, but a different outcome of MMP-action has been described for diseased brain. Increased MMP-activity was observed within 24 hours of a photothrombotically induced stroke, and application of a broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor at the time of the stroke partially rescued impaired barrel cortex plasticity.

     The study's results demonstrate a vital role of MMPs for adult visual cortex plasticity, particularly for the increase of open eye responses in V1 after monocular deprivation. The findings expand previous studies from juvenile rats and suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur. Overall, the study provides new insights into the critical role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and offers potential opportunities for treatment and recovery after stroke.
Biomedical research has made significant progress in understanding the structure and function of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors, a type of glutamate-gated ion channel involved in signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses. AMPA receptors are composed of four subunits that assemble as a dimer-of-dimers, and recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have provided full-length structures of these receptors, both alone and in combination with auxiliary subunits.

Studies have shown that the extracellular layer of AMPA receptors may undergo substantial lateral motions during gating, opening up along the central twofold symmetry axis. However, the presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Stargazin, has been found to limit this conformational flexibility. Using bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers, researchers were able to calibrate the conformations of functional AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of Stargazin. The results indicate that the extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can become trapped in stable, opened-up conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate.

In contrast, the presence of Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility, suggesting that under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of auxiliary proteins dominate, the extracellular domains of AMPA receptors are likely to remain compact during gating. This is consistent with the idea that AMPA receptors work in a fairly compact conformational regime during synaptic transmission, unless faced with long exposures to glutamate in pathological conditions.

Recent cryo-EM structures of AMPA receptors in complex with auxiliary subunits have been acquired in resting, active, and desensitized states, providing valuable insights into the structural dynamics of these receptors. However, the exact mechanisms underlying their rapid signaling are still unclear. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of auxiliary subunits in regulating the conformational flexibility of AMPA receptors and their function in synaptic transmission.
Biomedical researchers have long faced challenges in isolating immune cells from the intestines of mice infected with helminths, a type of parasitic worm. This is due to the strong immune response triggered by the infection, which leads to the production of mucus, tissue remodeling, and the infiltration of immune cells. A team of scientists has developed a new protocol to overcome this challenge, allowing them to isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.

To validate the accuracy of their protocol, the researchers used a high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel to analyze the isolated cells. This technique allowed them to identify many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection. The team also used confocal microscopy to confirm their findings, observing differences in cell ratios between naive and infected samples.

The new protocol and high-dimensional analysis enabled the researchers to characterize many known hallmarks of innate and adaptive anti-parasite immune responses, including the presence of specific immune cells such as B220+, Siglec F+, CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD4-, and CD64+ cells. These changes were observed locally, highlighting the importance of good cell isolation techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helminths directly.

The development of this protocol has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses, which have previously been unfeasible due to the difficulties in isolating immune cells from infected intestines. This breakthrough could lead to a better understanding of the complex interactions between helminths and the host immune system, ultimately contributing to the development of new treatments for helminth infections. The protocol's ability to accurately represent intestinal immune responses also opens up new avenues for research in the field of immunology.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have developed a new model to understand how the proteasome, a key enzyme involved in protein degradation, works. The proteasome plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including metabolism and the immune response. However, the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are not yet fully understood.

     To address this knowledge gap, the researchers used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to develop a comprehensive model of proteasome dynamics. They focused on the 20S proteasome, a dynamic enzyme whose activity changes over time due to interactions between substrates, products, and regulatory sites. The model predicted the locations of these sites and the interactions between them, which were experimentally confirmed.

     The analysis revealed that the rate-limiting step of protein degradation is the transport of substrates into the proteasome. This transport efficiency varies between human standard and immuno-proteasomes, affecting the total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage. The researchers used carefully designed experimental assays and detailed modeling to shed light on these mechanisms.

     The study used short fluorogenic peptides, which have a single proteasome-catalyzed cleavage site, to follow the kinetics of protein degradation in real-time. The results showed similar proteasome dynamics over time when using purified 20S proteasome or protein homogenates, suggesting that the model describes a core of proteasome features that could reflect proteasome dynamics in more complex cellular environments.

     The findings have implications for our understanding of protein degradation and its role in various cellular processes. Poly-ubiquitin tagging, transport, and peptide-bond hydrolysis regulate protein half-life and affect the majority of metabolic processes in the cell. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of proteasomal action, including the causes and extent of differences in substrate-specific proteolysis between different proteasome isoforms.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission. In Drosophila, histamine recycling is required for visual synaptic transmission. Histamine is rapidly taken up by laminar glia and converted to carcinine. Carcinine is then delivered back to photoreceptors, where it is hydrolyzed to release histamine and β-alanine. However, the mechanism by which β-alanine is returned to laminar glial cells was unclear.

     A new β-alanine transporter, named BalaT, has been identified in Drosophila. Null mutants of BalaT exhibited lower levels of β-alanine and reduced β-alanine accumulation in the retina. BalaT is expressed and required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. These results suggest that retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission and that a BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is necessary for histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission.

     The study found that BalaT functions in retinal pigment cells to recycle β-alanine. Disrupting histamine and carcinine synthesis abolishes photoreceptor synaptic transmission. While the transport of β-alanine seems less important, β-alanine recycling is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photoreceptor synaptic transmission. Establishing and maintaining a β-alanine pool also plays a key role in sustaining visual synaptic transmission.

     High levels of β-alanine were detected in retinal pigment cells, suggesting that pigment cells may be critical for the transport and storage of β-alanine. The study aimed to determine whether there was a β-alanine transporter required for Drosophila vision transmission. Mutations in BalaT disrupted transport and storage of β-alanine in the retina, resulting in reduced photoreceptor synaptic activity and visual behavior.

     The findings suggest a conserved function for β-alanine trafficking in mammals and Drosophila. The study provides evidence for a more complete histamine recycling pathway, which is critical for sustaining photoreceptor synaptic transmission. In this pathway, carcinine is synthesized in epithelial glial cells within the optic lamina and is transported back to photoreceptor cells via the synaptic cleft. The BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is essential for histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission in Drosophila.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the role of oxidants in aging and lifespan. A recent study used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to investigate the relationship between redox events and aging. The study found that chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse, resulting in the oxidation of over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. This redox collapse occurs several days before cell death and is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, as previously thought.

     Instead, the study suggests that a substantial drop in cellular NADPH levels is the primary cause of the redox collapse. NADPH normally provides the electron source for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. The decrease in NADPH levels occurs early in the aging process and sets off a cascade that down-regulates most cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a well-known lifespan-extending measure, was found to increase NADPH levels and delay the onset of the redox collapse.

     The study provides a timeline of events leading up to the system-wide oxidation of the proteome in aging yeast cells. The results suggest that chronological aging may represent a physiological stress condition that pushes the redox buffering capacity of the thiol proteome to its limits. The study also raises the possibility that the oxidation of certain key proteins may contribute to the beneficial down-regulation of cellular processes that would otherwise shorten lifespan.

     The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of aging in postmitotic cells. They suggest that the decrease in NADPH levels and the concomitant increase in cellular redox potential are not unique to yeast, but may be shared with other aging organisms whose metabolism changes. The study also highlights the potential of using yeast as a model system to uncover protein targets whose oxidative thiol modifications may contribute to the physiological alterations observed in aging organisms.
summary
     Biologists have long recognized the importance of homochirality in the biological macromolecular world, where molecules are predominantly composed of either left-handed (L) or right-handed (D) forms. To maintain this homochirality, cells have developed mechanisms to selectively remove D-amino acids that are mistakenly attached to transfer RNAs (tRNAs) during protein synthesis. A recent study has shed light on the molecular basis of one such mechanism, known as D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD), which is responsible for removing D-amino acids from tRNAs in the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

     The researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of DTD in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog. This revealed how the enzyme captures the chiral center of the incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA using a unique "cross-subunit" Gly-cisPro dipeptide. This dipeptide is inserted into the active site of the dimeric enzyme and plays a crucial role in recognizing the D-amino acid. Notably, no protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, and the enzyme's ability to act on multiple D-amino acids is due to a side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition.

     The study's findings provide a clear explanation for how DTD selectively removes D-amino acids from tRNAs while allowing L-amino acids to pass through. The researchers propose that the strict chiral specificity of DTD ensures that the cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs is enriched, preventing the incorporation of D-amino acids into proteins. This mechanism is essential for maintaining homochirality in proteins and preventing the incorporation of D-amino acids, which could disrupt protein function.

     The study's results also highlight the importance of weak hydrogen bonds in D-chirality selection. The researchers found that if an L-amino acid were to bind in the active site, it would have to adopt one of three possible conformations, making it less likely to be recognized by the enzyme. Overall, the study provides new insights into the enantioselective mechanism of DTD and its crucial role in enforcing homochirality in proteins.
summary
     The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride ion channel that is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CFTR channels are gated by cytosolic ATP, which induces the dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). This dimerization opens the pore, while disruption of ATP hydrolysis closes it. In wild-type CFTR, spontaneous openings without ATP are rare, but in certain CF mutants, they constitute the only gating mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator.

     Researchers have correlated energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening and closure in single CFTR channels. They found that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may occur even without ATP. This suggests that coordinated NBD/pore movements are intrinsic to CFTR, and ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations.

     The study shows that the presence of bound ATP does not alter the global arrangement of conformations, but rather acts as a'molecular glue' to stabilize the transition state and the open state. The researchers also found that the ligand binding site is occluded in open channels, making it impossible to define an open-state 'binding affinity'. This means that even when disruption of ATP hydrolysis forces CFTR channels to gate at equilibrium, that gating follows a reversible linear sequence, rather than a cycle subject to the principle of detailed balance.

     The study provides insights into the mechanism of CFTR channel opening and closure, and helps explain the effects of mutations, phosphorylation, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity. It also constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent channel gating, and understanding of the underlying driving forces, which are likely conserved among ABC proteins. The findings have implications for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms, and may lead to the development of new treatments for cystic fibrosis.
Biomedical researchers have identified a previously unknown force that drives the assembly of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. This force, referred to as the "orderphobic effect," arises from the interaction between the protein and the membrane's phase transition from an ordered to a disordered state. The study used large-scale molecular simulations to demonstrate that a protein embedded in an ordered membrane can stabilize a microscopic interface between the ordered and disordered phases. This interface has a finite stiffness, and when two such proteins approach each other, they assemble due to the reduction in interfacial energy.

The orderphobic effect is analogous to the hydrophobic effect, where the strength and range of the force depend on the protein's ability to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity. This ability is influenced by the proximity to the membrane's phase transition and the protein's size and hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane. The study found that a transmembrane protein with a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase can melt the ordered phase near the protein, resulting in the formation of an order-disorder interface.

The researchers also predicted that the orderphobic effect can lead to enhanced lipid mobility surrounding the protein, which may be experimentally testable using single molecule tracking techniques. The study's findings have implications for understanding the behavior of biological membranes and transmembrane proteins, which are complex systems with multiple components and multiple order-disorder transitions. The orderphobic effect is a dual phenomenon, where a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase can also induce order in its vicinity, leading to the formation of an order-disorder interface and a force for assembly.

The study's results suggest that the orderphobic effect is a significant force that can drive the assembly of transmembrane proteins, and its strength and range are larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity. The findings provide new insights into the behavior of biological membranes and transmembrane proteins, and may have implications for understanding various cellular processes, including protein-protein interactions and membrane organization.
Biomedical researchers have long used fluorescent calcium indicators to study neural dynamics, but the relationship between these indicators and action potentials (APs) has remained unclear. To address this, a recent study characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function in vivo for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. The researchers used simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings to investigate the relationship between APs and fluorescence signals.

The study found that under optimal conditions, most APs were detected, but under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected, often less than 10% and 20-30%, respectively. This highlights the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions. The researchers also noted that population imaging studies, which are necessary for studying large populations of neurons, compromise AP detection due to the large field of view and reduced photon flux per neuron.

To construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves, the researchers identified isolated AP events and summed APs over 250 ms. They found that only a minority of APs were used to construct these curves. The study also tested the performance of several spike inference models, detecting APs under optimal and less optimal conditions. The results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals and will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets.

The study's findings have implications for the use of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) in population imaging studies. GECIs are widely used with two-photon laser scanning microscopy to report neuronal activity within local populations in vivo. However, the study's results suggest that the relationship between APs and fluorescence signals is more complex than previously thought, and that AP detection is compromised under conditions typical of population imaging studies. The study's results will facilitate the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging studies using mainstream transgenic mouse lines, such as the Allen Institute's Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset.
summary
     Biologists have discovered a unique biological switching valve in the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. This valve allows females to control the direction of seminal flow, enabling them to receive multiple seminal packages from the same or different males within a short time span. The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females of Neotrogla have a penis-like intromittent organ that they use to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, which is not only used for fertilization but also serves as a source of nutrition for the female.

     The switching valve has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotrogla females to continue mating while the first slot is occupied. This adaptation enables females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla.

     In Neotrogla, males are held by the female's spiny penis during copulation, which can last up to 40-70 hours. This is significantly longer than in close relatives, where copulation lasts around 50 minutes. The long copulation duration in Neotrogla is thought to be an adaptation for females to obtain more semen from males. The switching valve allows females to selectively use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other slot empty. This enables them to immediately receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males.

     The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus. Female-female competition for males to receive nutritious seminal substances is considered a key factor driving the evolution of the female penis in Neotrogla. In contrast, a closely related species lacking genital structure reversal, Lepinotus patruelis, has a much shorter copulation duration of 50 minutes. The female penis of Neotrogla bears spines, which females use to anchor males coercively during copulation, likely to obtain more semen.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the complex process of synaptic exocytosis, the release of neurotransmitters from neurons. A crucial step in this process is the assembly of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins, which couple their stage-wise folding and assembly to rapid exocytosis. However, the functions of the different assembly stages and the role of Munc18-1, a protein that regulates SNARE assembly, were not well understood.

    Using optical tweezers, researchers observed four distinct stages of assembly in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively). They found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly, with the NTD and CTD responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, and the MD regulating SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures the t-SNARE C-terminus independent of the syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD.

    The researchers used optical tweezers to study the forces associated with Munc18-1-mediated de novo SNARE assembly. They found that Munc18-1 enhances de novo SNARE assembly by holding the SNAP-25 molecule together with the tethered syntaxin or VAMP2 as the t-SNARE complex unfolds. In the absence of Munc18-1, no SNARE reassembly was observed due to dissociation of the SNAP-25 molecule. In contrast, in the presence of Munc18-1, 45% of completely unfolded SNARE complexes showed full reassembly.

    The researchers also observed three force-dependent activities of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly, consistent with previously reported multiple modes of binding between Munc18-1 and the SNARE complex. They propose a working model to account for the multiple roles of Munc18-1 in stage-wise SNARE zippering and membrane fusion. According to this model, Munc18-1 regulates every stage of SNARE assembly, from initiation to stabilization of the half-zippered SNARE complex. The researchers conclude that Munc18-1 mainly acts on the folding intermediates of SNAREs to chaperone their assembly. This study provides new insights into the complex process of synaptic exocytosis and the role of Munc18-1 in regulating SNARE assembly.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how cells form diverse adhesion sites on their surface to interact with the extracellular matrix. These adhesion sites, called focal adhesions, are crucial for cell movement, growth, and signaling. A team of researchers investigated how the integrin adhesome, a group of proteins that make up focal adhesions, assembles into these sites.

     The study found that the integrin adhesome is already pre-assembled in the cell's cytosol as multi-protein building blocks. These building blocks can rapidly and modularly assemble into adhesion sites on the cell surface. The researchers used two techniques, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), to observe the dynamic exchange of these building blocks between adhesion sites and the cytosol.

     The study revealed that stationary focal adhesions release the same types of protein complexes that they recruit, maintaining a uniform pool of building blocks in the cytosol. This symmetric exchange ensures that the building blocks are not altered as they move between adhesion sites and the cytosol. The researchers propose a model in which the pre-assembled building blocks enable rapid and modular self-assembly of adhesion sites.

     The study also found that the building blocks in the cytosol cannot form larger structures due to dependencies between protein interactions. However, at the plasma membrane, the system can be "switched on" to self-assemble adhesion sites by passing through checkpoints that induce additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome.

     The researchers conclude that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cytosol, forming multi-protein building blocks for cell-matrix adhesion sites. These building blocks are size-confined and correspond to functional layers across focal adhesions, including anchoring and integrin regulation, force transduction, and actin regulation. The symmetric material exchange between adhesion sites and the cytosol ensures that the building blocks enter and exit adhesion sites without being altered, preserving the assembly logic of the system.
Researchers have identified a common electrophysiological marker that can track states of reduced arousal in humans, including different sleep stages and anesthesia. This marker is based on the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity. The study used intracranial and surface EEG recordings from four independent data sets to demonstrate that the spectral slope can distinguish wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

The researchers found that the spectral slope becomes more negative, or steeper, in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness. This suggests that the spectral slope can be used to track changes in arousal levels in both propofol anesthesia and sleep in humans with high temporal precision and on a wide range of timescales. The study also showed that the spectral slope can discriminate wakefulness from NREM and REM sleep based solely on the neurophysiological brain state.

The researchers used two datasets obtained during a full night of sleep to examine if the spectral slope could discern wakefulness from different sleep stages. They found that the spectral slope reliably differentiates wakefulness from all three states of reduced arousal level, namely REM, N3 sleep, and general anesthesia with propofol. The study also demonstrated that the non-oscillatory, aperiodic part of the power spectrum, which is devoid of prominent low-frequency oscillatory components, can be approximated by the 1/f decay of the power spectrum estimated from the 30 to 45 Hz frequency range.

The findings of this study provide empirical evidence for the notion that the slope in the range from 30 to 45 Hz correlates well with all stages of arousal. The study's results also provide a mechanistic link between the spectral slope and population synchrony during slow oscillations. Overall, the study's findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that can track states of reduced arousal in humans, including different sleep stages and anesthesia. This marker has the potential to be used in various clinical and research settings to monitor and study arousal levels in humans.
summary
     Biologists have discovered a new mechanism by which plant cells move chloroplasts to the nucleus during an innate immune response. Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells that play a crucial role in photosynthesis and other cellular processes. During an immune response, chloroplasts need to move to the nucleus to communicate with the cell's genetic material and coordinate a defense response.

     The researchers found that dynamic tubular extensions from chloroplasts called stromules play a key role in this process. Stromules extend along microtubules, which are part of the cell's cytoskeleton, and anchor to actin filaments, another component of the cytoskeleton. The direction of stromule extension is correlated with the direction of chloroplast movement, suggesting that stromules guide chloroplasts to the nucleus.

     The study showed that microtubules are essential for stromule extension and movement, while actin filaments provide anchor points for stromules. When microtubules are stabilized, stromule numbers and length increase, and when microtubules are depolymerized, stromules retract. This suggests that microtubules play a crucial role in regulating stromule dynamics.

     The researchers propose a model in which stromules extend along microtubules and attach to actin anchor points surrounding the nucleus, guiding chloroplasts to the nucleus during an innate immune response. This process is not limited to immune responses, as stromule-directed chloroplast movement was observed in steady-state conditions without immune induction, suggesting it is a general function of stromules in epidermal cells.

     The study provides new insights into the role of the cytoskeleton in plant cell biology and has implications for our understanding of innate immunity in plants. Further research is needed to investigate the molecular components required for stromule dynamics and the importance of perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions between chloroplasts, the nucleus, and the cytoskeleton in plant cells.
Summary
     Scientists have developed a new method to predict how proteins interact with each other at the molecular level. This prediction is based on the idea that amino acid sequences of residues that make contact across protein interfaces covary during evolution. In other words, if two proteins interact with each other, their corresponding amino acid sequences are more likely to change in a coordinated way over time.

     To test this idea, researchers applied their method to 50S ribosomal units and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes with known structures. They found that the predicted residue pairs were almost always in contact in the complex, provided that there were enough aligned sequences. This suggests that the method is accurate and reliable.

     The researchers then used this method to predict contacts across protein interfaces for 36 evolutionarily conserved complexes of unknown structure. They presented structure models for four of these complexes, including the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter.

     The study found that covarying pairs of positions are almost always in contact in the three-dimensional structure, provided there are sufficient aligned sequences. They also found that significant residue-residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting protein pairs but very rarely between non-interacting pairs. This suggests that the method can be used to predict whether two proteins interact with each other.

     The researchers used a pseudo-likelihood-based statistical method to examine residue-residue covariation across protein-protein interfaces. They applied this method to a large set of complexes of known structure and found that it was effective in predicting contacts across interfaces. This method has the potential to contribute to the determination of the structures of biologically important complexes.

     The study provides a new tool for predicting protein-protein interactions and has the potential to advance our understanding of protein structure and function. The predicted residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces of unknown structure are presented in Figure 3, which shows strongly co-evolving residue pairs for complexes without known structure that had at least one prediction with a GREMLIN score greater than or equal to 0.85.
Summary of Biomedical Research Article: Active Sensing in the Categorization of Visual Patterns

     Researchers investigated how people interpret visual scenes by accumulating information from multiple locations. They used a novel approach called active sensing, where participants' eye movements were tracked while they categorized visual patterns. The results showed that participants' scan paths followed an active sensing strategy, incorporating information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of the statistical structure of patterns.

     The study used a gaze-contingent paradigm, where small apertures of the image were successively revealed at each fixation location. This allowed the researchers to estimate the efficiency of eye movements in a high-level task on a fixation-by-fixation basis. The findings showed that participants' eye movements were substantially more efficient than heuristic strategies that only employed a subset of the elements of a fully closed-loop active sensing strategy.

     The researchers used a combination of a Bayesian ideal observer and an active sensor algorithm to estimate that a major portion of the apparent suboptimality of fixation locations arises from prior biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements. The central process of selecting fixation locations was found to be around 70% efficient in the task.

     The study suggests that participants select eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations. The results provide new insights into how people interpret visual scenes and how eye movements contribute to this process. The study's approach can be applied to multiple tasks in different perceptual domains, allowing for a more principled quantitative analysis of eye movements.

     The researchers dissociated the contributions of the eye-movement selection process from those of perceptual, motor, and decision processes. This allowed them to identify predominant sources of apparent sub-optimality in active sensing and quantify the efficiency of choosing each individual fixation throughout scanning a whole scene. The study's findings have implications for understanding how people process visual information and how eye movements contribute to this process.
Biologists have long understood that the nuclear pore complex (NPC) plays a crucial role in regulating the transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Despite its importance, the mechanisms governing the transport of large cargoes, such as pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes, across the NPC are not well understood. These large cargoes can be up to 15 nanometers in size and must pass through the NPC intact.

    Researchers have investigated the nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models, ranging in size from 17 to 36 nanometers, with varying numbers of nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). The NLSs allow the cargoes to bind to nuclear transport receptors, which facilitate their entry into the nucleus. The study found that the requirements for nuclear transport scale non-linearly with cargo size and can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model.

    The model correlates the import flux with the energetic requirements for nuclear transport, providing new insights into the molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells. For small cargo transport, the biochemical or physicochemical properties of the cargo surface have been shown to influence nuclear transport. The researchers anticipate that their findings could also contribute to a better understanding of the export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal subunits and large RNA export complexes.

    The study used a novel approach to assay nuclear import kinetics, allowing for the examination of a wide range of cargo sizes and NLS numbers. The results demonstrate that the transport of large cargoes is a complex process, influenced by both the size of the cargo and the number of NLSs. The findings have important implications for our understanding of nucleocytoplasmic transport and could potentially inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to nuclear transport dysfunction.

    Nuclear transport is a critical process in eukaryotic cells, with over 2,000 nuclear pore complexes spanning the nuclear envelope in a typical HeLa cell. The transport of large cargoes across the NPC is essential for cellular viability, and disruptions to this process have been implicated in various diseases. The research presented here provides new insights into the molecular determinants of large cargo import, shedding light on the complex mechanisms governing nucleocytoplasmic transport.
summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 in the activation of helper T cells. However, its role in maintaining T cell responses following activation has remained unclear. A recent study aimed to determine the function of CD28 after T cell priming by generating a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. The results show that continued CD28 expression is essential for the expansion of effector CD4+ T cells, particularly T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells during viral infection. Furthermore, the study found that persistent CD28 expression is also required for the clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract.

The study demonstrates that CD28 plays a previously undescribed role in helper T cell polarization in response to infection, distinct from its well-established function in T cell priming. CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for the expansion of Th1 cells and for the differentiation and maintenance of Tfh cells. These findings suggest that CD28 expression is necessary for intact effector CD4+ T cell responses during infection. The study also highlights the importance of CD28 in the immune response to bacterial infection, specifically in the context of Citrobacter rodentium infection, which elicits a robust humoral and cellular immune response.

Previous research has established that CD28 signaling is essential for multiple facets of CD4+ T cell activation, including proliferation, survival, glucose metabolism, and migration. CD28-deficient mice have been shown to have reduced expansion of effector CD4+ T cells and are unable to form Th1 and Tfh cells after infection or immunization. In contrast, Th1 cells do not require CD28 for their maintenance, but do require it for their expansion following T cell activation. The study's findings provide new insights into the role of CD28 in the immune response and highlight its importance in maintaining T cell responses following activation.

     Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that colonizes the stomach, has a unique helical shape that allows it to efficiently colonize the stomach lining. However, the molecular mechanisms that generate this helical shape are not well understood. Researchers investigated how H. pylori maintains its helical shape and found that two cytoskeletal proteins, MreB and CcmA, play a crucial role in defining zones of enhanced cell wall synthesis.

     The researchers used two metabolic probes to track cell wall growth in H. pylori and found that synthesis is enhanced at both negative and positive Gaussian curvatures on the cell surface. They also used superresolution microscopy and 3D quantitative image analysis to visualize the localization of MreB and CcmA. The results showed that MreB is most abundant at negative Gaussian curvature, while CcmA is most abundant at positive Gaussian curvature.

     The researchers propose that MreB promotes cell wall synthesis at negative Gaussian curvature, while CcmA promotes synthesis at positive Gaussian curvature. They suggest that this patterning of cell wall synthesis is one mechanism necessary for maintaining the helical shape of H. pylori. The study also found that H. pylori uses distinct mechanisms to achieve the broad distribution of sidewall Gaussian curvature compared to other curved-rod bacteria.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that generate the unique helical shape of H. pylori. The researchers propose a model where MreB and CcmA work together to promote cell wall synthesis at different regions of the cell surface, allowing H. pylori to maintain its helical shape and efficiently colonize the stomach lining. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between cytoskeletal proteins and cell wall synthesis in bacteria, and has implications for the development of new treatments for H. pylori infections.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a new function of the protein Cdc48 in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective chaperone, works with two deubiquitylases (DUBs), Ubp12 and Ubp2, to control the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission. Mitochondrial fusion is a process by which mitochondria combine to form a single, larger mitochondrion, while fission is the process by which a single mitochondrion divides into two smaller ones.

     The researchers found that Ubp12 and Ubp2 have opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion. Ubp12 promotes fusion by stabilizing ubiquitin chains on the mitofusin protein Fzo1, while Ubp2 inhibits fusion by removing ubiquitin chains from Fzo1. Cdc48 integrates the activities of these two DUBs by promoting the proteolysis of Ubp12, which in turn stabilizes pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1. On the other hand, the loss of Ubp12 stabilizes Ubp2, allowing it to remove ubiquitin chains from Fzo1 and inhibit fusion.

     The study reveals a new cascade of ubiquitylation events involving Cdc48, Ubp12, and Ubp2, which fine-tunes the fusogenic activity of Fzo1. This cascade ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation, allowing for mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover. The researchers also found that Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated chains on Fzo1 composed of a small number of ubiquitin moieties, which are too short to target proteasomal turnover. In contrast, Ubp2 recognizes and cleaves longer ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that target Fzo1 for proteasomal degradation and inhibit mitochondrial fusion.

     The study provides new insights into the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and the role of ubiquitylation in controlling the balance between fusion and fission. The findings suggest that Cdc48 plays a crucial role in integrating the activities of Ubp12 and Ubp2 to regulate mitochondrial fusion, and that the balance between these two DUBs is critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis.
Biomedical researchers investigated whether vision is necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOTC), a region of the brain involved in processing visual information. They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study how the VOTC responds to sound and visual categories in sighted and blind individuals.

The study found that the VOTC reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind people, using a similar representational structure and connectivity to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group, using a representational format closer to the one found in vision. Crucially, the VOTC in blind individuals represents the categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features.

The results suggest that sounds can trigger categorical responses in the VOTC of both congenitally blind and sighted people, which partially match the topography and functional profile of the visual response. However, there are qualitative nuances in the categorical organization of VOTC between modalities and groups.

The study demonstrates that a categorical organization similar to the one found in vision can emerge in VOTC in the absence of visual experience. In fact, the categorical response to sounds is enhanced and more stable in congenitally blind people. This is consistent with previous studies showing that the occipital cortex enhances its response to non-visual information processing in the absence of vision.

The researchers used representational similarity analysis to show that categorical membership is the main factor that predicts the representational structure of sounds in VOTC in blind people, rather than lower-level acoustic attributes of sounds. The study also found that the categorical representation of auditory stimuli in VOTC of both blind and sighted individuals exhibits different qualitative nuances compared to the categorical organization generated by visual stimuli in sighted people.

The findings suggest that crossmodal plasticity, or the brain's ability to reorganize itself in response to changes in sensory input, may play a role in the development of categorical organization in VOTC. Specifically, the overlap in categorical responses between groups may be due to the fact that VOTC represents visual attributes in the sighted and acoustic attributes in the blind.
Researchers have discovered a strain of the fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae that manipulates the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, in the laboratory. This fungus, known as E. muscae 'Berkeley', causes infected flies to exhibit moribund behaviors, such as climbing upward, extending their proboscides, and raising their wings, which allows the fungus to launch infectious spores from their abdomens. The fungus invades the nervous system of the fly, suggesting a direct means by which it induces behavioral changes.

The researchers established a method to infect D. melanogaster with E. muscae 'Berkeley' in the laboratory, allowing for the study of this behavior-changing fungus in a controlled environment. This new system is expected to facilitate rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior, given the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster.

The invasion of the nervous system by E. muscae 'Berkeley' may be a key factor in achieving behavioral manipulation of the host fly. However, the researchers caution that other mechanisms may also be at play. They propose four possible ways in which E. muscae 'Berkeley' could alter host behavior.

The researchers also tested whether E. muscae 'Berkeley' can infect hosts outside of Drosophilidae, the family of flies to which D. melanogaster belongs. They exposed house flies to E. muscae 'Berkeley'-infected D. melanogaster and observed that the house flies died and sporulated, indicating that they had been killed by the fungus.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of how E. muscae 'Berkeley' infection progresses in D. melanogaster at the molecular level, the researchers measured transcription changes in both the host and the fungus at 24-hour time points over five days. They found that infected and uninfected animals were phenotypically indistinguishable early on, making it challenging to track the progression of the infection.

The study highlights the potential of the E. muscae 'Berkeley'-D. melanogaster system as a model for developing a mechanistic understanding of parasitic manipulation of host behavior. Further research is needed to elucidate the molecular basis of behavioral manipulation and to establish genetic tools in both the fungus and the host, as well as neurobiological tools in the host.
Summary of Transcriptome Maps of General Eukaryotic RNA Degradation Factors

     Researchers have mapped the binding locations of 30 RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to better understand RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells. The study used a technique called photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) to generate transcriptome-wide protein binding profiles for the degradation factors.

     The analysis revealed how degradation factors vary in their binding specificities for different classes of RNAs and their preferred locations on RNA transcripts. The study found that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, while decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation. This suggests that decapping is a rate-limiting step in the degradation process.

     The study also found that decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, consistent with the rapid degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. Additionally, the nuclear surveillance machinery, including the complexes Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).

     Global comparisons of the profiles alongside previously published profiles of other RNA-binding factors revealed clusters of factors that co-occupy RNAs or co-localize on RNAs. The large variety of different RNA degradation factors poses the question of how RNA degradation pathways are selected and whether the RNA sequence can influence this selection.

     The study provides a rich resource for future studies of eukaryotic RNA degradation pathways, mechanisms, and the integration of mRNA metabolism. The findings have implications for understanding the regulation of RNA levels, the surveillance of aberrant or poorly functional RNAs, and the processing of RNAs in eukaryotic cells.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how plants rapidly respond to pathogen threats. Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant, produces camalexin, a potent defense compound, in response to bacterial and fungal infections. While several transcription factors controlling camalexin biosynthesis genes have been identified, the mechanisms enabling rapid activation of these genes upon pathogen signal remain unclear. Researchers combined publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin modification mapping to investigate this process. They found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications: trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), which represses gene expression, and acetylation of histone 3 lysine 18 (H3K18ac), which activates gene expression. These modifications form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin, which the researchers named kairostat. Mutants with reduced H3K27me3 or H3K18ac showed that both modifications are required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response. The study suggests that kairostat plays a crucial role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants. By integrating epigenomic profiles with a genome-wide metabolic network, the researchers found that H3K27me3 and H3K18ac are enriched at camalexin biosynthesis and several other specialized metabolic pathways. In mutants with defective deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac, the induction kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation was accelerated or delayed, respectively. The findings provide new evidence for how chemical defense mediated by camalexin may be regulated at the epigenetic level. The discovery of kairostat offers a molecular handle for future investigations into the regulation of camalexin biosynthesis genes.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the epigenetic mechanisms that enable specialized astrocytes to retain neurogenic competence throughout adult life. Recent studies have shed light on the role of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in this process. EZH2, a Polycomb repressive factor, is expressed in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells ( NSCs ) in the adult mouse subventricular zone ( SVZ ). This epigenetic regulator is required for neurogenesis, independent of its role in SVZ NSC proliferation.

     Research has shown that EZH2 directly represses the Ink4a/Arf locus to enable SVZ NSC self-renewal. Furthermore, EZH2 prevents the inappropriate activation of genes associated with non-SVZ neuronal subtypes. Olig2, a bHLH transcription factor, is a direct target of EZH2, and repression of this factor is critical for neuronal differentiation.

     Studies have also identified distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in the production of new neurons from a multipotent stem cell population. In the human brain, EZH2 is expressed in astroglia and neuronal precursors of the early infant SVZ, suggesting that this PRC2 factor plays key roles in postnatal human neurogenesis. These findings indicate that EZH2 is a critical epigenetic determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astroglia, enabling both proliferation and cell fate specification of an adult stem cell population.

     Acute deletion of Ezh2 in SVZ NSCs resulted in decreased neurogenesis, and this deficiency in part related to reduced cell proliferation. However, Ink4a/Arf-deficiency in Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs rescued cell proliferation, but neurogenesis remained defective. This suggests that EZH2 has a role in SVZ neurogenesis that is distinct from its function in Ink4a/Arf repression.

     These results provide novel insights into the complex role that EZH2 plays in normal development and gliomagenesis. Future studies may address whether re-expression of EZH2 in non-SVZ astrocytes can enable neurogenesis or their directed transdifferentiation into neurons in vivo for potential therapeutic purposes. The identification of EZH2 as a distinguishing feature of astroglial cells in the postnatal neurogenic SVZ of both the mouse and human brain has important implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.
summary
     Biologists have long known that viruses play a crucial role in shaping microbial communities and influencing ecosystem functions. However, studying the interactions between viruses and their hosts has been challenging due to the difficulty of cultivating certain microorganisms in the laboratory. A recent study used single-cell genomics to investigate the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP05 bacteria in a model marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ).

     The researchers isolated 127 single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) from SUP05 bacteria in the OMZ and identified 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within the dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae families. They found that approximately one-third of the SUP05 bacteria were infected with viruses, with higher infection frequencies in areas with more severe oxygen deficiency. The study also revealed that Microviridae viruses were clonal, suggesting that they were recovered from bloom-terminating viruses, while systematic co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses indicated previously unrecognized cooperation modes.

     The researchers analyzed 186 microbial and viral metagenomes from the OMZ and found that SUP05 viruses persisted for years but remained endemic to the OMZ. Notably, they identified virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase, which suggests that SUP05 viruses can reprogram their host's energy metabolism. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs.

     The study used single-cell genomics to directly link SUP05 viruses and their hosts across defined gradients of oxygen and sulfide over a three-year time interval in the OMZ ecosystem. The researchers obtained a SUP05 single-cell genomic dataset spanning defined redox gradients in the Saanich Inlet water column and identified SUP05-associated viruses infecting SAGs. They used the resulting virus-host pairs as recruitment platforms to estimate viral diversity, activity, dispersion, and potential impact on SUP05 population dynamics and metabolic capacity.

     The study found that SUP05 Microviridae contigs were inconsistently detected due to methodological biases, so they focused on dsDNA viral contigs. All four SUP05 Caudovirales contigs were absent from surface waters but repeatedly detected within and below the oxycline, consistent with SUP05 water column disposition. The researchers also found that putative SUP05 phage contained genes encoding reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase A and C, positing a role for viruses in modulating the marine sulfur cycle.

     The study's findings demonstrate closely coupled SUP05 virus-host co-evolutionary dynamics with the potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs. The identification of virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase suggests that viruses can reprogram their host's energy metabolism, highlighting the complex interactions between viruses and their hosts in shaping ecosystem functions.
summary
     Biologists have long understood that cilia and flagella are assembled and maintained through a process called intraflagellar transport (IFT), which involves over 20 IFT proteins. However, the functions of individual IFT proteins have remained unclear. A recent study focused on TTC26/DYF13, a putative IFT protein, to better understand its role in IFT.

     The study found that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. When TTC26/DYF13 was knocked down in zebrafish embryos or mutated in C. reinhardtii, the resulting cilia and flagella were short and had abnormal motility. Surprisingly, the assembly and movement of IFT particles were normal in the dyf13 mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants.

     Further analysis revealed that a specific set of proteins involved in motility was depleted in the dyf13 mutant. This suggests that different IFT proteins are responsible for transporting different subsets of cargo, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery. The study also found that TTC26/DYF13 is not required for ciliogenesis, the process of forming cilia and flagella, but rather plays a specialized role in transporting motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia and flagella.

     In contrast to other IFT proteins, TTC26/DYF13 is not necessary for the assembly or movement of IFT particles. Instead, it specifically transports a subset of proteins involved in flagellar motility. This is supported by proteomic and biochemical analyses, which showed that specific inner dynein arm components were reduced in flagella of dyf13 mutants. The study also found that IFT56, another IFT protein, has a conserved role in cilia and flagella, and its knockdown in zebrafish embryos and C. reinhardtii dyf13 mutant cells resulted in motility defects.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of TTC26/DYF13 in IFT and highlights the complexity of the IFT machinery. The findings suggest that different IFT proteins are responsible for transporting different subsets of cargo, and that TTC26/DYF13 plays a specialized role in transporting motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia and flagella. Further analysis is necessary to clarify the role of TTC26/DYF13 in determining the length of cilia and flagella.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the interaction between melanoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells ( LECs ) plays a crucial role in the development of distant metastasis in melanoma. In a recent study, researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction and its impact on melanoma progression. The study found that exposure of melanoma cells to LECs in 3D co-culture facilitated distant organ metastasis in mice. This effect was observed in expansively growing human WM852 melanoma cells, but not in singly invasive Bowes cells.

     To understand the underlying mechanisms, the researchers established LEC co-cultures with different melanoma cells originating from primary tumors or metastases. The results showed that the expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasively sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix, which was dependent on matrix-metalloproteinase-14 ( MMP14 ), Notch3, and β1-integrin. Notably, MMP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch3 induction and coincident β1-integrin activation.

     The study also found that MMP14 and Notch3 were required for LEC-mediated metastasis of zebrafish xenografts. The researchers used a combination of 2D and 3D LEC-melanoma co-culture models, transcriptome profiling, in vitro functional studies, and a zebrafish xenograft/metastasis assay to investigate the consequences of the interaction between melanoma cells and LECs.

     The results of the study provide new insights into the mechanisms of lymphatic dissemination in distant metastasis and highlight the importance of the interaction between melanoma cells and LECs in the tumor microenvironment. The findings suggest that LEC contact promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasively sprouting cell phenotype. The study also identifies MMP14 and Notch3 as key molecules involved in this process, which may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat melanoma metastasis.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a crucial role for microRNA-9 (miR-9) in the development of dendrites, the branching extensions of neurons that receive and transmit signals. miR-9 is one of the most abundant microRNAs in the brain and has been well-characterized in neural progenitors, but its function in dendritic and synaptic development was not well understood.

     To study miR-9's role in vivo, the researchers developed a transgenic mouse line that allows for the conditional inactivation of miR-9 in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, they found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in the brain. Furthermore, they demonstrated that miR-9's downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth.

     The study used a double reporter mouse line to characterize the activity pattern of miR-9 in different cell types in the brain. The analysis of the miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mouse line showed that inhibition of miR-9 results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo, accompanied by a concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission. The researchers also developed a conditional transgenic sponge mouse model to study miR-9's role in postmitotic neuronal differentiation.

     The study focused on the postmitotic stages of neuronal differentiation and demonstrated a critical role for miR-9 in the control of dendritic development in vivo. Other microRNAs have also been shown to influence dendritic growth, suggesting that the expression of genes controlling this process is under complex post-transcriptional regulation. The researchers found that miR-9's regulation of REST expression is essential for proper dendritic growth and synaptic transmission.

     The study provides new insights into the role of miR-9 in the development of dendrites and synaptic transmission in the brain. The findings suggest that miR-9 is a key regulator of dendritic development and that its dysregulation may contribute to neurological disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying miR-9's function and its potential therapeutic applications.
Biomedical researchers have identified a subtype of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) characterized by pronounced social visual engagement difficulties in early development. This subtype, known as GeoPref ASD, can be identified using a simple eye-tracking test that measures social or non-social visual preferences in toddlers. The study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a large sample of ASD toddlers and non-ASD comparison groups to investigate the neural basis of social visual engagement difficulties in ASD.

The results show that ASD-related functional hypoconnectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and visual and attention networks is a key feature of early ASD development. Specifically, the DMN, which is involved in social cognition and self-referential thinking, is functionally disconnected from the occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), a region responsible for processing visual information. This hypoconnectivity is more pronounced in the GeoPref ASD subtype, which is characterized by early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity.

The study also found that increased DMN-OTC hypoconnectivity is related to increased severity of social-communication difficulties in GeoPref ASD, but not in other ASD subtypes. This suggests that early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a critical neurobiological feature of GeoPref ASD and may be a key factor in the development of social-communicative difficulties in these individuals.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the neural basis of social visual engagement difficulties in ASD and highlight the importance of early social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity in the development of social-communicative difficulties. The study's results also support the idea that heterogeneity in early social engagement is an important factor in explaining functional connectivity differences present in early ASD toddlers. The identification of GeoPref ASD as a distinct subtype of ASD with pronounced social visual engagement difficulties has important implications for the development of early intervention strategies and treatment targets for these individuals.
summary
     Biologists have long known that animals with a body cavity, or coelom, have blood cells that work together to maintain homeostasis, or a stable internal environment. This division of labor relies on a balance between blood cell production and differentiation, which occurs in specialized organs called hematopoietic organs. In fruit flies, also known as Drosophila melanogaster, the lymph gland produces two types of blood cells: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are similar to macrophages in vertebrates and are involved in phagocytosis, or engulfing and digesting foreign particles. Crystal cells, on the other hand, have a different function, but their numbers increase during larval development.

    Until now, it was unclear how crystal cells increase in number, as mature crystal cells do not divide during larval stages. However, researchers have discovered that new crystal cells in third-instar larvae originate from plasmatocytes through a process called transdifferentiation, which is dependent on the Notch signaling pathway. This process occurs in sessile hemocyte clusters, which are clusters of blood cells attached to the body wall. The researchers found that the integrity of these clusters is essential for crystal cell differentiation.

    The study of hematopoietic organs and their structure is crucial for understanding how different types of blood cells arise and how their numbers are controlled. In Drosophila, embryonic hematopoiesis produces two types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are mitotically active and expand during larval development through self-renewal. In contrast, the numbers of crystal cells increase during larval development, but it was unclear whether this was due to self-renewal or de novo differentiation.

    The discovery of a hematopoietic tissue in Drosophila that relies on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis. This finding also establishes further parallels with vertebrate systems, where macrophages are the most plastic cells in the hematopoietic tissue and their specialization depends on the local microenvironment. The study of hematopoietic organs and their structure is essential for understanding how different mature blood cells arise and how their absolute and relative numbers are controlled.
summary
     Biologists have long been puzzled by the phenomenon of aneuploidy, where cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes. Aneuploidy is linked to various diseases, but it also plays a role in the evolution of organisms. While laboratory strains are highly sensitive to aneuploidy, researchers have found that aneuploidy is surprisingly common in wild yeast isolates. These wild yeast strains show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes, suggesting that they have a mechanism to buffer the effects of aneuploidy.

     To investigate this further, the researchers generated diploid strain panels with cells carrying two, three, or four copies of specific chromosomes. They found that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes in these strains. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations, but they show elevated rates of gene amplification. This suggests that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes, allowing them to tolerate aneuploidy.

     The researchers also found that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to certain wild yeast strains, such as oak strain YPS1009. This strain amplifies a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation, giving it a selective advantage. The study presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy, providing a natural but likely transient route to rapid phenotypic evolution.

     The findings provide new insights into how cells can tolerate the effects of aneuploidy long enough for new phenotypes to evolve. The study shows that up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneuploid strains show lower-than-expected expression. This reduced expression is due in part to heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate expression from amplified genes, some of which may have been selected for during adaptation to aneuploidy.

     The researchers investigated the expression of amplified genes in six aneuploid wild yeast strains, interrogating 2204 genes across eight amplified chromosomes. They found that some genes escape dosage compensation in response to aneuploidy and can contribute significantly to phenotypic variation. Whole and partial chromosome amplification is common in laboratory selection experiments, and the study suggests that dosage compensation may play a key role in buffering the effects of aneuploidy in natural populations.
summary
     Biologists have discovered a new type of light-sensitive cell in a flatworm called Maritigrella crozieri. These cells express a protein called xenopsin, which is a type of opsin photopigment. Traditionally, opsins were thought to be found only in the eyes of animals, but xenopsin is also found in extraocular cells around the brain in adult flatworms. These extraocular cells have hundreds of cilia, which are long, thin extensions of the cell membrane, enclosed within a vacuole called a phaosome.

     The researchers characterized the ultrastructure of these extraocular cells and found that they are similar to rod photoreceptors in jawed vertebrates, which also enclose their cilia within their own plasma membrane. To determine if xenopsin can form a photopigment and drive phototransduction, the researchers carried out functional assays in human cells. They found that xenopsin can drive phototransduction primarily by coupling to Gαi, a type of G protein.

     The discovery of xenopsin-expressing cells in flatworms challenges our understanding of opsin and photoreceptor evolution. Traditionally, it was thought that extraocular ciliary photoreceptors and ocular rhabdomeric/microvillar photoreceptors were distinct types of photoreceptors. However, the discovery of xenopsin-expressing cells in the eyes of protostome larvae and in extraocular cells in adult flatworms suggests that there may be more overlap between these types of photoreceptors than previously thought.

     The researchers also found that xenopsin is expressed in ciliary cells in the eyes of Maritigrella, which provides molecular and functional evidence for the presence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms. Ciliary photoreceptors are morphologically diverse, and the discovery of xenopsin-expressing cells in flatworms adds to our understanding of the evolution and diversity of photoreceptors in animals. Overall, the discovery of xenopsin-expressing cells in flatworms provides new insights into the evolution and function of photoreceptors in animals.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that spatial and temporal cues play a crucial role in specifying the diversity of neurons in the nervous system. However, it has remained unclear how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors, also known as neuroblasts. Researchers used the fruit fly Drosophila as a model system to investigate this question. They focused on two neuroblasts, NB5-6 and NB7-4, which give rise to different types of neurons.

     The researchers used a technique called Targeted DamID to identify the genomic binding sites of the temporal transcription factor Hunchback in the two neuroblasts. They found that Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the possibility that spatial and temporal cues act independently to specify neuronal diversity. Instead, the researchers discovered that each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hunchback-bound loci in each neuroblast.

     Furthermore, the researchers found that the spatial factor Gsb/Pax3, which is expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. This suggests that early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.

     The study identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hunchback in NB5-6 or NB7-4, which are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification. The findings support a model in which spatial and temporal cues are integrated in neural progenitors to generate lineage-specific neuronal diversity. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of neurogenesis and has implications for our understanding of how neural diversity is generated in the nervous system.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how P2X receptors, a type of ion channel, open and close in response to the presence of ATP. These receptors play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including pain sensation and neurotransmission. Recent studies have provided insights into the molecular structure of P2X receptors, but the exact mechanism of pore opening remains unclear.

     To address this question, researchers used a novel approach called photo-switchable cross-linkers, or "molecular tweezers," to study the P2X2 receptor. These tweezers allowed the scientists to monitor the distance between specific amino acids in the receptor's transmembrane domain during activation. By combining this experimental data with computational simulations, the researchers were able to create high-resolution models of the channel in both open and closed states.

     The results showed that the outer pore of the receptor expands significantly less than previously thought, and that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices move closer together during activation. This movement is thought to occur through a "hinge-bending" motion, where the helices bend at a critical point, allowing the channel to open.

     These findings provide new insights into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and offer a versatile strategy for studying other membrane proteins. The use of photo-switchable cross-linkers as molecular tweezers represents a powerful tool for understanding the complex dynamics of ion channels and other membrane proteins.

     The study also highlights the importance of considering the full-length, membrane-embedded structure of P2X receptors, rather than relying solely on X-ray crystal structures, which may not accurately represent the native, open-channel state. By combining experimental and computational approaches, the researchers were able to gain a more complete understanding of the P2X2 receptor's gating mechanism, shedding light on a long-standing question in the field of biophysics.
summary
     Biologists have long assumed that all animal cells divide using a similar molecular mechanism during cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two. However, recent evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types has more variation than previously thought. A new study in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) reveals that cell-type-specific cytokinetic diversity is controlled by both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms.

     In the four-cell C. elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct cell fate, specified by conserved pathways. The researchers used fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment to identify cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust forminCYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton. They found that in one cell (P2), this cytokinetic variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another cell (EMS), this variation is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on both SrcSRC-1 signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2.

     The study used thermogenetics, drug treatment, and embryo microdissection to probe the mechanisms of cell-type-based variation in the regulation of cytokinesis among individual blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. The researchers found cell-type-specific differences in both the functional levels and temporal window of activity required for forminCYK-1 activity, but not myosin-IINMY-2 activity, during cytokinesis. They also found that inactivation of forminCYK-1 by thermal upshift to restrictive temperature resulted in cell-type-specific variation in the temporal requirement for activity among individual blastomeres.

     The study shows that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms contribute to cytokinetic diversity and promote robust cytokinesis when the contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. The findings suggest that each cell in the four-cell C. elegans embryo has a unique cell identity and can be individually scored for contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis. The study provides new insights into the complex regulation of cytokinesis and highlights the importance of cell-type-specific mechanisms in ensuring proper cell division.

     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of bacterial flagella in mediating host-microbe interactions, including tissue tropism during colonization and immune response activation. However, the flagellar shaft of certain bacteria, including human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. This sheath has been hypothesized to allow these bacteria to evade host responses to the immunogenic flagellin subunit, but its true purpose has remained unclear.

     A recent study has shed new light on the role of the flagellar sheath in the model symbiosis between the bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid. The researchers found that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both V. fischeri and its pathogenic congener Vibrio cholerae promotes the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent bacteria-derived immunogen found in the flagellar sheath. This discovery reveals a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host immune responses.

     The study used the model squid-vibrio symbiosis as a tool to probe the effect of the enigmatic flagellar sheath on host recognition. The researchers observed that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in V. fischeri and V. cholerae leads to the release of LPS, which is recognized by the squid host. This finding has important implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella and raises questions about the biophysical function of the flagellar sheath.

     The study's findings suggest that the flagellar sheath plays a previously unrecognized role in mediating the release of LPS, which is a key component of the bacterial secretome. The researchers propose that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum triggers the release of LPS, which in turn activates host immune responses. This new understanding of the flagellar sheath's function has significant implications for the study of bacterial virulence and the initiation of symbiotic relationships between bacteria and their hosts.

     Further research is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the signaling during the initiation of the squid-vibrio symbiosis. This includes characterizing the composition of LPS released by V. fischeri during flagellar rotation, identifying the squid receptors that recognize V. fischeri LPS, and determining any role flagellin may have in activating host responses. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between bacteria and their hosts and highlight the importance of further research into the biophysical function of the flagellar sheath.
summary
     Biologists have discovered a previously unknown phenomenon in plants where chromosomes undergo catastrophic restructuring during a process called genome elimination. This process occurs when two plants with different versions of a protein called centromere histone H3 (CENH3) are crossed, resulting in the formation of shattered chromosomes from the genome of the haploid inducer. The researchers found that these shattered chromosomes are compartmentalized within a micronucleus and that breaks in the chromosomes are repaired through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or stalled fork repair.

     The study, conducted in Arabidopsis plants, shows that the NHEJ pathway plays a crucial role in the repair of the haploid inducer chromosomes that contribute to diploid and aneuploid progeny. When the NHEJ pathway is inhibited, the frequency of haploid induction increases. The researchers also found that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase the elimination of the haploid inducer genome, similar to observations in mouse-human hybrid genome elimination.

     The study suggests that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks. Occasionally, such chromosomes are rescued, resulting in the formation of aneuploid and diploid progeny. The researchers propose that this phenomenon is a natural system for investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders.

     The findings provide evidence for the occurrence of chromosome restructuring when diverged individuals hybridize, identifying a centromere-based mechanism for genomic instability. This phenomenon depends on chimeric CENH3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species. The study's results have implications for our understanding of the consequences of mitotic malfunction on genome integrity and the potential for enduring genomic novelty.
Summary
     Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common virus that can cause several types of cancer. To understand how EBV contributes to cancer development, researchers studied how the virus affects the survival of B cells, a type of immune cell. They found that EBV uses a unique mechanism to prevent B cells from dying, even in the early stages of infection.

     Normally, B cells rely on a protein called BCL-2 to survive. However, during EBV infection, the virus upregulates two other proteins, MCL-1 and BFL-1, which work together with BCL-2 to prevent apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This is a critical step in cancer development, as uncontrolled cell growth can lead to tumor formation.

     The researchers used a technique called BH3 profiling to study the regulation of apoptosis in EBV-infected cells. They found that the viral protein EBNA3A plays a key role in suppressing apoptosis by promoting the localization of MCL-1 to the mitochondria and increasing the transcription of BFL-1. This is a new and unique function of EBNA3A, and it is essential for the survival of EBV-infected B cells.

     In contrast, uninfected B cells rely solely on BCL-2 for survival, while EBV-infected cells use a combination of BCL-2, MCL-1, and BFL-1 to prevent apoptosis. The researchers also found that the viral oncoprotein LMP1, which is thought to be responsible for apoptotic suppression in latently infected cells, is not present during the initial burst of B cell proliferation induced by EBV.

     This study provides new insights into the mechanism of EBV-induced B cell survival and has implications for our understanding of lymphomagenesis, or the development of lymphomas, which are cancers of the immune system. The findings suggest that EBNA3A plays a critical role in the suppression of apoptosis during both early and late stages of EBV infection, and this may contribute to the development of EBV-associated cancers.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that plants produce diverse metabolites to cope with environmental challenges. However, the genetic and environmental factors that drive the diversification of these metabolites within and between plant species are not yet fully understood. A recent study investigated the variation in specialized metabolites across a population of 797 natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from Europe. The researchers found that a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography, and genetic processes all contribute to the specific chemotypes and their distribution within the population.

     The study focused on the Arabidopsis glucosinolate ( GSL ) pathway, a well-studied system for understanding specialized metabolism. The researchers measured the amounts of aliphatic GSLs in seeds of A. thaliana accessions and found that genetic variants influencing plant chemical variation are more common in enzyme-encoding genes for specialized metabolism. Many previous studies have focused on biallelic phenotypic variation linked to loss-of-function variants. However, this study found that causal loci in specialized metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles with patterns suggesting potential within-species convergence.

     The results suggest that the intersection of environmental pressure, demography, and genomic complexity gives rise to the pattern of metabolic variation across A. thaliana. The study provides new insights into the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation influencing local adaptation. The findings also raise questions about how pathways with high levels of diversity and structural variation pass through speciation boundaries. The study's results have implications for understanding trait evolution and the genetic, demographic, and environmental factors that shape variation within a trait in a population. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering the intersection of genetics, geography, environment, and demography in understanding the diversification of specialized metabolites within and between plant species.
summary
     Biomedical research has traditionally viewed apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, and its molecular mediators, caspases, as tumor suppressors. However, recent studies suggest that under certain conditions, apoptotic caspases can promote tumor growth and proliferation. A new study in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, has uncovered a mechanism by which caspases can switch from tumor suppressors to tumor promoters.

     In the study, researchers used a well-studied neoplastic tumor model in Drosophila to investigate the role of caspases in tumor growth. They found that oncogenic mutations of the proto-oncogene Ras (RasV12) maintain tumorous cells in an "undead" state, where caspases no longer induce cell death but instead promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, in turn, recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells, which signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling.

     JNK signaling further amplifies caspase activity, creating a feedback amplification loop that is necessary for uncontrolled tumor growth and invasive behavior. The researchers demonstrated that interfering with this amplification loop significantly reduces the neoplastic behavior of these cells and improves organismal survival.

     The study also showed that oncogenic Ras suppresses the apoptotic activity of caspases, keeping tumorous cells in an "undead" state. While caspases may still induce apoptosis in a few tumor cells, they largely promote the generation of intra- and extracellular ROS, which are required for malignant growth and tissue invasion of surviving neoplastic cells.

     The findings of this study extend previous models of the conversion of Eiger and JNK signaling from anti-tumor to pro-tumor roles by oncogenic Ras and identify caspases as essential components of this switch. The study suggests that under certain conditions, such as the presence of oncogenic RasV12 in scrib mutant cells, apoptotic caspases can adopt a tumor-promoting role, challenging the traditional view of caspases as tumor suppressors.
Biomedical research has shown that the way we perceive time can be influenced by our social interactions. A recent study found that people tend to perceive social interactions as shorter in duration than non-social interactions. This effect, known as temporal compression, was found to be stronger in individuals with higher social cognitive competency. However, individuals with autistic-like tendencies showed a weaker temporal compression effect. The study also found that intranasal oxytocin administration restored the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, while the administration of atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminished the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings suggest that perceived time is not a faithful representation of physical time, but rather is influenced by an individual's personality traits and social cognition.

The study used a series of experiments to investigate the relationship between social interactions, temporal perception, and oxytocin. In one experiment, participants were shown videos of people engaging in social or non-social interactions and asked to estimate the duration of the interactions. The results showed that social interactions were perceived as shorter in duration than non-social interactions, and this effect was stronger in individuals with higher social cognitive competency. However, individuals with autistic-like tendencies showed a weaker temporal compression effect.

The study also found that oxytocin played a critical role in mediating the temporal compression effect. In socially less proficient individuals, intranasal oxytocin administration restored the temporal compression effect, while the administration of atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminished the effect in socially proficient individuals. This suggests that oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction, further supporting its role in human social cognition.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of time perception and social cognition. They suggest that perceived time is not a fixed or objective measure, but rather is influenced by an individual's personality traits and social cognition. The study's results also highlight the importance of oxytocin in mediating social interactions and time perception, and suggest that oxytocin may be a potential therapeutic target for improving social cognition in individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
summary
     The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and the ACE2 cell surface protein is crucial for viral infection of cells. Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged worldwide, such as the B.1.1.7 lineage with a mutation (N501Y) in its Spike RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. Similarly, ACE2 alleles in humans have mutations in the RBD binding site. This study analyzed the effects of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The results show that most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction, except for mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. The N501Y and S477N mutations enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, while the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape. The study also examined the effect of combinations of RBD mutations, including those present in VOC-202102–02, a subset of the Alpha lineage, and the Beta and Gamma variants. The findings suggest that carriers of ACE2 variants with mutations S19P and K26R will be at greater risk of infection and/or severe disease. The study's results provide precise information to assess the extent to which RBD mutations have been selected because they enhance ACE2 binding or facilitate immune evasion.
Summary
     Biologists have long understood that genes interact with each other to produce complex traits and modify the effects of mutations during development and disease. However, mapping these interactions has been a significant challenge. A team of researchers used a novel approach to create a comprehensive map of directional genetic interactions in Drosophila cells. They employed combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to study 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells. The resulting map comprises 1367 Drosophila genes involved in key biological processes such as signalling, chromatin biology, cell cycle regulation, and protein turnover control.

     The researchers developed a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships between genes. This approach allowed them to reconstruct the sequence of protein activities during mitosis and identify regulatory relationships between genes. Notably, the map revealed an interaction between the Ras pathway and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex. This interaction was found to be conserved in human cancer cells.

     The study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and provides a valuable resource for interpreting the functional consequences of genetic alterations. The researchers demonstrated that their method can be used to identify epistatic relationships between genes at a large scale and map these interactions to other genomic data sets. The resulting epistatic network revealed a detailed circuit diagram of regulatory, temporal, and causal relationships of complexes that function during the M-phase of the cell cycle.

     One of the key findings of the study is the unexpected link between chromatin remodelling and RAS signalling. The researchers found genetic interactions between the SWI/SNF complex and the SWI/SNF-associated chromatin remodeller dalao. This interaction was confirmed in vivo and highlights the importance of chromatin remodelling in regulating RAS signalling. The study provides new insights into the complex relationships between genes and offers a valuable resource for understanding the functional consequences of genetic alterations in development and disease.
summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding the genetic basis of heterostyly, a common floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding in plants. In the genus Primula, also known as primroses, heterostyly is controlled by the S-locus supergene, which determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between the two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remained unknown until now.

     Researchers have identified the CYP734A50 gene as the G locus that determines the style-length dimorphism in Primula. This gene encodes a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme and is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype. CYP734A50 is specifically expressed in S-morph styles and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution.

     The study found that CYP734A50 is absent or inactivated in all seven cases of derived long homostyly, and its presence strictly cosegregates with the morph type in all heterostylous species sampled across the Primula phylogeny. This strongly supports the conclusion that CYP734A50 is the G locus of the Primula heterostyly supergene that determines the style-length polymorphism.

     The researchers propose that the duplication and gain of style-specific expression of CYP734A50 in the ancestor of the Primulaceae likely represents the dominant style-shortening mutation. This finding provides a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and sheds light on the evolution of the S-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene. The discovery of CYP734A50 as a causal locus in a supergene underlying an adaptive polymorphism opens the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the Primula S-locus.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have made a significant discovery about the role of kisspeptin neurons in the regulation of reproductive function. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Kiss1ARH) play a crucial role in pubertal development and fertility. These neurons co-express kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB), dynorphin, and glutamate, and are thought to provide an episodic, excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH) neurons.

     Using optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology, and single-cell RT-PCR in mice, the researchers characterized the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1ARH neuronal activity. They found that high-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons evoked the local release of excitatory (NKB) and inhibitory (dynorphin) neuropeptides, which synchronized the firing of Kiss1ARH neurons. This synchronized activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons through a synaptic mechanism that also involved glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1ARH neurons.

     The researchers discovered that high-frequency photoactivation of Kiss1ARH neurons induced a NKB-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which was modulated by co-released dynorphin, and caused synchronization of Kiss1ARH neurons. Additionally, activation of Kiss1ARH neurons co-released glutamate that excited the rostral Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. The combination of synchronization and unified excitation of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons resulted in robust excitation of GnRH neurons.

     Kiss1ARH neurons also communicate with the Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via the fast neurotransmitter glutamate, which stimulates burst-firing of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. Activation of these rostral Kiss1 neurons releases kisspeptin to robustly excite GnRH neurons via activation of the GPR54 signaling cascade, thereby stimulating the release of GnRH at the time of the preovulatory surge. The researchers propose that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role in driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.
summary
     Biologists have long known that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling plays a crucial role in maintaining the ability of cells to become any cell type in the body, a state known as pluripotency. However, the exact mechanisms by which BMP signalling prevents cells from differentiating into specific cell types, such as nerve cells or muscle cells, were not well understood.

     Researchers have now discovered that BMP signalling suppresses differentiation by maintaining the expression of a protein called E-Cadherin (Cdh1). E-Cadherin is a molecule that helps cells stick together and is involved in the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. When E-Cadherin is lost, cells are more likely to differentiate into specific cell types.

     The study found that suppressing E-Cadherin activity is sufficient to overcome the block to differentiation imposed by BMP signalling. This suggests that E-Cadherin plays a key role in maintaining pluripotency and preventing cells from differentiating into specific cell types.

     BMP signalling also helps to prime pluripotent cells for mesodermal differentiation, which is the process by which cells become muscle, bone, or blood cells. This is in contrast to neural differentiation, which is the process by which cells become nerve cells. The study found that BMP signalling acts independently of E-Cadherin to prime cells for mesodermal differentiation.

     The researchers propose that BMP signalling feeds into a control mechanism that regulates the receptivity of cells to differentiation cues. This means that BMP signalling helps to determine whether cells are receptive to signals that promote differentiation into specific cell types.

     The study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which BMP signalling maintains pluripotency and promotes mesodermal differentiation. It also highlights the importance of E-Cadherin in regulating the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells develop and differentiate into specific cell types during embryonic development.
summary
     Biologists have long known that the two centrioles of the centrosome in quiescent cells are inherently asymmetric structures that differ in age, morphology, and function. However, the mechanisms that establish and maintain these asymmetric properties during quiescence have remained unknown. A recent study has shed light on this process by identifying a critical role for a protein called Cep120 in regulating centriole maturation in quiescent cells.

     Cep120 is a protein associated with the daughter centriole, and its depletion in quiescent mouse and human cells leads to the accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) components, including pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, ninein, and Cep170. This accumulation results in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome, leading to aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling.

     The study found that Cep120 plays an inhibitory role at the centrosome by regulating PCM levels during quiescence. Loss of Cep120 initiates a series of changes in protein localization and abundance that ultimately result in defective ciliary assembly and function. The researchers used immuno-electron microscopy to show that Cep120 resides on the outer wall of the centriolar microtubules, suggesting that it regulates the asymmetric distribution of PCM proteins at the centrosome.

     The study's findings indicate that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting the untimely maturation of the daughter centriole. This process is critical for the proper assembly and function of cilia, which are essential for various cellular processes, including signaling and sensing the environment. The study's results also suggest that loss of Cep120 may contribute to the pathogenesis of ciliopathies, such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.

     The researchers propose that the dispersal of centriolar satellites upon Cep120 loss disrupts the formation and/or function of cilia during quiescence. This disruption is likely due to changes in PCM abundance, microtubule organization, and dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins. The study's findings highlight the importance of centrosome homeostasis and its relationship to primary cilium assembly and signaling, and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ciliopathies.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that neuron-glia interactions play a crucial role in the maturation of neural circuits in the developing central nervous system (CNS). However, the pathways that mediate communication between neurons and glial cells, such as Müller glial cells (MCs), in the developing retina are not well understood. A recent study investigated neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina and found that retinal waves induce calcium transients in MCs.

The study used a combination of whole-cell recordings and two-photon imaging to investigate the interaction between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and MCs. The results showed that retinal waves were correlated with calcium transients in a large proportion of MCs, indicating that spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks in the developing retina.

The study also found that the mechanism of interaction between neurons and MCs during cholinergic retinal waves is similar to previous findings in other brain regions, such as the visual cortex and hippocampus. However, the proportion of MCs that responded to waves with calcium transients decreased significantly from postnatal day 9 (P9) to P11, despite the presence of retinal waves.

The researchers used an optical glutamate sensor to show that the decline in MC calcium transients is caused by a reduction in the amount of glutamate reaching MCs. This suggests that neurons and MCs exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses.

The study also found that MCs express multiple neurotransmitter receptor types throughout this period, allowing neuronal control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal synchronization shifts from being dependent on cholinergic to glutamatergic signaling. This suggests that the responsiveness of MCs changes to match the neurotransmitter used to support retinal waves.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina and highlights the importance of neurotransmitter spillover in enabling correlated activity between neurons and MCs during a critical period of retinal maturation. The findings have implications for our understanding of the development and function of neural circuits in the CNS.
Summary
     Estimating the time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI), is crucial in death investigations. However, current methods, such as forensic entomology, can be prone to errors and biases. Researchers have explored the potential of microbes to provide a more accurate estimate of PMI. A recent study used a mouse model system to investigate the feasibility of using microbial communities to estimate PMI.

     In the study, 40 mouse corpses were decomposed on soil under controlled conditions for 48 days. The researchers characterized the changes in microbial communities at three external sites and one internal site using DNA sequencing. The results showed that the microbial communities underwent dramatic, measurable, and repeatable changes over time. These changes allowed the researchers to estimate PMI with an accuracy of approximately 3 days over the 48-day period.

     The study provides a detailed understanding of the microbial ecology of corpse decomposition and suggests that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI. This approach has the potential to complement existing methods and provide a more accurate estimate of the time since death. The researchers rigorously tested the predictability of microbial community changes over the decomposition timeline, which is essential for using microbes as a "clock" to estimate PMI.

     The study builds upon previous research by Pechal et al. (2013), which demonstrated consistent changes in skin and mouth bacterial communities during decomposition of swine corpses over 5 days. The current study expands on this work by characterizing microbial community change in multiple sites and providing a proof-of-principle demonstration of the potential of microbial community ecology to be developed into a complementary forensic tool for estimating PMI. The results of this study provide a foundation for further research into the use of microbial communities in forensic science.
Despite the vast diversity of body forms in nature, bilaterian animals share common sets of developmental genes that display conserved expression patterns in the embryo. Among these genes are the Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior-posterior axis. Hox proteins exert their function by interacting with TALE transcription factors. However, the presence of Hox and TALE members in some but not all non-bilaterian phyla raises the question of how Hox-TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information.

     Researchers used proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages to show that Hox-TALE networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. The study found that Hox-TALE networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. The results highlight how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans.

     The study proposes that Hox-TALE networks constituted an ancestral regulatory module that was later exploited for patterning functions in Bilateria. This network was effective as soon as different interaction modes could exist with duplicated Hox family members, allowing diversifying patterning functions along the body axis. The original molecular system was subsequently co-opted by the various contexts of embryogenesis in different eumetazoan phyla for axis or tissue patterning.

     Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of all bilaterian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. Given their important patterning roles, Hox genes are thought to have strongly contributed to morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution. Although these networks rely on intricate molecular properties, they originated from an ancestral generic mode of interaction that was kept in other homeobox gene families.

     The study found that developmental genes can display highly dissimilar expression patterns or be absent in non-bilaterian lineages, showing that the genetic mechanisms underlying embryonic development are not universal. Interestingly, Cnidaria is the only non-bilaterian phylum with a bona fide Hox repertoire, whereas others lack Hox genes. This raises the question of how the Hox gene family acquired its crucial axial patterning functions during metazoan evolution. In Bilateria, Hox patterning functions rely on the presence of the PBC and Meis proteins, which are also present in non-bilaterian phyla.
Biomedical researchers used super-resolution microscopy to study the behavior of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in synapses. AMPARs are proteins that play a crucial role in transmitting signals between neurons. The study aimed to understand how the size of fluorescent probes attached to AMPARs affects their movement and localization within and outside of post-synaptic densities (PSDs).

The researchers used different-sized fluorescent probes, including organic dyes, small quantum dots (sQDs), and large quantum dots (bQDs), to label AMPARs in rat neurons. They found that the majority of AMPARs labeled with sQDs or organic dyes were confined to nanodomains within PSDs, which are stable for at least 15 minutes. In contrast, most AMPARs labeled with bQDs were found outside of PSDs and were highly mobile.

The study suggests that AMPARs can rapidly enter stable nanodomains within PSDs, rather than accumulating in extrasynaptic membranes. This finding contradicts the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD "slots." The researchers also found that the size of the fluorescent probe affects the behavior of AMPARs, with smaller probes (sQDs and organic dyes) allowing for more accurate tracking of AMPAR dynamics.

Using super-resolution microscopy, the researchers were able to observe the dynamics of AMPARs in synapses for extended periods, up to 60 minutes. They found that the localization of AMPARs is predominantly at synaptic regions, with typically one nanodomain per synapse. The study highlights the importance of using smaller fluorescent probes to accurately track the behavior of AMPARs and other neurotransmitter receptors in synapses.

The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. AMPARs play a critical role in learning and memory, and understanding their behavior and regulation is essential for developing new treatments for neurological disorders. The use of super-resolution microscopy and smaller fluorescent probes has enabled researchers to gain new insights into the behavior of AMPARs and their role in synaptic function.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the earliest response of central neurons to hypoxia, a condition characterized by insufficient oxygen supply to the brain. A recent study has shed light on this process, revealing that the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) pathway plays a crucial role in the initial response of central neurons to acute hypoxia. Specifically, the study found that hypoxia activates the SUMO pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN), leading to the SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels, an increase in voltage-gated sodium current (INa), and a shift in the voltage-dependence of channel activation.

     The study demonstrated that the time-course for SUMOylation of single NaV1.2 channels at the cell surface and changes in INa coincide, and both are prevented by mutation of NaV1.2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme. Within 40 seconds, hypoxia-induced linkage of SUMO1 to the channels is complete, resulting in larger sodium currents in response to depolarizing steps. The study also found that the SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 channels are potential targets for neuroprotective interventions, given the recognized role of INa in hypoxic brain damage.

     The research further showed that hypoxia-mediated SUMOylation of NaV1.2 is observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a potent blocker of sodium channels, indicating that Na+ flux is not a prerequisite for channel SUMOylation. Additionally, the study found that the SUMO pathway tonically controls INa under normoxic conditions, with SUMO1 and SENP1 increasing and decreasing the current, respectively. The response of INa to hypoxia was ablated by µ-Conotoxin-TIIIA (CnTX), a potent blocker of NaV1.2 channels, supporting the implied mechanism of rapid SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels at the CGN plasma membrane in response to hypoxia.

     The study's findings suggest that NaV1.2 channels and SUMO pathway enzymes may be valuable therapeutic targets for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons. The research has significant implications for the development of neuroprotective interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of hypoxia on the brain.
Biomedical researchers have developed a model to predict the transmission of Ross River virus (RRV), a mosquito-borne pathogen found in Australia, the Pacific Islands, and potentially emerging worldwide. The model shows that RRV transmission peaks at moderate temperatures of 26.4°C and declines to zero at temperatures of 17.0°C and 31.5°C. This means that RRV transmission is likely to be year-round in tropical areas, but seasonal in temperate regions, resulting in a nationwide seasonal peak in human cases.

The study's findings suggest that climate warming will likely increase RRV transmission in temperate areas, where most Australians live, but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum. The researchers used a mechanistic model based on empirical, unimodal thermal responses to parameterize the temperature-dependent transmission of RRV. They used data from two important vector species, Cx. annulirostris and Ae. vigilax, to develop the model.

The study's results support a general pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission, where the optimal temperature is driven by adult mosquito lifespan. However, the upper and lower thermal limits of transmission are more uncertain and may be determined by unique traits for different vector-pathogen systems. The researchers found that the strongest statistical signal of temperature on disease is expected in temperate regions, where mean temperature varies along the rapidly rising portion of the R0 curve.

The study highlights the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change. The researchers note that thermal responses vary substantially among diseases and vector species, and that identifying transmission optima and limits by characterizing nonlinear thermal responses can more accurately predict geographic, seasonal, and interannual variation in disease. The study's findings have implications for understanding the effects of climate change on mosquito-borne disease transmission and for predicting the emergence and spread of new mosquito-borne pathogens.

     Biomedical researchers have long been interested in understanding the role of beta band oscillations in the motor cortex, a region of the brain involved in movement planning and execution. These oscillations, which occur at a frequency of 13-30 Hz, have been linked to changes in underlying neural activity, but the specific behavioral manifestations of these changes have remained unclear.

     To investigate how changes in population neural activity, beta oscillations, and behavior are linked, researchers recorded multi-scale neural activity from the motor cortex of three macaques while they performed a novel neurofeedback task. The task required the animals to volitionally bring their beta oscillatory power to an instructed state and then execute an arm reach.

     The results showed that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power exhibited significantly faster movement onset times than reaches preceded by an increase in beta power. Furthermore, population neural activity was found to shift farther from a movement onset state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching tasks. This finding establishes a population neural basis for slowed movement onset following periods of beta oscillatory activity.

     Notably, this shift in neural population was also seen in naturally occurring beta oscillations during reaching tasks, suggesting that beta oscillations reflect a common signature of spiking patterns even in different task contexts. This study ties together existing works on behavioral correlates of beta oscillations with hypotheses of how the motor cortex encodes movement onset through the lens of population-level neural activity.

     The results of this study support the hypothesis that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow the onset of new movements. This is consistent with previous findings of elevated beta power prior to and after well-trained movements. However, individual unit responses during beta activity were found to be different across tasks, suggesting that beta oscillations may be generated by different mechanisms in different contexts.

     Despite these differences, population-level analyses showed that beta oscillations promote a consistent movement-slowing state during both neurofeedback-induced and naturally occurring beta oscillations. This finding has implications for our understanding of how the motor cortex encodes movement onset and suggests that beta oscillations play a key role in slowing the initiation of new movements.

     TRAF2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation and homeostasis of immune cells. It is a component of the TNF superfamily signaling complexes and is essential for the proper functioning of the immune system. However, the role of TRAF2 in adult tissues is not well understood, as mice deficient in TRAF2 die shortly after birth.

     Researchers have investigated the function of TRAF2 in keratinocytes, a type of skin cell, and found that its absence leads to psoriasis-like skin inflammation and epidermal hyperplasia. This inflammation is driven by TNF, cell death, non-canonical NF-κB, and the adaptive immune system. The study suggests that TRAF2 has essential tissue-specific functions that do not overlap with those of Sphk1, an enzyme involved in the generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate.

     In the absence of TRAF2, keratinocytes are more sensitive to killing by TNF and exhibit delayed activation of NF-κB and MAPK. This leads to a vicious cycle of inflammation, where TNF-induced death of keratinocytes triggers the production of inflammatory cytokines, which in turn recruit immune cells to the skin, exacerbating the inflammation.

     The study also found that the absence of TRAF2 in keratinocytes leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines via the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, even in the absence of TNF. These cytokines recruit inflammatory immune cells, including neutrophils and IFNγ+ T cells, to the skin, resulting in a psoriasis-like phenotype.

     The researchers were able to reverse the inflammatory phenotype by simultaneously deleting both TNF and NF-κB2 genes, highlighting the importance of TRAF2 in protecting keratinocytes from cell death and down-regulating inflammatory responses. The study suggests that intrinsic defects in keratinocytes can initiate psoriasis-like skin inflammation, and that TRAF2 plays a critical role in maintaining skin homeostasis.
Biomedical researchers have long understood that synaptic vesicles (SVs) play a crucial role in transmitting signals between neurons. After releasing neurotransmitters, SVs are rapidly recycled through a process called endocytosis, where their membranes are retrieved and reused to form new SVs. A key aspect of this process is the formation of large endocytic vacuoles, or "bulk" endosomes, which are thought to be involved in the recycling of SV membranes.

Recent studies have suggested that clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and dynamin 1 and 3, proteins involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, are essential for this process. However, a new study has challenged this understanding by investigating the role of CME and dynamin 1 and 3 in the formation of new SVs from bulk endosomes. The researchers used neurons that lacked dynamin 1 and 3, making them unable to form clathrin-coated vesicles, and found that the formation of bulk endosomes was not impaired.

In fact, the absence of dynamin 1 and 3 led to an increase in the formation of bulk endosomes. Furthermore, the conversion of these endosomes into new SVs occurred independently of clathrin, as evidenced by the lack of clathrin-coated buds on the surface of the endosomes and the continued conversion of endosomes into SVs even after clathrin levels were depleted. These findings suggest that there is an alternative pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the need for clathrin and dynamin 1 and 3.

This study provides new insights into the complex process of synaptic vesicle recycling and suggests that bulk endosomes play a more significant role in this process than previously thought. The discovery of a dynamin 1-, dynamin 3-, and clathrin-independent pathway for SV reformation has important implications for our understanding of synaptic function and plasticity, particularly during intense synaptic activity. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying this process and its role in neurological disorders.
Biomedical researchers have long sought a reliable biomarker to measure the effects of glucocorticoids, a class of commonly prescribed medications. Glucocorticoids play a crucial role in regulating various bodily functions, including metabolism, immune response, and stress response. However, there is currently no established biomarker to quantify their action in the body. To address this gap, a recent study aimed to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid action in humans.

The study involved 10 participants with primary adrenal insufficiency, a rare disorder characterized by absent or very low endogenous glucocorticoid production. The participants were admitted to an in-patient clinic and underwent a randomized, crossover trial, where they received physiological glucocorticoid exposure and withdrawal. The researchers collected and analyzed various biological samples, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, adipose tissue, plasma microRNAs, and serum metabolites.

Using integrated multi-omic analysis, the researchers identified a transcriptomic profile derived from both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue that was predictive of glucocorticoid exposure. They also identified a microRNA, miR-122-5p, which was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoid exposure. Notably, this microRNA was replicated in independent studies with varying glucocorticoid exposure, suggesting its potential as a reliable biomarker.

The study's findings have significant implications for the optimization of glucocorticoid therapy and the understanding of disease etiology related to unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity. The identification of miR-122-5p as a putative biomarker of glucocorticoid action opens up new avenues for research into the effects of glucocorticoids on human health and disease. Further studies are needed to validate the use of miR-122-5p as a biomarker and to explore its potential applications in clinical practice.
Biologists have long understood that amino acids play a crucial role in activating the mTORC1 complex, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Recent research has shed light on the dynamics of this process, revealing a complex interplay between amino acids, lysosomes, and the mTORC1 complex.

The study found that amino acids trigger the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes, a process that is essential for its activation. Using live imaging techniques, researchers observed that this translocation occurs rapidly, within 2 minutes of amino acid addition, and peaks within 5 minutes. This process is accompanied by the appearance of fluorescent leucine in lysosomes, suggesting that amino acids are being sensed and processed within these organelles.

The study also identified key regulators of mTORC1 activity, including Sestrin2 and the vacuolar ATPase. Sestrin2 acts as a negative regulator, while the vacuolar ATPase is a positive regulator of mTORC1 activity. Notably, the phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, indicating that mTORC1 undergoes a dynamic and transient passage from the lysosomal surface before targeting its substrates elsewhere.

The researchers used a cell-permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester to image RAPTOR, a component of the mTORC1 complex, in live cells. This allowed them to visualize the dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids. The results showed that the lysosome is a crucial locus for mTOR activation, but the process is more complex than previously thought.

The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of mTORC1 activation, highlighting the importance of lysosomes in sensing amino acids and regulating cell growth and metabolism. The findings also suggest that multiple types of amino acid sensing may be involved in mTORC1 activation, including the sensing of leucine by Sestrin1/2 proteins and the transport of arginine into lysosomes via the SLC38A9 transporter. Overall, this research advances our understanding of the complex interplay between amino acids, lysosomes, and the mTORC1 complex.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the glycosylation profile of antigens plays a crucial role in determining how they are processed and presented to the immune system. A recent study has demonstrated that modifying a model antigen, Ovalbumin (OVA), with a specific glycan structure, LewisX (LeX), alters its intracellular routing in dendritic cells and enhances the priming of T cells.

     The researchers found that the LeX modification of OVA directs it towards the C-type lectin receptor MGL1, which is involved in the recognition of glycan structures. This re-routing of OVA leads to an enhanced cross-presentation of the antigen to CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a key role in cell-mediated immunity. The study also showed that the LeX modification of OVA favors the skewing of CD4+ T cells towards a Th1 response, which is characterized by the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).

     Importantly, the researchers found that the LeX modification of OVA reduces the amount of antigen required for cross-presentation by 100-fold and eliminates the need for Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, which is typically required for the activation of dendritic cells. The study also showed that the cross-presentation of OVA-LeX is independent of TAP-transporters and Cathepsin-S, which are typically involved in the processing and presentation of antigens to CD8+ T cells.

     The researchers used MGL1-deficient mice to confirm that MGL1 is the primary lectin involved in the cross-presentation of OVA-LeX. They found that mice lacking MGL1 expression on dendritic cells did not show enhanced frequencies of OVA-specific effector T cells after immunization with LeX-conjugated OVA.

     Overall, the study demonstrates that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can influence their intracellular routing, the nature, and strength of immune responses. The findings suggest that modifying antigens with specific glycan structures, such as LeX, may be a useful strategy for optimizing current vaccination strategies and enhancing the efficacy of immune responses.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a novel mechanism by which certain bacteria, Burkholderia thailandensis, control the growth of mutants that do not respond to quorum sensing signals. Quorum sensing is a process by which bacteria communicate with each other through chemical signals to coordinate their behavior. In B. thailandensis, quorum sensing regulates hundreds of genes, including those involved in the type VI secretion system (T6SS). The T6SS is a complex system that allows bacteria to kill or inhibit the growth of other bacteria through the secretion of toxins and the production of immunity proteins.

     The researchers found that the T6SS is activated by quorum sensing in B. thailandensis and is essential for controlling the growth of mutants that do not respond to quorum sensing signals. These mutants, which lack the BtaR1 quorum-sensing signal receptor, have a significant growth advantage over wild-type cells in liquid broth cultures. However, when grown on agar surfaces, where cell-cell contact is possible, the wild-type cells are able to outcompete the mutants due to the T6SS-mediated growth inhibition.

     The researchers propose that quorum sensing activates the T6SS in wild-type cells, allowing them to produce toxins and immunity proteins that inhibit the growth of quorum-sensing mutants. This mechanism serves as a form of "microbial policing," where quorum-sensing competent bacteria are able to control the growth of mutants that do not respond to quorum sensing signals.

     This study provides new insights into the role of T6SS in controlling the growth of quorum-sensing mutants and highlights the importance of quorum sensing in regulating bacterial behavior. The findings have implications for our understanding of how bacteria interact with each other and their environment, and may have potential applications in the development of new strategies for controlling bacterial populations. The study also suggests that T6SS-mediated killing is not limited to interspecies competition, but can also be used to control the growth of mutants within the same species.

     The researchers used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of T6SS in B. thailandensis. They found that the T6SS is essential for controlling the growth of quorum-sensing mutants and that quorum sensing activates the T6SS in wild-type cells. The study provides evidence for a novel mechanism of microbial policing, where quorum-sensing competent bacteria are able to control the growth of mutants that do not respond to quorum sensing signals. The findings have important implications for our understanding of bacterial behavior and may have potential applications in the development of new strategies for controlling bacterial populations.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the connection between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus plays a crucial role in cognitive performance, and this connection is established early in life. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms of this connection are not yet fully understood. A recent study aimed to elucidate the contribution of glutamatergic projection neurons in the hippocampus to the emergence of prefrontal oscillations in neonatal mice.

     The study used optogenetic manipulation to selectively target glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either the dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus in neonatal mice. The results showed that the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with the intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in the intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosted prefrontal oscillations.

     The study found that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of the intermediate and ventral hippocampus, but not the dorsal hippocampus, elicited broad band oscillations in the prefrontal cortex of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections. The tight coupling by synchrony and the directed information flow from the hippocampal CA1 area to the prefrontal cortex via direct axonal projections suggest that the hippocampus acts as a drive for prefrontal activation already at neonatal age.

     The study also identified differences in communication between the dorsal and intermediate/ventral hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex, arguing for a prominent augmentation of driving force along the septo-temporal hippocampal axis. The findings provide causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the intermediate and ventral hippocampus drives the oscillatory entrainment of local circuits in the prefrontal cortex.

     The study's optogenetic protocol represents a new tool for assessing the adult behavioral readout of long-range communication in the developing brain. Further research is needed to understand how the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the development of cognitive functions and the underlying neural mechanisms.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a new type of post-translational modification on the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), a crucial enzyme responsible for transcribing genetic information into RNA. This modification involves the methylation of lysine residues on the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII, specifically at position 7 (K7). The study found that mono- and di-methylation of K7 residues (K7me1 and K7me2) occur during the earliest stages of transcription, preceding or accompanying the phosphorylation of serine residues at positions 5 and 7 (S5p and S7p). In contrast, acetylation of K7 residues (K7ac) is associated with productive elongation, serine-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression.

     The researchers developed new antibodies to detect K7me1 and K7me2 and used biochemical and genome-wide approaches to show that these modifications are present at the promoters of genes that are productively transcribed into mature RNA. The study also found that mutation of CTD-K7 residues is compatible with the viability of mouse fibroblasts, suggesting that global serine phosphorylation and RNAPII localization are independent of the presence or absence of K7 residues.

     The results indicate that the extent of productive transcription at active genes with similar RNAPII recruitment to their promoters is modulated at the level of CTD-K7 modifications. Methylation of K7 residues is associated with less productive transcription, while K7 acetylation is most enriched at the highest expressed genes. This balance between methylation and acetylation of K7 residues fine-tunes gene expression levels. The study provides new insights into the regulation of transcription and the role of post-translational modifications in modulating gene expression.
summary
     Biomedical research has shed light on the mechanisms governing the quiescence of skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs). These cells play a crucial role in muscle tissue repair and regeneration. In their quiescent state, SCs remain dormant until muscle injury triggers their activation, proliferation, and self-renewal to replenish the SC population. To understand how SCs maintain quiescence, researchers identified differentially expressed gene transcripts following muscle injury. Among these, the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin (TTP) was found to be significantly changed.

     TTP promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment. Upon SC activation, the p38α/β MAPK signaling pathway phosphorylates and inactivates TTP, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. This allows MyoD to accumulate and drive SCs to commit to myoblasts. Satellite cell-specific knockdown of TTP precociously activates SCs in vivo, leading to MyoD accumulation, differentiation, and cell fusion into myofibers.

     The study suggests that TTP regulates mRNAs as one of several critical post-transcriptional mechanisms controlling SC homeostasis. MyoD up-regulates its own transcription, creating a rapid feed-forward loop that drives SCs to commit to myoblasts upon muscle injury. TTP may also be involved in down-regulating MyoD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts during the initial formation of a quiescent SC population or upon reacquisition of quiescence following an injury.

     The research proposes that TTP suppresses transcripts for SC activation as a mechanism for immediate exit from quiescence. Upon muscle injury, p38α/β MAPK is rapidly activated, resulting in the phosphorylation and inactivation of TTP. This inactivation allows MyoD mRNA to accumulate, driving SCs to commit to the myogenic lineage. The study highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of RNA in skeletal muscle homeostasis and the role of TTP in maintaining SC quiescence.
summary
     Infants with defects in the interleukin 10 receptor (IL10R) are prone to developing very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Researchers investigated whether IL10R regulates lamina propria macrophage function during infant development in mice and whether macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy. The study found that signs of colitis were absent in IL10R-deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, but intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction began during the third week of life, concomitant with weaning and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis, while the absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is crucial for preventing the development of murine colitis.

The study used detailed time-series experiments to evaluate histology, inflammatory gene expression, cellular composition of the lamina propria, and luminal bacterial communities from birth to 14 weeks of age in IL10R-deficient infant mice and their littermate controls. The results suggest that IL10R does not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development. Instead, the study found that macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy. The requirement for macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling develops during a critical developmental transition, which has important implications for understanding factors that initiate colitis in infants with genetic deficiencies in IL10R signaling.

Previous studies have shown that the IL10/IL10R pathway is essential for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and prevention of intestinal inflammation in infancy. Modeling infantile-onset colitis in mice that lack functional IL10R signaling could lead to significant advances in our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases. The findings of this study highlight the importance of IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period in preventing the development of murine colitis.
summary
     Biologists have identified a protein called SIMR-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in the regulation of transposons and other germline genes. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that can jump from one location to another in the genome, and their regulation is essential for maintaining genome stability. SIMR-1 is a Tudor domain protein that acts downstream of piRNA production and upstream of the mutator complex, which is responsible for synthesizing secondary siRNAs from piRNA-targeted mRNAs.

The piRNA pathway is a complex process that involves the recognition of target mRNAs by piRNAs, followed by the amplification of siRNAs by the mutator complex. However, the steps between mRNA recognition by the piRNA pathway and siRNA amplification by the mutator complex were previously unknown. The researchers found that SIMR-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, which are phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively.

SIMR-1 may function similarly to Krimper, a protein that coordinates Ago3 and Aubergine during ping-pong piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila. The researchers suggest that SIMR-1 bridges the gap between the primary and secondary phases of the C. elegans piRNA silencing pathway. They also found that SIMR-1 localizes to cytoplasmic foci near P granules, Z granules, and Mutator foci, implicating a series of distinct perinuclear condensates in the regulation of mRNAs by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex.

The study identifies SIMR-1 as a factor that acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex. This suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in promoting mRNA regulation by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex. The researchers propose that SIMR-1 may interact with other proteins, such as RDE-12, to shuttle piRNA-targeted mRNAs into SIMR-1 foci and ultimately to Mutator foci. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of transposons and other germline genes in C. elegans and highlights the importance of perinuclear condensates in the piRNA pathway.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long been interested in understanding the behavior of Purkinje neurons, which play a crucial role in cerebellar function. These neurons have been shown to exhibit membrane bistability in vitro and in vivo under anesthesia, but the existence of bistability in awake animals has been disputed. To investigate this, a team of scientists recorded intracellularly from Purkinje neurons in unanesthetized larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). The results unequivocally demonstrate bistability in these neurons, with tonic firing observed in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolarized membrane potentials.

     The researchers found that Purkinje neurons could switch between states spontaneously or with current injection, and that activation of AMPA receptors by climbing fibers (CFs) was sufficient to trigger bursts. Furthermore, the initiation of motor neuron spiking was correlated with increased incidence of CF excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and membrane depolarization. Developmentally, bistability was observed soon after Purkinje neuron specification and persisted at least until late larval stages.

     The study also showed that two types of glutamatergic excitation are observed in Purkinje neurons: strong excitation from CFs and weak excitation from parallel fibers (PFs), both mediated by AMPA receptors. Bistability in Purkinje neurons has been reported in vitro in amniotes and in vivo under anesthesia in rodents, but this is the first time it has been observed in vivo in an awake animal.

     The researchers recorded from Purkinje neurons of larval zebrafish from 4 days post-fertilization (dpf) to 19 dpf, allowing them to study intracellular membrane potential dynamics in the context of fictive motor output. While it is possible that the bistability observed is a property of a developing network and may not be present in the mature cerebellum of the adult, the conservation of other structural and functional properties of the cerebellum suggests that bistability may be a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons from fish to mammals.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the behavior of Purkinje neurons in vivo and highlights the importance of AMPA receptor-mediated CF inputs in driving state-dependent bursting in these neurons. The findings have implications for our understanding of cerebellar function and motor control, and suggest that bistability may be a fundamental property of Purkinje neurons across species.
Biologists have long understood that the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where cells internalize molecules and particles from their surroundings. A recent study has provided new insights into how the actin cytoskeleton self-organizes and adapts to generate the necessary force to internalize endocytic pits against the tension of the cell membrane.

    The study used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to model the behavior of the actin cytoskeleton during endocytosis. The researchers found that a minimal branched actin network, composed of actin, the Arp2/3 complex, and capping protein, is sufficient to generate the necessary force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension. This network self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented towards the base of the pit, and long actin filaments bend between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit.

    The study also showed that around 200 activated Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization of endocytic pits. Using a newly developed molecule-counting method, the researchers determined that approximately 200 Arp2/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations predicted that the actin network self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented towards the base of the pit, and that elastic energy stored in bent filaments contributes to endocytic internalization.

    The researchers also found that elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments towards the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production. This adaptive mechanism allows the actin network to change its organization and force-producing capacity under varying physical constraints. The study suggests that the spatially constrained actin filament assembly is essential for endocytosis under conditions of high membrane tension.

    The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and highlight the importance of the actin cytoskeleton in generating the necessary force to internalize endocytic pits against the tension of the cell membrane. The study's multiscale model of actin in mammalian endocytosis can be used to further investigate the mechanisms of endocytosis and the role of the actin cytoskeleton in this process.
summary
     Biologists have long studied macropinocytosis, a process by which cells engulf and internalize large volumes of extracellular fluid. A key step in this process is the formation of a macropinocytic cup, a cup-shaped projection of the plasma membrane driven by actin polymerization. Recent research has shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of these cups in Dictyostelium cells.

     The study found that macropinocytic cups in Dictyostelium are organized around intense patches of PIP3, active Ras, and active Rac. These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery. The formation of these patches does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring, and they become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, indicating that Ras plays an instructive role in their formation.

     The researchers used lattice light sheet microscopy to examine macropinocytosis in 3D detail and mapped the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SCAR and WASP with respect to signalling molecules like PIP3 and active Ras. This led them to propose a new hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane.

     The study also found that new macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. The F-actin in de novo macropinosome cups is closely associated with signalling molecules, including active Ras. Circular ruffles can persist on the cell surface for prolonged periods before either closing successfully or regressing back into the cell body.

     The researchers propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery. This ring of active SCAR drives a hollow ring of F-actin to extend the walls of the macropinocytic cup. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying macropinocytosis and the formation of macropinocytic cups.
Biologists have long understood the importance of the cohesin ring in holding together newly replicated sister chromatids until their separation at anaphase during cell division. A separate complex, Scc2NIPBL/Scc4Mau2 (Scc2/4), is responsible for loading cohesin onto DNA and determining its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is crucial for cell division, and defects in this process can lead to chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, resulting in severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms.

     Researchers have now determined the crystal structure of the interaction between Scc2 and Scc4, revealing that Scc4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. Using budding yeast, the team demonstrated that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is necessary to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and build pericentromeric cohesion. This finding shows that Scc4 plays a key role in determining the localization of cohesin loading and provides a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres.

     The study found that Scc4 targets cohesin loading to a specific genomic locus and that this function is separable from its essential role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome. The researchers used the structure of Scc4 bound to a minimal fragment of Scc2 to derive separation of function alleles that uncoupled cohesin loading from cohesin targeting to centromeres. These experiments demonstrated that cohesin targeting in yeast depends on Scc4, consistent with unpublished genetic evidence for an Scc4-dependent cohesin localization pathway.

     Further experiments showed that perturbation of the conserved patch on Scc4 eliminated centromeric localization of Scc2 in mitotic cells and reduced association of the cohesin subunit, Scc1, with the centromere and pericentromere, but not with chromosome arms. This pattern of Scc2 localization was also observed in cells progressing through S phase, the stage at which cohesin loading is initiated. The study suggests that the Scc4-dependent cohesin targeting pathway is a general feature of the control of cohesin loading across diverse eukaryotes.
Biomedical research has shown that being born late in the active season can have significant effects on the growth, fattening, and survival of hibernating animals. A study on garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus) investigated the differences in growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival, and fecundity between early-born (EB) and late-born (LB) juveniles. The results suggest that LB juveniles grow and gain mass twice as fast as EB individuals, but reach lower fat content before hibernation.

The study found that torpor use is low during intensive growth, but increases during pre-hibernation fattening. LB juveniles showed higher torpor use, reached similar body sizes, but lower fat content than EB individuals before hibernation. Additionally, LB individuals showed similar patterns of hibernation, but a higher proportion of breeders during the following year than EB dormice. These findings indicate that torpor is incompatible with growth, but promotes fattening and consolidates pre-hibernation fat depots.

The study also explored the effects of food availability on the growth and fattening of LB and EB juveniles. The results showed that LB juveniles grew and fattened faster than EB individuals, regardless of food availability. However, the use of energy-saving strategies, such as daily torpor, was higher in LB juveniles. The study also found that the pre-hibernation fat reserves of LB juveniles were sufficient to fuel their shorter winter duration due to the five-week delay of hibernation start.

The findings of this study are consistent with previous research on common dormice, which also showed no significant differences in winter survival between EB and LB juveniles. The study suggests that an extensive use of torpor is incompatible with structural growth, but supports pre-hibernation fattening late in the season and the preservation of fat reserves previously deposited prior to hibernation. Overall, the results indicate that being born late in the reproductive season is associated with a fast life history in garden dormice.

     Biomedical researchers have long known that ADAR proteins play a crucial role in altering gene expression by converting adenosine to inosine in RNA. This process, known as A-to-I editing, is essential for proper neuronal function in all animals studied to date. However, the specific targets of ADAR proteins in the nervous system have remained unknown. A recent study in Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of nematode worm, aimed to identify critical ADAR targets in the neural transcriptome. The researchers used a software tool called SAILOR to analyze the effects of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans, on the neural transcriptome. This analysis revealed over 7,300 A-to-I editing events across the neural transcriptome, including 104 novel edited genes. By intersecting the neural editome with gene expression changes associated with ADR-2, the researchers identified a specific mRNA, clec-41, whose neural expression is dependent on deamination. Restoration of clec-41 expression in ADR-2 deficient neural cells rescued the chemotaxis defect, providing the first evidence that neuronal phenotypes of ADAR mutants can be caused by altered gene expression. This study is the first to link a phenotype associated with loss of C. elegans ADAR enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a specific gene. The findings suggest that altered neural gene expression, rather than recoding events, is responsible for the aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack of C. elegans ADR-2. The study provides the first analysis of the tissue-specific role of ADR-2 in A-to-I editing and regulating neural gene expression in C. elegans. The results have significant implications for understanding the neurobiological effects of RNA editing in the nervous system.
summary
     Influenza A virus (IAV) uses a common strategy called host shutoff to repress cellular mRNA translation and allow efficient translation of viral mRNAs. To understand the mechanisms behind this process, researchers used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to study IAV-induced host shutoff. The results show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated, and instead, the decline in cellular protein synthesis is caused by the viral takeover of the mRNA pool. This takeover leads to a reduction in cellular mRNA expression, which is the main cause of host shutoff during IAV infection.

The study found that viral genes have translation efficiencies similar to those of host genes, indicating that direct co-opting of the translation machinery does not play a dominant role in cellular gene shutoff. Instead, the viral dominance over the mRNA pool is the primary mechanism behind host shutoff. At 8 hours post-infection (hpi), viral mRNAs take over 53.8% of the translation activity in the cells, while 57.3% of the mRNAs in the cells are viral. This suggests that the relative reduction in cellular mRNA expression is the main cause of host shutoff during IAV infection.

Interestingly, the study found that short transcripts are less affected by IAV infection, and these mRNAs are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. The results of this study advance our understanding of IAV-induced host shutoff and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.

The findings of this study contradict previous suggestions that IAV uses direct co-opting of the translation machinery to repress cellular mRNA translation. Instead, the viral takeover of the mRNA pool is the primary mechanism behind host shutoff. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of IAV-induced host shutoff and highlights the importance of oxidative phosphorylation in viral propagation. Overall, the results of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions between IAV and the host cell.
Biologists have long known that gradients of signaling proteins play a crucial role in shaping the development of tissues and organs. However, the mechanisms behind the formation of these gradients are not yet fully understood. A recent study in Drosophila (fruit flies) has shed new light on this process by investigating how a signaling protein called FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) forms a gradient in the development of the wing imaginal disc.

In this study, researchers used fluorescently-tagged versions of FGF and its receptor, FGFR, to visualize their distribution in the wing imaginal disc. They found that FGF produced in the disc moves to the air-sac-primordium (ASP) through specialized structures called cytonemes that extend from the ASP to the wing disc. The number of cytonemes decreases with increasing distance from the FGF source, generating a gradient of FGF in the ASP.

The researchers also discovered that the transcription factors Pointed-P1 and Cut, which are activated by FGF, regulate the formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes. These transcription factors create regions with higher or lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes, resulting in a precise gradient of FGF in the ASP. This gradient, in turn, regulates the expression of specific genes in the ASP, such as pointed-P1 at higher levels and cut at lower levels.

This study reveals a novel mechanism by which morphogens, such as FGF, can self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion. The findings have important implications for our understanding of tissue morphogenesis and the development of complex tissues and organs. The study demonstrates that cytoneme-dependent signaling can provide precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.

The researchers used the Drosophila larval wing imaginal disc as a model system to investigate the formation of the FGF gradient. This system is unique because the wing disc and the ASP are spatially separated, allowing for the study of long-range signaling. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis and highlight the importance of cytoneme-dependent signaling in shaping the development of complex tissues and organs.
Despite being the most well-understood protein fold, α-helical coiled coils have been found to exhibit an unexpected property. Researchers have discovered that inserting two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil can cause the formation of a new type of fiber. This insertion strains the supercoil, leading to the local formation of short β-strands. These β-strands move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis, resulting in the creation of an α/β coiled coil.

The α/β coiled coil retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. This novel structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold. The α-helical coiled coil is a ubiquitous protein domain found in a wide range of structural and functional contexts. It was the first protein fold described in atomic detail and is also the only one whose backbone structure can be computed with parametric equations.

Insertions of two and six residues were previously thought to cause the greatest strain on α-helical geometry. However, researchers have found that these insertions break the α-helices to form short β-strands, which associate into a triangular supersecondary structure called the β-layer. The β-layer is found repetitively in natural coiled coils, where it forms regular fibers with alternating α- and β-structure. This protein fold has not been described before.

The α/β coiled coil is a new class of protein fiber based on a novel supersecondary structure element. It consists of alternating α- and β-layers, with the first β-layer occurring after a position g of the preceding heptad. This g position is biased towards a c position, yielding the same g/c position. The discovery of the α/β coiled coil expands our understanding of protein structure and design possibilities.
summary
     Epsin is a protein that plays a crucial role in the process of endocytosis, which is the uptake of molecules into cells through the formation of clathrin-coated pits. Endocytosis is essential for various cellular functions, including cell signaling, nutrient uptake, and waste removal. However, the exact function of epsin in endocytosis has remained elusive until now.

     Researchers generated embryonic fibroblasts from mice lacking all three forms of epsin (epsin triple KO mice) to study its role in endocytosis. The results showed that the absence of epsin led to a significant impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, resulting in the accumulation of early and U-shaped clathrin-coated pits. This defect was correlated with a disruption in the interaction between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits.

     In a cell-free assay, the researchers confirmed that epsin is involved in the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton. They found that epsin helps generate the force necessary for the invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits. This process is critical for the successful completion of endocytosis.

     The study also revealed a weak interaction between epsin's ENTH domain and the SNARE synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2, which is involved in the fusion of intracellular vesicles with their target membranes. However, the researchers found that epsin's most critical function is at the earlier stages of clathrin coat maturation, specifically at the transition between shallow/U-shaped and deep invaginated pits.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the role of epsin in endocytosis and highlight its importance in the coupling of the endocytic clathrin coat to the actin cytoskeleton. The study suggests that epsin plays a key role in generating the force necessary for the invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits, which is essential for the successful completion of endocytosis.
A study conducted in urban Uganda investigated the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren aged 5-17 years. The researchers used a case-control study design, comparing 555 children with asthma (cases) to 1115 children without asthma (controls). The study found that several factors increased the risk of asthma in schoolchildren, including having a father or mother with a tertiary education, being born in a small town or city, and having a family history of asthma or allergic conditions.

The study showed a strong association between the area of residence at birth and the risk of asthma. Children born in small towns or cities had a higher risk of asthma compared to those born in rural areas. This risk increased further in the presence of other asthma risk factors, such as parental history of allergic disease, children's own atopy, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity.

The researchers found that children with asthma were slightly older and more likely to have parents with a tertiary education and a reported history of asthma. The study also found that even among children with no parental history of allergic disease, being born in a town or city was associated with an increased risk of asthma compared to being born in a rural area.

The study's findings suggest that asthma is associated with a strong rural-town-city risk gradient, higher parental socio-economic status, and urbanicity. This is particularly concerning given the rapid urbanization in Africa and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which is likely to increase the prevalence of asthma. The study provides a basis for future research to identify specific environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to the increased risk of asthma among children in urban areas of LMICs.
summary
     Biomedical research has shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of color patterns in zebrafish. A recent study has identified the importance of gap junctions composed of connexins 41.8 and 39.4 in this process. Gap junctions are specialized channels that allow direct communication between adjacent cells. In zebrafish, three types of pigment cells – melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores – interact to form the characteristic striped pattern on their bodies and fins.

     Mutations in the leopard (leo) gene, which encodes connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8), result in a series of spotted patterns in zebrafish. A new dominant allele, leotK3, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting that it has a dominant negative effect on another component of gap junctions. Further investigation revealed that this component is connexin 39.4 (Cx39.4), encoded by the luchs gene. Loss-of-function alleles of luchs demonstrate that it is essential for stripe formation in zebrafish, but the fins are largely unaffected.

     Double mutants and chimeras showed that leo and luchs are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores. This suggests that Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 form heteromeric gap junctions, which promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively. These interactions instruct the patterning of iridophores.

     The study found that fish homozygous for leotK3 or trans-heterozygous for leotK3 over leot1 show an identical phenotype of a completely dissolved pattern. Individual melanophores that hardly cluster together are still present, mostly associated with blue iridophores. This indicates that the dramatic expansion of dense iridophores is an indirect effect, possibly caused by mutant xanthophores covering the iridophores.

     The research suggests that Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 interact to form heteromeric gap junctions, which are responsible for some of the interactions that take place among chromatophores while the pigment pattern is established. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of color patterns in zebrafish and highlights the importance of gap junctions in this process.
Summary of Biomedical Research Article: Evolution of Insect Olfactory Receptors

     Insects have a highly developed sense of smell that allows them to detect a wide range of behaviorally relevant odor molecules. This sense is mediated by different types of receptors, including olfactory receptors (ORs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), and gustatory receptors (GRs). While IRs are found in the olfactory organs of all protostomes, ORs are thought to have evolved as an adaptation to the terrestrial lifestyle of insects.

     However, a recent study investigated the olfactory system of three ancient insect species: the wingless bristletail Lepismachilis y-signata, the firebrat Thermobia domestica, and the neopteran leaf insect Phyllium siccifolium. The results suggest that ORs and the olfactory coreceptor (Orco) are likely absent in Lepismachilis, but present in Thermobia and Phyllium. This indicates that ORs did not evolve as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but rather later in insect evolution.

     The study also found that the coreceptor Orco evolved after the bristletails split from their last common ancestor with the remaining insects. However, an olfactory system that relies on both ORs and Orco seems to have evolved after the emergence of wings. This suggests that the evolution of the insect olfactory system is more complex than previously thought.

     The researchers used a combination of approaches to identify the receptors involved in odor detection in these ancient insects. They found that in neopteran insects, most volatile stimuli are recognized by members of the olfactory receptor family (ORs). ORs are distinct from nematode and vertebrate olfactory receptors and have a unique membrane topology.

     The study provides new insights into the evolution of the insect olfactory system and suggests that ORs and Orco evolved at different times in insect evolution. The results also highlight the importance of studying ancient insects to understand the evolution of specific building blocks in olfaction. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of the insect sense of smell and its adaptation to different environments.
summary
     Biomedical researchers conducted a study in Myanmar to investigate the effectiveness of mass antimalarial drug administration (MDA) in reducing the spread of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The study took place in four villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border, where MDA had been implemented to control the disease. The researchers analyzed data on malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in the villages before and after the MDA.

     The results showed that individuals living in neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had a higher risk of developing malaria episodes after the treatment, compared to those living in areas with high adherence. This suggests a "herd effect," where the protection provided by MDA benefits not only those who received the treatment but also those who did not. The study also found that high mosquito biting rates, living in a house with someone who has malaria, or having an asymptomatic malaria infection increased the risk of developing a clinical episode.

     The researchers used detailed spatial and temporal data to examine the relationship between individual and group-level participation in MDA, subclinical infections, and clinical episodes of P. falciparum post-MDA. They found that clinical episodes decreased among all groups for a longer period than the prophylactic effect of the administered antimalarials, indicating a group-level effect from MDA adherence.

     The study provides evidence of a herd effect conferred by MDA for P. falciparum malaria, where the protection provided by the treatment benefits not only those who received it but also those who did not. The findings suggest that spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, may hinder elimination efforts. The study's results have important implications for further research, intervention, and policy work in the control and elimination of malaria.

     The study's primary objective was to investigate the potential herd effect and the impact of non-adherence with regard to MDA for P. falciparum malaria. The researchers found that the herd effect was evident from three lines of evidence: the decrease in clinical episodes among all groups for a longer period than the prophylactic effect of the administered antimalarials, the association between low MDA adherence and increased risk of malaria episodes, and the increase in clinical P. falciparum episodes post-MDA corresponding to an increase in village mosquito biting rates. The study's findings provide an evidence base for further research, intervention, and policy work in the control and elimination of malaria.
Summary of Conservation of Transcription Factor Binding Specificities across 600 Million Years of Bilateria Evolution
     Biologists have long sought to understand how the diverse forms of life on Earth arose from a common ancestor. One key factor in this process is the regulation of gene expression, which is controlled by proteins called transcription factors (TFs). These proteins bind to specific DNA sequences to turn genes on or off, and changes in their binding specificities can lead to the emergence of new cell types and body forms. However, it has been difficult to assess the importance of changes in TF binding specificities in the evolution of different species.

     To address this question, researchers studied the binding specificities of 242 TFs in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and compared them to those in humans and mice. They found that the binding specificities of TFs are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, meaning that the same TFs bind to similar DNA sequences in both species. This conservation extends even to subtle differences in DNA binding preferences, suggesting that TF binding specificities are not subject to significant evolutionary drift.

     The researchers used a technique called HT-SELEX to determine the binding specificities of Drosophila TFs, which revealed a striking level of conservation with human TFs. They found that Drosophila has almost as complex a repertoire of TF binding motifs as humans, and that the conservation of specificity extends to secondary modes of binding and even subtle dinucleotide preferences.

     The study also showed that TFs that belong to the same structural family generally bind to similar sites, and that orthologous TFs in Drosophila and humans have almost identical core DNA binding profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary modes of binding. This suggests that changes in TF binding specificities contribute to the emergence of new cell types and body forms.

     The researchers identified a few human TFs with divergent specificities that function in cell types not found in fruit flies, indicating that the evolution of TF specificities plays a role in the emergence of novel types of differentiated cells. Overall, this study provides new insights into the conservation of TF binding specificities across 600 million years of bilateria evolution and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the diversity of life on Earth.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how the heart and lungs develop together in the human body. This process, called cardio-pulmonary co-development, is critical for the proper formation and maturation of these organs. However, there has been a lack of models to investigate this process in humans.

     Scientists used human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which can become any cell type in the body, to create a model of cardio-pulmonary co-development. They used a step-by-step approach to direct the simultaneous induction of cardiac and lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of hiPSCs. This was achieved by tuning the WNT and Nodal signaling pathways in the absence of external growth factors.

     The researchers used a 3D suspension culture system to create concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-tissues (μTs), which effectively segregated into separate cardiac and pulmonary μTs. The presence of cardiac accompaniment was found to promote alveolar maturation in the lung tissue. When the WNT agonist was withdrawn, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each dual-lineage μT segregated from each other, and cardiac contraction was initiated.

     This study provides an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis. The model allows for the study of the mechanistic interplay between the developing heart and lung, which is essential for their proper formation and maturation. The cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during organogenesis has been well-documented in mouse models, but this study delivers an effective in vitro model for studying this process in humans.

     The researchers demonstrated that co-induction of mesoderm and endoderm drove simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary specification from their respective germ-layer progenitors. Upon transitioning the co-induced cardiac and pulmonary progenitors to 3D suspension culture, they observed expedited alveolar maturation within 3 days, supported by the accompanying cardiac lineage. This study offers a novel model for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue boundary formation. Further investigation is needed to explore the morphological and functional maturation of both cardiac and pulmonary lineages and their crosstalk during this process.
summary
     Biologists have long believed that an organism's mutation rate is a slowly-evolving parameter that is strictly regulated. However, a recent study on Escherichia coli (E. coli) has revealed an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates as a response to changes in selective pressure. The researchers found that when E. coli cells are exposed to high ethanol stress, their mutation rate increases, allowing them to adapt quickly to the stressful environment. This increase in mutation rate is not a permanent change, but rather a transitory state that decreases once the cells are adapted to the stress.

     The study used E. coli as a model system to investigate the dynamics of hypermutation under near-lethal, complex stress. The researchers found that hypermutator states, which are characterized by high mutation rates, are essential for de novo adaptation to high ethanol stress. They also identified cellular mortality as the major force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates. In other words, the death of cells that are unable to adapt to the stress leads to an increase in mutation rates in the remaining cells, allowing them to adapt more quickly.

     The researchers used a defined collection of mutators with distinct mutation rates to identify a range of optimal mutation rates that enable rapid growth under high ethanol stress. They found that an increase in mutation rate is necessary for adaptation to high ethanol stress, but it is not a permanent change. Instead, the mutation rate decreases once the cells are adapted to the stress.

     The study provides new insights into the dynamics of mutation rate evolution and helps explain why maintaining high mutation rates is limited in time. The findings have implications for our understanding of the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapses upon chemotherapy. The study suggests that the balance between robustness and evolvability is crucial for an organism's ability to adapt to changing environments. The results also highlight the importance of cellular mortality in driving the evolution of mutation rates in response to stress.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how plants adjust their growth and defense responses to changing environmental conditions. A key player in this process is the AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 kinase, a metabolic master regulator found in animals, yeast, and plants. This kinase acts at two levels: modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes and reprogramming gene expression. While its first function is well understood, its role in transcriptional reprogramming is less clear, particularly in plants.

     Researchers have identified the Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 as a key regulator of the starvation response and a direct target of the SnRK1 kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changes its dimerization preference, affecting target gene expression and primary metabolism. A bZIP63 knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild-type bZIP63 but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites.

     The study found that the SnRK1 kinase AKIN10 is the major kinase responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63. The importance of bZIP63 phosphorylation at the SnRK1 target sites for its in planta function was further underlined by complementation of the bzip63 mutant with genomic bZIP63 constructs. Wild-type bZIP63, but not a mutant version, could complement the metabolic and senescence phenotypes of the bzip63 mutant.

     The researchers also showed that bZIP63 is an important metabolic regulator, especially under stress/starvation conditions, and that it is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo in a sugar- and energy-dependent manner. They identified SnRK1 as one of the kinases responsible for bZIP63 phosphorylation and found that it targets three highly conserved serine residues in the N- and C-terminus of bZIP63.

     To verify that SnRK1 plays an important role in the in vivo phosphorylation of bZIP63, the researchers compared the phosphorylation state of bZIP63 in plants overexpressing bZIP63-GFP or -YFP in the wild-type and akin10 background, respectively. They demonstrated that the phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for bZIP63's dimerization and activity in planta and proposed a molecular model for a phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization partners, which ultimately regulates metabolic reprogramming.
Biomedical researchers have identified a novel protein called ring finger protein 10 (RNF10) that acts as a messenger between synapses and the nucleus in the brain. Synapses are the connections between neurons where information is transmitted, and the nucleus is the control center of the cell where genes are expressed. RNF10 is activated by calcium signals at the synapse and triggers changes in gene expression in the nucleus.

RNF10 is found at excitatory synapses, where it interacts with a specific subunit of NMDA receptors called GluN2A. When NMDA receptors are activated, RNF10 is released from the synapse and transported to the nucleus through a process called importin-dependent long-distance transport. This transport mechanism allows RNF10 to carry information from the synapse to the nucleus, where it can influence gene expression.

The researchers found that RNF10 is essential for the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP), a process that strengthens the connection between neurons and is thought to be involved in learning and memory. When RNF10 is silenced, LTP is impaired, and the structure of dendritic spines, which are the sites of synaptic connections, is altered. This suggests that RNF10 plays a critical role in the long-lasting changes that occur in the brain as a result of synaptic activity.

The study also found that RNF10 interacts with other proteins, including calmodulin (CaM), which is involved in calcium signaling. This interaction suggests that RNF10 may be part of a larger signaling pathway that links synaptic activity to gene expression in the nucleus.

Overall, the discovery of RNF10 as a synaptonuclear messenger provides new insights into the mechanisms by which synaptic activity influences gene expression and long-term changes in the brain. The findings have implications for our understanding of learning and memory and may lead to the development of new treatments for neurological disorders.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the mechanisms by which Swi2/Snf2 ATPases, a family of enzymes, remodel protein-DNA complexes to regulate chromatin structure and epigenetic state. The enzyme Mot1, a single-subunit remodeler, has been identified as a useful model system for studying Swi2/Snf2 enzymes due to its ability to dissociate TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes. In a recent study, researchers have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2) at a resolution of 3.8 Å.

     The structure reveals that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.

     Swi2/Snf2-type ATPases remodel protein-DNA complexes to regulate chromatin structure and epigenetic state during transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Mot1, apart from being an essential gene regulator, serves as an attractive model system for structural and mechanistic studies of Swi2/Snf2 enzymes. Binding of Mot1 leads to subtle but consistent conformational changes between substrate proteins and DNA, which could prime the complex for ATP-dependent disruption.

     The interface between Mot1 and NC2 observed in the crystal structure is small, but the contact between Mot1's insertion domain and NC2 could help separate NC2's main TBP anchor helix H5 from TBP and H4 from DNA. The study provides a pseudoatomic structure of the Swi2/Snf2 enzyme Mot1 bound to its protein-DNA substrate and a detailed structural framework for the interaction of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex. Swi2/Snf2 enzymes typically remodel protein-DNA complexes by disrupting the interface between the nucleic and protein partners of the target complex.

     ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation of the Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domain could provide most if not all of the chemomechanical force, but a question is whether binding of the remodeler induces conformational changes in the target. The association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes that may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism. The study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified the molecular target of a natural compound called ternatin, which is toxic to cancer cells. Ternatin is a cyclic peptide that was previously known to inhibit the growth of fat cells, but its mechanism of action was unknown. By designing synthetic variants of ternatin, the researchers found that these compounds are up to 500 times more potent against cancer cells than the original compound.

     Further investigation revealed that ternatin and its variants bind to a complex of proteins called the elongation factor-1A ternary complex (eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA). This complex is essential for protein synthesis in cells. The researchers used a photo-affinity probe to confirm that ternatin binds to the eEF1A ternary complex and identified two other natural compounds, didemnin and cytotrienin, that also bind to this complex.

     Mutations in a specific domain of the eEF1A protein prevented ternatin from binding and made cells resistant to its toxic effects. This suggests that the hydrophobic surface of the eEF1A protein is a key site for ternatin binding. The researchers conclude that the eEF1A ternary complex is a common target for natural compounds that are toxic to cancer cells.

     The study also found that ternatin and its variants inhibit protein synthesis in cells, which correlates with their ability to block cell proliferation. The researchers used a photo-ternatin probe to identify the eEF1A ternary complex as a direct target of ternatin-related cyclic peptides. This is the first time a small molecule has been shown to bind specifically to the eEF1A ternary complex.

     The discovery of the eEF1A ternary complex as a target for ternatin and other natural compounds may lead to the development of new cancer therapies. The simplicity and accessibility of the ternatin structure make it an attractive candidate for future medicinal chemistry efforts. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of action of ternatin and its variants and to explore their potential as cancer treatments.
summary
     Biomedical research has shed new light on the role of OCRL in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and uncoating. OCRL is a protein that interacts directly with clathrin, a key component of clathrin-coated pits. Mutations in the OCRL gene cause Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease, which have primarily been attributed to intracellular sorting defects. However, studies of Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts have revealed that OCRL loss impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis, resulting in an endocytic defect. This defect is characterized by an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits.

     Further investigation showed that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor, facilitating the recycling of endocytic factors necessary for the normal progression of endocytosis. The absence of OCRL in patient cells delays endocytosis by stalling late-stage pits, impairs uncoating, and triggers the nucleation of actin comets from clathrin vesicles that retain phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and fail to uncoat.

     The study also found that SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds OCRL. In Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts, the absence of OCRL impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics, resulting in an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to lose their coat. These vesicles nucleate at least a cohort of the intracellular actin comets previously described in Lowe syndrome patient cells.

     The findings suggest that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis contribute to the pathology in patients with OCRL mutations. The study provides new insights into the role of OCRL in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and uncoating, and highlights the importance of OCRL in facilitating the normal progression of endocytosis. The results have implications for our understanding of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for these disorders.
Biomedical researchers have identified a new pathway that contributes to the development of colorectal cancer. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is known to play a crucial role in colorectal cancer, but finding effective inhibitors for this pathway has been a significant challenge. To better understand how this pathway is regulated, scientists investigated the role of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and PYK2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) in intestinal tumorigenesis.

The study found that FAK and PYK2 are elevated in adenomas in mice and human colorectal cancer tissues. These proteins function redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) at the Y216 site. This phosphorylation event reinforces the pathway's output, leading to the accumulation of β-catenin and intestinal tumorigenesis. The researchers also discovered that the phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 is a molecular determinant of GSK3β's recruitment of β-TrCP (β-transducin repeat-containing protein), which is necessary for Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation.

Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 using the inhibitor PF-562271 suppressed adenoma formation in APCmin/+ mice, which are genetically predisposed to intestinal tumorigenesis. This was accompanied by reduced levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin in the intestine. These findings indicate that the FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis.

The study also revealed that the loss of functional APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) leads to the expression of FAK and PYK2, which in turn phosphorylate GSK3βY216 to stabilize β-catenin, initiating and supporting intestinal tumorigenesis. The phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 was previously identified two decades ago, but the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. This study provides new insights into the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and identifies a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

     Biomedical research has investigated the neural control of transitions between posture and movement, focusing on the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. A study examined the continuity of vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion, as well as between two standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS). The relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses.

The results showed discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These findings indicate that humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies as predicted by optimal feedback theory.

The study specifically examined the contribution of vestibular sensory signals to the control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion, as well as between two standing postures. The vestibular system encodes motion of the head in space and is vital to maintaining stability during both quiet standing and locomotion. Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture.

To transition between two motor states, balance correcting responses are disrupted, and the vestibular influence on whole-body balance responses is suspended. This suspension occurs while subjects are still maintaining quiet upright stance, well before the transition onset. The suppression of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting it represents a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states.

The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies. During quiet standing, whole-body accelerations and oscillations within the limits of the base of support are small, and an adaptive feedback controller is used. The vestibular control of balance during locomotor or posture-to-posture transitions can be monitored by continuously quantifying the magnitude of vestibular-evoked balance responses over the transition. This approach has been used previously to monitor the time course of engagement and disengagement of the vestibular control of balance between self- and externally-driven states of balance control.
summary
     The circadian output pathway in cyanobacteria plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic programs in response to light availability. The transcription factor RpaA is the master regulator of circadian transcription in cyanobacteria, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Deletion of rpaA has no effect on viability in constant light conditions, but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark periods alternate. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying this viability defect and found that the rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night.

The rpaA- strain exhibits defects in cell growth and viability in cyclic, but not in constant light environments, suggesting an important role for circadian regulation of gene expression in alternating light/dark cycles. The phosphorylated form of RpaA, regulated by the circadian clock, is critical for the coordination of carbon anabolism and catabolism and thus cell viability in light/dark cycles. Deletion of rpaA prevents glycogen accumulation in light and renders cells unable to utilize existing glycogen at dusk, leading to alterations in cellular energy charge and a severe reduction in fitness.

Reconstruction of carbon utilization pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy charge and viability of the rpaA- strain in light/dark cycling conditions. This suggests that functional circadian output mediated by the activity of RpaA is required for the anticipatory accumulation of carbon reserves during the day, as well as metabolic switching to carbon catabolism at dusk. These metabolic adaptations allow cells to stimulate energy production and sustain cell viability during periods of darkness that challenge and constrain resources for cyanobacterial growth. The study highlights how a circadian output pathway controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations. The findings provide insight into the role of the circadian output pathway in enhancing fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment.
summary
     Biomedical research has shed light on the structure and ion-release mechanism of PIB-4-type ATPases, a subclass of heavy-metal transporting P-type ATPases. These enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by transporting transition metals such as zinc, copper, and cobalt across cellular membranes. However, the metal specificity of PIB-4-ATPases has remained elusive, with some members showing specificity for cobalt, while others transport a broader range of ions, including zinc, nickel, copper, and calcium.

     A recent study has provided the first structural information on an archetypal PIB-4-ATPase, sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1. The data reveal that PIB-4-ATPases lack classical heavy-metal-binding domains (HMBDs) and display an eight-helix M-domain configuration. This finding provides new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters. The study also reveals a dual role for PIB-ATPases in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine.

     Furthermore, the research shows that the turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium-independent, contrasting with many other P-type ATPases. This discovery opens up new avenues for drug discovery, as PIB-4-ATPases function as virulence factors in many pathogens. The study also identifies novel P-type ATPase features, including a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine.

     The study employed the established PIB-4 model sCoaT to shed light on the structure and mechanism of the entire PIB-4-class. The ATPase activity was assessed in vitro in lipid-detergent solution using the Baginski assay, in the presence of a range of different heavy metals. The results provide a promising lead for drug-discovery efforts or to aid the development of tools to manipulate heavy-metal accumulation in plants to prevent accumulation or for enrichment.
Biomedical researchers have long been interested in understanding the phenomenon of monoallelic expression (MAE), where a single allele of a gene is expressed while the other allele remains silent. MAE plays a crucial role in various human diseases, but its regulation has been challenging to study due to its clonal nature. A recent study has identified a chromatin signature that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with high accuracy. This signature is characterized by the simultaneous presence of chromatin marks associated with active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) in the gene body.

     The researchers applied this approach to various cell types and found that approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes exhibited the MAE chromatin signature. Notably, this signature was enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. The study suggests that MAE is linked to cell differentiation and opens a new approach to studying MAE that is independent of polymorphisms.

     The researchers estimated that up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin signature of MAE. This detection method does not rely on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or sample clonality, making it feasible to analyze MAE in primary samples, including comparisons of normal and diseased tissues.

     The study also found that genes with the MAE chromatin signature share some pronounced features as a group. Importantly, the MAE identified in clones is reflected by the chromatin signature in a polyclonal sample. To test the chromatin signature as a predictor of the MAE state, the researchers identified novel genes with the MAE chromatin pattern and assessed their allelic bias in monoclonal cell lines. They found that a remarkably large fraction of known bivalent genes acquire the MAE chromatin signature in at least one of the differentiated cell types, much higher than other genes that are also silent in embryonic stem cells. This suggests that upon activation, these master regulator genes preferentially resolve into a state with the characteristic MAE chromatin signature.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a new mechanism for controlling the activity of AAA+ chaperones, a type of protein complex that plays a crucial role in protein folding and degradation. AAA+ chaperones, such as ClpC, are essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance, but their activity must be tightly regulated to prevent damage to the cell.

     ClpC, a central AAA+ chaperone found in Gram-positive bacteria, forms a complex with the peptidase ClpP to create a bacterial protease. The activity of ClpC is controlled by the adaptor protein MecA, which targets substrates and stimulates ClpC's ATPase activity. However, ClpC's activity must be repressed in its ground state to prevent damage to the cell.

     Researchers used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of ClpC with and without MecA. They found that ClpC forms large two-helical assemblies that associate via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains (MDs). In its resting state, ClpC is repressed by these MDs, which sequester ClpC molecules in an inactive state.

     When MecA binds to the MD interaction sites, it converts the resting state to an active planar ring structure, allowing ClpC to unfold substrates and degrade them. However, loss of ClpC repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. This suggests that the repressing mode of MDs is a general mechanism for controlling bacterial AAA+ chaperone systems.

     The researchers also found that mutating a key regulatory MD residue of ClpE, another AAA+ chaperone, causes cellular toxicity, indicating that this regulatory mechanism is not unique to ClpC. These findings have implications for the development of antimicrobials that target AAA+ chaperones, which are essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance. Overall, this study reveals a new regulatory concept executed by coiled-coil MDs to tightly control AAA+ chaperone activity.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how stem cells remain in a dormant state and how they are reactivated. A recent study in Drosophila, the fruit fly, has shed light on this process by examining the behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the stem cells responsible for muscle growth and regeneration. The study found that AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles, suggesting that muscles may play a role in AMP reactivation.

     Further investigation revealed that muscles send inductive signals, specifically dIlp6, that activate the Insulin pathway in closely associated AMPs. This activation leads to the activation of Notch, which in turn regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. The study found that dMyc acts as a positive regulator of AMP reactivation, indicating that the proliferation of muscle stem cells is regulated by the same set of genes in both Drosophila and vertebrates.

     The study's findings suggest that muscles behave as an AMP niche, providing inductive signals that reactivate dormant AMPs and induce their proliferation. The Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs, allowing them to proliferate and provide a source of myoblasts for adult muscle growth and regeneration.

     The study's results have significant implications for our understanding of stem cell biology and muscle regeneration. The discovery of the muscle niche-driven Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade provides new insights into the mechanisms governing AMP reactivation and proliferation. This knowledge may have important applications in the development of therapies for muscle-related diseases and injuries. The study's findings also highlight the conservation of genetic mechanisms between Drosophila and vertebrates, underscoring the importance of studying model organisms in understanding human biology.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long been interested in understanding how certain neurons in the brain fire spontaneously at high rates. These neurons, found in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), play a crucial role in brain circuits by providing tonic inhibition to downstream brain areas. A depolarizing "leak" current is thought to support this firing pattern, but the molecular basis of this current has remained poorly understood.

     To investigate this, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons. They discovered that SNr neurons express the sodium leak channel, NALCN, and that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing. The researchers also found that NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

     The study suggests that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN. The researchers identified NALCN as the highest expressed nonselective cation channel (NSCC) in SNr neurons, making it a prime candidate for the channel carrying the depolarizing leak current. They found that SNr neurons require NALCN for appropriate tonic firing, and that mutations in NALCN could contribute to basal ganglia-related motor disorders.

     The study also found that SNr neurons express Unc80, Unc79, and Fam155a, three genes whose protein products are known to interact with NALCN. These findings suggest that NALCN plays a critical role in the function of SNr neurons and that disruption of NALCN could have significant consequences for brain function. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of NALCN in the basal ganglia circuit and its potential contribution to motor disorders.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long relied on antibiotics derived from a limited number of culturable microorganisms to combat bacterial infections. However, the rise of antibiotic resistance has made these compounds increasingly ineffective, while the vast majority of microbial diversity remains inaccessible for cultivation and exploration. To address this issue, scientists have developed a new method for cultivating and prioritizing antibiotic producers from natural microbial communities.

     The new approach involves a highly parallelized droplet-based microscale cultivation system, which is directly coupled to a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation. This system allows for the cultivation of single cells in a miniaturized droplet volume of 200 picoliters, resulting in the cultivation of yet uncultured species and a significantly higher bacterial diversity than standard agar plate cultivation.

     The droplet-based system provides a genotype-phenotype linkage for secreted products, meaning that compounds stay confined with the cell from which they originated. This allows for the storage of droplets in bulk, enabling the generation and incubation of large droplet populations under controlled aerobic conditions. A high-throughput screening for antimicrobial products is also implemented using bacterial reporter strains in droplets.

     The combination of bacterial strain discovery during the in-droplet cultivation phase with subsequent selection of the most auspicious candidates for natural product biosynthesis through a highly robust reporter assay streamlines efforts towards new scaffold structures for the development of antibiotics. The practical relevance of the cultivation approach is increased by combining it with a screening step to detect and select droplets containing environmental cells producing compounds with antibiotic activity.

     The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach by culturing a complex bacterial community derived from a soil sample in a growth substrate designed accordingly and comparing the cultivation outcome to classical agar plate cultivation for the same sample. For one of the isolates that showed antimicrobial activity in the droplet screening, the secreted metabolites were identified and characterized. This innovative microscale cultivation strategy utilizing a modular droplet-microfluidic platform and mimicking environmental conditions in situ has the potential to revolutionize the discovery of new antibiotics.
summary
     Biomedical researchers conducted a Bayesian analysis to investigate the association between the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) genotype and survival in patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM). TBM is a severe form of tuberculosis that causes excessive inflammation, leading to high mortality rates. While adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids have been shown to reduce mortality by 30%, the underlying inflammatory pathophysiology is not fully understood.

     A previous study in Vietnam found that patients with a C/T promoter variant in the LTA4H gene, which encodes an enzyme regulating inflammatory eicosanoids, had improved survival when treated with corticosteroids. In contrast, a study in Indonesia did not find a survival benefit associated with the LTA4H TT genotype. To reconcile these findings, the researchers used Bayesian methods to analyze both studies and found that the LTA4H TT genotype confers a survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations.

     However, this benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality. The researchers suggest that LTA4H genotyping, combined with disease severity assessment, may help target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it. They propose that personalized genotype-directed adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment could be warranted, with the drug given only to TT patients.

     The researchers considered two possible explanations for why the LTA4H TT effect was thought to be limited to the least severe patients in both cohorts. Firstly, the Indonesia cohort was skewed towards more severe disease on presentation, which may have overridden the underlying association between LTA4H genotype and survival. Secondly, Indonesia Grade 3 patients may have presented with a greater degree of dysregulated inflammation not revealed by standard metrics of judging disease severity, making corticosteroids less effective.

     However, the researchers concluded that it is more likely that the beneficial effects of dexamethasone for the LTA4H TT genotype were nullified in more severe disease, rather than invoking an unknown genetic phenomenon. This concept has precedent in the idea that disease severity can be too great for outcomes to be influenced by intervention.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand how growth cones navigate axonal projection in response to guidance cues. A key challenge lies in deciphering how local spatial cues are transduced into protrusive forces that drive growth cone migration. A recent study has made significant progress in this area by investigating the role of shootin1 in netrin-1-induced axon guidance.

     The study found that knockout mice lacking shootin1 display abnormal projection of forebrain commissural axons, a phenotype similar to that of netrin-1 knockout mice. Further investigation revealed that shallow gradients of netrin-1 elicit highly polarized Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones. This phosphorylation event increases the interaction between shootin1 and the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM, promoting F-actin-adhesion coupling and the generation of forces necessary for growth cone migration.

     The study demonstrated that the spatially regulated phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones is required for axon turning induced by netrin-1 gradients. In other words, the phosphorylation of shootin1 acts as a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients, resulting in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance.

     The research also showed that shootin1a is expressed at high levels in developing forebrain commissural axons and that its knockout leads to dysgenesis and misprojection of these axons. Notably, very small spatial differences in netrin-1 concentration elicited highly polarized directional phosphorylation of shootin1a within growth cones.

     Furthermore, the study found that netrin-1-elicited shootin1a phosphorylation promotes direct interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM, generating traction force for growth cone motility. Disturbance of the spatially regulated shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones inhibited axon turning, but not axon outgrowth, induced by netrin-1 gradients.

     Overall, the study defines a mechano-effector for netrin-1 signaling and demonstrates that shootin1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients that results in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying netrin-1-regulated axon guidance and highlight the importance of shootin1 in this process.
Summary
     Scientists have long been fascinated by the unique humming sound produced by hummingbirds in flight. To understand the biophysical origin of this sound, researchers used a combination of advanced measurement techniques to study six freely hovering Anna's hummingbirds. They employed a 2176-microphone array to record the acoustic nearfield of the birds, while simultaneously measuring the three-dimensional aerodynamic forces acting on their wings using a new aerodynamic force platform.

     The researchers developed an idealized acoustic model that integrated the aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics to explain how the hummingbird's hum arises from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. By comparing the acoustic measurements with the model, they found that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of the birds' flapping wings originate from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their body weight.

     The study also compared the findings with those of insects, such as mosquitoes, and found that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of their flapping wings also arise from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces. However, the researchers noted that allometric deviation, which refers to the scaling of body size with respect to wing size, affects the sound produced by larger birds and elongated flies. Larger birds tend to be quieter, while elongated flies tend to be louder.

     The study provides new insights into the complex bioacoustic behavior of flying animals and sheds light on the biophysical origin of the humming sound produced by hummingbirds. The researchers used a combination of advanced measurement techniques and idealized modeling to explain how the oscillating aerodynamic forces generated by flapping wings contribute to the production of sound. The findings have implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between aerodynamics, wing kinematics, and sound production in flying animals.
Biomedical researchers have long debated the roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in evolution. To address this question, a new study used a combination of ancestral protein reconstruction and continuous evolution technology to investigate the evolution of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family of proteins. The BCL-2 family plays a crucial role in regulating cell death and is involved in various diseases, including cancer.

The researchers used a novel approach to mutate and select proteins in the BCL-2 family to acquire specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from multiple ancestral proteins, the study found that contingency, or the unique sequence of historical events, played a significant role in shaping the evolution of BCL-2 family proteins. Over long historical timescales, contingency steadily erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation.

The study also found that trajectories launched from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded virtually no common mutations, even under strong and identical selection pressures. This suggests that the patterns of variation in BCL-2 sequences are idiosyncratic products of a particular and unpredictable course of historical events. The researchers propose that present-day BCL-2 family proteins are largely physical anecdotes of their particular histories, reflecting the interaction of accumulated chance events during descent from common ancestors with necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and natural selection.

The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of evolution. They suggest that contingency, in addition to selection, drift, and mutation, is a primary factor shaping the outcomes of evolution. The results also indicate that the paths through sequence space leading to historical PPI specificities changed repeatedly during the BCL-2 family's history, even during intervals when the proteins' PPI binding profiles did not evolve. This highlights the complex and unpredictable nature of evolution, where multiple paths to a selected phenotype must be accessible with similar probabilities of being taken for chance to strongly influence the outcomes of adaptive evolution.
Summary of Admixture into and within Sub-Saharan Africa
     A recent genome-wide analysis of 48 sub-Saharan African groups has provided new insights into the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow in the region. The study used a haplotype-based approach to examine the combination of genetic markers along chromosomes, which indicates shared ancestry and historical connections between different population groups due to admixture.

     The analysis revealed that coastal populations in sub-Saharan Africa experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7,000 years. Additionally, Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups were found to share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. Furthermore, most sub-Saharan populations were found to share ancestry with groups from outside their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4,000 years.

     The study also identified clear evidence of the movement of Eurasian ancestry back into the continent as a result of admixture over various timescales. This is consistent with previous studies, such as the African Genome Variation Project, which described the influence of Eurasian and hunter-gatherer ancestry on the population genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa.

     At finer scales, the analysis revealed smaller groups and often differentiated closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry. The study measured gene-flow between populations and related it to potential historical movements of people into and within sub-Saharan Africa. Admixture is a common feature of human populations across the globe, and genome-wide analyses of African populations are refining previous models of the continent's history and its impact on genetic diversity.

     The findings of this study provide insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, both of which are relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology. The study's in-depth analysis provides a quantitative measure of the coancestry between groups and identifies the dominant events that have shaped current genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell dimensions during early animal development. The mitotic spindle is a complex structure composed of microtubules that separates chromosomes during cell division. In Xenopus laevis, a type of frog, the mitotic spindle undergoes significant changes in size as the embryo develops from a few cells to thousands of cells. To investigate this process, scientists created an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts from Xenopus embryos that recapitulates the spindle size differences between early and late developmental stages.

     The researchers identified a kinesin-13 protein called kif2a as a key driver of spindle scaling during Xenopus development. Kif2a's microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in early-stage spindles by the transport receptor importin α. However, in late-stage spindles, importin α partitions to a membrane pool, allowing kif2a's activity to be activated. This ratiometric mechanism controls microtubule destabilization and couples spindle size to cell size.

     By altering spindle size in developing embryos, the researchers found that spindle orientation during metaphase was impaired, but chromosome segregation remained robust. This suggests that spindle size plays a critical role in maintaining spindle orientation in large cells during early Xenopus development. The study's findings are consistent with the gradual change from meiotic to mitotic spindle morphology observed during early mouse development.

     The researchers also found that importin α's interaction with kif2a is influenced by its partitioning to a membrane pool. In early-stage extracts, kif2a retrieves significantly more importin α than in late-stage extracts, suggesting that the amount of importin α available to interact with kif2a is sufficient to alter spindle size. These observations suggest that changes in gradients and spindle assembly pathways accompany cell size changes and could influence spindle size.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms controlling spindle size during vertebrate embryogenesis. By creating an embryo extract system capable of assembling spindles in cytoplasmic extracts at any stage of Xenopus development, the researchers were able to elucidate a mechanism that coordinates spindle size with cell size through differential activation of kif2a. This work has important implications for our understanding of how the physical changes in embryonic cells impact biochemical reactions that alter spindle architecture.
summary
     Biologists have discovered a natural system in bacteria that uses two types of RNA molecules to control the production of purine, a key component of DNA and RNA. This system, called a tandem riboswitch, can sense the presence of two different molecules, guanine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), to regulate the expression of genes involved in purine biosynthesis.

     The researchers found that the tandem riboswitch consists of two separate RNA molecules, one that binds to guanine and another that binds to PRPP. When both molecules are present, the riboswitch is activated, allowing the expression of genes necessary for purine production. However, when either molecule is absent, the riboswitch is inhibited, preventing the expression of these genes.

     This system is an example of a Boolean logic gate, which is a fundamental concept in computer science that allows for the processing of multiple inputs to produce a specific output. In this case, the tandem riboswitch acts as an "imply" logic gate, where the presence of guanine implies the presence of PRPP.

     The discovery of this system is significant because it suggests that ancient RNA-based life forms, known as the "RNA World," may have had the ability to regulate complex metabolic processes without the need for protein-based regulatory factors. The researchers propose that PRPP may have been used by these ancient organisms to generate the building blocks of RNA, and that the riboswitches that bind to PRPP may have persisted to the present day.

     The study also highlights the complexity and sophistication of RNA-based regulatory systems, which are capable of sensing multiple inputs and producing specific outputs. The researchers suggest that additional variations of two-input Boolean logic gates may exist in modern cells, waiting to be discovered. The discovery of these systems has implications for our understanding of the origins of life and the evolution of complex biological processes.
Biomedical researchers have long understood that the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential determines the reliability of synaptic transmission. However, the source of variability in this fundamental property has remained unclear. A prevailing view held that the release of a single vesicle (univesicular release, UVR) or multiple vesicles (multivesicular release, MVR) reflected variability in vesicle release probability. This notion was supported by the calcium-dependence of release mode.

     Recent studies using mouse brain slices have challenged this view, demonstrating that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool (RRP), which is upstream of vesicle release probability. The RRP is a functional measure of the number of release-competent vesicles per active zone, under the control of synapsins. These findings suggest that protein kinase A (PKA) and its vesicle-associated target, synapsin, dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability.

     Multivesicular release is a widespread phenomenon in the rodent central nervous system and appears to be the dominant release mode in human cortex. However, some synapses are limited to the release of a single vesicle per active zone, termed univesicular release. Understanding the mechanisms that determine whether an active zone supports UVR or MVR is crucial to understanding synaptic diversity and developing unifying models of presynaptic function.

     The number of vesicles released from an active zone is the product of vesicle release probability (Pr) and the number of vesicles available for release. The RRP constrains the number of vesicles released and is under the control of synapsins. This fundamental synaptic parameter has not been explored previously, leading to an exclusive focus on Pr as the principal regulator of UVR and MVR. However, some high Pr synapses display exclusively UVR, while some low Pr synapses can exhibit MVR, illustrating that Pr alone is insufficient to dictate vesicle release mode.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) selectively packages its genetic material, known as RNA, into new virus particles. A key component of this process is the Gag protein, which assembles on the surface of the cell membrane and binds to the viral RNA. However, the exact mechanism by which Gag selects and packages the HIV-1 genome has remained unclear.

     In a recent study, scientists used a simplified system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant Gag protein, and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to reconstitute the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genome. The researchers found that the Gag protein is able to selectively package the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. This selective packaging is dependent on the ability of Gag to assemble into multimers on the surface of the GUVs.

     The study also showed that mutations in the CA-CTD domain of the Gag protein, which affect its ability to self-assemble on the membrane, abolish the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genome. Furthermore, the researchers found that the association of Gag with transfer RNA (tRNA) inhibits the assembly of virus particles that do not contain the HIV-1 genome.

     The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 genome selection and packaging. The researchers propose a model in which the NC domain of the Gag protein is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genome. According to this model, a viral RNA with multiple high-affinity binding sites for Gag can recruit several Gag molecules to the membrane, allowing for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genome.

     These findings have important implications for our understanding of HIV-1 biology and may inform the development of new strategies for preventing the spread of the virus. The study highlights the importance of membrane-localized Gag assembly events in HIV-1 genome selection and packaging, and provides a new framework for understanding the complex interactions between Gag and the HIV-1 genome.
