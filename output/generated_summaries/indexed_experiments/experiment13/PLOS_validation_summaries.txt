Researchers investigated how genetic variations in the 3' end of genes affect gene expression in human lymphoblast cells. They found that the position of the 3' end of a gene does not occur randomly, but is influenced by regulatory elements such as microRNA sites. The length of the 3' end also varies between individuals and is predicted by genetic variations in polyadenylation signals and other 3' motifs. These variations affect the expression of the gene. Experiments confirmed the effect of polyadenylation on gene expression and validated the role of 3' regulatory elements. The study focused on the immune regulator IRF and found that natural variation in 3' end processing affects response to antigen stimulation. The results highlight the importance of 3' end mechanisms in genetics and suggest integrating 3 end positions with 3 motifs will be a useful tool for understanding human variation.
Researchers have studied the effectiveness of the SIVΔne vaccine, a weakened form of the simian immunodeficiency virus, in inducing protection against the wild-type virus. They used deep sequencing technology to analyze the CD8 T cell response, a type of immune cell that fights infection, in vaccinated animals. The results show that the initial CD8 response targets variable parts of the virus, but the virus quickly mutates and escapes. However, the CD8 cells adapt by targeting conserved parts of the virus and generating new responses to mutated variants. This adaptation correlates with the vaccine's protection. The study highlights the importance of targeting conserved regions and expanding the CD8 cell repertoire for successful vaccine design.
Researchers studied the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the body's defense against fungal infections caused by Candida albicans in the mouth. They used a mouse model of oral candidiasis and found that IL-1 signaling is crucial for controlling the infection by regulating neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. IL-1 acts in two ways: by recruiting neutils from the bloodstream to the site of infection and mobilizing new neutils from the bone marrow. Without IL-1, mice had impaired chemokine production and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in response to Candida. Surprisingly, endothelial cells were the primary source of G-CS, responding to IL-α from keratinocytes in infected tissue. In vitro, IL- dependent communication between different blood cell types was confirmed using a kerocyte and endothelial cell line. The study established a link between IL and granulopoies in fungal infection. Two mechanisms coordinating neutil response in the mucosa were identified, preventing fungal growth and protecting the host from disease.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filari (GPE) delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via mass administration of anti-filar drugs in at-risk areas for 4-6 years. The economic benefits of this achievement were calculated by quantifying the number of clinical manifestations averted and associated with disease prevention in the context of direct costs, indirect labor, and healthcare for affected individuals. Reviewing multiple sources, including the World Health Organization, International Fund, and Labour, an estimated $21.8 billion in economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million treated during the first 8 years of GPE. This includes $2.3 billion from protection of nearly 3 million individuals from acquiring lymphatic filari as a result of being born in areas freed transmission. Additionally, 28 million infected benefit from GLF halting progression, resulting in $19.5 billion economic benefit. At-risk individuals decreased services with reduced morbidity save health systems approximately $2.2 billion. The Programme offers significant economic benefits, with favorable implementation largely due to donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry, showing a high return on investment. 

The GPE was initiated in 200 to guide endemic countries implementing single-dose, yearly mass administration using albend+iverect or alb+DEC for 4-6 years. The Programme delivered nearly 2 billion treatments and reached 570 individuals in 83 countries. As a result, 31.4 million will gain benefits over lifetime from direct and indirect costs. Lymphatic filari imposes a severe socioeconomic burden on 1.3 billion at-risk in 83 countries. This study offers an economic analysis, estimating $21.8 billion benefits for infected and non-infected in M-treated areas, plus $2.
Researchers have created a new animal model to study Gaucher disease, a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. This model, called GBA-/-medaka, lacks the enzyme glucerebrosidase activity, which leads to the accumulation of harmful substances in the body. Unlike humans and mice without this enzyme, G-aka lived for months, allowing scientists to study the progression of the disease. G-aka showed symptoms similar to human Gaucher disease, including brain cell infiltration, neuron loss, and inflammation. Detailed analysis revealed abnormal lysosomes in neurons and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-s) in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, disrupting α-s did not improve lifespan, axonal swellings, neuron loss, or inflammation in G-aka. This study provides a new model for Gaucher disease and reveals how α-s accumulation is caused by glucerebrosase deficiency and its minimal contribution to the disease. Gaucher is the most common lysosomal disease, caused by homozygous mutations in GBA, leading to decreased enzymatic activity and accumulation of glucerebrosidase substrates. It is divided into three types: non-neuronopathic, acute neuronopathic, and subacute. Long-term survival of Gaka allowed observation of disease progression, revealing lysosomal dysfunction in neurons and α-s accumulation in axonal autophag. Axonal transport of α-s may play a role in G mutations leading to Parkinson's disease and be a target for therapy. Patients with type 1 Gaucher have increased risk of Parkinson's disease, carrying G mutations show intraneural α-s accumulation, Lewy bodies and neurites, hallmarks of sporadic PD. Several studies indicate association between G mutations and α-s accumulation. The observed phenotypes in Gaka brains were caused by G mutation. α-s overexpression causes neurotoxicity, neuroflammation observed in PD brains, promoting disease progression.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Listeria monocytogen interacts with the immune system to cause infection. L monocogen is a type of bacteria that lives inside cells and triggers a strong immune response. To cause long-lasting protection, the bacteria must escape from the cell's recycling compartment called the phagosome and enter the cell's inner space. The study found that the immune response to bacteria trapped in the phag is not weak because it's not presented to the immune cells, but because the immune is actively suppressed. This suppression affects not only the response to bacteria in the phag but also to those in the cell's inner space. When both types of bacteria are present, the immune response is weakened and specific cells that fight the bacteria in the inner space are reduced. Bacteria in the phag suppress inflammation and produce a protein called IL-10, which blocks the immune response. Blocking IL-10 or removing a key protein called MyD restored the immune response. The study shows that bacteria in phag can impact the immune system by blocking pathways that create inflammation and protective cells.
Researchers have identified six genetic variants in the SIX gene associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a leading cause of blindness worldwide. The study sequenced the SIX gene in 262 PO cases and 256 controls and found six nonsynonymous coding variants, including a rare and common variant AsnHis (rs12345), which was significantly associated with PO (OR=1.27, p=4.2×10-10) in the NEIGH/GLUG datasets. The variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complement assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye and optic structure. Five variants found in PO cases were hypomorphic or null, while one found in controls was benign. One variant in the SIX enhancer increased SIX expression and disrupted its regulation. The study found a clinical feature in PO patients dependent on SIX genotype: those homozygous for the SIX risk allele (His) have a thinner retinal nerve layer than homozyg for the non-risk (As) allele. The results, combined with previous SIX work, suggest SIX variants disrupt development leading to reduced retinal cells, increasing glcoma vision loss.
Researchers have identified a genetic switch that controls the production of flagella and toxins in Clostridium difficile, a human intestinal pathogen that causes diarrhea. This switch, called the flagellar switch, is a 154-base pair sequence that can be flipped to two different orientations. When in one orientation, the bacteria produce flagella and secrete toxins, while in the other orientation they do not. The orientation of the flag switch can change during growth in a lab dish. The researchers found that a protein called RecV is responsible for flipping the switch, and that this affects the production of toxins and flagella. Bacteria with the switch in the "on" orientation are motile and produce toxins, while those with the switch in the "off" orientation are not motile and produce less toxins. The flag switch also affects the production of toxins by controlling a gene called sigmaD, which is important for toxin production. The researchers found that RecV also controls the phase variation of a cell wall protein and is responsible for flipping the flag switch in both directions.
Researchers studied the process of sporulation in the bacterium Clostridium difficile, an intestinal pathogen that forms highly resistant spores. This process is crucial for its infectious cycle. They compared it to Bacillus subtilis, a well-studied model organism, and found differences in the regulation of sporulation factors. In B. subtilis, four sigma factors (σF, E, G, K) control gene expression in the forespore and mother cell during sporulation. In C. difficile, σE activity is independent of σF, σG is dependent on σ, and σK does not require σ. σK is not necessary for spore formation. The researchers also found reduced temporal segregation between early and late sigma factors and altered signaling pathways. Despite these differences, the sporulation network is conserved across species, with sigma factors regulating the pathway established 2.5 billion years ago in the Firmicutes phylum.
Researchers have developed a new framework to model the behavior of allosteric multisite proteins, which are proteins that change shape and function in response to multiple signals. This framework uses a single variable to replicate the complex behavior of multisite systems, such as the Monod-Wy-Change alloster model. The model shows that optimal sensitivity is achieved when activation of the protein by individual sites is concerted and redundant. This makes it useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems where multiple proteins interact. As an example, the researchers applied the model to a newly discovered signaling pathway in yeast that monitors cell growth at the plasma membrane. They found that components of the pathway form a hysteretic switch, a system that responds only when a signal reaches a certain threshold indicating sufficient growth has occurred. The model can be extended to other types of multisite modifications, such as ligand binding, transcription, methylation, and ubiquitination. To test the model's versatility, it was applied to a cell size checkpoint in yeast. The model assumes a protein is phosphorylated by a kinase at multiple sites and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase. The system is non-sequential, with different phospho forms and a large number of sites. The model shows bistability, hysteresis, and limit cycles, which are common in regulatory processes involving multis proteins.
Researchers have uncovered the underlying mechanism of a "switch" in the quorum sensing (QS) system of E. coli, a process that allows bacteria to communicate and gain a selective advantage over populations. Quorum sensing is a complex phenomenon where genetic circuits and regulation are intertwined, making it difficult to understand. A combination of experimental and mathematical models was used to study the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) QS system in E. coli. The network was separated into sub-networks to examine negative and positive feedback mechanisms. A new negative interaction was hypothesized and tested with a simple model, revealing the importance of the Lsr regulator and its role in the E coli QS switch. A "bottom-up" approach was used to understand gene regulation, which will help unravel complex network architectures and direct emergent behaviors.

The QS system consists of an auto-regulatory network with a double motif, providing a population response. The connectivity and signal propagation of AI-2 in the system were examined. Regulatory motifs were studied in isolation, then combined to represent the system as a network. Further analysis will shed light on regulatory pathways in bacterial metabolic networks and guide new phenotypes. A model was built based on results, incorporating the new element, capturing predictions and simulating the network and sub-systems. The mechanistic basis for Lsr-mediated E coli switch was revealed, buried in the native system but effective.

The AI-2 mechanism, a main module in AI-2 QS E coli, was taken apart and sub-systems analyzed in isolation. Modules were separated, leading to speculation of new interactions within the network. A "bottom-up approach isolating regulatory elements is effective to analyze biological networks with positive and negative regulations. Study of modules allows constructing a hypothetical system and predicting new mechanisms.
A study was conducted in rural Gabon to investigate the effect of schistosiasis, a soil-transmitted helminth, on Plasmod falcum infection in school-age children. The study found that schosias increased the risk of Plmod infection, especially when combined with Trichuris trichi or hookworm infection. Children infected with schos had a higher incidence of malaria over time compared to non-infected children, with a significant delay in time to first malaria event in those aged 6-10 years. The prevalence of schos and Plmod co-infection was 23% and 9, respectively. The study suggests that STH enhances Plmod risk in schos-positive children and increases susceptibility to malaria in young children, but not older children.
Researchers studied how the body's immune response to Leishmania infection, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. They found that a protein called IRF-5, which triggers inflammation, limits the growth of a type of immune cell called CD8 T cells. IRF-5 activates genes that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF. The study shows that IR-5-induced inflammation hinders CD8 T cell expansion and development by inducing HIF-1 in dendritic cells. HIF-1 in dendritic cells impairs their function. When H-1 is blocked in dendritic cells, there are more CD8 T cells and less parasite in the spleen. Mice with blocked H-1 in dendritic cells have lower parasite burden, suggesting H-1 is a mechanism used by Leish to establish infection.
Researchers conducted a systematic review to identify factors associated with poor outcomes in patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Latin America. They analyzed 14 studies and found that jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age under 5 and over 40 years, neutropenia, dyspnea, bacterial infections, edema, and low hemoglobin concentration were linked to unfavorable outcomes. The strongest predictors were jaundice, thromocytopenia, hemorrh, and HIV coinfection. The review highlights the need for validated prognostic models to identify patients at risk of poor outcomes. 

VL is a serious health issue in endemic regions, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, North Africa, and South America, and is one of the world's most neglected diseases, associated with poverty and scarce effective treatments. The Brazilian Ministry of Health recommends platelet transfusion for patients with counts under 10,000 platelets/mm3. Leishmania-HIV coinfection was a prognostic factor for adverse VL evolution in all studies and multivariate analyses showed coinfected individuals had higher risk of poor prognosis.
Researchers in Algeria studied the susceptibility of Leishmania parasites to antimonial drugs over a 30-year period. Antimonial drugs are used to treat visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, but high selective pressure may lead to resistant parasites. The study analyzed 106 isolates from humans, dogs, rodents, and phleomines collected between 1976-2013 in Algeria and 18 from dogs in France. The isolates were from areas where leishiasis is common. Potassium antimony tarate and sodium stibogluconate were tested on promastigotes and amastigotes. The 50 inhibitory concentrations were 23.83 μg/mL and 15.91 μg for visceral and cutaneous leishias, respectively. A trend of increasing susceptibility in visceral isolates was found, but cutaneous isolates became more resistant. The emergence of resistant isolates correlates with L. kili (L. trop) causing cutaneous leishias that emerged in Algeria. The study provides insight into spatiotemporal dynamics of Leish antimony susceptibility and highlights the need for effective methodology to detect resistant strains.
Researchers investigated the link between acute gastroenteritis and the development of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory condition of unknown etiology. They found that exposure to foodborne pathogens causing gastroenteritis increases the risk of CD in the post-infect period, but the mechanism behind this relationship was unclear. To study this, they developed two models of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimium or Citrobacterium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia (AIE), a pathion linked to CD. Results showed that disease activity in the post-infect period after gastroenter is driven by the tissue expansion of resident AIE pathion, with increased immunology defects, barrier, and delayed mucosal restitution following path clearance. This was due to AIE resistance to host peptides and inflammatory response to enteric pathogen. The study suggests individuals colonized by AIE at the time of infectious gastroenter may be at risk for CD onset. Importantly, AIE was identified as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in development of interventions following gastroenter in-risk individuals.
In flowering plants, the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two cells: the egg cell and the central cell, surrounded by five accessory cells. These cells are essential for fertilization, but the mechanisms controlling their formation and fate are unknown. Researchers isolated the lach (lis) mutant, which forms extra egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells become egg cells, indicating LIS prevents accessory cells from becoming egg cells. LIS is involved in a mechanism that suppresses egg fate in accessory cells. Its expression suggests this mechanism occurs in egg cells. LIS is similar to yeast splicing factor PR4, indicating splicing components participate in cell decisions.

 Studies show all cells in the gamophyte can become egg cells and LIS is involved in suppressing egg fate in accessory cells. In lis mutants, the central cell also becomes egg, suggesting LIS suppresses egg fate in the central cell. The lis mutant reveals two levels of cell regulation: between egg and accessory, and between egg and central. Marker genes indicate distinct Arabidopsis cell fates occur after cellularization.

The female gamophyte forms from a single spore through three divisions, resulting in a syncytium of eight nuclei that differentiates into four cell types. In lis mutants, synergids become egg at the expense of syner cell. A syner marker is expressed in lis gamophytes, showing not all accessory and egg fate are exclusive. Over time, lis/LIS plants become more distinct from wild type. Results suggest accessory cells in lis mutants become egg cells. The lis mutation is in At2g00, a protein with seven WD repeats.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in a rural Ethiopian highland community to understand the barriers to wearing shoes, which is crucial for preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). They used the PRECE-PRO model to assess social, behavioral, environmental, and educational factors influencing shoe-wearing. The study gathered information from 242 respondents through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and case studies. Results showed that shoe-wearing norms are changing, with going barefoot seen as shameful. Shoes are thought to confer dignity and protection against injury, but many practical and social barriers prevent desire to wear from practice. Limited resources mean people can't buy more than one pair or afford quality shoes. As a result, shoes are preserved for special occasions and not provided for children until a certain age. Underlying barriers like poverty, price, unsuitability, and low perception are likely relevant to range of NTDs. Established models of health behavior adoption identified barriers to shoe-wearing amenable to intervention, which will benefit NTD prevention through shoe distribution.

In a community endemic for podoiosis, a NTD triggered by soil exposure, researchers found behaviors and practices relevant to other NTDs. In Ethiopia, shoes are distributed to children to prevent podoiosis. Recurring barriers mentioned were financial and poor suitability for common activities. Constraints influence possession, type, age, consistency, replacement, and activities. Theories argue importance of targeting beliefs, attitudes, and perceived capabilities to prevent podoiosis and reduce risk. The study aimed to understand barriers to consistent shoe use in a setting. Respondents aspired to wear, but reality was different. Many possessed shoes, but not worn regularly. Barriers included financial, access, perceptions, and disease risk. Podoiosis faced difficulty finding sizes and stigma.
Pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of infected sympathetic neurons. Without Us, mutants are defective in anterograde transmission in vivo. Researchers investigated how Us promotes axonal sorting of many viral proteins. They found that glyroteins B, C, D, and E are associated with lipid microdomains on infected cells and directed into ax in Us-dependent manner. This study determined Us is associated with lipid rafts, critical for Us-mediated sorting viral proteins. 

In non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, Us is highly in detergent-resistant membranes (DR). Reducing Us affinity for lipid ra inhibited antograde transmission from neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. Association Us with lipid ra is key for targeting proteins to axons, consequence for spread PR from pre-synaptic to postynaptic neurons in mammalian nervous system. Without Us, axons do not contain vesicles with viral glyrote or virus. However, mechanism unclear. Glycoprote B, C, D, E associated lipid ra on infected cells, directed ax in Us manner. Model viralids and proteins traffic ax as mature particles within vesicle. 

Us is in DR non-polar and polarized PC cells, enrichment critical axonal and neuron-to-cell spread. Enrichment cholesterol, essential Us-mediated antog spread primary SC neurons. Us responsible ax sorting viralids, glyrote B, C, E. Us product, small, type II membrane protein, interest antog transport alpha viruses mammalian nervous. Directs membrane and caps to ax infected. Requirement antog neuron-cell and neuron-neuron virus. Overall, PC cells recapitulate Us phenotypes primary neurons, efficacious study Us biology.
Researchers have found that genetically identical yeast cells can exhibit varying growth rates and stress tolerance under constant conditions, a phenomenon known as nongenic heterogeneity, which has implications in tumors and microbial infections. They studied the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that growth rate correlates with susceptibility to heat stress at the single-cell level. Using genetic and chemical perturbations with high-throughput single-cell assays, they showed that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein A (PKA) pathway and its transcription factors M2 and M4 underlies nenic heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, as shown by direct comparison of cAMP in subpopulations enriched for slower vs faster cells. An endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in cells. Paralogs M2 and M4 differ in roles inenic heterogeneity, demonstrating slow growth and stress are not linked. Heterogeneity in rate requires M2, whereas M4 is required for heterogeneity expression of T1, a subunit of trehalose synth that contributes to acute-stress. Perturbingenic heterogeneity by mutating genes in pathway or culturing wild-type with cell-perable cAMP analog 8-bromoAMP or PK inhibitor H89 impacts survival of acute stress.
Researchers analyzed the genetic diversity of the Chikungunya virus (CHV) during its rapid spread from Asia to the Americas in 2013. They used deep-sequencing to study viral samples from infected individuals in Guadeloupe and Martinique, two islands in the center of the outbreak. The study found changes in the virus's genetic sequence and a range of minority variants present at different levels in the population. The diversity was reduced after the virus was grown in lab cells. A new 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure was discovered, not found in nature, that helped the virus replicate in insect cells. This suggests CHV evolved quickly once it entered a new population. The study highlights the need for ongoing viral surveillance to understand the virus's potential.
Researchers have identified a new gene called UOR that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and tumor formation through a signaling pathway called mTOR. This pathway is involved in various human diseases, including cancer. The study found that reducing UOR in cultured brain cells and nerve cells promotes growth, while overexpressing it suppresses tumor formation in cancer cells. Mechanistic studies showed that UOR stabilizes a component of the mTOR complex, called DEOR, to inhibit the pathway. In zebraf model, disrupting UOR gene increased mTOR activity and worsened tumor formation caused by a cancer-causing gene. UOR depletion also promoted tumor growth and m signaling in mice with human cancer cells. These findings demonstrate how UOR regulates growth and tumor through mTOR signaling. UOR is a previously unknown gene found only in vertebrates, with no known function despite extensive searches. It encodes a protein with no known domains. Reducing U in brain and nerve cells promotes growth, while depleting in other cells promotes growth, but overexpressing suppresses tumor formation. U interacts with DEOR and m complex to inhibit m signaling. Disrupting U in zraf increased m activity and worsened tumor caused by a cancer gene. U depletion also promoted growth and signaling in mice with human cancer cells.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of protein interactions in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis in humans and Nagana in cattle. This parasite is difficult to study because most of its proteins have unknown functions, making it hard to understand its biology and how it causes disease. The researchers used a method called biochemical fractionation to study interactions between over 3,500 proteins in the parasite's early life stage. They found 128 high-confidence interactions involving 716 proteins, including 635 with no known functions. These interactions match known pathways and proteins across the parasite's life cycle, and suggest functions for many uncharacterized proteins. They validated several new proteins involved in RNA editing, a process that regulates the parasite's genes. This study provides a new view of the parasite's protein map and a resource for studying its proteins.

The map is the largest of its kind for trypanid parasites and can help form new hypotheses and leads. To show its usefulness, researchers used it to find new factors in the parasite's gene regulation and validated them with experiments. Trypanid parasites are distant from well-stud organisms like yeast and mammals, making it hard to guess their protein functions. Protein maps help identify functions of unknown proteins.

The study found 791 proteins in the parasite's gene regulation network. A previous study showed a protein's importance in the parasite's blood stage. Researchers used two methods to study protein interactions in the parasite and found many uncharacterized proteins. Predicted complexes matched previous findings. Some complexes are essential in all parasite stages, while others not in the early stage. The parasite has two stages: insect and mammal.
Researchers studied lymph nodes (LN) in macaques infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to understand how the bacteria persist in these organs. LNs are common sites of extrapulmonary tb infection and thoracic LNs are frequently infected in humans, but the dynamics of tb infection in LNs and their function are not well understood. The study used PET scans, bacterial burden, and immune function to analyze thoracic LNs from tb-infected macques. They found that LNs have different trajectories of activity, increasing or decreasing over time, even in the same animal. Rhes macques are more susceptible to tb than cynolg macques due to extensive LN pathology. However, tb grows to same level in cynolg and rhes mac LNs, but cynolg macques control tb later while rhes do not. LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation, but also persistence of significant numbers of tbilli. 

The study used PET imaging to track inflammation in thoracic L following tb infection and found variation in the number of L infected among macques and differences in pathology and bacterial burden between cynolg and rhes macques. Rhes mac have more infected L, higher burden, and pathology than cynolg macques. Extensive disease can lead to LN enlargement impinging on the airway, lung collapse. The study analyzed thoracic L in tb-infected cynolg andhes mac to identify how tb changes LNs. Found L increased PET-measured activity during infection and necy, almost all FD-avid L contained viable tb or persistent DNA. tb grows same in L of both species, but cynolg L controlled better than rhes. Compared to granulomas in lung, L had limited ability to kill tb.
Researchers have identified 47 new species of microsporidia, a type of fungus that infects animals, and studied their interactions with the nematode Caenorhabis elegans and other related nematodes. Microidia are obligate intracellular parasites, meaning they live inside their hosts, and are poorly understood. Caenorhabis elegans has been a model for studying microidia through its natural pathogen Nematida paris. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microidia infections are in Caenorhabis and other nematodes in the wild. The researchers isolated and cultured 47 nemodes with microidian infections. Nematida paris was found to be the most common microidian infecting Caenor in the wild. They also described six new species in the Nematida genus. Phylogenetic analysis identified two subclades distinct from Nematida, named Entersect and Ptospora. Unlike Nematida, these genera belong to the clade of microidia that includes human pathogens. All microidia are horizontally transmitted and specifically infect intestinal cells, except Ptos epiga that replicates in the epidermis of Caenor host. At the cellular level, infected spores of Entersect show apical distribution and exit via budding off the membrane, unlike Nemat. Host specificity is broad for some microidia, narrow for others. Some microidia infect Osche but not its sister Osche, and vice versa. Nauseli fails to induce Caenor transcription of genes induced by Nemat species, suggesting evolved mechanisms to prevent host response.
Chemokine receptors, a type of protein receptor, play a crucial role in the immune system and are involved in cancer and HIV infection. Previous studies have shown that chemokine receptors can form homodimers and heteromers, which affect their function. However, little is known about the structure of these homomers and how they interact with cholesterol. This study used computer simulations to investigate homod and heterodimerization of chemine receptors CXCR, CCR, and CCR. The results show that closely related chemine receptors CCR and C2 have similar homodimer patterns, but differ from CXCR. Cholesterol affects homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific way. Chemine heteromers have distinct patterns, with CX4/5 and CX/2 different from CX/2. Associations between CX and C5 show increased sensitivity to cholesterol compared to CX/2. This study provides a detailed view of the interaction between chemine receptors and how heterodization and environment affects their function.
Researchers have identified a new form of systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, which was previously thought to present with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting. The new form, referred to as "atypical", presents with one or two of these symptoms missing, and other symptoms such as lymphadenopathy and anemia. In a study of 160 patients with depressed immunity, 19.4% were found to have normal laboratory profiles but had macrophages laden with Leish parasites. This suggests systemic lemanis has a wider spectrum of symptoms than previously thought and is more common than previously diagnosed. The disease is not limited to the pediatric age group, as 31 adults were also affected. The researchers recommend considering atypical systemic leishiasis in patients with unexplained immunity and no obvious immunologic defect.
Researchers have analyzed millions of genetic mutations and variations in the human genome to understand how they relate to diseases, reactions to medications, and age-related conditions such as brain and cardiovascular issues. They found that predicting the effects of a genetic variation is challenging. A new approach is to look at variations in similar proteins, called paralogs, to identify those with disease-causing effects. This study used a database of known disease-causing variations to identify pairs of variations at the same positions in paralog proteins. The results show that variations in paralog proteins are related and if one is disease-causing, the other is likely to be too. This information can help identify disease-causing variations, improve prioritization procedures, and provide candidates for diagnosis and treatment.

A dataset was used to identify pairs of variations at homolog positions in human genes. Variants co-occur at aligned amino pairs more than expected, suggesting similar constraints on paralog sequences result in coordinated distributions of disease and non-disease variants. Data show paralog genes and variantairs can be used for hypothesis generation and clinical research. Extending to paral genes not associated with disease can identify new candidates and uncharacterized variants with phenotyp consequences.

A collection of disease-causing variations from OM and HG was mapped to genes and sequences. This suggests algorithms based on sequence conservation miss instances. Paralog human might provide in silico characterization, complementary to approaches like SIFT and PolyPhen. Rare disease variants in paralog tend to pair. Alignments provide a resource for genomics.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of the malaria parasite Plasium falciparum in people with severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papua New Guinea. They used a technique called RNA sequencing to analyze the parasite's genes in 44 cases of severe and uncomplicated malaria. The results showed that parasites causing severe malaria had changes in their gene expression, including a decrease in glycolysis, altered chromatin structure, and reduced expression of surface antigens called Pf1. These antigens are targets of protective immunity. The study also found associations between disease severity and Pf1 transcripts, domains, and smaller segments, and confirmed previous associations between expressed Pf1 sequences and disease. The findings can help identify targets for severe malaria vaccines and how parasites adapt to the host environment in severe malaria. 

The study differed from previous reports of increased expression of genes involved in Pf1 surface in severe malaria. However, 17 genes were downregulated, including skeleton protein 1, involved in Pf surface expression. Severe patients had lower levels of antibodies to Pf1 and recognized fewer Pf1 than uncomplicated patients. Parasites were older in uncomplicated patients, who had more immunity to Pf1 than severe patients. Severe had downregulated genes in Pf surface expression. Antigens encountered early in life are recognized by sera from immune children than uncomplicated. Expression of conserved Pf1 by severe parasites explains rapid immunity to severe than uncomplicated.
Researchers tested a new approach to prevent HIV infection by delivering antibodies through a virus-like particle called AAV directly into rhesus monkeys. The antibodies, called mAbs, were delivered in IgG form and persisted at high levels of up to 270 micrograms per milliliter in the monkeys. However, the monkeys' immune systems responded to the delivered antibodies in 9 out of 12 cases, limiting the amount of antibody that could be achieved. This resulted in a wide range of delivered antibody concentrations from 1-270 micrograms per millil. Despite this, six monkeys in the AAV-L Ig1 group showed protective effects against the difficult-to-neutralize SIV239 virus after repeated intravenous challenge. The effects included lower peak viral load, lower viral set point, and delay in time to peak viral load. These effects were statistically significant. One monkey with the highest antibody level resisted six successive SIV239 challenges, including a final challenge of 10 infectious units. The study shows promise for this approach to prevent HIV infection, but immune responses to the antibodies need to be understood for it to be effective.
Researchers studied the way proteins myosin and kinesin K1 respond to changes in their structure, such as when a ligand binds or detaches. They used a simplified model to analyze the proteins' conformational motions and found that the traditional assumption of a linear response is not accurate. This is especially true for kines K1, where the linear model fails to describe the protein's mechanical movements. The study suggests that the current understanding of protein dynamics may need to be revised.

Researchers have investigated the interaction between different endocytic pathways, specifically clathrin-independent endocytosis. They found that caveolins and cavin proteins, components of caveolae, regulate this process. Caveolin-1 and cavin-3, but not cavin-2 or cavin-4, inhibit the clath-independent/GPIAP enriched early endosomal (CL/GEE) endytic pathway. This occurs independently of caveol formation. Overexpression of caveolin and cavin leads to a reduction in CL/GEE carriers, detected by electron microscopy. The CL/G pathway is upregulated in cells lacking caveolin/cavin or with reduced cavin and cavin. Inhibition by caveol can be mimicked by the caveolin scaffolding domain, associated with perturbed lipid diffusion, revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies. Without caveol, caveolin is endocyted through the CL/G pathway, but loses polarization and sorting, affecting membrane dynamics and endytic in migrating cells and muscle tissue. Non-cave cavin-1 acts as a modulator of the CL/G regulator, C42. This study provides new insights into regulation of non-cave clath-independent endocyt by cave proteins, illustrating multiple levels of interaction between pathways. It shows a role for cavin in the CL/G pathway, a tool to study this pathway, and cave-independent functions of cavin, and a mechanism for inhibition of CL/G by caveolin.
Researchers have identified a new type of signaling system in bacteria and plants called Aspart-L Receiver (AL) domains. These domains are part of two-component signaling systems that help cells sense and respond to their environment. Unlike typical systems, AL domains don't have a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue, which is usually phosphorylated by a histidine kinase. The study found that AL domains are common and often attached to rare effector proteins. Analysis of AL structures and data showed that AL have reorganized their active sites to take on a constitutive role or accommodate signals other than phosphorylation. This defines AL as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into activation mechanisms between AL and REC domains.

The study found that most AL substitutions at the conserved phospho-As site are serine, threonine, and tyrosine, which are known to be phosphorylated by bacterial kinases. Some AL domains diversified to accommodate inputs like small molecules and serine phosphorylation through bacterial kinases and phosphatases, regulating cell envelope functions and virulence in microbes. Of 74,816 REC-containing proteins, 2,976 were missing or had substitutions at the conserved position, indicating up to 4% of domains don't have this residue. The subset was renamed Aspart-L Receivers (AL). AL sequences comprise 4% of all domains in bacteria and were defined as the Aspart-L Receiver (AL) domain of atypical RECs. 63 AL harbor arginine at the typical phosph-As position, which can be phosphorylated by kinases and phosphatases. The most common substitution was cysteine, sensing environmental changes in redox state.
Researchers have developed a new type of oncolytic herpes virus (OV) that targets cancer cells with a specific protein called HER2, which is found in many types of cancer. This virus is different from others because it is fully virulent, meaning it can cause an immune response in the body. They tested this new virus in mice with cancer and found it was safe and effective. The virus, called R115, was more effective than the other version, R113, in stopping the growth of the primary tumor and preventing the growth of new tumors in other parts of the body. The mice that survived the primary tumor were also protected from new tumors in other parts of the body. Analysis showed that R115 changed the environment around the tumor, making it harder for cancer to grow, and increased certain immune cells that fight cancer. The response was long-lasting and showed that the body's immune system learned to recognize and fight cancer cells with HER2 protein.
Researchers investigated the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors to HIV infection. They found that CD4 cells induced by the Adenovirus 5 (Ad) vector in a clinical trial were susceptible to HIV, but those induced by the ALVAC (canarypox) vector in another trial were less susceptible. The ALAC-specific CD4 cells had lower expression of HIV entry receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 and a Th1 phenotype with high IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-1) but low IL-17. In contrast, Ad5 and ALAC induced different CD8 and CD4 cell responses, with ALAC preferring CD8 and Ad CD4 proliferation. Depletion of ALAC CD8 cells increased HIV infection of ALAC CD4 cells, suggesting a protective role of ALAC CD8 cells. The study highlights the importance of evaluating vector responses in HIV vaccination.
Researchers studied how the evolution of X chromosome inactivation, a process where one X chromosome is silenced in female cells, in mammals. They found that the choice of which X to silence varies among species. Some species have strict paternal X inactivation (PX), where females are haploid for maternal alleles, while others have random X inactivation (RX), where both maternal and paternal alleles are equally expressed. The team analyzed how dominance, recombination, and sex-differential selection influence X inactivation evolution. They found that a single interaction between dominance and sex-differential selection can lead to a range of inactivation strategies, including unequal expression between maternal and paternal X chromosomes. RX is favored over PX when alleles are recessive to females, but is more restrictive when variation is sexually antagonistic. Evolution from PX to RX increases female fitness at the expense of male fitness. The study provides a framework for predicting X-linked gene expression and makes predictions for future studies on allele variation.

 Species properties and genetic variation affect X inactivation patterns. Sexual selection and mutation rates vary, influencing transmission of deleterious alleles between maternal and paternal X. X is a female-limited trait, so selection favors inactivation of the chromosome with more deleterious alleles. The team tested this by analyzing evolutionary stability of X strategies. Sex-differential selection, where fitness differs between males and females, affects large parts of the genome, can influence X diversification. Stronger selection against males than females decreases paternal X deleterious alleles. They also examined if sex-differential favors biased inactivation, unequal expression of maternal and paternal X. Results suggest conditions for biased inactivation are permissive.
Researchers investigated the antiviral potential of the host protein ZAP against three flaviviruses: Japanese encephalitis (JEV), dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIK). They found that overexpression of ZAP blocked JEV infection, but not DENV or ZIK, and depletion of endogenous Z enhanced JEV replication. Z hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3-5' exosome-mediated degradation. The zincinger motifs of Z were essential for RNA targeting and antiv activity against JEV. The 3'-UTR, especially the region with dumbbell structures and high content of dinucleotide, was mapped to bind Z and confer sensitivity to Z. The study identified J as the first Z-sensitive flavivirus. Z may act as intrinsic antiv factor through RNA binding against J infection. The researchers also found that the zincinger motifs of Z were essential for RNA targeting and antiv activity against J infection.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVV) is a significant pathogen that causes severe disease in humans and animals, particularly in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Researchers studied the immune response to wild-type and vaccine strains of RVV in mice to understand its pathogenesis. Mice infected with a live-attenuated vaccine survived with minimal disease and cytokine response, while wild-type infection was lethal, causing lymphocyte and platelet depletion and a strong cytokine response. The virus was found in the liver, with significant clinical and histological data supporting this. However, a pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not seen, but a chemokine response indicating immune cell infiltration was present. In the brain, a chemok and cytokine response was evident, but little pathology. The study suggests RVV pathogenesis in mice is liver failure due to necrosis and hepatitis, with long-term disease being neurologic, supported by human and mouse model observations.
Chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a significant challenge for improving patient survival. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of taxane chemoresistance in TNBC and found that C motif chemokine ligand 20 (C20) is elevated during tax-containing chemotherapy in patients with non-pathologic response. C20 promotes self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCS) through protein kinase Cζ (PKζ) or mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-mediated activation of nuclear factor B (NF-κ) pathway, increasing taxane resistance of BC. C20 also increases ATP-binding subfamily member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug 1 (DR) expression, leading to extracellular efflux of taxane. Results suggest chemotherapy-induced C20 mediated chemoresis via upregulating CB1. NF-activation C20, forming a positive loop between NF- and C pathways, sustaining chemores in cancer cells. C20 can be a predictive marker for taxane response, and blocking C or its pathway may reverse tax resistance in breast cancer.
Toxoplas gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, infects virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. Its ability to infect and manipulate host cells depends on transporting "GRA" proteins from secretory organelles called dense granules into host cells. GRAs have diverse roles in Toxopla's lifecycle, including hijacking host functions like cell cycle and p38 MAP kinase. Some GRAs, like GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into parasitoph vacuole (PV) where Toop replicates and transported across PV membrane (PVM) into host, but translocation process and machinery are unclear. A previous study showed TMY1, cleaved by TASP into fragments, localizes PVM and is essential for GRA transport into host. To identify additional proteins for effector transport, Toopla mutants defective in cyc-regulation were screened for ability to export GRA and GRA to host nucleus. Novel MY2 and MY3 play crucial role in translocation subset GR into host. MY2 and MY3 are secreted PV and co-localize with PVM and MY1. Consistent with transmembrane domains, all are membrane-associated, MY3 but MY stably with MY1, N-terminal and C-terminal disulf-linked. Fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to structured DH domain blocks transport, consistent trans-based model effector transport.
Researchers studied how a virus called papillomavirus (PV) replicates, or makes copies of itself, inside cells. They found that the virus's E2 protein binds to a host protein called origin recognition complex (ORC), which helps initiate DNA replication. However, ORC was not found at the viral origin, where replication starts. Depleting ORC increased PV replication in some cells, but not in others. This suggests ORC is not necessary for E2 to start replication, but instead suppresses its function. The study also found that high levels of E2 can prevent ORC from binding to host DNA, where it's needed for replication. This means ORC and E2 work together to control viral replication, especially in the amplification stage, where many copies are made.
Researchers investigated the presence of Brucella bacteria in the milk of cows in urban and peri-urban areas of Dush, Tajikistan. They found that 10.3% of 564 milk samples tested positive for Bruc DNA using a real-time PCR test. This is concerning because unpasteurified dairy products are commonly consumed in the region. Bruc DNA was detected in the milk of all seropositive cows, but also in 8.3% of seronegative cows. Sequence analysis suggested one cow was infected with B. abortus and another likely infected with B. melensis. The study highlights the need for complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false negatives in Bruc surveillance and control programs. Vaccination of cattle with S19 and small ruminants Rev1 may be necessary to control Bruc infections, but further research is needed to understand Brella circulating in the region.
Researchers studied the role of histone H3 lysine methylation in maintaining chromosome stability in the fungus Zoseptoria trici. This fungus has eight accessory chromosomes that are unstable during meiosis and mitosis, and are transcriptionally repressed, with high enrichment of repetitive elements and heterochromatin marks, such as trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 or lys 27 (H3me3, H3me). To understand the impact of heterochatin on genome stability, the researchers deleted genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for H3me and Hme, and generated a double mutant. They used experimental and genomic analyses to determine the impact of these deletions on chromosome and genome stability in vitro and in planta. Whole genome sequencing, ChIP-q and RNA-seq were used to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure and differences in expression between mutant and wild-type strains. Results showed dramatic chromatin reorganization in Hme-deficient strains, with Hme mostly localized in regions with Hme in wild-type. Many rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes were found in Hme absence, accompanied by activation of transposable elements. In contrast, loss Hme increased stability of accessory chromosomes under normal conditions in vitro, without large changes in gene activity. The study found that Hme is important for maintaining genome stability by preventing Hme in constitutive heterochatin regions. This reduces overall stability of accessory chromosomes, creating a "metable state for quasi-essential regions of the genome.
Researchers evaluated the cost-effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies vaccination in low-income countries, where life-saving vaccines are often inaccessible and unaffordable to those most at risk. They found PEP to be an extremely cost-effective intervention, with a cost of less than $60 per death averted. Switching from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration of P resulted in significant savings, reducing vaccine shortages and costs. To make P more accessible, financing mechanisms could subsidize costs for those in need and support existing rabies prevention programs. A universal switch to ID delivery would improve affordability and accessibility, leading to reduced rabies deaths and economical healthcare costs.

The study examined costs of IM versus ID administration in different settings, demonstrating ID to be more cost-effective in averting rab cases and lives. Clinic capacity affects vial sharing and cost-effectiveness. Rabies post-exposure vaccination is essential but out of reach for many, with shortages in developing countries and victims traveling long distances for vaccine, incurring costs and facing delays. Changes in P costs could improve affordability, providing incentives without compromising health budgets. Issues should be considered in P policy design to reduce rabies burden, increasing vaccines for the poor who bear the brunt in developing countries.

The researchers calculated cost-effectiveness in terms of dollars per death averted, including direct medical costs from the health provider's perspective. They found P to be cost-effective, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $200 per death averted.
Toxoplas, an obligate intracellular parasite, replicates within mammalian cells in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that does not fuse with host organelles. One mechanism for nutrient acquisition is attracting host organelles to the PV. This study examines the exploitation of lipid droplets (LD), fat storage organelles, by Toxoplas. Toxoplas replication is reduced in cells depleted of LD or impaired lipolysis or fatty acidolysis. In infected cells, host LD number and LD-associated gene expression (AP, DG2) increase until parasite replication onset. PV are surrounded by host LD. Toxoplas accesses host lipids in LD and incorporates them into its membranes and LD. Exogenous oleic acid stimulates LDogenesis in host, resulting in large LD accumulation inside parasite. Tooplas intercepts and internalizes host LD, some associated with Rab7, wrapped by intravacolar network (IV) membranes. Mutants impaired IV display diminished lipid uptake from LD. Parasites lacking IV-localized phospholipase2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from LD in PV, suggesting IV's major role in LD processing and lipid release. Lipid gavage unveils Tooplas endytic structures containing material from PV lumen. This study highlights Tooplas reliance on LD for intracellular development and scavenging lipids from LD.
Researchers have identified a new compounds called chalcones that can inhibit the growth of Fasciola hepatica, a parasite that causes a disease in cattle and sheep. This parasite is considered an emerging zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. Currently, the main treatment is chemotherapy with the drug tricendazole, but resistance has been reported in several countries, making it urgent to find new treatments. The researchers searched a library of 40 flavonoids and found chalcones with phenyl and napht groups to be good inhibitors of the parasite's cystine proteases. One compound, C34, was found to bind to the enzyme FCL with an IC50 of 5.6 μM and is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the enzyme's catalytic site. In vitro, C34 reduced the parasite's ability to migrate through the gut and caused death within a week, but was not toxic to bovine cells. This is the first report of non-peptide inhibitors of Fasciola catheps and opens avenues for developing new treatments for fluke infections and other helminthic diseases.
Researchers investigated how the visual system transmits information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways. They used in vivo imaging to study how bipolar cells transmit signals to the retina and found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filtering. Individual cells transmit through terminals of varying size, but smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher gain, followed by more adaptation. Smaller terminals transmit higher frequencies more effectively. Modeling calcium dynamics of ves release indicated that variations in presynaptic compartments contribute directly to these differences in response.

Measurements of presynaptic calcium showed a strong rectifying function of light intensity, causing a graded increase in calcium with contrast. Voltage-dependent channels in the terminal of bipolar cells are responsible for the non-linear transformation of the signal. Variations in presaptic calcium impact the output of the synapse, with smaller terminals responding to light with higher release rates but resolution too low to detect modulations at frequencies over 1 Hz.

The next compartment in the pathway, the terminal of bipolar cells, showed rectification in output due to increase in stimulus causing increase in release rate even with constant luminance. To quantify time-dependent changes in gain, an "Adaptation" index was used, calculated as the ratio of peak response to steady-state. The model predicted rate of release would depress more in smaller terminals. Whole-cell recordings from goldfish retina showed presaptic signals in large and small compartments while controlling the terminal.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect and analyze individual synapses in the brain using fluorescence microscopy images. Synapses are the tiny connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate. Current methods to study synapses have limitations: fluorescence microscopy is fast and cheap but hard to distinguish between synapses and non-synaptic signals, while electron microscopy is reliable but slow and expensive. The new method, called probabilistic synapse detection, uses a combination of fluorescence and electron microscopy images to identify synapses. It takes into account molecular and morphological features of synapses and provides a map of probability of each voxel being part of a synapse. The researchers tested the method on human brain data and found it detected synapses as accurately as human annotators and reproduced known features of syn distributions. This opens the door to discovering new synapse types and density. The method can also be applied to standard and super-resolution fluorescence images where electron microscopy is not practical.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of action of ZnT, a protein responsible for accumulating zinc in secretory vesicles and releasing it into breast milk during lactation. They found that Zn2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter, meaning it uses a proton gradient to transport zinc into vesicles. This was demonstrated through experiments using Bafomycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar protonase that alkalizes vesicles, which abolished Zn2-dependent zinc transport into vesicles. Additionally, using Lyso Red and Ly-pfluorin, they showed that upon Zn2 overexpression in vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc, vesicles underwent alkalization due to proton-zinc antiport, which was reversed in the presence of TP, a zinc chelator. Computational calculations suggest Zn2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn+ ion. This means Zn2 is a motive-driven, electrutral ves zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to cytoplasm.
Researchers have discovered a new role for 14-3 proteins in maintaining genome stability during DNA replication. They found that 14-3 proteins interact with Exonuclease 1 (Exo), an enzyme that processes stalled replication forks in yeast and mammalian cells. Without 14-3 proteins, Ex1 is hyperphosphorylated, leading to accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps at forks. This causes persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects. Using DNA electrophoresis, researchers showed that 14-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide conditions. They propose that 14-3 assist in controlling Ex1 phosphorylation status and additional targets, promoting fork stability and restart in response to DNA stress.
Researchers studied the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis using a humanized mouse model. They found that pDC are critical in producing type I interferons (IF-I), which suppress HIV-1 replication. However, p also contribute to HIV-induced immunopathogenesis by promoting death of human leukocytes, including CD4 T cells. A monoclonal antibody was developed to deplete p in lymphoid organs of humanized mice. When p were depleted before HIV-1 infection, IF-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished, and HIV-1 replication increased. In chronic infection, p depletion reduced IF-I and IS, but increased HIV replication. Interestingly, p depletion reduced death of human cells in lymphoid organs, but not blood, despite increased replication. The study suggests p play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and promoting HIV-induced immunogenesis. Findings suggest p-depletion and IF-I blockade as novel strategies for treating HIV non-responsive patients with immune activation despite antiretroviral treatment.
Researchers have discovered that sulforaphane (SF), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, can inhibit HIV infection in macrophages, a type of immune cell that plays a key role in the body's defense against the virus. This is the first time it has been shown that SF blocks HIV infection in these cells, but not in other types of immune cells. The study found that SF works by activating a protein called nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is also activated by other viruses such as Marburg, Kapos's sarcoma herpes and Dengue. When Nrf is activated, it reprograms gene expression in the cell, making it harder for HIV to infect. Depleting Nrf with siRNA increased HIV infectivity in macroages and reduced the anti-viral effects of SF treatment. This suggests that Nrf is key to SF's anti-viral activity. SF blocks HIV infection after reverse transcription, but before formation of 2-L circles, similar to type I interferon-induced proteins SAM1 and MX. However, these proteins were not upregulated. The study found that Nrf can potently block HIV infection and highlights a new way to trigger this inhibition.
A cross-sectional study in rural Kenya found that 76.2% of pregnant women were infected with at least one geohelth, with 52.3% with Ascaris lumicoid, 39.5 with hookworm, and 29 with Trichuris trura. Infection with at least geelth was associated with using an unprotected water source (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3) and lack of treated drinking water (OR 1.8, 95 CI 1.1-3). Geelth infections were not associated with symptoms or low body mass. Hookworm infection was associated with lower upper arm circumference (mean -0.7 cm, 95 CI 0.3-1.2). Hookworm with egg count 100/gram was associated lower hemoglobin (mean -1.5 g/dl, 95 0.3-2.7). Pregnant women 2 and 3 with A lumicoid were less likely to have malaria (OR 0.4, 95 0.2-0.8) compared to without A lumoid. Geel infections are common in this population, but few effects were observed. Routine antelmin treatment during antenatal visit is recommended, but evaluation of impact on pregnancy, malaria, and outcome useful.
Mycolone, a compound produced by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, has been found to have anti-inflammatory effects on the nervous system. Research has shown that mycolone blocks the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells, leading to its analgesic and immunomodulatory properties. This study investigated myone's effects on inflammatory responses of nervous cells involved in pain perception and transmission, as well as neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain. Sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia were isolated from mice to assess myone cytotoxicity and immunomod activity. Results showed that prolonged exposure to myone induced cell death at concentrations >10ng/ml, but nanolar concentrations suppressed pro-inflammatory mediator production without affecting viability. Notably, myone prevented pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia, which contribute to neuroflamm. In a rat model of neuropathic pain, myone injected in the spinal canal decreased local inflammatory cytokine production without cytotoxicity. This study provides evidence that myone suppresses inflammatory responses of neurons, Schw cells, and microia without affecting viability, supporting previous studies suggesting myone analgesia is partially due to anti-inflammatory properties.
Researchers studied the genetic factors that influence the outcome of African trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambense, in humans in West Africa. They analyzed DNA samples from 425 individuals from Guinea, including 232 with the disease, 79 with a history of exposure but no symptoms, and 114 without the disease. The team looked at 28 genetic variations in 8 genes and found that one, IL6 rs1819, was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent to active disease. Another, MIF36071, was linked to increased risk but did not remain significant after correction. MIF12459 was associated with latent infection. They confirmed previous findings that AP1G2 was linked to higher risk and AP1 to lower risk of developing the disease. No associations were found with other genes. The study shows that genetics play a role in controlling Tryosoma bruce gambense infection and may lead to new tools for control.
Researchers have conducted whole-genome sequencing of 38 individuals from the Singapore Indian population to gain insights into the genetic diversity of South Asians. These individuals are primarily descendants of immigrants from Dravid-language-speaking states in south India and were compared to samples from the Singapore Malay population and the 1,000 Genomes Project. The study found that the Indian samples had greater genetic diversity and a higher heterozygous-to-homozygous ratio than other Asian populations. When compared to a panel of well-defined Indians, the samples were closely related but distinct from Europeans in autosomal SNPs. However, they had mitochondrial haplogroups and higher European admixture. Analysis of relatedness to archaic humans Denisovan and Neanderthal showed higher ancient admixture in East populations than the Indians. The data is publicly available and complements Asian samples in the 1,000 Genomes Project.
Researchers studied the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in Burkholderia pseudallei isolates from Thailand. They found that most isolates are resistant to aminoglycosides and macrolides due to the AmABpr efflux pump. However, three isolates 708, 218, and 379 were susceptible to these antibiotics. Quantitative PCR showed that isolate 708 had no Amr transcripts, while 218 and 379 had reduced levels. When exposed to gentamicin, 218 and 379 became resistant to other aminoglyides and macides, but 708 did not. Transcript analysis revealed that resistance in 218 and 379 was due to upregulation of Ampr expression by unknown mechanisms. PCR showed that the Ampr operon was missing in 708, associated with a large deletion of genetic material. Rescuing the Ampr region from a library and sequencing revealed a 131-141 kb deletion in 708 compared to other strains. This deletion removed not only Ampr but also genes for malleactin and cobal synthesis and other genes. Whole genome analysis confirmed absence of these genes in 708. Despite missing virulence genes, 708 was virulent in a murine model.
Researchers studied how CD4 T helper cells, a type of immune cell, differentiate into Th1 or Th2 states. They found that these cells can express both Th1 and Th2 markers at the same time, not just one or the other. This is different from previous studies where cells were forced to choose between Th1 or Th2. Cytokines, signaling molecules from outside the cell, play a key role in this process. The team found that only a small group of cells express cytokines, and this is not related to the level of Th1 or Th markers inside the cell. This variation in cytokine expression is higher in early stages of differentiation than later on. When cytok signaling is blocked, Th1 and Th markers are mutually exclusive, showing that intracellular factors are overruled by extracellular signals. This suggests that CD4 cells acquire a mixed Th1/2 state early on, influenced by cytokines from outside. The study reveals interplay between extracellular and intracellular components in Th1/2 differentiation, a common strategy for cells to handle noisy cytokine expression.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the protein PAQR-2 plays a crucial role in adapting to low temperatures by regulating fatty acid desaturation. PA-2 is similar to insulin-sensitizing adiponectin receptors in mammals and is essential for growth at 15°C, a temperature that is usually not suitable for the organism. Researchers screened for PA-2 suppressors and found mutations in genes involved in phosphatidcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. They found that PA-2, phosphidcholines, and Δ-9 desaturases form a pathway that increases unsaturated fatty acids to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This is supported by observations that PA-2 suppressors normalize saturated fatty acid levels and low detergents that increase fluidity can rescue PA-2 mutants.

 PA-2 is a transmembrane receptor that regulates fatty acid metabolism during cold adaptation. Mutants show abnormal fatty acid composition, excess lipid droplets, and are lethal with mutations in genes that promote fatty turnover. PA-2 increases unsaturation is essential for adaptation to 15°C in C. elegans. The study suggests PA-2 is a transmembrane protein regulating Δ-9 desases via phosphcholine and sb-1 during cold adaptation.
Researchers have used electron microscopy to study the structure of herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) virus particles. They found a previously unknown feature at the vertex of the virus, which connects the capsid to the viral membrane. This feature is similar to the tail of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria. Bacterophages have a tail that helps them deliver their DNA into the bacterial cell. The HSV-1 virus also needs to deliver its DNA into human cells, so this tail-like feature may play a role in that process. 

HSV-1 is a common virus that causes cold sores and other diseases. It has a complex structure with a protein and DNA, surrounded by a protein layer, and a lipid envelope. Scientists thought HSV didn't need a tail because it infects human cells, not bacteria. However, the delivery of DNA into human cells is similar to delivery into bacteria. 

The HSV-1 particle is about 155-240 nanometers long, with a 125 nanometer diameter. It has pentons, hexons, and triplexes that make up its structure.
Researchers studied how the Schistosoma mansoni parasite's soluble egg antigen (SEA) affects HIV-1 infection in the body. They found that SEA can block HIV-1 from entering cells by binding to a protein on immune cells called DCIGN. When immune cells were exposed to SEA, they produced less of a protein called IFN-γ, which helps fight infection. This made them less susceptible to HIV-1 infection. However, SEA did not affect HIV-4 infection. The study also showed that a protein called omega-1, similar to SEA, had the same effect on immune cells, making them less susceptible to HIV-1. This could be important for people co-infected with both parasites and HIV, as it may help reduce disease progression. The study suggests that helminthic infections, like Schosoma mansoni, may have a protective effect against HIV-1. The researchers also found that immune cells exposed to SEA produced less of a protein called MIP-1, which helps fight infection, and had less of a protein called CCR5 on their surface, which HIV uses to enter cells.
Researchers have discovered that neural stimulation causes a 30% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions. This phenomenon is crucial for understanding basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, but remains unexplained. A new model is presented that accounts for experimental data related to shrinkage in wild-type and gene knockout individuals. The model shows that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride, and passive channels of the Na/KATP pump, and osmotically transport of water through the astrocyte membrane are sufficient for shrinkage. However, taking into account ECS and astrocy ion concentrations with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na+/Cl (NK1) and NaHCO (NBC) cotransporters are critical for achieving observed levels of shrink. The model is sufficiently detailed to guide future experiments and pave the way for comprehensive astroglia-neuron models in normal and pathophysiological situations.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism for silencing transposons and repetitive DNA elements in plant genomes. These elements can be detrimental to the organism if expressed. In Arabidopsis thaliana, they are silenced by the siRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing pathway, where non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) produced by RNA Polymerase V (Pol) guide ARGONA4 (AGO) to chromatin and enzymes that establish repressive chrom modifications. It was unknown how chromatin enzymes are recruited to chrom. The study found that SPTLTF1, a silencing factor and homolog of S5 elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcription silencing. This occurs downstream of RNAase V but independently of 24-nt siRNA. SPTLTF and AGO are recruited to chrom in parallel and independently of each other. Methylation restriction enzymes show that binding of AGO and SPTLTF is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications at several loci. The researchers propose that SPT and AGO create a platform for direct or indirect recruitment of chrom modifying enzymes.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Rpo regulon in the tick phase of the Borrelia burgdorferi life cycle, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease. They found that Rpo-dependent gene expression is necessary for the transmission of spirochetes by nymphs. Without Rpo, the spchet are confined to the midgut and transform into unusual round bodies during the later stages of the blood meal. This transformation is reversible and appears to be caused by reduced levels of Coenzyme disulf reductase, which provides NAD for glycolysis. The study suggests that spiroes default to an Rpo-independent program for round formation when energy for transmission is unfavorable. The Rpo regul is important during the tick phase of the cycle, but the spchete's transcriptome in ticks is not yet understood. Rpo is induced during the nymph blood meal but not in larvae or unfed nymphs, indicating a specific ON/OFF regulation. Expression of Rpo-dependent genes in ticks is more complex than a simple ON/OFF switch. The study reveals a new role for RSB in tick-to-mamm transmission and a default mode of round formation when spiroes can't produce energy for dissemination.
Researchers studied how gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) hormones control the growth of the stamen in Arabidopsis flowers. GA and JA are important for flower development, but their relationship is not well understood. The team found three MYB genes, MY21, MY24, and MY57, are controlled by GA. Without GA, these genes are not expressed, leading to short stamen and male sterility. They showed that GA breaks down DELLA proteins, which suppresses MYB expression. Without GA, DEL accumulates and suppresses MYB. The team also found that GA promotes JA production, which is necessary for MYB expression. In GA-deficient plants, JA is lower than normal. A triple mutant of MY21, MY24, and MY57 resulted in short stamen and sterility. Exogenous JA restored MY expression and st growth in GA-deficient plants, but exogenous GA did not. This suggests that GA regulates JA pathway to control MYB. The study shows a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA in stamen development.
Researchers investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in lifespan extension caused by dietary restriction (DR) in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that a deficiency in H-1 resulted in extended lifespan, similar to inhibition of the RSK-1/S6 kinase, a key component of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. Using a modified DR method, they showed that H-1 modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner. H- loss-of-function extended lifespan under rich conditions but failed to show extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, which increases H- activity, diminished lifespan under DR. This effect was rescued by tissue-specific expression ofegl-9 in neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by H- was dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inos-requiring-1 (IRE-1) and associated with lower ER stress. The study suggests a tissue-specific role for H- in lifespan extension by the IRE-ER pathway.
Researchers have discovered that human skin cells called keratinocytes can change their behavior in response to different situations, such as when they differentiate or migrate. They found that these cells have unique groups of enhancers, called super-enhancers, that are specific to each state. These super-enhancers are linked to genes that give the cells their functions. The researchers also found that a transcription factor called GR3, which promotes differentiation and migration, binds to super-enh in differentiating kerocytes, but to promoters in migrating kerocytes, where it represses expression of migration inhibitors. GR3 is located in super-enh and binds to regulate them. It also represses formation of non-kerocyte super in differentiating kerocytes. The study shows that GR3 regulates gene programs in differentiating and migrating kerocytes by switching chromatin binding in distinct enhancer landscapes.
Researchers studied the relationship between endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and exogenous retroviruses in sheep. ERVs are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that are passed down from generation to generation. Some ERVs may help the host fight off pathogenic retroviruses by interfering with their replication. However, evidence of this mechanism's impact on coevolution of ERVs and exogenousviruses has been hard to find. Sheep are a good model to study retroirus coevolution because they have two exogenous (horizontally transmitted) oncogenic retroviruses, Jaags sheep retrovirus and Enzoot nasal virus, and related biologically active endogenous retrovir (JSRV). The study isolated and characterized 27 JSRV proviruses, which have been in the host genome for 5-7 million years. Two proviruses, JS56 and JS-20, entered the genome 3 million years ago and acquired a defective gag protein that blocks exogenous retrovir replication. These proviruses became fixed in the genome before sheep domestication (9,000 years ago). A provirus that escapes dominant JSRV emerged recently, likely in the last 200 years. The study shows sequential events indicating evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retrovir. This suggests ERs are used by the host to fight retroiral infections.
Researchers developed two real-time PCR tests to diagnose schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma mansoni and Schistoma haematobium. Current diagnosis relies on microscopic detection of eggs in stool or urine and serological tests, but these methods are not always accurate. The new PCR tests were evaluated on 412 samples from patients suspected of having schosomiasis, including urine, stool, biopsy, and serum samples. Results were compared to standard microscopic and serological tests, such as ELISA, HA, and Western blot. The PCR increased sensitivity from 4.5% to 10.5% and 33.7 to 48.8% for S. mansoni and S. haematobium in urine and stool, respectively. Serum PCR sensitivity was 72.7% and 94.1% in patients with positive microscopy. Specificity was 98.9%. After treatment, PCR positivity declined from 93.8% at 30 days to 8.3% at 360, while antibodies remained positive for a year. The new tests outperform standard microscopy in stool and urine and can be used with serology, which is the gold standard. When serology is positive and microscopy is negative, PCR can guide further exploration. DNA and antibodies are limited for early monitoring, but PCR can confirm cure after a year.
Researchers used machine learning to estimate the energy of different shapes of a complex molecule called Archazolid A, which is a powerful inhibitor of a type of enzyme found in a certain bacteria. This molecule is significant because it could help speed up computer simulations of larger, more complex molecules. They used a method called Gaussian process regression, a type of non-parametric machine learning, to model the relationship between the shape of the molecule and its energy. The model was trained on data from previous calculations of the molecule's energy at a high level of theory, and was able to predict new shapes with an error of less than 1 kilocalorie per mole. This shows that machine learning can be used for complex, pharmaceutical relevant molecules, potentially speeding up simulations of larger structures.

The researchers used a simple way to represent the molecule's shape, based on charges and distances between atoms, which was sensitive to changes in its geometry. This allowed them to find correlations between shapes and energies at a high level of theory. This is similar to how experimentally determined properties are estimated in cheminformatics. Machine learning has been used in quantum mechanics for various tasks, such as predicting atom energies and transition states. Estimating potential surfaces with machine learning has been done since the 1990s with neural networks.

The team integrated machine learning with molecular dynamics to simulate the molecule's long-term behavior. They trained a model to capture the relationship between the molecule's shapes and energies, using a simple representation based on charges and distances. Semi-empirical simulations were done with VAMP using the AM1 Hamilton, starting with a structure from NMR data. The model was then refined to match the NMR structure.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect Ebola virus in wild great apes, such as gorillas and chimpanzees, by analyzing their feces. This is important because Ebola has caused recent declines in ape populations in Central Africa, where it is a "hotspot" for emerging diseases. The new method can identify if apes that have been exposed to the virus and if they have developed immunity. It can also help find areas where the virus is present and which apes are at risk. The study found that 10% of gorillas in one area had Ebola antibodies, meaning they had been exposed to the virus, but not all died from it. This suggests the virus may not be as deadly as thought. The method can also detect antibodies in apes thought to be safe from the virus due to geographical barriers. This will aid in protecting apes from future infections by detecting early exposure, identifying at-risk populations for vaccination, and tracking vaccine effectiveness. Since humans get Ebola from contact with infected ape carcasses, controlling ape outbreaks can impact human health in local communities where the virus has 88% fatality rate.
Researchers have identified a new type of bacterial protein, called Xop, from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicator, that can manipulate plant cells and evade the immune system. This protein has an enzyme activity called E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is typically found in animal cells, not bacteria. The study found that Xop's E ubiquitin ligase activity is associated with its C-terminal region, which interacts with plant enzymes and forms a specific type of ubiquitin chain. The structure of Xop's C-terminal revealed a unique fold, not seen before in other E ubiquitin ligases. Mutations in this region disrupt Xop's activity and its ability to cause plant cell death. The structure also showed Xop has a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which may help recognize protein targets for ubiquitination. However, the E ubiqu ligase activity is needed for cell death, but not for suppressing plant defense responses. The study suggests bacteria have evolved different ways to mimic eukaryotic functions, like E ubiquitination, during co-evolution with hosts. Xop is a new type III effector from Xcv that causes disease in tomato and pepper plants. It was found to induce cell death and inhibit defense gene expression in N. bentiana. Xop's E ubiqu ligase activity is associated with its C-terminal and required for cell death. All known E ubiqu ligases belong to R/U or H-like class, but Xop has a novel fold. The study suggests K-linked ubiquitin chains may play a role in plant-pathogen interactions, but this is unclear.
Researchers studied the role of a type of immune cell called follicular helper T cells (Tfh) in the early stages of HIV infection. They looked at how these cells interact with B cells, which produce antibodies to fight the virus, and how antiretroviral treatment (ART) affects this interaction. The study used a group of 254 HIV-infected individuals at different stages of infection: early (stage 1 and 2) and late (stage 3). They found that Tfh function was impaired in stage 3 compared to stage 1 and 2. Tfh cells from stage 3 had lower ability to help B cells survive and produce antibodies. This was linked to increased inflammation and higher levels of certain proteins that promote inflammation. Higher viral load in stage 3 was associated with lower Tfh-mediated antibody production, suggesting virus affects Tfh function and antibody response. Mature B cells also showed changes, with fewer memory cells in stage 3 compared to stage 1 2, linked to higher viral load. Experiments suggested intrinsic B cell defects contribute to impaired response, despite lower levels. Overall, Tfh interactions with B were altered in stage 3 compared stage 1, linked to inflammation and reduced memory cells. The study suggests early ART for HIV-infected individuals could prevent immune dysregulation and preserve Tfh function and B memory.
Researchers have developed a miniaturized screening method to identify new treatments for the parasitic disease schistosomiasis, which affects over 200 million people worldwide. Current treatment relies on a single drug, praziquel, but it has limitations. The team pharmacologically profiled a schistosome serergic protein-coupled receptor (Sm.5TR), a potential target for new anthelmintics. They used a high-throughput screening approach with a luciferase biosensor to measure cellular AMP levels in intact cells. Data showed a divergent pharmacological signature between the paras serergic receptor and its human homolog (H.5TR), making it a promising target for selective ligands. New compounds with potency and selectivity for Sm.5TR over H.5TR were identified in vitro and validated in vivo against schistosules and adult worms. Sm.5 also displayed irreversible inactivation, a phenomenon also seen in H.5TR, making it an attractive target for anthint design. The study highlights the feasibility of profiling flatworm GPCRs in high-throughput format and the potential of Sm.5 as a chemotherapeutic node for next-generation anthelmics.
During embryonic development, the formation of the three primary germ layers - ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm - is crucial for the organization of the metazoan body. In some organisms, such as flies, fish, and amphibians, the ectoderm mesoderm boundary not only separates the layers but also serves as a substrate for meserm migration. Researchers have found that cell detachment at this boundary is key to layer separation, and involves Ephrin/Eph signaling. Ephrin ligands and receptors are expressed on both sides of the boundary, and separation depends on forward signaling in both directions, involving redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and Rho. This mechanism differs from simple adhesion-based layer formation, as it involves localized signals at the boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle allowing cell migration across a substrate.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 83 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers to identify biochemical markers of the disorder. They used multivariate analysis to classify participants as ASD or neurotypical, achieving 96.1% accuracy for neurotyp and 97.6% for ASD. Additionally, they used partial least squares to predict adaptive behavior, measured by Vineland Adaptive Composite score, with 5 metabolites from folate one-carbon and transulf pathways, achieving R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation. This level of accuracy exceeds previous approaches in the field, indicating strong correlation between metabolites and ASD diagnosis. The study used advanced statistical tools to examine metabolite data from folate one-carbon and transulf pathways in neurotyp and ASD children, as well as their siblings. Children aged 3-10 were assessed for oxidative stress, with ASD defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Disorders, Autism Observation Schedule, and Childhood Rating scales. Folate metabolites from 83,47,76, and 47 ASD, sibling, sibling, and age-matched neurotyp children were used for classification. Metabolites investigated are listed in Table 1. Of 83 on the spectrum, 55 had Vineland scores for regression (46-106). Vin Adaptive Composite evaluates adaptive skills through semi-structured caregiver interview. Multivariate analysis provided unprecedented classification separating ASD and neurotyp based solely on biochemical data. Existing reports show differences in metabol levels, but not designed for classification, failing to classify. Incorporating multiple measurements increased separability and predicted severity.
Researchers analyzed data on cutaneous and visceral leishias in Brazil from 2001 to 2010 using Bayesian geostatistical models. They found that precipitation and socioeconomic factors were key predictors for both types of leishias. The models predicted 30,189 cases of cutaneous leias and 4,889 of visceral leias in 2010. Maps showed highest numbers of infected people in Minas Gerais and Para states for visceral and cutaneous leias, respectively. High-resolution maps identified areas where leias control efforts should be targeted to reduce incidence. This study improved on previous analyses by using rigorous statistical modeling to account for spatio-temporal correlations. The Ministry of Health in Brazil reported incidence maps without predictors, while a previous study provided worldwide estimates and maps for Brazil. This study provided country-based maps for cutaneous and visceral leias at high resolution and explored spatial processes, risk, and high areas.
Researchers in Vietnam studied the clinical features of deng in 647 adults and 881 children who were hospitalized with the disease. They found that adults had more severe bleeding and organ involvement, while children had more severe vascular leakage and shock. Adults also had lower platelet counts, a condition known as thrombocytopenia, than children. This difference in platelet count was seen even after recovery from the disease. The study suggests that adults and children have different patterns of complications with deng, due to age-related physiological differences. This knowledge is important for understanding the disease and developing guidelines for treatment. 

The study found that thrombocopenia was common in adults with deng, but not severe enough to require transfusions in most cases. However, some patients with severe thromocytopenia received prophylactic transfusions, which are platelets given before a procedure to prevent bleeding. The researchers suggest more research is needed before this becomes standard care. They also note a lack of guidelines for using blood products in adults with deng.
Researchers studied SIV infection in sooty mangabeys, a non-human primates, and found that despite robust virus replication, the infection is non-pathogenic. They identified a novel CCR5 mutation, CCRΔ2, which is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in vitro. The mutation was present in 26% of a large colony, along with 3% for CCR5Δ24, which also abrogates expression. 8% of animals were homozygous for defective C5 and 41% heterozygous. The mutation was also found in wild sooty mangys in Africa. CD8 and CD4 T cells showed a gradient of C5 expression across groups, significant for CD8 cells. SIVm infection prevalence was not different in animals lacking C5 compared to heterozygous and homozygous wild-type. Animals lacking C5 had robust viral loads, modestly lower than wild-type. SIV isolates infected homozyg mutant and wild PBMC in C5-independent manner in vitro and Envs from C-null and wild used CX6, G15, G1 in addition to C5 transfected cells. This indicates SIV relies on C-independent pathways in homozy for C5 and alternative use in SM with C5 wild is uncertain, suggesting SIVm tropism and cell targeting in vivo is defined by distribution and use of entry in addition to C5.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcription factor MEF in the development of tumors, specifically in a type of cancer called leiomyosarcoma (LMS). They found that MEF can have two opposing effects: it can either promote or suppress tumor growth, depending on its interactions with other proteins. MEF influences histone modifications, such as H3 methylation and H3 acetylation, which are crucial for gene activation or repression. Class II HDs, a type of enzyme, play a key role in creating a repressive environment for MEF. In 22% of LMS cases, class II HDs are overexpressed, and high levels of MEF, HD4, and HD9 correlate with poor survival. Knocking out HD9 in LMS cells suppresses the transformed phenotype and restores transcription of MEF-target genes. HD9 also demethylates H3me3 at M2 promoters. Class II HDs do not bind all regulatory elements bound by MEF, meaning M-target genes can be both transcribed and repressed. However, repressed M-targets are poised in chromatin. The study suggests class II HD and HD9 as potential targets for therapy in LMS.
Researchers have studied the structure and formation of hydrophins, proteins produced by the fungus Trichoderma rei, using a combination of protein docking, molecular simulation, and cryo-electron microscopy. The study focused on two class II hydrophins, HFBI and HFB, and found that they form a unit cell composed of six proteins with a hexagonal symmetry. However, experimental results showed a unit cell with three proteins and a smaller size of 56 angstroms. Computational simulations suggested an alternative structure with a unit of three proteins and smaller size, and a Monte Carlo simulation showed that this structure could increase the rate of hydroph film formation. Hydrophins are important for fungal growth and have applications in nanotechnology. The study used cryo-EM, protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics to achieve atomic resolution of hydrophin films at the air-water interface. The structures of HF and HFB were studied for high resolution. The experimentally observed unit size matches a close-packed hexagonal arrangement of proteins, but would be seen as a uniform sheet by AFM. Macroscopic properties arise from interactions between interlocking proteins in the surface network. Hydrophins have industrial applications and biological significance. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to model hydrophin film formation, mimicking protein motions. The first high-resolution structure of hydroin was determined for HFB of Trichoderma rei, with a diameter of 2 nm and amphipathic structure.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donani. They studied the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, LThr, which is essential for protein synthesis in the parasite. Recombinant LThr was expressed and purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Immunofluorescence analysis showed LThr is localized in the cytosol and mitochondria. Heterozygous mutants of LThr in Leish promastigotes showed restricted growth and reduced infectivity, and were more susceptible to the inhibitor borid. Several attempts to create Thr homozyg null mutants failed, indicating LThr is essential for the parasite. Borid showed strong affinity for LThr and inhibited aminoacylation activity. The study suggests LThr is a potential target for drug discovery, as it is essential for parasite survival and can bind small molecules with strong affinity.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the protein RIG-I through the presence of a 5- triphosphate (5-pp) on viral RNA associated with a 3 poly-UUC tract. Researchers have defined the HCV pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and criteria for R-I non-discrimination of HCV by examining RNA-function attributes that impart AMP to the poly-UC tract. They found that the 34 nucleotide polyuridine core of the sequence was essential for R-I activation, and interspersed ribosine nucleotides between poly sequences in RNA were required for optimal R-I induction. 5-pp poly-UC variants stimulated R-I efficiently in vitro and interaction with the repressor and helicase domains of R-I was required for signaling. When appended to 5-pp RNA lacking AMP activity, the polyUC-core sequence conferred non-recognition of RNA and innate signaling by-I. Importantly, HCV polyUC variants strongly activated-I triggered anti-H responses in vitro and hepatic immune responses in vivo using a mouse model. These studies define a multi-mot P signature of non-recognition by-I that incorporates 5-pp with polyuridine composition and length. The HAMP motif drives-I to induce the immune response to infection.
Researchers have found that eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in supporting the growth of a parasitic worm, Trichinella spiralis, in the host's skeletal muscle. Eosinils produce a protein, IL-4, which is necessary for the worm's normal growth and development. Without IL-4, the worm's growth is impaired. Eosils from mice that can produce IL-4 are sufficient to support the worm's growth, even in the absence of an adaptive immune response. The presence of eosils suppresses inflammation and maintains nutrient balance in the muscle tissue. Gene expression in the muscle is consistent with a regenerative response and shift in energy source in infected tissue. Redistribution of glucose transporter 4 and phosphorylation of Akt in cells enhance glucose uptake and glycogen storage by the worm. The study suggests eosils promote worm growth through an IL-4 mechanism that limits interferon-driven responses that alter nutrient metabolism in muscle. This is a novel interaction between parasite and host, where the worm co-opts an innate cell response to facilitate growth.
Researchers studied how DNA replication occurs in human cells and found that it doesn't happen in large blocks as previously thought. Instead, origins of replication are spaced about 40,000 base pairs apart and fire in clusters as the cell divides. The speed of replication remains constant at about 0.7-2 kilobases per minute throughout the process. Analysis of the entire genome shows a range of replication speeds, with some regions taking less than 2 minutes and others more than 10 minutes. This suggests that cells don't have large areas of unidirectional progression. Instead, temporal regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins that increase in rate as the cell divides. This is demonstrated by studying the IGH locus in HeLa cells. Other cell types, like embryonic stem cells, show more unidirectional progression. This can be explained by origins firing independently under long-range chromatin control or forks from early origins stimulating nearby unreplicated DNA. These findings provide new insights into mammalian genome replication and a model for its kinetics.
Researchers investigated how the brain's ability to recognize objects despite changes in context, such as perspective or lighting, is achieved through a concept called "temporal stability" or "slown" approach. This approach suggests that object identities change more slowly than contextual variables or noise. They explored how this concept can be implemented in biologically realistic learning rules. A slow feature analysis algorithm, based on slown, was implemented in a continuous model using a modified Hebbian rule, linking it to the trace rule, another slown learning implementation. For linear neurons, slown was shown to be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific window. Analyzing STDP dynamics, it was found that the window alone is not relevant, but its convolution with postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is. This led to deriving STDP windows that implement slown and trace rules, compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. The analysis also showed the window can be split into reversible and irreversible components, sensitive to input statistics. Irreversible statistics favor oscillatory weight dynamics, not stable distributions. The study offers a new interpretation of STDP's functional role in neurons.

In a continuous model, Hebb learning enabled a neuron to learn slown combination of inputs, linking SFA to the trace rule. For a spiking neuron, STDP was shown to be an implementation of slown for a linear Poisson neuron. The study suggests ST's outcome is governed by the convolution of window and EP, not the window alone. The learning window for SFA can be calculated analytically. This holds for a spiking model, where STDP can be interpreted as slown. Physiological parameters lead to a window shape and width in agreement with findings, proposing a new interpretation of STDP as sl compensating for neuronal filters like EP.
Researchers have discovered a new way that cancer cells in non-small lung cancer (NSCL) tumors work together to resist chemotherapy. This is called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT). When some cancer cells in a tumor are exposed to a drug, they can change their behavior to help neighboring cells that are not exposed to the drug. This helps the whole tumor grow and resist the treatment. The researchers used a special tool to create cells with different mutations and grew them in a 3D culture to study how they interact. They found that when cells with different mutations were together, they could grow even when the drug was present. This is because they changed their behavior to help each other. The researchers also tested this in human tumor samples and found that this behavior is linked to how well the cancer responds to treatment. This means that just looking at genetic mutations alone may not be enough to choose the right treatment. Cancer cells can work together to resist treatment, making it harder to cure.
A study in the Mbeya region of southwestern Tanzania found that 67.9% of the population above the age of 5 had IgG antibodies against Spotted Group (SFG) rickettsiae, a type of bacteria that causes spotted fever. The study involved 1,228 participants from nine communities, stratified by age, altitude, and ownership of domestic animals. Higher temperatures, male gender, and lower population density were associated with higher seroprevalence. At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher seropreval. The study suggests that SFG ricketial infection is common in the rural population of Mb Region and spread is limited by temperature and elevation. Further research is needed to determine the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses and estimate the disease burden in the population. 

The study used random sampling to select participants and tested for Ig antibodies against SFG ricketiae using indirect immunofluorescence at a dilution 1:64. Interviews were conducted with household heads regarding socioeconomic and infrastructural setting. SFG might contribute to disease burden, as Sicketios are frequent in travelers and endemic in African countries. Future studies should detect the pathogen in infection and describe transmission to validate risk factors. Comparing to typhus group ricketial antibodies, S and TGR serositivity occur in different patterns, with higher in areas with sparse or dense population.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a type of fatty acid called oleate in the immune system of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. This fatty acid is important for the worm's ability to fight off infections and defend itself against pathogens. The study found that oleate is made by an enzyme called stearl-CoA desaturase and is necessary for the worm to activate its immune response to infection. Without oleate, the worm is more susceptible to bacterial infections. However, adding oleate back to the worm makes it more resistant to infection. The researchers also found that oleate works differently than other types of fatty acids, called polyunsaturated acids, which are also important for the worm's immune system. The study suggests that oleate plays a key role in the worm's ability to fight off infection and that is connected to how it stores and uses nutrients.
Scientists have discovered a new way to create antibiotics that target a specific type of molecule called guanine riboswitch, which is involved in the regulation of purine metabolism in bacteria. Guanine ribwitches control the production of nucleotides, which are essential for bacterial growth. When guanine binds to the ribwitch, it stabilizes a specific mRNA structure that stops the production of downstream genes. Researchers found a pyrimidine compound (PC1) that binds to guanine ribwitch and kills certain bacteria, including hospital-acquired pathogens. This effect is only seen when the gene guA, which codes for GMP synthase, is under the control of the ribwitch. The study shows that PC targets a different metabolic pathway than other antibiotics. In a mouse model, administration of PC reduced Staphylococcus aureus infection in mammary glands. This opens the possibility of designing new antibiotics that target guanine ribwitch. The discovery is crucial as community-acquired bacterial infections are emerging.
Researchers studied how macaque monkeys navigate a virtual reality maze to find a reward, examining their behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity. They found that some cells in the hippocamp responded to one or more variables like direction, point of gaze, or task. These cells fired at the sight and in anticipation of a single landmark in a viewpoint or task-dependent manner, encoding the animal's situation within a set of actions to the goal. The hippocamp activity was best described by a fine-grained space comprising current position, view, and context. The findings indicate that rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional taskituated knowledge to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in space construction.

The study found that this type of coding is ubiquitous in mammals, consistent with encoding task-related hippocamp neurons in rodents. The results show space in primates embodies self-position to the target gaze and carries information to the current trajectory to goal. The study examined the nature of hippocamp coding in a goal task, separating goal and landmarks, and how cells code position, direction, and gaze. The goal setting enabled to examine task context modulated the cells. Previous studies in primates, including humans, showed hippocamp encoded spatial views, place, or a mixture place and view. In a controlled VR setting, the findings show hippocamp display fine tuning preferentially one landmark viewed by the animal and self-position to landmark.

The results give a comprehensive analysis of variables controlling hippocamp cells, bridging rodent and primate studies in real and virtual environments. Hippocamp cells code the target gaze informed, embedding self-position to elements and context. The data suggest counterpart place in prim, compared to rodents, expressed activity to gaze with other navigation variables, position, and visual elements at instants planning.
Researchers have studied the development of the midbrain and hindbrain in vertebrates, focusing on the midbrain boundary (MHB), where a specific pattern of gene expression is established and maintained by a network of regulatory interactions between transcription and secreted factors. A Boolean analysis of gene expression patterns at the murine MHB revealed key interactions in this network, predicting a maintaining rather than inducing effect of fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) on wingless 1 (Wnt) expression, which was unclear from previous data. Using mouse neural plate explant cultures, they found F8 maintains but does not induce ectopic Wnt expression. Combining this with known interactions, a regulatory network of transcription and secret factors at the M was constructed. Models of this network showed it explains the maintenance of M and expression patterns under wild-type and knockout conditions. The study demonstrates that spatial expression patterns can reveal regulatory network structure, helping to understand boundary maintenance on a systems level.
A parasite called Theileria annulata infects host cells, causing them to multiply uncontrollably. After the parasite enters the cell, the host's cell membrane dissolves and microtubules (MTs) surround it, forming a structure called a schizont. Instead of invading other cells, the schizont stays attached to the host MTs and uses them to divide the cell during mitosis and cytokinesis. To understand how the schizont interacts with host MTs, researchers focused on the plus ends of MT, which are dynamic and constantly growing or shrinking. They found that the schizont recruits a protein called EB1, a key regulator of MT dynamics, through a protein called p104 on its surface. EB1 binds to the schizont through a specific site on p104, and this interaction is regulated by the cell cycle. This is the first time a pathogen protein has been shown to interact with EB1 through a specific site. The schizont's interaction with host MTs is crucial for its survival in the host, and this study provides new insights into how Theileria interacts with the host cytoskeleton.
In yeast cells, broken replication forks can lead to DNA breaks that are normally repaired through a process called homologous recombination or break-induced replication (BIR). A mutation in a gene called cdc9 leads to a population of cells with persistent DNA damage, likely due to broken forks, and activates the DNA damage checkpoint, resulting in longer telomeres. Telomere length requires functional telomerase, the DNA signaling cascade Mec1-Rad-Rad53, and components of the IR pathway Rad51, Rad52, 32, and P1. The phosphorylation of P1 by Mec-Rad53, necessary for inhibiting telomerase at double breaks, is also important for P1's role in IR and telom elongation in c9 cells. Two other mutants, c44 and r3, similar to c9, have long telomeres dependent on P1 phosphorylation. We propose that IR forks passing through telomeres promotes telom activity, leading to telom lengthening.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool to detect Onchercias, a disease caused by the filarial nematode Onocerca volulus, which is a major public health concern due to its debilitating symptoms and resurgence in previously controlled areas. The tool, called luciferase immunoprecitation system (LIPS), is a rapid, specific, and standardized assay that can differentiate between infected and uninfected individuals with 100% sensitivity and 100 specificity. Four recombinantly produced Onoc volulus antigens (Ov-AR-1, Ov-API-1, Ov-MS-1, and OvPI-1) were tested on a large cohort of sera, including uninfected controls and patients with proven parasitic infections, including Onoc volulus, Wucher bancfti, Loa loa, Strongloides storal, and other cross-reactive infections. Antibody responses to the four antigens allowed unequivocal differentiation between infected and uninfected with 100% sensitivity and 100 specificity. Analysis of antibody titers in infected sera revealed they were markedly different and did not correlate with each other. Compared to infected, patients with W, L, S, and other conditions had lower geometric antibody titers to each antigen. The simplified method using a mixture of four antigens in standard or 15-minute IPS showed 100 sensitivity and 100 in distinguishing infected from unected sera. IPS had best performance with 76, 84, and 93 in distinguishing from W, L, S-infected sera. The multi-antigen IPS can be a rapid, high-throughput, specific tool to diagnose individual infections and potentially sensitive point-of-care for early detection recrudescence in controlled and new transmission areas.
Researchers conducted a 54-month study in rural Vietnam to evaluate the effectiveness of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and deworming in reducing anemia, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted infections in women of reproductive age. The study found that 76% of participants took the ironolic supplement and 95% received dewing treatment. Hemoglobin levels rose from 122g/L to 131/L and anemia prevalence fell from 38% to 18. Iron deficiency decreased from 23% to 8 and iron deficiency anemia from 4%. Hookworm infection fell from 76 to 11 and moderate or heavy infestation to less than 1%. The study suggests that population-based interventions can efficiently reduce anemia and eliminate iron deficiency anemia and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted infections below public health concern levels.
Epstein-Barr Virus Glycoprotein gp150 Forms Immune-Evasive Glycan Shield at Surface of Infected Cells

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a type of herpesvirus, has developed a novel mechanism to evade the immune system by producing a glycoprotein called gp150. This protein is expressed during the late phase of viral replication, when the virus is most vulnerable to cell-mediated immunity. gp150 inhibits the presentation of antigens by HLA I, H II, and CD1 molecules on the surface of infected cells, making it harder for the immune system to recognize and attack the virus. The mechanism does not depend on degrading the antigen-presenting molecules or the protein's cytoplasmic tail, but rather its abundant glycosylation creates a shield that impedes antigen presentation. This is a new immune evasion strategy for herpesviruses, and gp's broad target range could impact beyond T cell activation. Cells infected with a gp-null EBV mutant showed rescued levels of antigen presentation by HLA I, II, and CD, indicating an important role for iKT cells in fighting EB infection. The study suggests EB gp prolongs the lifespan of the virus at its most vulnerable stage.
Researchers have found that a protein called Tarp, which is present in all pathogenic chlamydia species, plays a crucial role in the bacteria's ability to invade host cells. Tarp is a protein that binds to actin, a component of the cell's cytoskeleton, and helps it to polymerize into filaments. This process is essential for the bacteria's entry into the cell. A specific antibody against the actin-binding domain of Tarp was created and tested in the lab and shown to inhibit actin polymerization in vitro and chlamydia entry in vivo. Analysis of Tarp orthologs from various chlamdia species revealed multiple actin binding sites. To determine if these sites are functional, Tarp fusions from different chlam species were tested for their ability to bind and nucleate actin. The results showed that Tarp mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved among diverse chlam species and plays a role in bacterial invasion of host cells. All chlam species examined have at least one functional actin domain, and purified Tarp from chlam species can form actin filaments in vitro. A peptide against the actin domain prevented T mediated actin formation and reduced host susceptibility to chlam infection. Interestingly, some chlam strains have multiple actin domains on a single protein, suggesting a hybrid mechanism of actin nucleation involving multiple monomers and oligomerization by proline domain.
Researchers have developed a new method, called formalin-acetate sedimentation digestion (FASD), to accurately count Schistosoma japonicum eggs in the feces of infected water buffalo. This is important for understanding how the parasite spreads and contaminates the environment. The method involves filtering, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation before microscopy. It removes 70% of debris in feces, making it easier to see the eggs. This allows for accurate estimation of infection in buffalo and other animals that carry the parasite. The new method is as effective as real-time PCR but less expensive. It can be a valuable tool for tracking the parasite in areas with low to high infection rates or after control efforts to eliminate it.
Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage protein (CRT) and proly 3-hydroxylase 1 (PH1) were first identified as causes of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). These proteins, along with cyclophilin, form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a proline on the α1(I) chain at position 986 and has cis-trans isomerase peptidase activity for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest proly 3-hydrolation of 986 is not required for collagen stability, but absence of this post-translational modification disrupts protein-protein interactions, leading to collagen overmodification. PH and CRT stabilize each other, and absence of one results in degradation of the other. Hypomorphic or loss of function of either gene causes loss of the complex and its functions. The contribution of this complex's 3-hydrolysis versus peptidase to OI phenotype is unknown. To distinguish these functions, mice were generated with a single amino acid substitution in PH's catalytic site (Lep1H662A). This abolished PH activity but retained ability to form complex with CRT and chaperone function. Knock mice showed absence proly 3-hydrolation at 986 of α(I) and α(II) collagen but no overmodification at other residues. They were normal in appearance, no growth defects, and cartilage plate histology but decreased trabecular bone mass. This model recapitulates OI bone but not cartilage phenotypes caused by loss of proly 3-hydrolation complex. Observations suggest differential consequences due selective inactivation PH hydroxylase versus ablation of proly 3-hydro complex.
Researchers have found that the P-element, a selfish genetic element, has invaded the Drosophila simul species, causing hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes including sterility. This is similar to its invasion of Dophila melanogaster, where it spread globally in a few decades. Until now, D simul remained P-element free. However, a survey of 181 D simul strains shows 20% induce dysgenesis. Genomic and transcript data show the dys-inducing phenotype is associated with P-element invasion. A survey of 631 D simul strains on three continents over 27 years found P-element occurred rapidly and simultaneously, with strains containing P-elements rare in 200 and common by 201. Strains from latter phase of invasion have adapted to suppress P-element effects, evidenced by resistance to dys phenotype.
Researchers have developed a new method to mark the bodies and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypt mosquitoes using rhodamine B, a fluorescent dye. This technique allows for rapid assessment of mating success during releases of sterilized males in the wild. Males were fed 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% rhamine in 50% honey solutions during flight. All concentrations produced >95% transfer to females and body marking after 4 days, with 0.4 and 0.8 solutions lasting longest. Rhodamine marking had no effect on male competitiveness. Field releases showed successful transfer of marked fluid to females and recapture of marked males. This method is useful for evaluating male-based control strategies and mark-release experiments without negative effects of traditional methods. Rhamine marking is less expensive and time-consuming than other methods like PCR and isotope labelling or female fertility assays for assessing sterilized males.
Bacterial superantigens, a family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. CD28, a homodimer on T cells, functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response through interaction with B coligands. However, to elicit inflammatory gene expression and toxicity, superigens must bind directly to the dimer interface of CD28. Preventing access of superigen to CD suffices to block lethality. Mice were protected from lethal superigen challenge by peptide mimetics of the CD dimer interface and peptides to compete with superigen for binding in CD. Superigens use a conserved β-strand/α-helix domain to engage CD28. Mutation of superigen domain abolished cytokine induction and lethality. Structural analysis showed when superigen binds to T receptor on cell and major histocompatibility class molecule on antigen-presenting cell, CD can accommodate as superigen receptor in ternary complex, with CD dimer oriented towards β-str/α domain in superigen. Our findings identify CD homimer as critical receptor for superigens. The role of CD as receptor for class microbial pathogens, superigens, broadens pathogen recognition mechanisms.
Researchers have found that the Wnt/β-caten pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and potency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Unlike somatic cells, ESCs have a fast cell cycle with a short G1 phase due to the lack of cell cycle inhibitors. The Wnt/β-caten pathway controls ESC pluripotency through the W-effector T3, but its role in cell cycle regulation was unknown. The study shows that W-eff T1 is recruited to the Ink/Ar tumor suppressor locus, activating it and reducing ESC proliferation without affecting pluripotency. T1, not T3, is recruited to palindromic motifs in promoters of cell repressors like p15k, p16, and p19, mediating W-dependent anti-proliferation in ESCs. Inhibition of β-caten or T1 impairs W-dependent cell regulation.

 Activation of Wnt downregulates differentiation genes while plurotency remains unpert. Cell effects depend on βaten and T1, but not T3, indicating non-overlapping functions of T/L factors in ESCs. T1 is enriched at promoters of cycle genes like Ink/Ar locus. GSK inhibition or βaten regulates expression of Ink and Arf members in T3-independent manner. T1 KD in ESC impairs W-dependent cell regulation. Wnt induces expression of negative cycle regulators like Cdk2 (16,19) and Cdkb (15). Results show W/βaten triggers anti-proliferative effect in ESCs via T1 activity, contrasting its mitogenic effect in somatic cells.

ESCs have unique cycle due to absence of CD inhibitors. T1 is recruited to promoters of InkAr locus. W/T1 regulates CDIs as direct target. W/T pathway. W/aten is essential in development, homeostasis, and cancer. Activation maintains plurot in ESCs and somatic reprogramming, but deregulation leads to cancer.
Researchers studied the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in dengue virus (DENV) infection. DENV can cause a range of symptoms from mild to severe and even fatal, and can lead to plasma leakage and hemorrhages due to a cytokine storm caused by monocytes and dendritic cells. pDC are immune cells that respond to virus exposure by secreting IF-α and expressing TRAIL. The study aimed to characterize p activation of DC in deng patients and their function under DENV-2 in vitro. Flow cytometry analysis showed that pDC of mildeng patients had higher frequencies of TRAIL compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma of IF-α and soluble TR were increased in mild compared to severe deng patients, correlating with p activation. Experiments showed that in vitro exposure to D-2 induced TR expression on p. Microscopy highlighted TR was relocalized from intracellular to plasma. Chloro treatment inhibited D- induced TR localization and IFα by p. Endosomal degradation by chloro allowed viral detection inside p. Data suggest endocyt pathway activation by D in p. Coculture of p/D- infected monocytes reduced antigen detection. Antigen reduction in monocytes was also observed after IFα treatment. p effect on viral load was mainly dependent on IFα production.
Researchers have studied how tumor necrosis factor (TN) plays a role in fighting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. TN is important in both active and latent phases of infection. TN-neutralizing drugs, used to treat inflammatory diseases, have increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) in animal studies. This study used a computational approach to understand TN's role in fighting the tuberc bacillus in both active and latent infection. They extended previous models to investigate soluble (sTN) and transmembrane TN (TN). Analyzed effects of anti-T therapy in clinical trials by simulating two common therapies, anti-T antibody and TN receptor. Found that bioavailability of TN after anti-T therapy is main cause of latent infection reactivation and sTN, even at low levels, is essential for control. Using a model, distinguished mechanisms of anti-T treatments and TN's role in TB control and pathology. Suggests a TN-modulating agent could balance reduction of inflammation with resistance to infection. Alternatively, anti-T therapy timing and dose could be modified.
Researchers studied how genetic variations in the human genome, called retroduplication variations (RD), contribute to differences between individuals. They analyzed data from the 1000 Genomes Project and found 193 new RDs, most of which resulted from the loss of retrocopies. They also looked at how often these retrocopies were expressed in different populations using RNA data from the Illumina Body project and lymphoblast cell lines from the Geuvis Consortium. A new method was developed to detect retrocopies not in the reference genome, and 11 were confirmed to be present or absent in 17 human populations. Expression of 10 retrogenes that were deleted in some individuals was low, suggesting they may have a function. Differences in expression between populations were also found in 9 retrogenes.

The study focused on RD resulting from deletion, as most were absent in more than 50% of individuals. A new approach was developed to detect undiscovered retro variations in the genome. Previous studies found 208 RD, but this study found more, with a different method. The majority were from retro deletion, not recent retroduplication. Only 56 orthologs were found missing in some human genomes.

Data from the 100 Genomes Project and RetroDB were used to analyze retro variation from loss in populations. 214 indels affected 190 retrocopies. The role of RD in population history is established, but this study shows they can also reveal ongoing processes. RNA-Seq data from Geuvis allowed studying changes in retro repertoire and function.
Researchers studied how the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the brain affects inflammation in pigs with neurocysticercosis, a disease caused by the parasite. They found that cysterci in the brain tissue (parenchyma) caused more inflammation than those in the meninges (membranes surrounding the brain) or partially in both. After treatment with praziquel, an anti-parasitic drug, inflammation increased in parenymal cystic but not meningeal. Inflammation in meningeal cystic was not affected by treatment. Inflammation in corticomeneal cystic (adjacent to both parenym and meninge) increased with the extent of cyst in parenym. Disruption of blood-brain barrier occurred only in parenym tissue after treatment. Inflammation in meninge cystic was less than parenym. This may explain why subarachn NCC is hard to treat compared to parenym NCC.
Researchers conducted a study in Ghana to investigate the presence of yaws, a disease caused by Treponema pallidum s. pertue, in two districts where azithrom was previously distributed to control trachoma. They tested 90 children aged 5-17 with ulcerative lesions and found that none had syphilis, but 9 had Haemophilus duyi DNA in their lesions. The study found no evidence of ongoing y transmission in these communities. H. duyi was associated with some lesions, but most remained unexplained. The researchers suggest integrating diagnostic testing into pre and post-treatment surveillance to inform y control programs. 

In the Northern Region of Ghana, all patients had negative treponal and non-treponal serology, indicating they never had y. Both districts had several rounds of azithycin M for trach in the past decade. T. pallum s. pertue or alternative causes may be responsible for some cases in other regions. This has implications for the WHO y eradication campaign, as Ghana is a major focus of y worldwide. A range of organisms cause skin lesions, including Mycobacterium ulcer, which is endemic in Ghana. Accurate data on y epidemiology is needed to guide eradication efforts.
Researchers have been working to find new ways to stop HIV from hiding in the body after treatment. A key part of the problem is how the virus stays in cells called the reservoir. The reservoir is made up of memory T cells, a type of immune cell that helps fight infection. A pathway called Jak-STAT is involved in keeping these cells healthy, but it also helps HIV stay hidden. Two drugs, tofacitinib and ruxitin, were tested to see if they could block the reservoir. They work by stopping the Jak-STAT pathway, which is important for cell growth and survival. In lab tests, the drugs reduced the number of cells with HIV DNA, the virus's genetic material. They also stopped the virus from making new copies in infected cells and prevented it from spreading to other cells. This shows that blocking Jak-STAT is important for HIV persistence and the drugs could be a new way to stop it. The study also looked at how the drugs affected different types of T cells that harbor the virus and found they reduced the reservoir in all of them. The researchers think this could be a new way to prevent HIV from coming back after treatment and could be used in future cures.
Researchers studied the immune response of Spodoptera exigua larvae to two different types of baculoviruses, SeNP and AcNP. They used a microarray to analyze the genes expressed in the larvae and found that, unlike expected, many genes were up and down-regulated in the first 36 hours after infection. Immune-related genes, including pattern recognition proteins and signaling pathways, were down-regulated. This was also seen in the larval gut, where immune-related genes affect the gut microbiota, which are important for growth and development. The researchers wondered if this downregulation affected the amount of gut microbiota and found an increase in bacterial load after infection. They hypothesized this was due to the virus. Experiments showed that gut bacteria enhanced baculirus virulence and pathogenicity. The study suggests immune processes affected by baculiruses and the role of microbiota in infection.
Scientists have made a breakthrough in understanding of apomix, a type of asexual reproduction in plants, by creating a new genotype called Mi that replaces meiosis with mitosis. Meiosis is a process where cells divide to produce gametes with half the number of chromosomes, while mitosis is a process where cells divide to produce identical cells with same number of chromosomes. In Mi plants, meiosis is completely replaced by mitosis, resulting in diploid gametes that are genetically identical to the mother plant. This is a key step towards understanding and engineering apomix, which could be useful in agriculture.

The researchers isolated a gene that controls entry into second meiotic division and combined it with two other genes that affect meiotic processes to create the Mi genotype. They tested it in plants and found that meiosis was replaced by mitosis. The plants produced functional gametes that were genetically identical to the mother. This is different from previous attempts where only 0.2% of gametes were viable, making it unusable for apix engineering. In contrast, Mi plants produced wild-type levels of viable gametes and pollen.

The Mi plants underwent mit-like division instead of normal meiotic division without affecting sexual processes. The gametes retained the mother's genetic markers, confirming mitosis instead of meiosis. When meiosis is replaced by mitosis, ploidy is expected to double with each generation.
Researchers have developed a new method to prioritize disease-causing genes by incorporating tissue-specific information into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Current methods rely on a static picture of human PIs, which may not account for differences in tissue-specific P networks. The new approach integrates tissue-specific gene expression data with P information to construct tissue-specific PIs for 60 tissues and assess their prioritization power. Results show that tissue-specific PIs improve prioritization compared to generic P networks and predict novel disease-tissue associations, highlighting subclinical effects that may be missed.

Focusing on cases where the disease gene is expressed in the tissue, integrating tissue information into prioritization improves accuracy. Tissue-specific PIs were generated using gene expression data from 60 healthy tissues. The same data is often used for prioritizing genes for liver or brain diseases, despite hepatocyte and neuron molecular landscapes being dissimilar. Tissue-specific expression was incorporated into prioritization, demonstrating its impact on results. This was achieved by constructing tissue-specific PIs and employing them in prioritization. The same prioritization algorithm was applied to original and tissue PIs, with performance compared in cross-validation. Tissue variant yielded higher area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and correct gene ranking than original.

The method was extended to infer diseaseissue associations by constructing specific PIs and using them for prioritization instead of generic networks. It was hypothesized that a gene is likely expressed in healthy tissue for mutation to manifest clinically in that tissue. Indeed, 71-83% of disease-causing genes are expressed in disease-associated tissue. Tissue specificity was added for diseases to infer causing genes. The PRCE algorithm was used prioritization and contrasted generic and specific PIs. Tissue approach enhanced algorithm performance. Two methods for specific P construction yielded different priorit performance.
Researchers have developed a two-locus model to study the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes that transmit diseases such as malaria. The model accounts for differences in male and female mosquitoes' exposure to high or low concentrations of insecticide and varying selection pressures depending on the concentration. They tested the model by comparing sequential use of insecticides versus deploying them as a mixture to minimize resistance spread. Results showed mixtures outperformed sequential use in 24% of runs, while 56% favored sequential and 44 favored mixtures over 500 mosquito generations (about 40 years). Mixtures were favored when insect effectiveness is high and exposure is low. If insect does not kill homozygous mosquitoes, sequential may be more robust. Resistance spreads slower with mixture, but may not outperform sequential. For example, a mixture may last 5 years while individual insecticides last 3 and 4 years, giving 7 years overall lifespan. The model can identify control strategies to minimize resistance spread. A new insecticide may be delayed until another is available for a mixture with low resistance. The model was applied to a wider parameter space, indicating performance depends on insect, application, mosquito behavior, and genetics. Mixtures are favored when effectiveness is high. New insecticides may be deployed as mixtures. The timeframe is arbitrary. A plot showed how variables affect time to resistance, favoring mixtures with lower exposure and higher effectiveness.
Researchers have studied the saliva of Rhodnius neglectus, a type of kissing bug that transmits Chagas disease, to understand how it interacts with its host. They used next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify proteins in the saliva. The study found 636 proteins, 73 of which were confirmed by proteomic analysis. The saliva contains serine proteases, lipocalins, serine inhibitors, antigen-5 metalloproteases, and disins, and odor binding proteins. These proteins help the bug feed on blood and evade the host's immune response. The study improves understanding of how hematophagous arthropods interact with their hosts and each other. The findings can aid in developing new treatments for Chagas disease.
Researchers used the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans as a model to study how nematodes interact with bacteria in soil. They exposed C. elegans to bacteria from grassland soils and used a technique called transcription profiling to identify genes that were turned on or off in response to the bacteria. Many of these genes were involved in metabolism and immunity, suggesting they could affect nemode community dynamics in natural systems. The researchers then mutated 21 of these genes and found that most affected lifespan and fitness in a given bacterial environment, even though the bacteria were not a natural food source for C. elegans. They also showed that changes in food source, which can occur in environmental disturbances, had a large effect on gene expression with consequences for fitness. Additionally, they used analysis to demonstrate that the degree of gene expression between bacterial environments predicted the effect of gene loss on life traits in those environments.
Researchers have investigated the role of gene expression noise in the development of the mammalian embryo, specifically the formation of the inner cell mass (ICM) surrounded by the trophoblast, which forms extra-embryonic structures. Using multi-scale modeling, they found that stochastic gene expression promotes cell plasticity and plays a critical role in organizing the mouse blastocyst. They discovered that asymmetry in noise levels of Cdx2 and Oct4 expression provides a means to benefit from noise-mediated plasticity while reducing detrimental effects of stochasticity. By controlling the timing and pace of cell specification, the embryo modulates plasticity, creating a window for cells to read their environment and adjust fate. These results suggest noise is crucial in maintaining plasticity and organizing the blastocyst.

The study supports the hypothesis that gene expression has a positive influence on TE/ICM organization and robustness for correct blastocyst arrangement. They found that noise in C2, Oct, or both drive cell transitions to correct expressions and organization. 2D and 3D simulations showed inherent asymmetry in the system, introducing perturbations leading to switch from less stable to more stable states. The regulatory model is plausible, but results indicate noise helps deal with ambiguities and imperfections in positional information. Asymmetries in noise sources, predicted and confirmed by gene quantification, promote noise plasticity without overwhelming dynamics. Mammalian fate is a gradual process, providing a window for noise to fix errors. This suggests induced plasticity improves organization.

Results are consistent with modeling that C2 noise improves organization, while Oct noise does not. With modeling predictions, they conclude that noise in the appropriate range promotes proper organization.
Researchers have discovered that germline-encoded antibodies, which are antibodies encoded in the human genome, have the ability to bind to multiple antigens, or foreign substances that trigger an immune response. This flexibility is due to the structure of the germl gene, which allows for diverse binding to various antigens. However, the affinity and specificity for a particular antigen increases as the antibody acquires somatic mutations, or changes, in antigen-stimulated B cells. The study investigated whether germl-encoded antibodies are optimal for polyspecificity by determining the basis for recognition of diverse antigens by antibodies encoded by three gene segments of the variable heavy chain (VH). Panels of somatically mutated antibodies encoded by a VH gene, but binding to different antigens, were computationally redesigned to predict antibodies that engage multiple antigens at once. The Rosetta multi-state design process predicted sequences for the entire heavy chain region, including framework, CDR, and CDR mutations. The predicted sequences matched germl gene to a remarkable degree, revealing computational residues that enable polysity, or binding many antigens with common sequence. This process reverses antibody maturation in silico. In contrast, designing to bind a single antigen, similar to mature sequence was returned, mimicking natural maturation silico.
Locusts exhibit two main behavioral phases: solitary and gregarious. Solitary locusts are repelled by other locusts, while gregar insects are attracted to conspecifics and form large aggregations like hopper bands. Research has shown that crowding converts locusts to the gregar form. To understand hopper band formation, scientists studied phase change at the collective level. A mathematical model was created to predict dynamics at the population level. The model reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large transition to the gregar phase. It predicts the proportion of the population that will gregarize and the time for this to occur. Numerical simulations show aggregation's structure and traveling clumps of gregar insects. Predictions suggest possible biological experiments.

A mathematical model was used to describe collective gregar, a key process before locust outbreak. It linked individual phase change and interactions to the gregar hopper band. The onset of an outbreak was studied by constructing a model of phase for gregar and solitary locusts. Dynamics were classified in wide parameter space, a challenging by numerical techniques. For low densities, both phases are spread and solitary dominates. For large populations, a dense gregar patch emerges and solitary locs become scarce. Clustering at high densities is the onset of hop band. The model calculates critical density for gregar forms and final ratio gregar to solitary.

Behavior is plastic and dependent on density: sparse, gregar to solitary and vice versa in crowded. Gregar dominates large numbers at a site, leading to outbreak. This is summarized in a figure. Analysis yields unstable spacing from the number of modes. Simulations show rapid transitions once gregar initiated. Dense gregar packs form and sweep solitary in vicinity.
Researchers have studied the process of how a type of virus called flavivirus fuses with host cells to infect them. This process involves changes in the shape of a protein on the virus's surface called E, which helps it merge with the host cell membrane. To understand this process, scientists looked at a specific virus called tick-borne encephalitis virus. They found that by changing the pH (a measure of how acidic or basic a solution is) from acidic to alkaline, they could trap the virus in an intermediate state where the E protein is split into smaller parts and interacts with the host membrane, but doesn't merge with it yet. When the pH is changed back to acidic, the virus fuses with the host cell. This shows that there are two distinct steps in the fusion process: first, the E protein splits into smaller parts and interacts with the membrane, and second, these parts merge to form a hair-like structure that fuses the virus with the cell. This discovery helps understand how viruses infect cells and could lead to new ways to stop them.
Researchers have found that plant species in the Cape of South Africa, a biodiversity hotspot, are at a higher risk of extinction than previously thought. This region is different from what is seen in vertebrates, such as animals, where traits like body size, fertility, and geographic range are key indicators of vulnerability. The study compared data from the Red List for British and South African floras and found that taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs between regions, contradicting a simple trait-based model of extinction. A comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape revealed a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant risks, but most threatened species cluster at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals. Analyzing 11 exemplar clades, mode of speciation best explains the phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. Results show that young and fast-evolving plant lineages are at higher risk and cannot be explained by simple biological traits. Critically, vulnerable species are marching towards extinction at a rapid pace, independently from human effects. This has implications for conservation and questions the utility of Red List criteria in regions with rapid speciation.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (TK) and Vav, that contribute to the immune system's ability to engulf and destroy the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This process, called phagocytosis, is crucial for preventing infection. The proteins interact with the major phagytic receptor Dectin-1, which plays a key role in anti-fungal immunity. TK and Vav are recruited to phagytic cups containing C. alb yeast or hyphae, but are absent from mature phagosomes. They localize to regions surrounding the hypha, while Dect-1 lines the length of the phosome. TK and V colocalize with lipid (3,4,5)P3 and F-act at the phytic cup, but not diacylglycerol (DAG) which marks mature phagomal membranes. A TK inhibitor showed that TK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phytic cup and recruitment of PK. TK or V-deficient peritoneal macrophages display defect in C. alb phocytosis. Bone-derived macrophages lacking TK or V1 show reduced C. alb uptake, similar to Dect-1 deficient cells. TK or V-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C infection than wild-type mice.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a vector-borne disease that affects ruminants and humans. Madagascar was heavily affected by RV in 2008-2009, with a large spread of the disease. To optimize resources for RV surveillance in Madagascar, identifying at-risk environments is essential. This study aimed to identify factors favorable to RV transmission in cattle and humans, and human behaviors favoring human infections in Malag contexts. We characterized Malag environments using Multiple Factor Analysis (FA) and analyzed cattle and human serological data using Generalized Mixed Models. Cattle and human seroprevalence were associated with humid environments and high cattle density. Areas with high cattle density were at risk, and frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection. Our study highlighted eastern, western, and northwestern parts as high-risk for RV transmission in cattle. Analyzing environmental and human datasets brought new insight on RV transmission patterns in Madagascar. Association between serreval, humid, and cattle density suggests conitant and direct transmissions critical to RV enotic transmission. In at-risk environments, western, northwestern, and eastern areas, suitable Cx and Anophe mosquitoes vector transmission occurs in cattle and humans.
Researchers studied how a type of protein called a prion, which is a self-propagating protein conformation, is transmitted between identical and non-identical proteins, such as between proteins from different species. They used a yeast-based system to explore the nature of transmission barriers. The prion, called Rq1, is common in wild and laboratory yeast and facilitates the appearance of other prions. R1's pr domain has four Q-rich regions. The study found that R1 has multiple pr determinants that can drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the prion state in vivo. Analysis of transmission between R1 fragments with different pr determinants showed that one Q-rich region is required and sufficient for transmission, but barriers exist despite identical sequences. This indicates that multiple pr domains act cooperatively to attain the pr conformation and transmission is determined by this fold.

The prion domain is located in the Q-rich C-terminus, but one region is not essential for the pr state, suggesting multiple determinants support the pr. To determine which regions drive pr-like aggregation, R fragments lacking three of four regions were tested for amyloid formation in vitro. One region's inability to maintain the pr is not unexpected, as it lacks oligopeptide repeats and residues that facilitate fragmentation. Pr strains have distinct pr conformations of the same protein, despite sequence, with different barriers. In vitro and genetic data indicate large regions define differences.

The pr, PIN, is found in industrial and pathogenic yeast, while PSI and URE are common in laboratory. Saccharomyces cerevisiae three factors, PSI, URE, and PIN, manifest self-peruating amy conformations of Sup, Ure, and R, respectively. The pr nature was established using criteria and proof transmission obtained by infecting cells with vitro Sup, U, or R amyloids.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze genetic data from multiple individuals using a technique called deep learning, a type of machine learning. This method uses multiple layers of neural networks to learn from input data, such as summary statistics, to output genetic parameters of interest. They applied this method to a challenging problem: inferring natural selection and population size history in Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly. The approach can separate the effects of population size and selection, which is important because selection can confound demographic analysis. The researchers applied their method to 197 Dophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia and found many regions of the genome have experienced strong selection, soft, or balancing selection. They also found that soft and balancing selection occur more often near the center of chromosomes. Additionally, their analysis suggests previous estimates of population bottlenecks for Dophila melanaster were too extreme. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning for population analysis, which is still in its early stages. The method can distinguish between informative and uninformative statistics, and has been applied to other fields like neuroscience and biology. It can accommodate complex models and provide a new approach to likelihood-free inference in genetics. Deep learning could be used to select statistics for other methods, such as ABC, or estimate parameters jointly. The approach is complementary to existing methods like ABC and SVM, and it is unclear which would produce most accurate results.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes disrupt the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway by impairing localization and deubiquination of FANCD2. Persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogenes is necessary for the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. Researchers found that E6/E7-expressing cells are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing interstrand crosslinks (ICL). The study reveals how E/E7 attenuates the FA DNA repair pathway. E7 activates the pathway by increasing FAN2 monoubiquination and foci, but inhibits completion of repair by multiple mechanisms. E7 impairs FAN2 localization with double-strand breaks (DSB), hindering downstream protein Rad51 recruitment to DS in E cells. Further, E expression delays F2 deubiquination, a process important for ICL repair. Delayed F2 deubination is associated with chromatin retention of F2, hindering US1 deubiquinating activity and persistently activated ATR/CHK1/p565F signaling. Emediated p53 degradation does not hamper cell cycle process F2 modifications but abrogates repair by disrupting F deubination. E reduces and foci formation of Pal2, a repair protein downstream F2.
Researchers in Mexico's Southern Chiapas region have made significant progress in controlling onchocerciasis, a parasitic disease caused by Onchocerca volulus. The area is one of the largest onchercias foci in Latin America. Since 1998, 559 communities have received semi-annual ivermect treatments. In 50 of these communities, iverectin distribution shifted to twice a year in 2003, and 113 more communities were added to the quarterly regimen in 2009 to suppress transmission. In-depth studies were conducted in 6 communities with 2 rounds of iverect per year and 3 with 4 rounds per year. No infected Simulium ochum flies were found in 67,924 collected during the 201 dry season, with an upper 95% confidence interval of 0.06/2,000. Serological tests on 4,230 children under 5 showed 2 exposed to O. volulus (0.05%). These findings meet criteria for transmission interruption by the World Health Organization.
Listeria monocytogen, a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen, invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate in the host cytos. A transcription activator PrA regulates intracellular growth and spread, but the signal that activates PrA has not been defined. Researchers found that L monocytogen secretes a small peptide pherone, pA, which enhances escape from vacoles and may facilitate PrA activation. pA is generated by proteolytic processing of P lipoprotein signal. P is dispensable for pathogenesis, but bacteria lacking pA are attenuated in virulence and reduced vacole escape in nonphagocytic cells. Mutating PrA restores virulence and eliminates pA need. Experimental evidence suggests pA signals monocogen presence within vacole, expressing products contributing to escape and PrA promoting growth in cytos.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Vibrio cholera, which causes cholera, adapts to the hostile environment of the human intestines during infection. They used a technique called whole-genome transposon sequencing (T-seq) to compare genes required for colonization in mice with and without the antioxidant N-acetyl cystine, which reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestines. They found that mutants of the methyl-directed repair system, such as MutS, had a significant advantage in untreated, ROS-rich mice but not in N-treated mice. Further analysis showed that accumulation of catalase-producing and rugose variants in N- mice was due to Mut mutant enrichment by oxidative stress during infection. Rugose variants could revert to smooth colonies in vitro. Mutation rate of wildtype colonized in N- mice was higher than in N+ mice. The study suggests Vibrio employs an adaptive strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes.
Researchers studied the role of the Mlh3 protein in baker's yeast, a type of fungus, in meiotic recombination and DNA repair. Meiotic recombination is the process by which genetic material is exchanged between chromosomes during reproduction. Mlh-M3 is an enzyme that helps resolve Holliday junctions, a type of recombination intermediate, into crossovers. It also plays a minor role in mismatch repair, fixing errors in DNA. To understand how Mlh-M3 functions in both meiotic recombination and repair, the researchers analyzed 60 new Mlh alleles. Five disrupted mismatch repair, while one disrupted meiotic crossing over. The researchers purified and characterized Mlh-M representatives from each class. Both displayed wild-type endonuc activities in vitro. The M2sh-M complex, that acts with Mlh-M in repair, stimulated the enduc activity of M-M but not M, suggesting M is defective in interactions. Whole-genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type, mismatch, crossover, mismatch, enduc defective, and null M mutants. Compared to wild-type, all M mutants showed increases in non-crossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative pathways. The study provides a structure-function map for Mlh, revealing importance of protein-protein interactions regulating M's enzymatic activity. It also shows how meiotic components can alter fate of recombination intermediates, providing insights into recombination pathways regulation.
Researchers have found that the structure of a host population plays a crucial role in the reversal of drug resistance after treatment is stopped. When antibiotics are used to treat diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, Staphylococcus aureus, or gonorrhea, resistance levels increase, leading to a switch to new drugs and discontinuation of older ones. However, resistance often persists or declines slowly. This has been attributed to low fitness costs of resistance in the absence of the drug. The study shows that host heterogeneity in the number of contacts also affects reversion dynamics. During treatment, host structure leads to non-random distribution of resistant strains among the population, and after drug discontinuation, it affects competition, resulting in mitigation of fitness advantages. As a result, reversion rate and probability are lower on the population level after treatment is stopped. Simulations show the impact of heterogeneity is largest in biologically plausible range, when fitness costs are small.

The study confirms contact heterogeneity lowers reversion probability even when a substantial pathogen population is sensitive when treatment is stopped. Large differences between sensitive and resistant strains result in non-trivial distribution of infections over the network, influencing reversion once treatment is stopped. Costs of resistance are generally small for many path-drug combinations, making the biologically relevant range where effects are expected. Fitness variance affects reversion probability and shifts closer to 1 with system size. During treatment, resistant infections increase while sensitive decline. Once resistant has risen to a level, treatment is stopped and dynamics are governed by wild-type and resistant in absence. Modulating host structure on reversion is strongest in biologically when differences are small. This framework allows studying resistance emergence and competition between strains after treatment.
Researchers studied the genetic interactions between genes in fruit flies (Drosophila) that are similar to human genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). They found that changes in the number of copies of these genes, known as copy number variants (CNVs), can have a synergistic effects when combined. Synergistic means that the effects of two genes together are greater than the sum of their individual effects. The researchers looked at CNVs in the genomes of individuals with autism, including those with a 22q11.2 deletion. They found that changing the number of copies of Dophila orthologs of candidate genes affected by CNVs resulted in similar neurological defects as previously reported in Doph models of ASD variants. They then examined pairs of genes affected by the same CNV and found significant synergistic effects in three out of four cases. The changes in Doph synapse resulting from interacting variants supported a consistent outcome across interacting pairs. The study showed specificity and transitivity between interactors within and between CN candidate sets, suggesting shared and distinct genetic etiologies. Different interactions affected divergent processes, demonstrating distinct molecular etiologies. The study illustrates how synergistic effects from large variation contribute to disease.

The researchers used Doph as an in vivo system to examine interactions contributing to ASD phenotypes. Understanding between genes in autism requires a tractable, high-throughput in vivo system. They modelled effects of gene changes on Doph neurological readouts using sets from multigen de CNVs identified in patients with autism. They focused on Doph orthologs of genes affected by CN whose products participate in ASD network and neural functioning. Many CNs affect genes in same pathway, and proportion affect multiple proteins within pathway, suggesting combined copy change causally contributes autistic phenotypes. ASD is highly heritable, but genetic identified in less than 30% cases, while dizyotic twins comparable to first degree, suggesting numerous and rare alleles. Large individuals with family have de CN.
Researchers have been studying how CD8 T cells contribute to the development of cerebral malaria, a severe form of the disease caused by the Plasmodium berghei parasite. They found that these cells accumulate in the brains of infected mice, but the mechanisms behind their pathogenic activity were unclear. Using a technique called intravital two-photon microscopy, they observed CD8 cells in the perascular spaces of the brain, where they formed long-term interactions with antigen-presenting cells. However, blocking these interactions did not prevent the development of cerebral malaria. The cells were also found near apoptotic endothelial cells, but apoptosis was rare and did not damage the brain's blood vessels. The study suggests that CD8 cells' arrest in the perascular space is a hallmark of malaria that causes cerebral symptoms and plays a key role in its development.
A study was conducted in Vih County, Kenya to determine the burden of Tungis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga, also known as jigger. The study involved 437 participants aged 5 and above from 21 villages in 3 sublocations. The overall prevalence of Tungis was 21.5% (95% CI 17.7-25.3%). The disease was more common in areas with low economic status, such as monthly income of Ksh 100 or less, and lack of toilet facilities. Other factors associated with Tungis were age 14 or less, no use of closed footwear, and resting inside the house. Tungis is a significant problem in Vih County due to the economic status of the affected people. The study suggests the need for cost-effective and accessible strategies to control Tungis.

The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries, but exact areas affected are hard to identify. The burden of Tis worldwide is unknown. In Kenya, studies have shown a prevalence range of 19-40%. Children and the elderly bear the brunt of the infection. Tung is a neglected disease due to its occurrence in poor communities with inadequate housing and sanitation. It is not recognized by the World Health Organization. The disease affects communities in poverty, trapping them in a cycle of poverty and disease.

The study found no spatial autocorrelation, indicating Tis prevalence might be random. Soil in the sublocations was mainly clay. The highest concentration of cases were in Chiti and Selewe villages.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study how auxin and cytokinin, two hormones, interact in the Arabidopsis root. Auxin is a hormone that helps roots grow and develop, while cytokinin promotes cell division and growth. The model shows that auxin creates a pattern along the xylem axis, a key part of the root, due to a feedback between aux and cytokinin. This pattern depends on PIN, a class of auxin transporters, and AHP, a cytokinin inhibitor. The model reveals that cytokinin levels are not necessary for this pattern, but rather aux modifies cytokinin response, allowing feedback that stabilizes auxin. Simulations demonstrate the importance of regulating auxin transport for robust patterning. PIN proteins are known to be involved in vascular patterning, but the model predicts a role for AUX and LAX2 aux influx transporters. Localizing PIN creates an aux circuit that stabilizes aux in the xylem and allows it to accumulate in xylem-pericycle cells, an early step in lateral root initiation. The model also shows pericycle cells on xyle poles compete for aux, consistent with lateral roots not initiating opposite each other. The model is an extension of a previous aux transport model, now considering regulation by aux and cytokinin. It identifies a novel role for aux influx and subcellular polarity in robustness. Insights into transverse aux transport will aid future 3D models of root growth in Arabidopsis.
Researchers have identified a key player in the process that helps migratory locusts change their behavior in response to their environment. The protein CRE-B acts as a mediator in the neuropeptide F (N)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, which regulates locomotor activity between solitary and gregarious phases. CRE-B directly activates the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by interacting with its promoter region. Phosphorylation of serine 110 on CRE-B changes in response to population density and is controlled by N2. The involvement of CRE-B in N2-regulated locomotor plasticity is confirmed by RNA interference and behavioral assays. Protein kinase A transmits the effects of N2 on CRE-B phosphorylation and OS transcription. The study reveals a precise cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity.
Researchers studied the role of the protein Zelda (Z) in the early development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster embryo. Zelda plays a key role in the activation of genes involved in sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes. To understand how Zelda works, the researchers used a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (Ch-Seq) to map where Zelda binds in the genome at different stages of development. They found that Zelda binds to thousands of regions in the genome, most of which remain bound throughout development. Expectedly, Zelda binds to the promoters and enhancers of genes that are active early. However, they also found Zelda binds to the promoters of genes that are not active until the maternal-to-zyotic transition (MZ) and enhancers of factors that regulate gene activation during MZ. This suggests Zelda is not only required for early transcription but also plays a role in activating the genome at MZ. The study found that Zelda binding can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity.
Researchers have studied how proteins interact with each other in cells to regulate biological processes. They found that the timing of these interactions is crucial for proper function. Circadian clocks, which run on a 24-hour cycle, control many physiological processes, but the timing of protein interactions on this scale is not well understood. The study identified 109 new interactions between circadian proteins using a yeast-hybrid approach. One interaction between phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL led to BM1 destabilization. A dynamic circadian protein network was created to predict interactions using circadian data. Systematic analysis of RNA and overexpression suggested crucial roles for components in interactions. Analysis of a global network in the liver showed interacting proteins are expressed at similar times to restrict interactions to specific phases. Circadian interactions connect many processes, such as signaling and cell cycle, contributing to cellular organization in a new way.

A previous studies have analyzed protein interactions at specific stages or phases, but this study provides a comprehensive view of circadian dynamics. Modulators of CLOCK/BMAL function were found, indicating phosphatase 1's role in BM1 regulation. The network was expanded with validated interactions from literature, some essential for circadian dynamics. Timing of gene expression, protein interactions, and post-translational modifications are essential for circadian rhythms. The study focused on CLOCK and BM1, central to the circadian network, whose modulation by proteins is relevant for rhythms.
Researchers have solved the structure of ABA-1, a repeating unit of the nematode protein allergen (NPA) found in Ascaris su, a parasitic worm that infects humans. Nematodes are unusual proteins that bind lipids, such as fatty acids and vitamins, and help transport them between tissues. They may also play a role in nutrient scavenging, immune modulation, and IgE antibody responses during infection. ABA-1 is similar to the NPA of Ascar lumicoid, a worm that infects humans. Immune responses to NPA are associated with natural resistance to infection and are under genetic control. The structure of ABA-1 was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It has a novel seven-helix fold with a central helix and two four-helix bundles on either side. Two hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets are found in the N and C-terminal bundles. Amino acid chains affected by ligand binding were identified. Recombinant A-1 contains a tightly bound ligand of bacterial origin in one of its sites. This is the first post-translationally processed unit of a tandemly repetitive protein to be structurally characterized and belongs to a new class. NPA have no counterparts in vertebrates, making them potential targets for drug or immunological intervention.
Ciguater poisoning is a type of food poisoning that occurs in tropical regions, particularly in island communities in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PITCs). Between 1998 and 2008, there were 39,677 reported cases of cigu poisoning in 17 ITs, with an average of 194 cases per 100,000 people per year. This is a 60% increase from the 104 cases per 100,000 reported between 1973 and 1983. Accounting for underreporting, an estimated 500,000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from cig poisoning in the last 35 years. This is a significant public health issue that is expected to worsen with environmental changes.

Cigu poisoning is caused by eating fish contaminated with cigatoxin, a toxin from dinoflagates and cyanobacteria. The toxin builds up in the food chain, from herbivorous fish to carnivorous fish. Symptoms include severe neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac problems, and in some cases, chronic neuro symptoms lasting weeks to months. Diagnosis is difficult as it can only be detected in specialized labs and is based on symptoms after eating contaminated fish.

Factors associated with cig poisoning include the presence of dinoflagates, climate change, coastal degradation, and exploitation of marine resources. The incidence is predicted to increase in the future due to these changes.
Researchers studied the impact of benznazole treatment on CD4CD+8 T cells in chronic Chagas disease patients. Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that persists in the body and impairs the immune system. CD4CD8 T cells are a type of immune cell that expands in chronic Chagas patients, but little is known about their role. Thirty-eight patients with chronic Chagas and twelve healthy donors were enrolled in the study. Blood cells were stimulated with parasite antigens to analyze cytokine and cytotoxic molecule production before and after benznazole treatment. Expression of inhibitory receptors on these cells was also studied. CD4CD T cells were more frequent in Chagas patients than healthy donors, with higher ratio of CD4CDlowCDhigh subpopulation. Benznazole reduced CDCD T frequency and ratio, decreased inhibitory receptor expression, and improved multifunctional capacity. After treatment, CD T cruz antigen-specific CD8 cells increased IL-2 and TN-α production. CD8 cells can control T cruz infection, producing effector molecules. Benazole partially reversed exhaustion caused by T cruz infection, improving CD antigen-specific CD8 response.
Researchers have identified a key enzyme called Arabidopsis PLC2 (AtPLC2) that plays a crucial role in the metabolism of phosphoinides, a type of lipid involved in plant development and stress response. Phosphides are important signals that help plants grow and respond to stress. However, multiple forms of phosphide biosynthetic genes make it hard to understand which enzymes are involved in each step of the pathway and their roles in growth. The study found that PLC2 is the primary enzyme in phosphide metabolism and involved in seedling growth and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in Arabidopsis. Lipid profiling of mutants showed increased levels of substrates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating impaired phosphide metabolic pathway. PLC2 displayed distinct expression and localization at plasma membrane in different cell types where phosphide signaling occurs. Seedlings of mutant showed growth defect complemented by heterologous expression of PLC, suggesting phosphide-specific phospholase activity by PLC is required for growth. Moreover, mutant showed hypersensitive response to ER as evidenced by changes in phenotypes and gene profiles. Results revealed primary enzyme in phosphide metabolism, involvement in seedling and link between phosphide and stress.
Researchers challenge the assumption that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding emergence at the macro level. They use a measure called intrinsic-effect power-integrated (Φ) to show that a macro level can "beat" the micro. Systems were evaluated across different spatial and temporal scales by considering all possible black boxes, which are elements of one or more micro elements over one or more updates. Cause power was based on inputs and outputs of the boxes, ignoring internal elements that support their input-output function. Results show black elements can have more inputs and outputs than micro elements, revealing emergent mechanisms and constraints not apparent at micro. A macro system can have higher Φ than its constituents with more mechanisms that are interconnected. For a system, local maxima of Φ can be identified across spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a biological system, the Boolean model of fission-yeast cell, which identifies local max during its biological function. These max correspond to levels of organization where emergent cause properties come into focus, providing a point for scientific inquiries.

The researchers use intrinsic power as a quantification of causal and show examples of black macro with higher power than micro. This refutes the assumption that power resides exclusively at the micro. Evaluating across spatiemp scales shows local max of macro power, which integrated decreases to zero. Local max capture emergent roles of macro, corresponding to system descriptions as NOR, OR, OR, or MAJ elements. Reduction assumes power resides with micro, but assess power explicitly and determine spati levels where properties emerge. The approach studying systems at a particular scale treats lower components as black. A framework to evaluate power and properties of a black system is proposed. Emergent properties include increase power and relationships between elements that become apparent at macro. Intrinsic power and mechanisms at micro and black levels are quantified using interventional counterfactual theory.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in the mitochondrial respiratory chain are crucial signals that help cells adapt to their environment, but can also damage cells under conditions of hypoxia/reoxygenation, leading to various diseases. To understand their role, researchers extended a model of complex III to account for electron transport, proton leak, transmembrane potential, TCA reactions, and substrate transport. They measured electron flux in rat mitochondria fueled by succinate, pyruvate, and malate, and dynamics of NAD reduction by reverse transport from succ through complex I. Analysis revealed association of ROS with specific radicals and their combinations in complexes I and III. The phenomenon of bistability in complex III remains valid for the whole chain. Conditions for high radical content in III were predicted and confirmed. Findings provide insight into ROS production mechanisms.

A model describes states of complexes formed during electron transport, including free radicals that can form superoxide and ROS. Contributions of radicals to ROS are unclear, so researchers measured production and levels predicted for same conditions. ROS are products of electron transport in the respiratory chain, starting with superoxide formation from oxygen and free radicals. Superoxide is deactivated by superoxide dismutase.

A change in radical and ROS indicates model and process validation. Inhibition of reverse transport by roten decreases ROS in succ-fueled mitochondria. Measurements show ROS inhibition after roten addition. Sets with good fit data define patterns for radicals in I and III, giving insight into respiration and ROS. A substantial data on ROS cannot be explained within current paradigm. Succinate fueled mitochond do not expend energy on ATP synthesis, resulting in fast NAD reduction. In presence roten, NAD reduction is characterized by TCA and forward flux from succ oxidation.
Researchers have studied how motor proteins transport cargo within cells, which is essential for various cellular functions. Motor proteins convert chemical energy into kinetic energy, enabling unidirectional and bidirectional transport of cargo over long distances. Disruptions in this process, caused by mutations altering motor characteristics, lead to neurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of the kines motor domain at serine residue is linked to Huntington's disease. A study found phosphorylated and phosphomimetic ser residues reduced motor stalling forces. This article investigates the effects of similar mutations on transport properties of cargo carried by wild-type and mutant motors. Results show mutants with altered stalling forces determine average velocity and run-length, even outnumbered by wild-type motors. Mutants gain an advantage and increase run-length when load is near their stalling force or multiple of stalling. A new semi-analytical method was developed to analyze transport by multiple motors. It determines transition rates between configurations and computes biologically relevant quantities like velocity and run-length without Monte Carlo simulations. This method can model single parameter alterations and deduce effects on transport by multiple motors. The technique is implementable and a software package is provided.
Researchers studied how a specific gene, CAC1, affects learning and behavior in mice. They used a task where mice had to choose between two options based on a light on a screen to get a reward. Mice with a modified C1 gene, which is linked to learning problems and psychiatric disorders, were compared to those with a normal gene. The study found that mice without the C1 gene still learned, but used a different strategy than expected by the experimenters. Most used an outcome-based strategy, while controls used a rule-based strategy. This suggests C1 plays a specific role in learning and highlights the importance of looking at behavior in different ways. The results may help with understanding and treating psychiatric disorders.
Researchers studied how Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes respond to cyclical heat stress. Wolia-infected mosquitoes are being released to control arboviruses worldwide, but their ability to invade and persist depends on environmental conditions, such as fluctuating temperatures. The team reared larvae with different Wolia types (Mel, wAlB, and wPopCLA) under diurnal temperatures. They found that rearing at 26-37°C reduced cytoplasm incompatibility and Wolia density in Mel and wPop-CLA-infected larvae. These infections were not transmitted to the next generation when exposed to 26-37°C across their lifecycle. In contrast, wB infection maintained high density and cytoplasm incompat, and was transmitted to offspring with high fidelity under this temperature. This has implications for Wolia interventions in different environments and highlights temperature control in rearing.
Researchers studied the presence of adenoviruses in non-human primates, including great apes and macaques. They found that these animals shed substantial amounts of infectious adeniruses in their stool, even when they appeared healthy. This was a surprise, as adeniruses were thought to be self-limiting in immunocompet hosts. The team detected adeniruses in 18% of 568 non-primate stool samples from zoos and primate facilities. Shedding was observed in 22-38% of chimpanzees, bonos, and gorillas, but not orangans. In humans, the rate of adenirus shedding was similar to previous studies. The team isolated and sequenced 30 adeniruses from apes and 3 from macques. Analysis showed that ape adeniruses belonged to human species B, C, and E, with evidence of intraspecies recombination and high phylogenetic relatedness across primate hosts. This suggests zoonotic transmissions have occurred. The high asymptomatic shedding and zoonotic transmissions warrant caution for primate handling and housing. Persistent adenirus infections in the gut should be considered in human and non-primate studies with adenirus vectors.
Researchers have investigated the process of unwrapping the outer helical turn of nucleosomal DNA, a fundamental to various cellular processes. Nucleosomes are protein-DNA complexes where 146-147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1.75 times around a histone core. To function, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, but the details of this process at an atomic level were not well understood. Using molecular simulation with enhanced sampling, the researchers calculated the free profiles for unwrapping the outerhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA, finding a free energy change of 11.5 kcal/mol, consistent with single molecule experiments. The simulation revealed various conformation states, indicating multiple paths to unwrapping, but a dominant path is likely asymmetric. Unwrapping starts at one end with 5 base pairs, followed by 5 at the same end with increased energy, then at the other end with 10 pairs unwrapped. Further unwrapping advances at one end, then the other, completing unwrapping the outerhel turn. This provides insight into nucleosome construction, disruption, and repositioning, ongoing cellular processes.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which helps protect cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can harm cell membranes, and lysosomes are particularly vulnerable because they need a stable acidic environment to function. A protein called Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) has antioxidant properties and is secreted by cells in the nervous system, like astrocytes, to help neurons cope with stress. While its protective effects are known, the mechanism was unknown. The study analyzed ApD's entry into cells and its role in lysosomal homeostasis during oxidative stress. Results show ApD is endocyted and targeted to vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner and helps maintain lysosomal integrity by preventing membrane permeabilization. This is crucial for processes like myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and autophagy in neurons. The study reveals a new function of ApD, a member of a conserved family of extracellular lipoproteins, regulating lysosomal membrane integrity. This opens opportunities for therapeutic approaches to repair lysosomes in neurodegenerative diseases.
Researchers studied two colonies of Phlebotus orientalis sandflies from different locations in Ethiopia to understand their biology and susceptibility to Leishmania donovani, the parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis. One colony was from a non-endemic area in the lowlands of Melka Wer and the other from an endemic area in the highlands of Addis Zemen. They found differences in life cycle parameters between the two colonies, including requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analysis of DNA did not reveal any differences between the two colonies. The researchers also found that hybrids of the two colonies had higher fecundity than the parental colonies. They tested the susceptibility of P. orient to L. donani by infecting them with the parasite and found that even the lowest dose of 2,103 per ml was enough to infect 50% of the sandflies. Higher doses resulted in 90% infection rates in both colonies. The parasite developed quickly in the sandflies, with metacyclic promastigotes in the thoracic midgut and colonization of the stomal valve by haptads recorded in 5 days. Both colonies were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donani strains. The study suggests that the non-endemic of visceral leishias in Mel Wer is not due to low susceptibility of local P. orient to L donani.
Researchers in China conducted a study to assess the quality of life and disability of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica, a serious disease listed as a priority by the Chinese government due to its health and economic impacts. However, it was not included in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimates. The study used a questionnaire and physical examination to evaluate 506 suspected cases in a schistosoma-hyperemic county in China. Disability and morbidity were assessed using the EQ-5D questionnaire, ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. Patients rated their health on a visual scale, and age-specific disability weights were estimated. Results showed most patients reported impairments in health dimensions such as pain, discomfort, activities, and anxiety or depression. The overall disability weight was 0.447, and age-specific weights ranged from 0.378 to 0.510. Disability was associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and hepatitis B, while splenectomy and albumin were protective. The study provides data for GBD revision and evidence-based decision-making in China's schosomiasis control program.
African Trypanosomias, also known as sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals, are prevalent parasitic diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. They are spread through the bite of tset flies infected with the protozoa Trypanosoma brucei. A study used national census data from 1999 to estimate vulnerability and disability in Kenya's tse belts, areas where tset flies are found. The study found that tse belts were associated with increased disability, both directly from the bite of infected tse flies and indirectly, as diseased livestock affected agricultural production, leading to nutritional deficiencies and poverty. The census data is a promising tool for future surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa. Both human and animal trypanosomias and agricultural losses contribute to disability in tse-infested areas. Future research will examine the relationship between tse infestation and disability after the 2009 census.
Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a compound that induces cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells, but its mechanism of action was not well understood. Researchers found that HMBA activates the PI3/Akt pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation of HEXIM, a protein that binds to a transcription factor called PTEb. When PTEb is phosphorylated, it is released from its inactive complex with HEXIM and 7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). As a result, PTE is recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription and production of the virus. However, the released PTE is quickly reassembles with 7sn and HEXIM. A mutant HEX protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released PTE and sn via PI/Akt pathway blocks HM-induced viral production. The study reveals how HM induces HIV production and suggests that changes in balance between active and inactive PTE contribute to cell differentiation.
Researchers have identified a virus called Leish RNA (LRV) in Leish parasites that can cause a severe form of the disease called mucosal leishmanias (ML) and disseminated cutaneous leishias (DCL). This form of the disease occurs when the infection spreads from the initial skin lesion to other parts of the body, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Studies have shown that LRV is responsible for the severity of the disease, causing high levels of parasites in the blood and inflammation. To better understand this relationship and detect LRV in other Leish strains, new methods are needed that don't rely on knowing the virus's genetic sequence, as it has changed over time. This study presents several techniques, including an antibody called J2, which recognizes LRV in a specific way that doesn't require knowing its sequence. J2 is used in immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot tests, complementing other methods like nucleic acid purification and real-time PCR. The researchers tested J2 on several Leish strains, patient samples, and mouse biopsies, showing it can detect LRV. They suggest these methods could be used in the field to detect LRV and assess risk of complications in cutaneous leishias.
Researchers studied how two types of bacteria, Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHE) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), infect intestinal cells. These bacteria attach to the cells, flatten microvilli, and create structures called actin pedestals. To form pedestals, EPEC uses a protein called Tir, while EHE uses a protein called EspFU. Both bacteria form communities on cells, called macrocolonies, which grow over time. The proteins Tir and Esp, as well as a host protein called Arp2/3, are important for macrocolony growth. Unexpectedly, EspFU helped create larger macroies faster than Tir, by making bacteria move to cell junctions and forming a new pedestal on a neighboring cell, allowing one to infect the second cell. This shows Esp enhances colonization by increasing actin movement and efficient cell-to-cell transmission.
Researchers compared two methods for purifying extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the secretions of a parasitic worm, Fasciola hepatica, to determine the best approach for downstream studies. Differential centrifugation (DC) is the most commonly used method, but size exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been used for other pathogens. The study found that SEC-purified EVs were smaller and less diverse than DC-purified EVs. Protein analysis showed SEC had a higher purity of EV to secreted protein ratio, with less contamination from free cathepsin and tegument proteins. Proteomics analysis revealed DC-pur EVs had more protein identifications and peptide hits, indicating contamination from secreted proteins and tegument. SEC-pur EVs had less tegument proteins. The results suggest DC and SEC do not isolate the same EV population, and caution is needed when choosing purification method. SEC is proposed for EV purification before studies.
Researchers used a reverse-engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation in the fruit fly Drosila melanogaster. They focused on the gap genes Krpp, kni, and gt, which play a crucial role in patterning the embryo. The team used detailed data on mRNA and protein expression to fit a model of post-transcription regulation and test its identifiability. The results showed that post-transcription is not necessary for patterning, but crucial for controlling protein levels. This study demonstrates the potential of reverse engineering in understanding complex biological processes like development.

The researchers used a rigorous method to fit the model to data, ensuring it had a unique solution. They then fitted the model to protein data, using mRNA as inputs or boundary conditions. If the model reproduced protein patterns, they concluded postcription was not required. If it failed, they identified features relying on postcription processes. The team applied this approach to the complex problem of spatio-temporal formation in the fly embryo. They tested the importance of postcription in development, a process often studied through transcriptional regulation.

The study created a high-resolution dataset of mRNA patterns for Kr, kn, and gt, covering the entire blastoderm stage. They used reverse-engineering to test if postcription was required for gap protein expression. The results showed that postcription is necessary for proper protein levels, not patter. The study demonstrates the uniqueness and specificity of the model in the context of spatio-temporal formation. This increases the potential of reverse engineering in studying development and other complex biological processes.
Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide and primarily infects the intestinal epithelial cells in the gut. Infants and newborn mice are highly susceptible, while adults are mostly asymptomatic and shed few viral particles. Researchers investigated how the age-dependent intestinal immune response to rotavirus in a mouse model. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which recognizes viral RNA, was low in suckling mice but increased during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus shedding and damage. Adult mice lacking TLR3 or its adaptor molecule Trif had higher viral shedding and reduced epithelial pro-inflammatory and antiviral gene expression. In contrast, neonatal mice lacking TLR or Trif did not show impaired stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Chimeric mice showed non-hematopoietic cells contributed to Tr-mediated antiral response in adults. Human intestinal biops also showed age-dependent TLR increase. Upregulation of epithelial TLR during infancy might contribute to age-dependent rotavirus susceptibility.
Researchers analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 1,039 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 870 controls from the National Human Genome Repository to identify rare genetic variations. The data was collected from two centers using different methods to sequence and call variants. To ensure consistency, variants were filtered based on missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative reads. Seven samples were sequenced at both centers, and results were compared. The study addressed how to combine data from centers: gene-based analysis or meta-analysis or mega-analysis. Due to the nature of gene-based tests, mega-analysis had more power than meta-analysis. Before analysis, the impact of population structure on rare variants was explored. Like previous studies, population structure confounded case-control studies by clustering variants in ancestry, but unlike others, principal component analysis controlled for ancestry and produced correct distributions. Using gene-based tests and mega-analysis, no new risk genes for ASD were found. Results suggest gene tests require larger samples for discovery, even for a disorder like ASD.
A study investigated the association between genetic polymorphisms in the chitin-degrading enzymes chitriosase and AMCase and the incidence of mycetoma caused by Madlla myetatis in a Sudanese population. Chitin is a component of the fungal cell wall of M. myetatis, which can trigger the human immune system. Polymorphisms in the genes for chitriosase and AMCase were studied in 112 myetoma patients and 103 controls. A 24-b insertion in the chitase gene (rs1317) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the AM gene (617) were associated with impaired and decreased activity, respectively. Additionally, a SNP (41292) and 10-b insertion in the 5'UT region of the AM gene (143088) were associated with increased activity. DNA was isolated from blood and genotypes were determined using PCR-RP. Histological staining confirmed the presence of chitin in the fungal grain. The polymorphism in chitase was associated with increased odds of myoma (2.9; p.004). No association was found for polymorphisms in the genes AM. Decreased chitase activity was associated with increased risk of M myetoma.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency, a state where the virus remains dormant in the body without causing symptoms. Traditionally, HSV was thought to have two phases: an acute phase where the virus replicates and a latent phase where it remains dormant. However, new evidence suggests that the latent phase is not as clear-cut as previously thought. Studies have shown that lytic genes, responsible for viral replication, can be transcribed during latency, but it was unclear if they were translated into proteins. A new study used a sensitive model to show that lytic and latent phases are not as distinct as previously thought. Half of the virus spread to latent sites occurred after the initial infection, and ly promoters drove protein expression during latency. This is the most direct evidence to date that lytic promoters can generate proteins during latency. The study also linked this to CD8 T cell activation in latently infected nerve cells with viral gene expression during latency. This could be due to either limited lytic gene expression being part of latency or early presentation of proteins to CD8 cells halting reactivation by immune mechanism.
Researchers studied the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brains of mice infected with three different strains of scrapie, a type of prion disease. They used a technique called dual-staining immunohistochemistry to see where the misfold protein, called PrSc, accumulated in the brain cells. The results showed that each strain had a different pattern of accumulation: strain 22 was mainly in astroglia, strain 7 in neurons, and strain RML was similar to 22 in thalamus but similar to 7 in substantia nigra. The researchers also looked at the expression of genes involved in neuroinflammation in the thalamus and found that despite the differences in PrSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains. The upregulated genes correlated with activation of both astrogl and microglia early in the disease before vacu pathology or clinical signs. The profile of upregulated genes in scrapie differed from two viral diseases that had reactive gliosis similar to prion-infected mice.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study the 3D organization of chromosomes, which is crucial for gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long, densely packed, and topologically constrained polymers, making it challenging to model their behavior. The team created a generic coarse-grained model for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, accounting for entanglement and volume density. This model captures steady-state and dynamic properties and tracks dynamics at different scales, offering a significant numerical efficiency gain and a way to define reliable coarse-grained models for chromosomes. They used this approach to study the evolution of chromosome 3R (20Mbp) in Drosophila during a cell cycle (20 hours). The combination of coarse-graining with a one-parameter copolymer model integrating epigen-driven interactions quantitatively reproduces experimental data and predicts chromatin is dynamic during the cycle.

The team achieved high numerical efficiency by introducing rigidity to the model and controlling volume, allowing simulation of chromosome dynamics during a cycle on a desktop in a day. They built a coarse-grained model for chromatin with a copolymer framework based on epigen data to investigate folding and dynamics of a large chromosomeR of Doph. This is the first study to describe the behavior and evolution of a large region (20M) during a cycle (20 hours) with high precision (10bp). The approach is generic and can be applied to any self-avoiding polymers and off-lattice systems. Neglecting topological constraints leads to erroneous fine-scale description, and supplementary interactions may lead to misinterpretation.

The team demonstrated the strategy and its efficiency, leading to a systematic approach for coarse-grained models. They applied it to the role of epigen-driven in folding and dynamics of Doph genome, and discussed results in the context of chromosome and chromatin biology. This highlights the need to account for organization evolution in models, especially in higher eucotes where chromosomes are topologically constrained.
Researchers analyzed genetic data from 11 studies on 7 cell types to identify quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associated with gene expression. They integrated QTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) information from the ENCODE project and built a model to predict cell specificity of QTL. The study found QTL associated with hundreds of cell-specific CRE, including enhancers, promoters, and repressive chromatin regions. This provides insight into mechanisms generating cell-specific QTL and regulation. Using a random forest classifier with CRE-SNP overlap features, they demonstrated predicting cell specificity of QTL is feasible. They also showed that CRE from a trait-associated cell can annotate GW associations without QTL data for that cell. This integrative modeling improves understanding of complex human phenotypic variation. 

The study further explored relationship between QTL-SNP overlap and cell specificity Q replication. They built classifiers to predict cell specificity Q in absence of gene data and function of GW SNPs with phenotypes lacking Q data. This is supported by GW associations within DNase hypersensitive sites and QSNPs, and follow-up studies tying disease SNPs to misregulation. Although eQs provide mechanistic interpretations for disease, cell specificity Q presents a problem. QSNPs overlapping cell CRE are enriched for cell Q, suggesting specific mechanisms. The relationship between Q reproducibility and overlap led to hypothesis SNP-CRE predicting cell Q in absence expression or genotype. The study aims to understand mechanisms generating cell-specific Q, as Q data exist for limited cell types. For example, a GW identifies SN associated with type II diabetes, a cell to develop mechanistic model of molecular change.
Researchers have developed a new cell line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that can produce HIV-1 proteins with a specific type of sugar modification, called mannose-5 (Man5), which is an early intermediate in the sugar-adding process. This is important because many antibodies against HIV-1, called broadly neutralizing antibodies (NAb), recognize and bind to sugars on the virus protein gp120. The new cell line was created using a gene editing tool called CRISPR/Cas9 and a mutation that inactivates the gene MG1, which is responsible for adding sugars to the protein. Proteins made in this cell line bind better to certain antibodies that recognize sugars on gp120, such as PG9 and PGT and 10-107, while keeping other important parts of the protein unchanged. This new cell line can grow well and produce proteins at high densities, making it useful for large-scale production of HIV-1 vaccine. This is a step towards creating a vaccine that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies in humans.
Researchers have identified a potential target for developing new treatments against parasitic nematode diseases, such as lymphatic filariasis, a major cause of long-term disability in tropical regions. Trehalose-6-phosphatase (TPP) from the nematode Brugia malayi is essential for survival and has no mammalian counterpart, making it a promising target for inhibitors. The crystal structure of TP from B. malayi was determined, revealing a stabilizing N-terminal domain and catalytic C-terminal C2-type H phosphatase fold. Mutagenesis and kinetic analyses with a competitive inhibitor, treose-sulfate, identified key residues for binding and catalysis. A model of the TP-trehose-phosphate complex shows substrate binding driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions, unlike hom sucrose-phosphatase which relies on hydrogen bonds. This suggests high-affinity inhibitors will bind to the phosphoryl pocket and non-native to the treose pocket. Conservation of key residues in TP enzymes from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria indicates a common strategy for inhibitor design, potentially applicable to antibiotics and anthelmics.
Researchers have developed a new computer model to simulate how fluids move through tumors in the body. Tumors are made up of leaky blood vessels that don't work well together, which makes it hard to treat them. The new model uses real images of tumors to predict how fluids move through them. It combines two descriptions of blood and fluid flow to make accurate predictions. The model can be used to test how tumor heterogeneity affects fluid movement. The researchers tested it on two types of tumors and found that normalizing blood vessels is key to fluid movement. They also found that reducing pressure doesn't increase fluid flow, but creating a pressure gradient does. They think stabilizing vessel sizes and permeability is key to fluid movement after treatment. Normalizing the microenvironment may be a better way to increase fluid flow in tumors. The model can be applied to any tissue and is more efficient than other methods.
Researchers have investigated how HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, spreads from one cell to another. They found that neutralizing antibodies, which prevent the virus from entering cells, work differently depending on how the virus is transmitted. When the virus is free, floating in the blood, these antibodies can stop it from entering cells. However, when the virus is transmitted from one cell to another, some of these antibodies are less effective. Specifically, antibodies that target the CD4 binding site on the virus, like VRC01, lose potency when the virus is transmitted from cell to cell. This suggests that these antibodies block the virus when it's free, but not when it's transmitted through cell contact. This helps explain why HIV can spread quickly and evade antibodies that target the CD4 site. The study shows that the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors against cell-to-cell transmission needs to be considered, as HIV uses both free and cell-to-cell transmission to infect.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain how attention affects neural responses in the brain. They suggest that attention's effects on neural firing rates and receptive fields come from top-down modulation of higher visual areas, such as V4 and MT, rather than input areas like V1. The model requires feedback connections between areas and short-range inhibition within each area. Feedback redistributes top-down modulation to lower areas, altering inputs of higher cells, including those not initially modulated. This produces rate modulations and receptive field shifts. Simultaneously, short-range inhibition between cells produces competitive effects scaling receptive field size. The model reproduces attention effects on rates (response gain, input, gain, competition scaled field) and receptive structure (shifts, resizing) without changing parameters. It also predicts attention effects shift from gain to contrast as focus drifts from cell. 

The model requires modulatory connections between areas and short-range inhibition within each area. Feedback redistributes top-down modulation to lower areas, altering inputs of higher cells, including not initially modulated. This produces attention effects on responses, receptive expansion towards focus. The model suggests effects arise from feedback between higher and lower areas, interacting with short inhibition within each area. Attention's source is plain modulation of top layer, modeling intermediate cortex, V4 and MT, unlike existing models positing input modulation.
In Drosophila, a group of specialized cells called the posterior signalling centre (P) controls the balance of blood cells in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. This role is similar to the "niche" environment of hematopoietic stem cells in vertebrates. The P acts non-autonomously to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (J/STAT) signalling in hematietic progenitors, preserving their multipotent character for differentiation into lamlocytes, a cell type required to fight specific threats such as wasp parasism. A study found that a type I cytokine receptor, CG142/Lat, is required to switch off J/STAT signalling in hematiet progen. This is necessary for differentiation of lamytes upon wasp infection. In vivo and cell assays show Lat forms heteromers with Dome, a Drosila type cytokine receptor related to mammalian GP130, and antagonizes Dome activity dose-dependently. The immune response to wasp infection is a decrease in cytokine levels in the gland, followed by an increase in Lat/Dome ratio. This sequence leads to inhibition of J/STAT signalling by Lat. J/STAT is associated with human diseases like leukaemia and mouse studies point to a role in hematopoies and immune regulation.
Researchers studied how two types of viruses, Tomato yellow curl virus (TY) and Tomato leaf curl virus (TO), interact with each other when they infect the same plant. They found that when these viruses exchange genetic material, or recombine, the patterns are complex and influenced by how similar the viruses' genetic sequences are to each other, not by their structure. This means that when the viruses are more similar, they are more likely to exchange genetic material in certain areas. However, not all recombinant viruses survive, and selection acts against those that disrupt protein and nucleic acid interactions, which are crucial for the viruses' function. The researchers found that selection favors preserving interactions between proteins and DNA, even if it means discarding some genetic material. This can be used to identify which sequences are involved in these interactions. The study used 120 days of experimental infections in tomato plants and found recombinant viruses with up to 58 breakpoints, much more complex than previously observed.
Researchers have long believed that nucleosomes, the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin, influence the evolution of eukotic genomes by affecting DNA mutation and selection. However, a recent discovery of histone proteins in archaeal genomes challenges this idea, as archaeal nucleosomes differ significantly from eukotic counterparts. Despite these differences, a striking association between nucleosome footprints and evolution is conserved between humans and the archaeon Halofer volcanii. To understand this, scientists compared substitution patterns around nucleosomes in humans to dynamics in Halofera, a group of halophilic archaea. They found that neither mutation nor selection can explain the observed association between nucleosomes and sequence. Instead, nucleosome substitution patterns are consistent with a model where sequence divergence leads to frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. The study shows that nucleosome reposition is necessary and sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased patterns. This highlights the importance of considering causality between genetic and epigenetic change.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify key positions on a protein that are crucial for its ability to change shape when binding to a ligand. This shape change is important for the protein's function. The method looks at normal modes, or vibrations, of the protein that are involved in this change and how they are affected by mutations. A dataset of 188 protein pairs in bound and unbound forms was used to test the method. Results show a correlation between mutations that alter these modes and evolutionary conserved positions. These positions are mostly buried, aliphatic residues in regular regions like β-sheets and α-helixes. They are important for mediating ligand conformation change. 

The method selects normal modes involved in conformation change based on their overlap with distortions caused by ligand binding. A subspace defined by these modes is used to analyze effect of point mutations on conformation diversity. Key positions are those that alter this subspace the most. They are found to be conserved, mostly buried, aliphatic residues in regular regions like β-sheets and α-helix. These positions are important for mediating ligand conformation change. 

The method was applied to a refined dataset of paired protein structures in lig-free and lig-bound form. Findings allow identifying key positions for conservation of conformation diversity for lig binding. That is, positions whose mutations alter most subspace of lig-free modes in un-to-bound conformation. For each pair of lig-free and lig-bound in data, positions are ranked lowest 5% of Z-score.
Researchers have investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M), a bacterium responsible for tuberculosis, to understand its pathogenesis and develop new treatments. They engineered an M strain with reduced FBA levels and found that depletion of F resulted in clearance of M in both acute and chronic infection phases in vivo and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, consistent with M's ability to co-catabolize multiple sources, viability could be restored when cultured on mixtures of glycolytic and gluogenic sources, enabling generation of F knockout (Δba). In vitro studies of Δba revealed lack of F could only be compensated by specific balance of glucose and butyrate, with growth and metabolism of butrate determined by M's ability coatabolize glucose. These findings evaluate F as a potential target in both replicating and persistent M, and expand understanding of multiplicity in vitro that define essentiality of M's F in vivo.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called mitochondrial 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (mTXx) in the parasite Leishmania, which causes leishmaniasis. They created a mutant version of the parasite that lacked this protein and found it was unable to infect mice. However, this was not due to the protein's ability to remove oxidants, as the mutant behaved normally when exposed to added oxidants. The mutant was also unable to infect mice that couldn't mount an immune response. This suggests the protein's role is not related to removing oxidants. Further, a version of the protein that couldn't remove oxidants was able to rescue the mutant's inability to infect. The researchers propose a new function for TX, as a molecular chaperone, which helps other proteins fold correctly. This is based on its ability to prevent aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro. The mutant was also more sensitive to temperature changes, like organisms lacking chone genes. This changes the understanding of trypanid 2-cyste peroxins as just oxidant-removing devices and shows they can be important for pathogenicity independently of their oxidase activity.
Researchers conducted a multicenter study to evaluate the accuracy of the Histoplas urine antigen (HAg) test for diagnosing disseminated histlasis (PD) in HIV patients. The test, known as ALPHA-HAg, is used in regions outside the US due to its on-site availability and faster results. However, it's considered inferior to another test, MV-HAg, which is only available by referral. The study included 288 HIV patients with suspected PD and compared ALPHA-HAg results to Histlas capsul growth, blood, bone, and tissue cultures, or histopath exam. 29.5% of patients had PD. The test's sensitivity was 67.1% and specificity 97.5.5. A positive likelihood ratio was 27.2. In 10.5% of PD patients, co-infections were found, mostly Mycobacterium avium complex. The study found high specificity but low sensitivity. The test may start antifungals, but a culture-based approach is necessary due to frequent co-infections and a negative result doesn't rule out PD.
Researchers analyzed the viral communities in stool samples from 12 children with diarrhea using a new sequencing method that requires only a small amount of stool (less than 100mg) and limited sequencing (384 reads per sample. This approach, called "microassay sequencing", allowed them to detect known enteric viruses and novel viruses with limited similarity to viruses in the database. The study aimed to explore the diversity of viruses present in pediatric diarrhea, anticipating that it would vary from specimen to specimen. The goal was to obtain a broad perspective on the diversity of viruses that might be present. The method enabled systematic and unbiased exploration of viral diversity, including known and novel, in stool during acute diarrhea episodes, laying the foundation for future studies to assess if novel viruses play a role in diarrhea. The study showed that microay sequencing can define viral communities in fecal samples from diarrhea patients. Both known and novel viruses were detected from a few colonies per sample. This will serve as a starting point for further investigation of the roles of these viruses in the gastrointestinal tract.
A recent study in the Dominican Republic compared the Zika and deng outbreaks using national surveillance data. The study found that 75% of deng cases occurred in people under 20 years old, while Zika infections were more widespread among the population. Dengue rates were higher in males, 25.9 per 10,000 population, compared to 21.5 per 10,000 in females. However, Zika infections were highly clustered among females, with 73.8% of cases, and age-adjusted attack rates were 7.64 per 10,000 in females compared to 2.72 per 10,000 in males. Stratification by sex showed higher rates in females, 1.84 (1.82, 1.87), compared to males, 1.72 (1.69,1.75). However, GBS rates stratified by sex showed higher risk in males, 0.62 per 10,000 compared to females, 0.57 per 10,000. The study suggests little impact of existing deng immunity on Zika attack rates at the population level. Confounding R and incident calculations by sex-specific reporting can alter reliability, which can be addressed using proxy syndromes or conditions to explore sex-skewed incidence. The findings indicate community campaigns, influencing short-term health behavior, remain plausible behind increased reporting among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. Media and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on Zika outcomes among deng seropositive individuals.
Researchers have found that in Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of plant, a different poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PAR) enzyme, called PAR2, plays a major role in responding to DNA damage and immune responses, rather than PAR1, the most studied PAR enzyme in humans. PAR2 is responsible for 90% of PAR activity in humans. PAR2 has a different structure than PAR1, with a SAP binding motif instead of a zinc finger domain. PAR2 also contributes more than PAR1 to plant immune responses against a pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and reducing DNA breaks. The enzyme that removes poly AD-ri from proteins, PARG, is Arabidopsis P1, not P2. PAR2 activity is influenced by PAR1 and P1, and they physically interact with each other and PARG and P2. PAR and PARG are distinct from their animal counterparts, suggesting different regulation in plants. PAR2 and PARG are more important in plants than PAR1 and PARG in DNA damage and immune responses. Plants with PAR1 and PAR2 mutations are more sensitive to genotoxic agents bleomycin, mitomycin, and gamma-radiation.
Researchers have identified a new signaling pathway in the nematode worm C. elegans that regulates the formation of synapses, the connections between neurons. This pathway, called the M-15/JNK-1, opposes the action of the RPM-1 protein, which is involved in synapse formation and axon termination. The M-15/J-1 pathway includes four kinases: M-15, NS-1, JKK-1, and JNK-1, which work together to suppress defects in synapse formation in the mechanosensory neurons of RPM-1 mutants. Overexpression of these kinases in the M-15/J-1 pathway in wild-type animals impairs synapse formation. The M-15/J-1 pathway functions autonomously in mechanensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals, indicating its role in synapse development. Loss of M-15/J-1 signaling also suppresses habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in RPM-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit likely due to impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. Habituation is consistent with M-15/J-1 functioning as a parallel pathway to RPM-1, indicating it can restrict glutamateric synapse and short-term learning.
Researchers studied how a protein called TR-1 helps determine the sex of sperm cells in a type of worm called Caenorhabditis brigae. They found that TR-1 can both activate and repress the same genes, depending on signals from other proteins. This is called a "bipotential" behavior. The team confirmed TR-1 is bipot by identifying a co-factor and exploring how its structure changes during evolution. They found that TR-1 is needed for sperm production and works with a complex called Tip60 Histone Acetylase. It also promotes a gene called C-fog-3, essential for sperm development. Experiments showed TR-1 works with TR-1 to activate Cog-3 and control the sperm cell decision. Since TR-1 can also repress Cog-3, these results show it is bipot. TR- regulates the development of the tail. Mutants lacking both TR- and TR-1 resemble those lacking TR-1, suggesting both control TR- activity. However, the relationship between the two parts of the switch changed during evolution. Caenorhabdis brigae TR-1 mutants prevent hermaphrodite spermatogenesis, but C-f mutants do not. On the other hand, Caenorhabdis fem mutants prevent spermatogenesis, but TR-1 mutants do not. Interactions confirm both parts of the switch exist in each species. The relationship between the two parts of the bipot switch can shift during evolution, producing the same phenotype by alternative mechanisms.
Researchers have developed two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, to quantify the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts as it transitions between states, reflecting levels of consciousness generated by neural systems. These measures can be applied to time-series data, overcoming the limitations of previous measure ΦDM, which is only defined for discrete Markov systems and rare in biology. Simulations demonstrate the practical applicability of the new measures and explore their properties. The results provide opportunities for examining integration in real systems and model and implications for relations between integrated information, consciousness, and neurocognitive processes. However, findings pose challenges for theories ascribing physical meaning to measured quantities.

Previous measures of integrated information, such as Φ, were formulated in the context of Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (IT), which considers consciousness as a fundamental property of the universe. A new measure framed in terms of process, easy to apply in practice, permits testable hypotheses and synthetic models examining the role of integrated in neurocognitive processes. Previous measures were formulated under different assumptions and varying applicability. The IT ascribes consciousness in terms of capacity, not process, following William James. The distinction carries implications for theories, such as IT, ascribing meaning to measures of integrated. Under IT, consciousness is characterized in capacity of system, not process.
Researchers studied the spread of Rhodesian African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda, a disease that has been increasing in recent years. They wanted to understand how environmental and climate factors affect the disease's spread. A previous study used simple methods to look at the relationship between H and social, environmental, and climate variables in two affected areas, suggesting the disease spread was due to infected, untreated livestock movement. This study extended the research to account for spatial correlation, uncertainty in data and model parameters, and predict future H prevalence. Using a spatial analysis, a general linear model was used in a Bayesian framework to account for correlation and uncertainty, resulting in more accurate estimates and increased predictive power. The study supported that H was introduced via infected livestock movement from endemic areas. Health care and land temperature also affected H distribution. Predictive mapping showed increased risk in areas surrounding markets, highlighting trading's role in spread. Treating livestock at sale is crucial to prevent spread.

A study applied Bayesian geostat to H distribution in a Uganda area, providing robust results on livestock's role and methodology's utility for prediction. A previous study used logistic regression in two districts, Kabama and Dokolo, supporting H introduction via infected livestock. Spatial variation was modelled using geostat with a general linear and Bayesian model. The method is used for geo-referenced data, like disease prevalence. The study showed autocorrelation's importance in epidemiological variables, non-spatial analysis complicating covariate effects.
Researchers have challenged the idea that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems, a concept that has been widely accepted since the 1970s. They argue that the assumption of a feasible equilibrium, where all species coexist, has not been tested. Analytical and simulation results show that equilibrium is not possible in systems with many species. This leaves the question of whether stability is granted when an equilibrium exists. The study examines the effect of interaction strength and network structure on feasibility and finds that stability is not guaranteed by species richness, but by weak interactions. The behavior of ecological networks is different from unstructured systems. The study suggests that understanding ecosystems requires the interplay between interaction strength and architecture.

The feasibility of systems is critical to study, as complexity in models led to exploring the effect of structure on dynamics. Previous works have shown that certain architectures can stabilize networks, but the feasibility of different architectures for interactions has not been explored. Feasibility can be easily evaluated. The results indicate that studying the interplay between structure, strengths, and how strengths are distributed in architecture is key to understanding natural systems. Other aspects should be considered to reach conclusions about feasibility and stability that fit natural systems.

The study refines May's approach by mixing interaction types. The conclusion is that in species-rich communities, interactions should be moderate to ensure stability. Simulations study stability in randomly generated networks mimic empirically observed webs. Species richness and connectance are usually treated independently, but decrease in systems, restricting the space to explore. Topology has been suggested to play a minor role in stability, but architecture plays a role on equilibrium. The existence is not guaranteed, as the probability to observe decreases exponentially as the network grows. Weak interactions find non-trivial equilibria in ecologically, in a sensible way.
Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study in Western Kenya to assess the prevalence of Coxiella burnii, the bacteria that causes Q fever, in humans and cattle. They collected serum samples from 204 humans and 955 cattle in 416 households and administered questionnaires to gather demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information. Data was linked to environmental factors such as land cover. The study found 2.5% of humans and 10.5% of cattle had Coxi burnii antibodies. No correlation was found between cattle and human seroprevalence within households or nearby households. Multilevel analysis showed factors that cattle from markets and lower precipitation areas had higher seropreval. For humans, the youngest age group had highest odds of seropositivity, variations between ethnic groups and frequent contact with livestock was a risk. The study suggests Coxi burnii is endemic in Kenya, but prevalence is low. Environmental factors may play a role in cattle exposure, but human patterns are driven by livestock contact. Livestock markets may be a target for interventions.
Researchers have analyzed the genome of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a blood fluke that causes schistosomiasis, a major tropical disease. They identified 33 DEAD-box RNA helicases, a type of enzyme, in the parasite's genome. Three of these helicases, Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3, are similar to Vasa, a protein found in germ cells of animals. Vasa is a marker for germ cells in animals. The researchers found that Sm1, Sm2, and Sm3 are expressed in Schosoma's germ cells, specifically in the ovary, where eggs mature. This could be useful for tracking germ cells in the parasite, which is essential for developing new treatments. The team also found that Sm1, Sm2, and Sm are highly expressed in undeveloped eggs, sporocysts, adult females, and miracidia. They used bioinformatics to compare the helicases to other flukes and found that Sm1 is 89% identical to a similar helase in Schos japonicum. The study suggests that Sm1, Sm, and Sm could be used as markers for germ cells in Schoma. This could aid in developing new treatments for schosomiasis, a disease caused by the parasite. The team used real-time PCR to confirm the presence of Sm, Sm, and Sm in Schoma's developmental stages. They also used whole mount in situ hybridization to show that Sm, Sm, and Sm are transcribed in the ovary.
Researchers have found that a protein called VGL4 plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of heart valves in the body. Heart valve disease is a major problem worldwide and precise control of valve development and maintenance is essential. V4 is a cofactor in vertebrates and is mainly expressed in valve cells at a certain stage and stays till adulthood. Knocking out V4 in specific cells showed that loss of V4 in endothelial cells led to abnormal valve formation and expression of a target. Further, knocking out this target in V4-ablated hearts showed that proliferation of valve cells was constrained. These findings suggest V4 is important for development and manipulation of components could prevent congenital valve disease.

 Studies showed loss of V4 in endothelial resulted in abnormal valves and cardiac hypertrophy in mice, while knocking out rescued malformation by V4. The study shows V4 and signaling are required for proper valve remodeling and maturation. Hipp signaling in endothelial cells is required post-embryonic valve morphogenesis and homeostasis. Regulation of the pathway is necessary for proliferation of cells and valve elongation. This study identifies a function of V4 in remodeling and homeasis. Findings suggest mutations V4 may underlie human congenital valve disease. This is the first genetic study showing the role of pathway in valve remodeling and maturation. Tracing data show endothelial but not crest V4 regulates cell proliferation. This is because V is mainly in endothelial and derived cells. Only loss of V4 led to malformation Mechanistically, knocking out the phenotype of valves in V4 heart was rescued, indicating V4 required normal development by antagonizing activity. Together, a role of V4 in development and maintenance was identified.
Recent studies have suggested that soft sweeps, a type of positive selection acting on genetic variation, are common across various organisms, including humans, fruit flies, and viruses. However, other research has questioned the validity of these findings, arguing that sweeps are likely rare. This study re-examines three recent studies and their methods using population theory and simulations. The results show that all three are prone to high false positives, incorrectly identifying sweeps under both hard and neutral models. Demographic histories combined with hard sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation. This challenges the trend of using complex models of positive selection and neglecting proper demographic models. The lack of testing and analysis led to inaccurate views of evolutionary processes in studied organisms. Generalization resulted in misleading answers to population genetics questions, suggesting a dominant role of selection in genomic patterns. The study of multiple beneficial mutations found that soft sweeps rely on high mutation rate or large population size, but population size may be much larger than effective size. The claim of sweeps in humans is based on excess intermediate haplotype frequency across the genome, relying on prior knowledge of fitness and demographic history. Hard sweeps of weak mutations are classified as soft, and demographic models result in similar haplotype structures, while severe bottlenecks appear hard. Given non-equilibrium history and rare beneficial mutations, sweeps are unlikely in all instances. Examples span different population parameters, including humans, flies, and viruses.
Researchers studied the behavior of female Aedes aegypt mosquitoes, which transmit deng fever to humans through blood feeding. They found that after a blood meal, the mosquitoes stop seeking hosts for three days due to a hormone-like peptide called Peptide. But how Peptide works and the receptor it signals through were unknown. Peptide is similar to Neurope-F peptides, which affect feeding behaviors and signal through Neurope Y-Like Receptors (NLR). The team found eight NLR in the Ae aegypt genome and tested them against a panel of peptides. Four NLR responded to one or more ligands, but only NLR1 responded to Peptide and Neurope-F. Two NLR homologs in the Lyme disease vector Ix scularis were also sensitive to Peptide. Injecting synthetic Peptide and Ne-F inhibited host-seeking behavior in non-fed mosquitoes, while control injections had no effect. To see if NLR is necessary for host-seeking inhibition, the team created N mutants and tested behavior. Mutants were normal in locomotion, egg-laying, sugar-feeding, blood-feeding, and host-seeking, but not host-seeking after a meal. The team identified four Ae aegi NLR and NLR as a candidate Neurope receptor sensitive to Peptide. However, NLR alone is not required for host-seeking, suggesting other receptors, peptides, or both regulate this behavior.
Researchers in Nigeria used satellite imagery and spatial analysis to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission in Akure Local Government Area, Ondo State. The study focused on four environmental factors: temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/cover. A multicriteria evaluation method, Sa's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), was used to determine the weight of each factor's importance. Weighted analysis was done by overlaying these factors to identify areas vulnerable to schosiasis. Parasitological analysis of urine samples from random sampling showed 82% of the area fell under high and very high risk categories. Community O Ile had the lowest risk, while risk increased in Iju, Igoba, It Oolu, and Ogbese. Predictions matched field observations, with high zones corresponding to known endemic communities. The study suggests environmental factors can be used to predict and monitor schosias transmission in rural areas.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumoc) meningitis is a bacterial infection of the brain that causes significant damage and disability in many patients. A key factor in this damage is the cholesterol-dependent cytolin pneumolys, a toxin produced by the bacteria. Research shows that this toxin disrupts the regulation of glutamate in the brain, leading to synaptic damage. In post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumoc meningitis, synaptic loss was observed in the superficial layers of the frontal cortex. Similar damage was seen in mice with pneumoc meningitis when the bacteria expressed the pore-forming pneumolys. Exposure to the toxin at disease-relevant concentrations caused dendritic swelling, spine elimination, and synaptic loss in mouse brain slices. Glutamate antagonists reduced this damage. Pneumys increased glutamate levels in the brain. In astrocytes, pneumys initiated glut release in a calcium-dependent manner. The study proposes pneumys plays a role in pneumoc mening by initiating glut release from astrocytes, leading to damage. This is the first demonstration of synaptic pathology in pneumoc mening and shows a bacterial toxin can disrupt glut control in the brain, causing damage.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are viruses that cause major human cancers, and researchers are developing new ways to prevent them, such as vaccines and microbicides. To do this, they need to understand the life cycle of HPVs. The HPV life cycle is linked to the state of the skin cells it infects, and the virus is only made in the final stage of cell division. It's known that HPV first infects the bottom layer of skin cells, but why this wasn't clear. This might be because of specific entry receptors, but that doesn't explain why some cells can be infected in a single layer. Researchers used biology to show that cell division is key for HPV. They used HPV particles with a full genome, synchronized skin cells, and watched for early gene expression. The cells must enter the first stage of division for HPV to infect. Late stage inhibitors had no effect, but early, middle, and final stages prevented infection. Cells must pass the first stage for successful HPV to start. This is why HPVs infect the bottom layer of skin, as only these cells divide. This discovery has implications for controlling HPVs.
Researchers have identified microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffi, which is a major cause of systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. milRNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in animals and plants, but their function in fungi was not well understood. The team used high-throughput sequencing to find milRN in mycelial and yeast phases of P. marffei and found 24 potential candidates, with 17 in mycel and 7 in yeast. Two genes, d-1 and d-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins, and q-2 encoding Argonaute, were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed d-2 of P. marffei is closely related to homologs in other dimorphic pathogenic fungi, suggesting co-evolution. d-2 among thermal fungi. d-2 showed higher expression in mycel than yeast by 7-fold. Northern analysis confirmed expression of two milRN, PMil-M1 and PMil-M2, only in mycel. Knockout mutants showed biogenesis of milRN dependent on d-2 but not d- or q-. Targets of PMil-M were upregulated in knockdown PMilKD, supporting regulatory function of milRN. This is the first report of milRN in a thermal dim pathogenic fungus and differential expression in mycel and yeast.
Zika virus (ZIK) emerged in French Polynes in 2013 and spread through the Pacific between 2013 and 2017. Several Aedes mosquitoes may have contributed to ZIK transmission, including Aedes aegypt, the main vector in the region, and Aedes polynensis, vector of lymphatic filariasis and secondary vector deng virus. This study analyzed the ability of these vectors to transmit ZIK at a regional scale by comparing the competence of wild Ae. aegypt and Ae. polensis populations from Pacific islands for ZIK strain circulated during 2013-2017 outbreak. Field Ae. aegypt (three) and Ae. polensis (two) populations from Pacific were collected. Female mosquitoes were exposed to ZIK (107 TCID/mL) isolated in 2014. At 6, 9, 14, and 21 days post-infection, mosquito bodies, thorax and abdomen, and heads were analyzed to measure infection, dissemination, rates, and transmission, respectively. Results showed ZIK infection rates were heterogeneous between Ae. aegpt populations, but dissemination rates were moderate and homogenous between these. Ae. polensis infection rates were less heterogeneous between two tested populations. Transmission efficiency revealed low competence for ZIK of different Ae vector populations. Results indicated low ZIK transmission by Ae.egti and Ae. polensis from Pacific region. This was unexpected, suggesting other factors, such as vector density, lifespan, or immunologically naive fraction of population, contributed to rapid spread of ZIK in Pacific during 201-2017 outbreak.
Researchers have developed a new method called Targeted Structure-Seq to study the structure of non-coding RNA (nc) Xist, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. This method combines chemical probing of RNA structure with massively parallel sequencing to provide high coverage of the target RNA with few reads, making it a targeted and scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. They used Targeted-StructureSeq to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within X, including the repeat element at the 5' end of X. The analysis also identified new structural elements in X that are evolutionarily conserved, such as an element proximal to the repeats that is important for X function. The study demonstrates the utility of Targeted-Seq to study lnc conformation in mammalian cells and expect it to be useful for advancing mechanistic understanding of lRNAs.
Researchers have identified many genetic variants associated with complex diseases, but it's unclear if using genomic profiles to predict risk will be clinically useful. To evaluate the performance of genetic prediction models, new statistical measures are needed. Previous studies mainly used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to judge the value of genetic tests, but it has limitations and should be complemented by other measures. This study develops a unifying framework that connects various predictive indices. Given the overall disease probability and level of variance in liability (heritability) explained by variants, it's possible to estimate a range of metrics, such as AUC, mean difference between cases and non-cases, net reclassification, proportion of cases at highest risk, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile. Graphs can also be constructed to visualize performance, like ROC, risk density, and predictiveness curves. Simulations match theoretical estimates. The framework is applied to nine diseases, evaluating predictive power of genetic tests based on known variants.
Researchers developed a new rapid diagnostic test for Trypanosoma brucei gambense infection, a parasite that causes African trypanosomiasis, a disease that affects 70 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. The test uses recombinant antigens, which are easier to produce than the native antigens used in current tests. The study compared the new test, called SDOL HAT 2.0, to the current test SDOLAT and the Cardagglutination Test Trypanosomias (CATT). The tests were used on 57,632 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 260 confirmed cases of trypaniasis. The new test was most sensitive, detecting 71.2% of cases, followed by ATT 62.5% and SDAT 59%. The ATT was most specific, 99.2%, while SDOL and SDOL 2.0 were 98.9 and 98.1%. The tests were more sensitive in passive screening, where people were tested at health centers, than active, where teams went to people. Combining tests increased sensitivity: SDOL and SDOL 2.0 reached 98.4% in passive and 83% active. The new test was as sensitive and specific as SDAT, but less specific than ATT. Using multiple tests may improve diagnosis, but decrease specificity.
Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of Latin Americans, has been controlled in most of Guatemala through indoor insecticide spraying. However, a few areas with persistent Triatoma infestation remain. One such area is Comapa, a municipality in southeastern Guatemala, where control efforts have been less effective. Researchers conducted three surveys in Comapa to evaluate a decade of vector control activities. Baseline serological and entomological surveys in 1999 and 2002 were followed by three rounds of insecticide applications 2005 and intermittent spraying of infested houses until 201. Household inspections determined entom indices and materials in 200, 7, and 201. Serological surveys in school children 199, 200, and 201, and women 15-44 in 201. After spraying, infestation decreased from 39 to 27. Household materials predicted less than 10 infested houses. Chagas seropreval in children declined 10-fold from 10 to 1. However, serreval in women remains 10. A decade of control in Comapa shows reduced transmission, but continued vector-borne and congenital transmission threaten the 202 elimination goal. Systematic control and Chagas screening for congen and vectororne disease are needed in regions with persistent infestation.
Citrobacterium is a natural pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in mice. It shares a virulence strategy with human pathogens Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and is used to model pathogenesis. The complete genome of Citrobium ICC168 was previously sequenced, showing characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen. This study used PFGE sequencing, isolates variation, whole transcriptome analysis, and mobile elements to find that Citium's genome is unstable due to large-scale recombination and transposition of prophages. An additional Citium strain EX-33 was sequenced, showing ICC168 is representative and most mutations occurred early in the pathogen's evolution. Evolution parallels with other pathogens suggest Citium is a recently emerged path alongside mice development as a human disease model.

Citrobium isolates showed genome features of recently bottlenecked bacteria, pseudogenes and IS elements. This study investigates genomic flux in Citium, focusing on mobile elements' impact on evolution, demonstrating the pathogen's unstable genome. Citium shares virulence with EPEC and EHE. Different Citium isolates from mouse and hamster outbreaks in Japan and USA 1960s-80s were classified as atypical E. coli (M) or Citacterii (later reclassified Citrogenom species). Genetic and biochemical analyses suggested clonal origin, reclassifying Citrobium. The genome of Citium ICC168, from a 1972 outbreak, was previously sequenced. ICC and DB100, from same source, are most studied Citium isolates. Functions conferring Citium virulence to EPEC EHE are on mobile elements. Large genomic rearrangements and gene loss suggest Citium recently emerged as path, adapting lifestyle.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework to analyze stochastic gene expression, which is the random fluctuations in protein levels across cell populations. Despite many theoretical models explaining this phenomenon, there was a lack of a robust, assumption-free approach to infer the underlying mechanisms. The new method infers biochemical rates of chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from protein distributions. It asks if these rates can be estimated from protein distributions without assumptions. The researchers derived analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution, found these moments capture the shape of distributions, and developed an efficient algorithm to infer expression constants from moments. Using this, they found most distributions are consistent with multiple biochemical constant sets, but the solution still informs the underlying mechanism. For example, it distinguishes between transcription bursting and constitutive production. The method agrees with the standard approach in its operating regime and identifies previously unobtainable constants. Without assumptions, it estimates biochemical constants or ratios in 91% of cases, and identifies all constants in some cases. This framework will be a powerful tool for deducing molecular contributions to gene expression patterns.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine approach to protect against monkeypox, a disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPV). MPV is a neglected disease in rural areas of Africa and can be spread from animals to humans and humans. Smallpox vaccination protects against MPV, but the vaccination campaign ended in 1980, leaving many people unprotected. There are no approved treatments for MPV and current vaccines have safety concerns. This study used a new strategy with recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (Bo-4) vectors expressing MPV glycoproteins to protect against lethal MPV in mice. Three Bo-4 vectors were made and tested for safety and efficacy in mice. The results showed that Bo-4-E1-MRg106TK alone or with Bo-4-ALD and Bo-6 protected 100% and 80% of mice from mortality and morbidity. This demonstrates the use of Bo-4 as a vaccine platform.
Researchers have identified a new enzyme called ApH phosphatase AL1 (AL1) as the main enzyme responsible for removing the cap from messenger RNA (mRNA) in trypanosomes, a type of parasite. Unlike other cells, trypanosomes lack the usual enzymes that remove the cap from RNA. AL1 is found in a special granule at the back of the cell and works with another enzyme called X, which breaks down RNA. Without AL, RNA is capped but not yet broken down. This suggests AL acts after the cap is removed and before it's broken down. Experiments show AL1 can remove the cap from RNA in a test tube, but only if a special enzyme is added. This is different from how other enzymes that remove the cap. AL is the first time a enzyme like this has been found in animal cells, which have it from bacteria.
Researchers have discovered that inactivating the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells can trigger their conversion into functional β-like cells. This process involves the mobilization of ductal precursor cells to adopt an endocrine fate, with glucagon cells being converted into β-like cells upon Ar inhibition. The study found that Pax4 is not necessary for this process, indicating Ar is the main trigger for α-cell β-cell neogenesis. Loss of Ar in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate β-cell mass and reverse diabetes-induced β-cell depletion. The research suggests strategies targeting Ar expression or its molecular co-actors may treat diabetes.
Eukaryotic cells have mechanisms to prevent the initiation of DNA replication at thousands of origins in their genome to avoid genomic alterations. Global mechanisms reduce the activity of initiation proteins, but origins initiate with different efficiencies when these are disabled. This suggests an additional layer of control that can regulate initiation at distinct origins. Researchers identified elements necessary for preferential initiation of two origins and sufficient to confer preferential initiation on heterologous origins when control is partially deregulated. These elements do not enhance S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins and act as initiation promoters (RIPs). The IPs are ∼60 AT rich sequences that act in distance and sequence-dependent manner. During replication, Mc2 associates with origins that preferentially initiate and those that do not, indicating IPs can overcome block initiation imposed by Mc2 association. This study reveals a level of control in initiation. Local control creates a complex replication landscape that is revealed when global mechanisms are compromised. If replication contributes to alterations, as in cancer, some regions may be more susceptible than others.
Invasive amebias, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, is a growing concern among men who have sex with men (MSM) and co-infected with HIV-1 in East Asian countries. A study of 170 HIV-1-infected patients with amebias found similar clinical features to those in non-HIV patients: high fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP with extralinal ameb diseases. Two died from amebic colitis and three from unrelated causes. Metronidazole or tinidazole treatment was successful in 165 cases, but luminal treatment after did not prevent recurrence in 6 of those who received it. Recurrence was more common in HCV-antibody positive and syphilis acquired during follow-up. Various E histoly genotypes were identified, but no correlation with clinical features or outcome. Metronidazole tinazole treatment was excellent for uncomplicated amebias in HIV-1 individuals. Luminal treatment after metronidazole tinazole did not reduce recurrence in high-risk populations due to re-infection.

A retrospective analysis of 170 HIV-1-infected patients showed no impact on clinical forms of amebias. Physical and laboratory findings showed fever, leukocyt, and high CRP with extralinal ameb diseases. Results indicate excellent outcome for HIV-1 individuals with uncomplicated amebias treated metronazole tinazole, in agreement with previous reports. Conventional wisdom suggests luminal treatment after metronazole to eradicate cysts. Results emphasize difficulty preventing recurrence without new infection approach in high-risk groups, such as HIV-1-infected MSM. Spread of E histoly in MSM beyond Asia is a concern.
Researchers in Chad conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of adding tset control to medical activities in reducing the transmission of Gambian sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomiasis, in the Mandoul area. The disease is caused by Trypanosoma brucei and transmitted by tse flies, and the global goal is to eliminate it as a public health problem by 2020 and stop transmission by 203. In the Mandoul area, around 100 cases were diagnosed and treated annually until 2013. The study found that adding tset control to case detection and treatment reduced the number of cases by 70.4% between 2013 and 2015, with 62.8% of the reduction due to tset control and 8.5% to enhanced detection. Mathematical modeling predicted that elimination as a public problem could be achieved by 2018 with continued vector control and screening. The study suggests that tset targets reduced numbers in the focus, interrupting transmission, and combining tset control with medical treatment reduced incidence in 2014 and 201.
Researchers studied 124 cases of strongyloidiasis, a parasitic infection, in Spain from 2009-2017. Most patients were immigrants from South America, with 66.9% of the total. Diagnosis was made through stool samples in 21.9% of cases, and serological tests in the rest. Eosinophilia was present in 82.2% of cases. Treatment with ivermectin was more effective than albendazole in achieving cure, with an odds ratio of 2.34. The study suggests screening for S. steralis infection should be mandatory for patients from or traveling to endemic areas, especially with immunosuppressed conditions due to long latency and risk of severe presentation.
Researchers have found that the amount of antigen or live pathogen in a vaccine, known as the inoculum dose, plays a crucial role in stimulating the immune response and causing side effects. Higher doses can lead to better protection but also increase the risk of severe side effects and limit vaccine availability during shortages. To determine the optimal dose, a combination of mathematical models and experimental data can be used. A study used data from mice infected with influenza A virus and rats with human parainfluenza virus at different inoculum doses to fit a mathematical model and map inoculum to immune protection and morbidity. The framework can be used to determine the impact of inoculum on outcomes such as protection and morbidity. The results show that inoculum's effect on protection and morbidity depend on the pathogen and do not always increase with higher doses. Once protection and morbidity levels are specified, the framework can help design vaccines and determine the optimal inoculum. 

A modeling framework was developed to predict the optimal inoculum for a vaccine using data from two experiments, influenza A and parainfluenza virus. The framework can be applied to specific vaccine candidates to determine the optimal dose efficiently. The study contributes to the development of a conceptual framework to rationally design and determine inoculum for any pathogen. Parameters were chosen to produce dynamics and explore inoculum's impact on protection and morbidity for a generic model. Simulations showed different inoculum doses and resulting protection and morbidity. For a vaccine, the optimal inoculum dose is desired, but there is no single definition. A framework was developed to systematically determine inoculum's impact on protection and morbidity. It was applied to data to illustrate the concept leading to insights, such as more inoculum does not always lead to more protection.
Researchers studied the expression of the hetR gene in Anaba filaments, a type of cyanobacteria, under different nitrogen conditions. The hetR is essential for heterocyst differentiation, specialized cells that fix nitrogen. They found that hetR expression in nearby cells is coupled, with a range of two to three cells, indicating interactions along the filament. This is different from unicellular organisms where fluctuations are independent. The coupling is due to intercellular transfer and cell division. Under nitrogen deprivation, fluctuations build on previous conditions. They found that under nitrogen-rich conditions, hetR expression is influenced by septal protein Sep and Het auto-regulation. In contrast, under nitrogen-poor conditions, Het inhibitor Pat and sept protein Fra/Fra play a role. The study shows that proteins involved in differentiation combine to control fluctuations in gene expression, leading to a one-dimensional pattern in the organism.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to I (GI) in China, as shown by molecular surveillance data. To confirm this shift at the seroepidemiological level, a serosurvey was conducted in non-vaccinated pigs, revealing an average ratio of GI/GIII of 1.87, indicating co-circulation of both genotypes with GI being more prevalent. To understand the reasons behind this shift, the replication of seven recently-isolated JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, was compared in C/36 cells, chicken fibroblast (DF-1) and porine artery endothelial (PIE) cells. GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII in DF-1 and PIE cells, particularly in DF-1 with titers 22.9-225.3 higher than GIII. This suggests enhanced replication of GI in avian cells. In vivo, young ducklings were used as a model and inoculated with GI and GIII at 2 post-hatching. GI-inoculated ducklings showed higher viremia and longer vmic duration than GIII-inoc ducklings. These results support the hypothesis of enhanced efficiency for GI in birds. There are 36 amino differences between GI and GIII, which may be responsible for the replication efficiency of GI in birds. The findings suggest that enhanced replication of GI in birds results in higher exposure and infection in mosquitoes, leading to increased transmission in the birds-mosquito-bird cycle, contributing to J genotype shift.
Researchers studied the genetic network of transcription factors that regulate Candida albicans biofilm formation, a key aspect of its pathology. They used a systematic approach to generate all possible double heterozygous mutants of the genes and analyze interactions between them. The network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with six heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation, similar to homozygous deletions. Many double heterozygous mutants are as severely affected as homozygous deletions, indicating a highly interdependent "small-world" network that is efficient but not robust. TEC1 is a component whose expression is sensitive to perturbations in other TFs. RO1 expression is dependent on auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other TFs. Heterozygous N80 mutant is hyperfilous under bio and hypha-inducing conditions in a T1-dependent manner. The study provides insights into individual TF functions and network topology in biofilm formation.
Researchers studied the enzyme asparagine synthase A (AS) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease. AS converts aspartate to asparagine using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. There are two types of AS: one that uses ammonia and one that uses glutamine. AS is not found in humans but present in trypanosomatids, making it a potential drug target. A previous study showed AS was essential in Leishmania donani, a related parasite, making it a promising target. This study found that Leish infant AS can use both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen sources. They created AS mutants by replacing the gene in Leish infant and found no significant growth or infectivity defects. However, severe growth impairment was seen in aspar limiting conditions. Results show AS is not essential for parasite survival or infectivity in normal conditions, making it unsuitable as a drug target.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy. The study included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries with a total of 474 participants, 215 with epilepsy and 259 without. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01) for the association between toxocari seropositivity and epilepsy. A positive association was found in restricted analysis of confirmatory diagnostic test, population, and population-based studies. Meta-regression showed no significant association between covariates and outcome. The meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between toxari seropitivity and epilepsy, mainly supported by population studies. Health strategies to reduce toxara spp are advised. Further research is needed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxara-associated epileptogenesis.
Researchers have identified a new pathway that helps cells respond to DNA damage caused by double-strand breaks (DSBs). This pathway involves a protein called ATM and a microRNA called miR-335. When cells are exposed to radiation, ATM is activated, which leads to a decrease in mi-335, a microRNA that targets a protein called CtIP. CtIP is important for a type of DNA repair called homologous recombination repair (HRR). The researchers found that a protein called CREB is responsible for most of mi-335 expression by binding to its promoter region. After radiation, CREB's activity is reduced, which is consistent with previous studies showing that ATM phosphorylates CRE to decrease its activity. Overexpressing mi-335 in cells resulted in lower Ct levels and reduced survival after radiation. In cancer cells with a "radiosensitive" phenotype, mi335 was elevated, Ct was low, and BRCA foci were reduced. Treatment with a mi-335 antisense oligonucleotide restored survival, BRCA foci, and Ct levels. This suggests an ATM-dependent CRE-mi-335-CtIP axis influences the choice of repair for certain DS lesions.
Researchers investigated how people's ability to attribute mental states, such as beliefs and emotions, to others affects their learning in social interactions. They created a game where participants played against artificial agents with varying levels of sophistication in mentalizing, or understanding others' mental states. Participants believed they were either playing against other people or in a casino, but results were the same. People won against sophisticated agents in social setting, lost in non-social. Their choices were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing models only in social setting. This shows mentalizing adds value in social interactions and can't decipher behavior without attributing mental states to others.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FastGM to efficiently infer Gaussian graphical models in biological networks. These models help analyze relationships between many variables, like genes or proteins, to understand diseases. Current methods are either not reliable or too slow for large datasets with thousands of variables. The new algorithm, based on a 2015 proposal, is faster by several orders of magnitude without losing accuracy. It was tested on simulated data and two real datasets: asthma and Alzheimer's disease. The algorithm built gene and protein networks for disease and healthy samples, showing interesting interactions and differences between cases and controls. The results are relevant to the diseases. FastGM is a fast and reliable way to construct graphical models for high-dimensional biological data. It's been implemented in an R package called "FastGM" available for download.
Researchers studied how striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the brain's basal ganglia structure respond to changing activity from the cortex. These neurons form groups that fire together in sync with behaviorally relevant timescales. A model of MSN network showed synchronized activity only with realistic connectivity and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPs). The study investigated how MSN population interacts with varying cortical activity, like in a task. At high connectivity, a "winner-takes-all" regime was found, where activity separated into fixed firing and quiet components. Only a few population rates interacted with cortical variations. Around a transition to a more active regime occurred, where cells switched between activity and quiet. In this regime, components wandered and were independent of cortical variations. Only in this regime, changes interacted with many components, allowing sequential assemblies to be activated for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset, and peri-stimulus histograms showed strong stimulus specificity. This activity was maximized at realistic striatal connectivities and IP sizes. The MS network is optimized to respond to cortical variations, not too stable or too unstable, but to generate patterns for long periods.
Researchers have discovered a new link between polarized exocytosis and endocyt in yeast cells. Polarized exyt is the process of transporting components to specific locations on the cell surface, while endyt is the retrieval of these components before they can diffuse away. The two processes were thought to be separate events, but the study shows they are connected through a protein called Sec4. Sec4 is a GTPase that regulates actin polymerization, which is the formation of actin filaments in the cell cortex. After polar exocytic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, Sec4 binds to actin subunits and promotes their assembly. Mutations in Sec4 or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2 inhibit actin formation, while activating Sec4 accelerates it. In vitro assays, Sec4 overrode S1 inhibition of Lasp-dependent actin nucleation. This suggests Sec4 relocates along the membrane from exytic sites to endytic sites, promoting actin polymerization and compensatory endyt, which refines cell polarization.
Acetamin-induced liver injury in mice is a widely used model for drug-induced liver injury in humans. Researchers have made progress in identifying molecular events and pathways involved, but a clear explanation for how damage occurs is still elusive. A key feature of acetamin-induced liver injury is that necrosis begins near the central vein of the liver lobule and spreads outward. A prevailing hypothesis is that differences in NQI formation within liver lobules are necessary and sufficient to explain this phenomenon, called the NQech hypothesis. However, challenging this hypothesis in mice is difficult because variables cannot be controlled and sequential measurements are needed at different locations within the same mouse. To test this, researchers used virtual hepatocytes with gradients to mimic location-dependent behaviors. Employing the NQech mechanism failed to achieve the phenomenon, suggesting at least one additional feature is needed. Two alternatives were explored: glutathione depletion in the direction and mitochondrial damage in the direction. Including one feature failed, but including both enabled achieving the phenomenon. This merged mechanism provides a multile explanation of acetamin hepatotoxicity in mice. Variants of the mechanism explain variation in necrosis among genetically diverse mouse strains after a single acetamin dose.
Researchers studied the diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in infants born to infected mothers. Current guidelines rely on detecting parasites in blood samples or specific antibodies at 10-12 months old. The study quantified parasite levels in 51 congenitally infected children at 3 time points: 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after birth. Infants diagnosed by microscopy at 1 month had high parasite levels (1,700/mL), those diagnosed at 6 months had lower levels (20-500/mL), and those diagnosed by antibodies at 1 year had even lower levels (5-20/mL). Parasites were isolated from 19 children, 18 were genotyped as DTU Tc and 1 as Tc. This is the first study to measure parasite levels in over 50 congenitally infected children. Results show some children (22/51) had parasite levels below detection limit of microscopy. Current treatment is effective, but more sensitive methods are needed for early diagnosis.

The study correlated parasite levels with ELISA and genotyped parasites to understand congenital transmission and improve diagnosis. The aim was to understand why not all neonates born to infected mothers can be diagnosed immediately after birth. Only infants with high parasite levels can be diagnosed at 1 month, microscopy has 94% sensitivity in 1-year follow-up. Three groups were studied: A) neonates diagnosed at 1 month, B) infants diagnosed at 6 months, and C) diagnosed by antibodies at 1 year. Babies diagnosed at 6 months had lower parasite levels, those diagnosed by antibodies at 1 had lowest levels.
Researchers have developed a simplified model of Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria, to understand how its growth and composition are affected by its genetic makeup. They assumed the bacteria are growing in a constant environment with plenty of resources. The model was tested with data from seven strains of E coli with different numbers of copies of a gene called the rRNA operon, ranging from one to seven, the normal amount. Results showed growth decreased for strains with fewer copies. The model reproduced these results and suggested that the amount of molecules inside the bacteria doesn't change with r operon number. It also predicted that having more than seven copies leads to a crowded cytoplasm with ribosomes and proteins, which slows down growth. The model suggests that changing the r operon number in normal E coli in a constant environment doesn't increase growth. Other observations, such as changes in cell shape and operon response, are consistent with the model. The researchers propose principles from the model and suggest further experiments to test its validity.
Researchers studied the role of R1, a protein in Arabidopsis, in seed germination and seedling development in response to abscic acid (ABA) and salinity. R1 is a member of the MYB family of transcription factors, which are involved in various biological processes, including stress responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous studies suggested R1 may play a role in plant development, stress, and hormone signaling. However, the mechanisms of R1 action in response to abiotic stresses were unclear. The team found that downregulation or upregulation of R1 altered sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to ABA, NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. R1 expression was dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. The transcription factors HY5 and HYH regulated R1 via binding to R1 promoter. Genetic analysis revealed R1 mediated multiple functions of HY in seed germination, postgermination to A and abiotic stresses, and seedling to salinity. R1 interacted with HYH in vitro and in vivo. R1 and HYH may function as a module in response to A and abiotic stresses. R1 bound the promoter of ABI5, regulating its expression, while R1 interaction stimulated HY binding to ABI. However, no evidence supported R enhanced activation of ABI by HY. HY and R may converge on ABI promoter independently or dependently regulate ABI and ABI downstream A and abiotic-responsive genes, improving plant adaptation to environment.
Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complex proton pump of the respiratory chain, links electron transfer from NAD to ubiquinone to pumping four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. In humans, defects in complex I are involved in a range of degenerative disorders. Recent X-ray analysis of prokary and eukotic complex confirmed red reactions are confined to hydrophil peripheral of L-shaped molecule and take remarkable distance from membrane. This implies proton pumping within membrane of I is driven indirectly via long conformation coupling, but mechanism, number, identity, and localization of pump sites unclear.

A small subunit of complex I, Yia, was deleted, forming stable sub (nbm) lacking dist part of membrane domain. Single particle analysis revealed subunit composition of holo and sub by three proteomic approaches showed two (4 and 5) with homology to bacterial Na+/H antiporters missing in nb. Despite this, nb still pumps protons at stoichi of complete. Results show membrane of I harbors two distinct pump modules connected by long helical element identified by X-ray.

Mitochondrial I links electron transfer from NAD to ubiquone to pumping four protons from matrix into intermem space. Recent X-ray analysis proary and eukotic I confirmed red reactions confined to hydrophil peripheral of L-shaped and take remarkable from membrane. Respiratory I proton pumping NAD:ubiquin oxidoreduct is large integral multiprotein in energy membranes of bacteria and eukotes, central in energy metabolism, I defects implicated in bio diseases including neurodegener and aging.
Researchers investigated how fever affects the binding of antibodies to malaria and deng antigens in the body. They used a technique called Isothermal calorimetry to measure the strength of the bond between antibodies and antigens at different temperatures, including 37°C, 40°C, and 42°C. They found that at 40°C, the bond between antibodies and antigens was stronger than at 37°C or 42°C. This suggests that fever may play a positive role in helping the body fight off infections by making antibodies bind more strongly to antigens. The researchers also found that if the proteins were allowed to adjust to the temperature before measuring the bond, it made the bond even stronger. This could be important for understanding how the body's immune system works and how to improve tests for diseases with limited samples.
Researchers have studied how actomyosin cortical flow, a key process in cellular morphogenesis, is controlled by the interplay of force generation and dissipation in cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors. They used a computational model to explore how stress production and dissipation depend on motor activity, cross dynamics, network architecture, and filament turnover. The study found that filament turnover is necessary to maintain stress against external resistance and steady flow in response to external stress. Steady stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τ, then decreases with lifetime above τ. Effective viscosity increases with lifetime up to characteristic τ, then becomes independent of lifetime and dependent on cross dynamics. These dependencies define multiple regimes of steady flow. The model predicts that when lifetimes are shorter than both τ and τ, dependencies of viscosity and stress on turnover cancel, making flow insensitive to turnover and dependent on motor and cross dynamics. The study provides a framework for understanding how cells control cortical flow through network remodeling.
Researchers have identified a gene in Arabidopsis thalian that makes seedlings insensitive to high sugar levels of glucose and fructose. This gene, called GS11, was found in a population of Arabidopsis and confirmed in near-isogenic lines. The GS11 gene encodes a transcription factor called AN060, which is part of the NAC family. The AN060 allele makes seedlings insensitive to sugar, and is dominant over the sensitive allele. Analysis showed a single nucleotide polymorphism in AN060 affects splicing, adding 20 nucleotides to the mRNA and creating a stop codon. This results in a truncated protein without a transmembrane domain. The truncated AN060 is found in 12% of natural Arabidopsis accessions. Glucose induces GS11/AN060 expression, requiring abisic acid (ABA) signaling. ABI4 binds to the GS11AN060 promoter to activate transcription. AN060 reduces ABA sensitivity and ABA accumulation, and ABI is reduced in AN060 lines. The sugar-ABA cascade induces AN060, but the truncated AN060 attenuates ABA and signaling, making seedlings insensitive.
Researchers have discovered how the molecule c-di-G (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) signaling pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria, gains specificity to control certain behaviors such as biofilm formation and motility. They found that the c-di-G synthase enzyme, Hsb, interacts with the Hpt regulatory pathway, which controls biofilm formation and motility. The interaction between Hsb and the anti-sigma factor HsA allows c-G signaling to be rewired into the Hpt cascade. This means that c-G signaling is not just a central hub, but can be localized to specific parts of the cell. The study shows that H and Sad, two different c-G synthases, have distinct roles in controlling P aerugin behaviors. Sad is involved in biofilm formation and swarming, while H is involved in swimming and twitching. The researchers propose that H acts at the cell poles and that both H and Sad intersect in the same regulatory network, Gacsm, which controls c-G levels for biofilm formation. They also found that Sad, a Gsm-controlled synth, is central for biofilm regulation and that H binds anti-sigma Flg, inducing flagellar expression. The Hpt pathway controls biofilm, swimming, swarming, and chemotaxis in P.
Researchers investigated how people learn to associate visual cues with motor responses in a pointing task. They found that participants can learn multiple associations between visual cues and motor responses when feedback is provided, but little is known about how this learning generalizes to new situations. To study this, participants performed a task where they had to point to targets with visual feedback that varied depending on the target's shape. The shapes were morphed between circular and spiky, and participants had to use different motor responses for each shape to hit it. After training, they tested performance without feedback on new shapes not seen before. Two hypotheses were tested: participants could explicitly learn the relationship between shape and motor response and generalize, or use a model that predicts generalization based on categorization. Results showed that learning requires awareness of cues' role, but participants apply mapping to most similar shape, consistent with the model. The model also predicts slower learning with more pairs, confirmed by results. A model of learning multiple visual-motor mappings was supported, indicating a possible mechanism for simultaneous learning.
Researchers studied how climbing fibers, one of the two main inputs to the cerebellum, transmit information from the inferior olivary nucleus. Climbing fibers are thought to be involved in timing motor commands and learning. When activated, they cause large action potentials in cerebellar Purkin cells, silencing them for a brief time. Previous studies showed that climbing fibers can transmit bursts of spikes, potentially increasing information transfer to the cerebell. The researchers used a detailed model of an inferioriv cell to investigate what determines the size of the climbing burst. They found that the size of the burst is related to the phase of the cell's subthreshold oscillation, but only in a limited range. The flow of charge between the cell's soma and dendrites is a major factor in determining the burst size. This suggests that phenomena like cell synchrony can affect the burst through dendritic junctions between cells.

 The cerebellum uses two main inputs: mossy fibers and climbing fibers. Mossy fibers carry information from many brain regions, while climbing fibers carry sensory events. It's thought that variability in olary cell spikes allows for more information transfer. The model predicts a phase dependency of burst size, but only in certain conditions. Inferior cells have a low firing rate, making it hard for some learning approaches to accurately represent the cerebell. To understand what the inferior can transfer, more investigation of its electrophysiological properties is needed. The model predicts a correlation between subthreshold oscillation phase and spike count, matching previous findings.
Researchers have created a detailed computational model of how the liver regulates iron levels in the body. Iron is essential for life, but too much of it can be toxic. The liver plays a key role in controlling iron levels, and misregulation is linked to many diseases. To better understand iron metabolism, a map of its fate in the body was created, but how its components interact to regulate it was unclear. A new model of human liver iron metabolism was developed, based on known mechanisms and kinetic properties. It was validated with published data and recreated experimental findings. A simulation of iron intake was compared to a clinical study and matched its dynamics. A simulation of hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease, was created by altering a gene mutation. The model shows how liver overload occurs in this disease. It supports the liver's role as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modeling to identify targets and design experiments.

The model allows for "what-if" experiments to test new hypotheses. No comprehensive liver metabolism model exists, only specific events like iron loading in ferritin have been modeled. A map of mammalian metabolism shows molecular interactions, but lacks detail. This model balances coverage and detail to address hepatic regulation. Quantitative modeling is challenging due to lack of interaction values. The model identifies predictions about regulation to investigate. It's the most detailed model to date, describing regulation. It links genotype to phenotype, as shown with hereditary hemochromosis.

Data from various sources, in vitro and animal, were used to parameterize the model. This is a clinical approach to improve human metabolism understanding. Iron absorption, transport, and regulation form a complex network. The liver regulates through hepcin secretion. The hepatic network was analyzed through a model and simulation.
Researchers have developed a computer simulation model to study how molecules move in and out of the cell's nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC is like a gate that controls what enters and leaves the nucleus, and it's crucial for cell function and survival. The process is fast, happening in milliseconds, but the details are unclear. The model focuses on interactions between proteins called karyopherins and FG repeat domains, which are key to transport. It takes into account the flexible nature of these proteins and their attraction to each other. The simulation shows that a 15-nanometer molecule takes about 2.6 milliseconds to pass through, with some variation. The molecule sticks to the wall and interacts with FG layers as it moves through. The attraction between karyins and FG is dynamic and fast, allowing efficient transport. Most binding sites on kary are used during transport. Without filaments, the NPC is more permeable to molecules, showing their role in selectivity.
Researchers have developed a new method to determine the optimal dose of a pathogen for non-human primate (NHP) models, which are commonly used to test interventions against human diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The goal is to find a dose that infects 50% of the animals, called the ID50. This is crucial for successful experiments, as too high or too low a dose can lead to false results and waste of animals. The new method minimizes the number of animals and resources while estimating the ID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value.

The method involves titrating the infectious agent to find the right dose, which only infects a fraction of animals. Too high a dose can lead to false negative results, while too low leads to insufficient infections. A 2-fold error in dose can impact the experiment's power. By following this method, researchers can reduce the number of animals and resources needed to define the pathogen dose in NPs.

On average, the protocol uses 15-25 animals, 3-5 rounds, and estimates ID50 within 40% of the true value. It is generalizable to any path and model, but critical for NPs where animal use is minimized. The ID50 is determined by iterative exposures of animals to path dilutions, adjusting dose between rounds to achieve 50% infection.
Researchers studied how a type of neuron in the auditory system of crickets, called AN2, adapts to changes in sound intensity. They found that the neuron's response to sound shifts towards higher intensities over time, with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery. This means that the neuron responds less to low-intensity sounds. The researchers tested whether this adaptation improves signal representation by comparing it to two theories: infom, which maximizes information about the entire signal, and selective, which enhances foreground signals while suppressing background. They presented signals with two or three peaks in amplitude, which the theories predict conflicting changes. Using data analysis, they found shifts in response curves with slight reduction in slopes and higher absolute thresholds than predicted by infom. Contrary to inf, adaptation reduces information when considering the whole signal. The response also doesn't match selective, as information about the loudest part doesn't increase but remains constant. Less is transmitted about lower-intensity signals.

The study explored properties of a single neuron in the cricket's auditory pathway, testing two principles: infom and selective coding. Adaptation's effect on the input curve depends on relevant information in context. In crickets, adaptation times at first neurons range from short to long. This study reports a time constant of about one second, previously unreported in AN of T. ocean and T. The first auditory stage's task is to maintain and condense information for object recognition. Several scales can be observed, similar to vertebrates and other modalities. Motivated by theories, they examined adaptation to ensembles of stimuli with different changes. Designed multimodal noise with two or three modes, mimicking scenes. The principles predict conflicting changes when a stimulus has more than one. Optimal selective shifts the curve to peak intensity. If inf, adaptation maximizes information conveyed.
Researchers studied the role of polybasic domains in prion protein (Pr) in the propagation of disease-causing prion (PrSc). They created prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains and used them as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sCA) reactions. After several rounds of sCA, prions lacking the central poly domain (Δ) were formed. Surprisingly, these prions could bind and convert poly domain mutant substrates into prions. However, they had reduced infectivity compared to wild-type prions. The study suggests that prion propagation may not depend on a single mechanism, but interaction through poly domains may be required for infectivity.
Researchers developed an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework to identify animal behavioral strategies from time-series data. They applied this framework to Caenorhabditis elegans thermotaxis, a behavior regulated by specific strategies. When fed worms were cultivated at a constant temperature with food and placed on a thermal gradient without food, they showed an appetitive response to the temperature. The IR approach revealed that fed worms used both the absolute and temporal temperature and their behavior involved two strategies: directed migration (DM) towards the temperature and isothermal migration (IM) along constant temperature. DM efficiently reached specific temperatures, explaining thermot behavior when fed. In contrast, starved worms escaped the temperature using only the absolute but not the temporal of temperature.

The researchers also investigated the neural basis of these strategies by applying the method to thermosensory-deficient worms. The IR-based approach is useful for identifying animal strategies from behavioral data and can be applied to various studies, including decision-making in other organisms.
Researchers have sequenced the genome and transcriptome of Chrychromina tobin, a type of algae that plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems. Algae are important for absorbing carbon, forming harmful blooms, and serving as a food source for various species. They dominate freshwater and marine environments due to their mixotrophic nature. Despite their importance, only one alga, Emilian hley, has had its genome sequenced. This study reports the genome of Chrychromina and transcript data at seven points over a 24-hour cycle. The genome is small, compact, with 40% coding, and encodes 16,777 genes. Genes for fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct expression patterns over the circadian photoperiod. The genome harbors a hybrid polyketide synth/nonribosomal synthase complex, anti-microbial peptides, and proteins for multidrug and toxic extrusion. A new alga xanthodin was identified, with two RuBisCOases shared across algal lineages. The genome provides information on evolutionary, ecological, and economic importance of algae.
Researchers have found that breast cancers that lack the markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2 are often belong to the Basal molecular subtype, which is associated with defective RB, p53, and BRCA pathways. Studies in mice show that inactivating both RB and p53 pathways can suppress cell death in mammary epithelial cells, and concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features common among BRCA-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplas, and necrosis. Gene analyses show tumors share attributes of Bas-like and Claudin-low signatures, two subtypes of the broader triple-negative class defined by clinical markers.

In humans, p53 is mutated in 20-30% of breast cancers and defective pathway intermediates increase breast risk. Nearly all Bas-like cancers with BR1 have conitant p mutation. BR1 mutation predisposes early-onset cancers that are triple-negative and correlate with Bas-like in microarray. Mouse models that mimic TNBC complexity will be tools for defining cellular behavior and triaging new candidates. Bas-like cancers inactivate three tumor suppressors infamous for roles in cancers: RB, p53, and BR1. Others argue Bas-like and Claudin signatures reflect progenitor and cell phenotypes, consistent with BR mediating stem/progen celluration. Loss BR activity may alter phenotype deregulation EMT inducer SL. CG analysis revealed CN consistent with human surveys.

This study shows mammary tumors by inactivating p family proteins (p, p, p, p) with BR1 and p53 mimic aggressive forms of cancer, rapid progression, poor differentiation, distant metastasis, necrosis, metlas, and genomic instability.
Researchers studied the population of Aedes aegypt, the primary vector of deng virus, in rural Kampha Phet, Thailand. To control deng transmission, it's essential to understand where and how many of these mosquitoes are produced. They found that Aegypt primarily develop in artificial water-holding containers, such as buckets and jars, near human habitations. Most adult mosquitoes don't travel far from where they were born, so containers near each other are more likely to be used as breeding sites. Containers that are used more often produce more mosquitoes. Most studies ignore how close these sites are to each other, but this study accounted for it. From 2004 to 2007, they surveyed 84,840 containers and used regression modeling to see how density, access to piped water, and season affected mosquito production. A special model was used to account for many zeros in counts. The number and density of breeding sites were key to Aegpt distribution and abundance. More containers produced more mosquitoes as density increased. Accounting for site density is crucial for predicting Aeg populations and controlling them.
Researchers have discovered a key mechanism by which the nematode C. elegans integrates information about its environment and internal state to make decisions about growth and development. They found that the TORC2 complex in the intestine sends signals to the brain about the quality and quantity of food available, allowing the animal to adjust its behavior and development accordingly. During larval development, TOR2 regulates the expression of daf-7 and d-28 genes in sensory neurons, which respond to bacterial food and temperature to decide whether to grow or enter a dormant dauer stage. In the adult, TOR2 modulates foraging behavior through a neuropeptide signaling pathway. The study also found genetic variation in TOR2 affects larval and adult traits and identified quantitative loci associated with these traits. This suggests TOR2 acts as a hub for gut-to-brain communication, influencing neuronal function by internal state.
Researchers have identified key genetic sequences that control the behavior of embryonic stem cells, which have the ability to develop into any cell type of tissue. These sequences, called cis-regulatory elements, were found in mouse and human embryonic stem cells. They are involved in gene expression, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. A new algorithm, Compoby, was developed to identify these sequences by comparing mouse and human genomes. Compoby found conserved motifs in genes upregulated in embryonic cells. These motifs are active in undifferentiated embryonic cells and act as enhancers with endogenous promoters. Importantly, their activity is conserved in human embryonic cells. A transcription factor, NF-Y, binds to one motif and is required for embryonic cell proliferation. This study provides insights into transcriptional networks of embryonic cells. The approach can be applied to other mammalian species.
Researchers have studied the structure of a complex between two proteins, N and P, which are essential for the replication of a type of virus called vesicular stomatitis virus. This virus has a non-segmented negative-strand RNA, meaning it needs a continuous supply of protein N in a complex with P to replicate. The researchers created a variant of N without its first 21 amino acids and a 60 amino acids of P, which includes a region that binds to RNA-free N. They crystallized this complex and solved its structure at 3.0 Å resolution, revealing how this region folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR experiments confirmed the binding of this region and showed its flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure suggests a mechanism for initiation of viral RNA synthesis and encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA. The N-binding region of N is disordered and has transient helical elements that constitute a molecular recognition element, which folds upon binding to its partner. The reconstituted complex is similar to the viral N-P complex and shows the region of P adopts a stable conformation upon binding to N, including residues 6-35, which is essential for maintaining N in a soluble form. The complex crystallized into a decamer, similar to previously crystallized N-RNA, and the structure reveals how N-binding region attaches to N. A variant of VSV that cannot bind RNA crystallized into decamer of empty N, which is an artifact of crystallization.
Researchers studied the role of gap junctions in the fly's visual system, specifically in the vertical network of cells that process visual information. Gap junctions are a type of electrical synapse that allow cells to directly communicate with each other. The study found that in this network, gap junctions enable the system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation of the fly's motion within 10 milliseconds of visual input. This efficiency is near-optimal, meaning it reaches the physical limits set by the structure of the visual input. The network is connected to downstream pathways through a subset of cells, and the presence of gap junctions in these cells makes them encode motion more efficiently than the whole network. This efficient encoding is necessary for the fly's ability to make sharp turns in evasive maneuvers. Gap junctions only affect the system's output, not the input, suggesting neural circuits may be more complex than previously thought. The study shows how specific connectivity leads to efficient sensory encoding.
Researchers have identified human-select glycoprotein ligand-1 (PS-1) as a receptor for enterovirus 71 (EV-71), a virus that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease in children and can lead to severe neurological diseases. PS-1 is a protein on the surface of white blood cells and helps them stick to the lining of blood vessels. To understand how PS-1 and EV-71 interact, scientists made PS-1 mutants and tested them for binding to EV-71. They found that tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, of PS-1 is critical for binding to EV-71. Tyine sulfation is a chemical change that adds a group to the amino acid tyine in PS-1. Without tyine sulfation, PS-1 does not bind to EV-71. An inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, blocked PS-1-EV interaction and reduced EV-71 replication in cells. This study shows that tyine sulfation of PS-1 is important for EV-71 entry and replication in white blood cells.
Researchers have found that inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) can be effective in treating leishmanias, a serious health problem affecting many people worldwide. Current treatments for leishiasis can be toxic and lead to resistant strains, making them ineffective in the long run. In this study, three mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin, G-645, and K-379, were tested in mice infected with Leish major. The results showed that a clinically relevant dose of rapycin or G-645, but not K-379, reduced foot swelling and parasite load in the lymph node. Importantly, rapycin did not kill the parasite in a lab test. The treatment also reduced IL-4 production in infected mice and increased the IFN-γ:IL-4 ratio, suggesting a T1-skewed cytokine profile. The expression of CD, an activation marker, on T cells was enhanced in rapycin-treated mice. These findings suggest that select mTOR inhibitors may be used in treating leishias. The benefits are thought to come from their immunomodulatory properties.
Researchers have studied the process of natural transformation in bacteria, where they take in DNA from their environment and change their genetic makeup. To prevent unwanted changes, some bacteria prefer to take in their own DNA, which has a specific sequence called DUS. They found that Com is the receptor for D in Neisseria species, a type of bacteria that causes meningitis. By changing Com levels in Neisser meningidis, they showed that taking in D is dependent on Com, and also happens without D. The inner bases of D are crucial, while outer bases are less important. Variants of D in human Neisser species, differing by one or two bases, are impaired for transformation in Neisser meningidis. They also found that Com from another Neisser species binds to its D variant and enhances transformation in a Com mutant Neisseridis. This shows a similar mechanism is used by Neisser species to take in their own or similar DNA. These findings reveal the early steps of natural transformation and how bacteria share genes in the same environment.
In the process of cell division in yeast, a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and septum formation are crucial for cell separation. While many CAR proteins have been identified, how they interact with septum enzymes to form the septum is unclear. A study in yeast shows that cooperation between Pxl, a protein required for ring integrity, and B1, enzyme for β-1,3 glucan synthesis and septum formation, is necessary for CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane before division and furrow formation. Without Pxl and B1, ring contraction fails and cell growth occurs without septum formation. Pxl concentration at CAR increases during cytokinesis and depends on the SH domain of protein Cdc15. B1 depletion in cells with cdcΔ3 allele causes ring disassembly and block, as in cells lacking P1. Absence of P1 is lethal when C15 function is affected, causing CAR sliding with septum material along cell cortex. Findings indicate CAR anchorage through C15 and P1, and conitant B1 activity are necessary for CAR and septum formation in yeast. B1 and P1 cooperate to maintain CAR position and integrity during cytokinesis, and are essential for septum synthesis. In yeast, R1 inactivation is required for septum formation. P1 deletion increases R1 activity, impeding septum formation in b1+ cells. Results suggest C15, through SH, and P1, cooperate with B1 to confer CAR stability and septum during cytokinesis.
Researchers investigated a recent outbreak of glanders, a highly infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia malle, in Bahrain. They used high-resolution genotyping and whole-genome sequencing to analyze samples from infected horses and a camel, and compared them to samples from a 2004 outbreak in the United Arab Emirates. The results showed two distinct clusters, suggesting multiple introductions of different B. malle strains. The Bahrain samples were closely related to B. malle from horses in the UAE in 2004, indicating repeated importation from similar sources. High-resolution genotyping and whole-genome analysis revealed same phylogenetic patterns among samples. The close relationship between Dubai/UAE B. malle populations may indicate a shared geographic origin yet to be identified for infecting strains. The emergence of glanders with horse trading poses a new risk for human infections.
Researchers studied 43 patients in Colombia who did not respond to the standard treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, with the medication Glucime. The study aimed to understand the clinical and parasitological features of these patients. Most patients (95.4%) were infected with Leishmania braziliensis, a species associated with treatment failure and relapse. Lesion size and parasite infectivity were negatively correlated with Glucime susceptibility. The study found that Leish brazili was the main species linked to treatment failure or relapse. The results suggest that a second round of treatment with pentavalent derivatives may not be effective for Leish brazili infections. The study included patients who had received at least one round of Glime 20mg/kg/day for 20 days and experienced ATF or relapse. Female patients and those with incomplete or no treatment were excluded. The study was a cross-sectional, recruiting patients from June 2013 to March 2014 in three reference centers for complicated cutaneous leishiasis in the Colombian Army. The new form of the disease tends to be more severe and last longer than the old. In Colombia, most cutaneous leishias are caused by Leish viannia subgenus, associated with more treatment failure than Leish leish subgenus.
Researchers studied the relationship between two biosynthetic pathways in Escheria coli that produce iron-scaveng molecules called siderores and genotoxin colactin. These pathways require a specific enzyme called 4-phosphate transferase (PT). Two PTases have been identified: Ent and ClA. Ent is part of the bacteria's core genome, while ClA is on a pathogenic island that codes for colactin. This island is associated with a high pathogenic island (H) in some virulent E. coli strains. H carries genes for yiniact synthesis, but not its PT. The researchers investigated if ClA could contribute to siderore synthesis. They found that ClA can help produce siderores. Inactivating both Ent and ClA made a virulent E. coli less virulent in a mouse model. Having either Ent or ClA was needed for E. coli to survive in the body. This is the first report of multiple PT pathways making distinct metabolites in a microorganism. The researchers think the association of the island with H is because ClA is a PT that can make both genoto and siderores. This shows complex interaction between virulence and functions. Identifying these points is key to understanding E. virulence and may lead to new treatments.
Researchers have developed a new probabilistic model for calculating the probability of a multiple sequence alignment given a phylogenetic tree and evolutionary model, which accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions. The model, called probabilistic phylogenetic inference with insertions and deletions, uses a rate matrix to describe the probability of gap events and is based on a continuous Markov process. The model assumes insertion and deletion occur one residue at a time. The researchers applied this model to phylogenetic inference by extending the program dnaml in phyl, a widely used tool for phylogenetic inference. They tested the new model on simulated and real data, including ribosomal RNA alignments, and found it improved accuracy compared to ignoring gaps while retaining computational efficiency of the Felsen peeling algorithm. The Felsen algorithm is used in many phylogen tools due to its efficiency, scaling linearly with alignment length and number of sequences. However, most phylogen models only account for substitutions, not insertions and deletions. The new model aims to integrate evolutionary modeling into probabilistic models used in other sequence analysis, such as hidden Markov models and stochastic context-free grammars, which already account for insertions and deletions.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infects the skin through the mucous membrane before entering nerve endings. In the skin, epidermal Langerh cells (LCs) are the first dendritic cells (DCs) to encounter HSV, but it is CD103+ dermal DCs that carry viral antigen to lymph nodes for presentation, suggesting cross-talk in the skin. This study compared topically HSV-1 infected human skin explants with biops of initial human herpes lesions and found that LCs are initially infected and emigrate into the dermis. LCs bearing markers of maturation and apoptosis formed large clusters with BD3+ dermal DCs, thought to be equivalent to murine CD+ dermal DC, and DC-S+ macrophages. HSV-expressing LC fragments were observed inside dermal DC/macrophages and BD3 dermal DC had upregulated damaged uptake receptor CLEC9. No infected epidermal cells interacted with dermal DCs. Correspondingly, LC isolated from skin and infected with HSV-1 in vitro underwent apoptosis and were taken by isolated BD3 dermal DC and S+ cells. A viral relay takes place where infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken by dermal DC for antigen presentation. This provides a rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal immunization.
Researchers studied how Leishmania parasites, a type of parasite that causes leishmaniasis, interact with host cells called macrophages. They used a technique called multidimensional imaging to observe how the parasites grow inside the cells. They compared two types of Leish parasites, L. major and L. amazonensis, and found differences in how they grow inside macrophages. L. major grows in small, tight-fitting vacuoles, while L. amazon grows in large, giant vacuoles. The researchers used a tool called Lysacker, a fluorescent probe that shows acidic parts of the cell, to study how the parasites grow. They found three key features of L. major growth: lysacker enters the vacole, the number of acidic vesicles in the cell decreases, and the vacole fuses with itself. L. amazon grows by fusing with other vacoles. This study helps understand how Leish parasites grow inside cells and could be useful for studying other microorganisms.
Researchers studied how chromatin structure affects the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair in gene conversion in chicken cells. They used the DT40 cell line as a model, where immunoglobulin genes undergo sequence diversification through gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. They found that the immunoglobulin V pseudogene has histone modifications associated with active chromatin, indicating an open structure. To test the importance of chromatin, they created a system where heterochrom protein HP1 from Drosoph melanogaster was expressed as a fusion to Escheria lactose repressor, tethered to lactose operators within the pseudoλ donor. This reduced histone acetylation in the pseudoλ and altered the outcome, favoring non-templated mutations over templated mutations. Chromatin regulates homology-directed repair, suggesting histone modifications contribute to genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.
Researchers studied how the cerebellum, a part of the brain that helps adjust motor behavior to changing situations, learns from past mistakes. It's thought that the cerebellum uses the difference between desired and actual behavior, or "error," to guide learning. This error not only affects immediate behavior but also causes lasting changes in connections between brain cells that help adjust behavior. Climbing fibers, which connect to these cells, are believed to carry error information for learning, but not memory. The study tested monkeys in a task that challenges this idea. They found a clear signal of error at the time of mistake and a repeat of this signal later, before new behavior, to improve it. This contradicts the idea that climbing fibers only communicate instant errors.

A previous studies supported this concept, but not all agreed that climbing fibers only communicate errors. One example is a study on short-term sacc adaptation, a model of cerebell learning, which found patterns that didn't match the idea. The study saw a shift between populations indicating sacc amplitude change by error in primary interval. Firing of simple spikes and complex spikes in learning is established, so they wondered if observed effects were secondary to error changes in simple discharge. They used a random sacc adaptation task to avoid gradual changes and error obscuring the error's fingerprint. The study found clear changes in complex spike rate, reflecting past errors before sacc. Discussions of climbing's role in sacc learning have had conflicting findings. The idea is that climbing conveys information for future behavior improvement through two types of fibers, one from the olive, is central.
Researchers have found a way to reduce the toxic effects of a protein called TDP-43, which is associated with a devastating neurodegenerative disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). They used a yeast model to study T-43's effects and found that overexpressing the protein S1, a type of chaperone, reduced T-43's toxicity and proteolysis. They also showed that overing the mammalian S1 homologue, DNA1, relieved T-43 mediated toxicity in rodent neurons. This suggests that S1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS. T-43 aggregation is a hallmark of ALS and other diseases, and overexpressed T-43 is toxic and forms cytoplasmic aggregates in yeast and mammalian neurons. The study found that T-43 inhibits clearance of misfolded protein by the ubiquitin proteome system, suggesting that some T-43 toxicity is caused by proteoly dysfunction. The researchers identified S1 as a modifier of T-43 toxicity and showed that overing it reduces T-43's effects. They also found that overing DNA1, a mammalian S1 homologue, reduces T-43 mediated toxicity in rodent neurons.
Researchers studied the parasite load and diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in 65 patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of Brazil. Chagas is a major health issue in Latin America, and finding a link between parasite types and disease symptoms is a challenge. The study used PCR and real-time PCR to type and quantify parasites in patients' blood. 53.8% of patients were positive, with 30.7% having the indeterminate form and 23.1% the cardiac form. The parasite load ranged from 0.12 to 153.66 per mL, with a median of 2.54. The load was higher in patients over 70 years old, 20.05 per mL. Using spiked blood samples, parasites were genotyped to 0.5 per mL with high specificity. 80% of positive patients had a parasite type, while 20% had partial results. Analysis showed 40% TVI, 17.1% TVII, and 14.3% mixed infections. Two patients had TV and one had TVI+II, all with chronic cardiomyopathy and from Bahia region. TVI had higher loads, 7.56 per mL, while TVI had 2.35. However, 50% of TVI and 16.7% TVII evolved to cardiomyopathy.
Researchers conducted a rabies surveillance program in Guatemala between 2009 and 2011, testing 672 bats from 31 species for the rabies virus (RV). The overall prevalence of RV was low, at 0.3%. However, two vampire bats (Desmodus rotus) had viral antigens and infectious virus isolated from their brains, and RV was also found in their oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys. Sequencing showed the viruses were 100% identical, but had one non-synonymous substitution in the glycoprotein gene. The viruses were related to those found in vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. 7% of 398 bat sera showed RV neutralizing antibodies, with variation across troph guilds suggesting complex compartmentalization of RV perpetuation.

The study is the first to isolate RV from bats in Guatemala, with a low prevalence of 0.3% among all bats, and 1.3% among vampire bats. The viruses were phylogenetically related to those in eastern Mexico and El Salvador, due to geographic proximity. RNA was detected in multiple bat species, similar to other studies in Peru, Grenada, and Trinidad. Given bats' ecological importance, novel strategies are needed for prevention and control of bat-associated zoonoses.
Researchers have discovered a new role for A-type lamins in the regulation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication. A-type lamins are proteins that make up the nuclear lamina, a structure that provides support and organization to the cell's nucleus. The study found that A-type lamins help HSV target the virus to the edge of the nucleus, where it replicates, and reduce heterochatin, a type of chromatin that silences gene expression. Without A-type lam, the virus replication compartments are smaller and fail to reach the edge of the nucleus. The virus is associated with more heterochatin in cells lacking A-type lam. This suggests A-type lam is necessary for viral expression, replication, and growth, with greatest effect on replication at low infection levels. The lamina serves as a scaffold for DNA and proteins that regulate both euchatin and heterochatin modifications. The study provides evidence for A-type lam's role in heterochatin maintenance and silencing. HSV has been used to study cellular processes, and chromatin plays a role in gene regulation. The virus is not associated with histones. By regulating chrom on the virus, it determines productive or latent infection in cells. Further studies will determine how A-type is exploited by HSV to keep the genome active during infection. The lam may also provide a platform for viral and chrom-modifying enzymes to keep the genome active. The requirement for A was multiplicity-dependent, with 5-fold reduction at high MOI and 100-fold at low MO.
Researchers have studied the structure of the TOM (translocase of the outer membrane) complex in hydrogenosomes, a type of mitochondria found in the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. Mitochondria originated from proteobacteria and their transition to organelles was linked to the establishment of protein import pathways. The initial import of proteins is mediated by the TOM, which is common to all forms of mitochondria. However, diversity of subunits between eukotic lineages has been predicted, but knowledge is limited to few organisms. The study found that the highly divergent β-bar T. vaginalis TOM (Tv)40 forms a trans channel to conduct hydrogenosomal import. Tv40 is present in high weight complexes and analysis revealed four subunits. Two, Tom36 and Tom46, with heat shock protein (Hsp) and tetratopeptide repeat (PR) domains, bind hydrogenosomal proteins and likely function as receptors. A third sub, Tom-like, has short domain and conserved transmembrane but lacks domain. Fourth, hydrogenosomal outer protein 19 (Hom) has no homology. Data indicate TvOM is associated with sorting assembly (Sam) that in β-bar assembly. Electron microscopy revealed TvOM forms three pores with skull-like shape. Results suggest the triplet-p TOM, composed of conserved subunits, was present in last eukotic ancestor (LECA), while receptors for substrate evolved in eotic lineages.
Researchers studied how genetic variations in immune cells called CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to autoimmune diseases. These cells play a key role in the immune system's response and can cause problems when not working properly. The study looked at genetic variations associated with several autoimmune diseases and found a specific location on chromosome 12 that affects regulation. They found a variation in the R26 gene that affects gene expression in CD4 and CD8 cells. A variation in the IL27 gene was linked to type 1 diabetes, reducing protein activity and expression of IR1 and STAT in CD4 cells. This suggests IL27 may promote autoimmunity in the pancreas by upregulating the STAT pathway. CD4 T cells, including regulatory T cells, control autoimmune diseases. Genome studies identified thousands of genetic variations associated with immune diseases. This study mapped genetic variations in CD4 and CD8 cells, revealing effects on genes associated with autoimmune diseases. Effects varied between cell types and were specific. A variation in the R26 gene may affect protein stability or translation of many mRNAs. The role of this variation in type 1 diabetes is unknown, as well as other genes in the region. A variation in IL27 was significant for IR1 and STAT in CD4 cells. This may promote autoimmunity in the pancreas by upregulating STAT.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in the Democratic Republic of Congo to understand barriers to treating African Trypanosomiasis (AT), a parasitic disease. They interviewed patients, healthcare workers, and program managers in two provinces with high AT prevalence. Participants mentioned strict rules to follow after treatment: no work, no sex, no food, and no sun exposure. Violating these rules was believed to cause serious or deadly complications. These rules were well-known and led some to avoid screening due to fear of following taboos if diagnosed. Originally to mitigate melarsol's side effects, they became outdated with new safer drugs. Health providers must address community concerns to adapt to changing treatment.

The study aimed to understand these prohibitions and their impact on AT control in the Democratic Republic of Congo, led by the National Program against African Trypanosomiasis. The researchers found that medical advice on AT management turned into strict taboos in these regions, affecting screening and treatment uptake. Tabos might be abandoned with safer options, as seen with NECT. Restrictions negatively affected participation and adherence. Their origin and basis unclear, self-imposed or provider-imposed. Given impact, they explored these aspects in-depth.

The study took place in provinces with high AT prevalence, where tabos identified. Not explored in areas with lower prevalence. Failure and adverse rates vary, e.g. 19.5% in Equateur, 0.45 in Bandu, 29.6 in Kasai. Follow-up no longer recommended by WHO. Non-participation compromises control objectives, due to multiple factors, including community-enforced prohibitions associated with AT.
In Eastern Sudan's Gedare State, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a significant health burden. Médecins Sans Frontières has treated patients with VL at Tabarak Hospital since 2009. A survey was conducted to estimate VL incidence in villages around Tabarak. Between May 5th and June 17, 2011, an exhaustive door-to-door survey was done in 45 villages of Alure locality. Deaths were investigated by autopsies. Individuals with fever for at least two weeks, VL diagnosed and treated in previous year, and clinical post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) were referred to medical teams for ascertainment. A new VL case was clinical with positive rk39 rapid test or direct agglutination test. In 45 villages, 17,702 households were interviewed for 94,369 inhabitants. Crude rate over 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people. VL was possible probable cause for 19% deaths. VL-specific rate was 0.9/100 per year. Teams examined 551 individuals for fever at least weeks, 16 diagnosed primary VL. Incidence over year 7.0/100 persons or 7.9/100 when deaths included. 12.5% of population reported past treatment. VL represents significant burden in Gedare. Active case detection had low yield with access to care, not priority to enhance in similar contexts.
Researchers studied how supercoiling in bacterial chromosomes is controlled in Escherichia coli and Salmonella bacteria. Supercoiling is the twisting of DNA that makes chromosomes compact. There are two types of supercoiling: diffuse and constrained. Diffuse supercoiling moves freely around the chromosome, while constrained supercoiling is caused by proteins that bend, loop, or unwind DNA. Both types contribute equally to total supercoiling in normal cells. However, Escheria coli has 15% more supercoiling than Salmonella. To understand how diffuse supercoiling changes, researchers used a "supercoil sensor" in Salmonella. The sensor monitored supercoiling and transcription rates in normal and mutant bacteria. Transcription increased supercoiling upstream and decreased it downstream of highly expressed genes. Topoisomerase I relaxed excess supercoiling, while gyrase replenished it. Mutations in gyrase caused superco losses in some bacteria. Strains with gyrase mutations had 30-100% less supercoiling than normal. Supercoiling was influenced by transcription, as rifampicin caused superco to rebound. Mutations in gyrase also reduced transcription rates throughout the genome. The study found a link between RNA polymerase speed and gyrase, suggesting fast-growing bacteria may have more supercoiling than slow-growing species.
Researchers studied how the parasite Leishmania amazonensis, which causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, grows inside host cells. They found that the parasite grows in a structure called a parasitophorous vacuole (PV), which is similar to a late endosome or lysosome. The PV expands during infection, but its impact on parasite survival was unknown. The study showed that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate LYSTBe, a protein that regulates lysosome size. Mutations in LYSTBe caused PV to expand and parasite to grow more. However, overexpressing LBe led to small PV that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment with vacolin reversed this, expanding PV and promoting growth. In contrast, E-64 reduced PV size in LBe mutant cells and inhibited parasite growth. Enlarged PV protect parasites from damage, as inhibition of nitric oxide had no effect on Lensis within PV, but enhanced growth inBe small PV. The study found that upregulation of LBe in infected cells is a host response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV and survival.
Researchers have developed a zebraf model to study the mechanisms and treatment of Allan-Her-Dandy syndrome (AH), a genetic disorder characterized by delayed development, intellectual disability, muscle weakness, and spasticity, and thyroid hormone imbalances. The syndrome is linked to mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (M8) gene, which regulates thyroid hormone (TH) transport. M8 knockout mice replicated abnormal TH levels but did not exhibit neurological symptoms, so a zeb model was created using zinc-finger nuclease (Z)-mediated gene editing. Elimination of M8 decreased TH receptors but not other TH-related genes. Similar to patients, zeb larvae showed neurological and behavioral deficiencies. High-throughput assays showed reduced locomotor activity, altered light response, and increased sleep. Deficiencies were associated with myelin and neuron formation. Time-lapse imaging revealed reduced filopodia, axon branching, and synaptic density in sensory and motor neurons. TH analogs restored myelin and axon growth in z larvae, suggesting M8 regulates neural assembly, mediating sensory and motor performance. Administration of analogs during development may reduce neurological damage in patients.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common virus that affects newborns and people with weakened immune systems. It infects various cells using different entry pathways involving forms of the gL glycoprotein and the fusion glycoprotein B. However, the minimal machinery for cell fusion is just gL and B. Researchers found that CMV B and gL form a stable complex early after synthesis without other viral proteins. L can interact with B mutants unable to mediate cell fusion. B-L complexes make up to 16-50% of total L in CM virus particles. In contrast, small amounts of L and L-131 complexes are associated with B. Herpesviruses express B and L molecules, and most models suggest L interacts B to mediate fusion, but there's no direct evidence. For herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), it's suggested that after binding L binds B either before or with membrane fusion. The study's results contradict these models, showing CM B and L form stable B-L complexes in virions without receptor or membrane fusion. The data supports the proposal that L interacts B.
Researchers have discovered a gene called Gimap that plays a crucial role in regulating the segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in a specific types of cells called leukocytes. Mitochondrial DNA is the genetic material found inside the energy-producing structures within cells called mitochondria. The segregation of mtDNA is important because it determines the onset and severity of certain diseases. In this study, scientists used a mouse model to show that Gimap, an outer membrane protein, regulates mtDNA in leukocytes. They found that Gimap is essential for cell development and survival, suggesting that cell survival may be a key factor in regulating mtDNA variants and diseases.

The study identified the first gene that influences mtDNA segregation in mammals. Gimap regulates the rate of mtDNA in hematopoietic tissues, which produce blood cells. The segregation of mtDNA in these cells is complex and age-dependent, but not related to the number of mtDNA copies. A variation in the G3 gene changes the protein sequence, but not the part that anchors it to the membrane.

The researchers found that Gimap is critical for regulating mtDNA in hematopoietic tissues. The protein does not directly interact with mtDNA as it does not span the membrane. Overexpression of G3 in cells had no effect on mt levels. This suggests a cell-specific pathway is required for mt segregation. The number of mt has been linked to segregation and mt mutations in humans.
Researchers in Victoria, Australia studied the incubation period of Buruli (BU), a skin and soft tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, to understand how long it takes for symptoms to appear after exposure to the bacteria. Most people with BU live in areas where the disease is common, making it hard to estimate the incubation period. However, in Victoria, many people get BU after visiting these areas. The researchers looked at 443 cases from 2013 to 2016 and found the mean incubation period was 4.5 months, similar to a previous study from 2002 to 2012. They also found no link between incubation period and age, sex, location of exposure, or duration of exposure. The study confirms the incubation period of BU in Victoria is between 4 to 5 months, which can help guide clinicians and suggests the mode of transmission is similar in different regions.
Researchers have identified a protein in the Toxoplas parasite that is related to a human protein called Niemann-Pick type 1 (NPC). This protein, named TCR1, is involved in regulating lipids within the parasite. TCR has a similar structure to human NPC, but lacks targeting signals to endo-lysosomes, instead localizing to flattened vesicles beneath the parasite's membrane. When expressed in mammalian cells with NPC mutations, TCR restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from endo-lysosomes. Disrupting TCR in the parasite results in abnormal lipid accumulation of cholesterol esters, sphingomyins, and ceramides, and storage bodies and membranous tubules in the parasitoph vacuoles. Mutant parasites replicate faster and are more virulent than the parental strain. These findings suggest TCR regulates lipid homeostasis in Tooplas by controlling intracellular lipid levels, leading to stimulation of storage, biosynthesis, and division.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in the SMOC1 gene as the cause of ophthalmoacelic syndrome (AS), a rare disorder characterized by eye malformations, including anophthalmia, and postaxial oligodactyly. Homozygosity mapping and targeted mutation analysis of the SM1 gene on chromosome 14q24 identified mutations in eight unrelated families, four of which were nonsense, frameshift, and two missense. Missense mutations were in the thyrogulin-1 domain of the protein. The mouse ortholog, Sm1, shows stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofacial, and somite development. A targeted gene-trap mutation of Sm1 reduced mRNA to 10% of wild-type levels, resulting in highly penetrant postax oligodactly in homozyg mutant animals. Eye malations, most coloma and cleft, occurred in a proportion of mutant embryos and pups. Loss of Sm1 results in a convincing phenocopy of the disease. SM1 is a mammalian paralog of Drosophila Pentone, an inhibitor of decaplegic, and Xenopus Sm1 functions as a BMP antagonist in early embryogenesis. Loss of BMP antagonism provides a plausible explanation for limb and eye phenotypes in humans and mice.
Researchers have found that a protein called TRIM22 plays a key role in restricting the replication of the HIV virus. They treated human cells with type 1 interferons, which are proteins that help fight off viruses, and identified TR22 as one of the most highly activated genes. They confirmed that overexpressing TR22 in cells blocked HIV replication. To see if TR22's role was important under normal conditions, they compared cells with and without TR22 and found that HIV release was higher without it. This suggests that TR22 acts as a natural antiviral agent. Studies showed that TR22 blocked the release of HIV particles containing the G protein, but not other viruses. This was because TR22 disrupted the normal movement of G to the cell membrane. Mutations of TR22 showed that two specific amino acids are needed for its antiral activity. This reveals a pathway by which type 1 interferons stop HIV replication.
Researchers studied the relationship between fig trees (Ficus) and their specific wasp pollinators (Agonidae) to understand why this mutualism is stable. In this mutualism, both species benefit, but cheaters should outcompete cooperative ones, leading to instability. Ficus trees have two types of ovules: inner and outer. Wasps avoid ovipositing into outer ovules, resulting in mutual stability, but the mechanism is unknown. In Ficus rubosa, outer ovules are vulnerable to parasitic wasps ovipositing from outside the sycon. Parasitism decreases towards the center, where inner ovules provide safe space for pollinator offspring. This may contribute to pollinators avoiding outer ovules and wasps focusing on a subset, reducing galling rates. This mechanism may explain stability in fig-poll mutualism independent of plant defenses or pollinator constraints. In most Ficus species, sycon receive foundresses exploit more ovules than wasps, leaving unexplained seed production. Three hypotheses failed to explain stability, suggesting pollin wasps favor innerules for oviposition. Variance in morphology and parasitic wasps across Ficus indicates parasitic wasps contribute to stability. Ficus and Agonid wasps are an obligate mutualism example. Wasps pollinate trees, trees provide was offspring. In monoec F, wasps ovip into receptive sycon, pollinating while depositing eggs into ovules. Parasitic wasps may contribute to stability by selecting innerules due to reduced parasitism. Our study shows pollin was gain fitness by selecting innerules due to reduced parasitism.
Researchers studied how genetic and environmental factors affect plant height in a type of grass called Setaria. They grew 12 sets of the same plants in different conditions to see how height changed. They found that height was reduced when water was limited and when plants were close together. They also found that environment, such as being in a field or a controlled room, affected height. The study suggests that height is a complex trait influenced by many genes and can be changed by environment. Some genes that control height are active at different times in plant's life. Genes from a wild Setaria parent made plants grow taller early, while genes from a domesticated Setaria parent made them grow taller later. The study found 37 genes that affect height in 12 experiments with different water and density. Most of these genes were not from known to affect height before. Plant growth is a process that changes over time and is influenced by genetics and environment. Understanding this is key to knowing how traits are formed. Height is a key part of plant architecture and easy to measure, so it's been studied for a long time.
A recent study in the Pantanal wetlands of western Brazil found evidence of the Ilus virus (ILV), a type of flavivirus, circulating in the region. Between 2005 and 2009, at least three flaviviruses, including ILV, were detected in horses in the area. To further investigate, researchers collected 3,234 mosquitoes from 16 species in 2009-2010 and tested them for virus and flaviral RNA. One pool of 50 non-engorged female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes tested positive for ILV by culture and real-time PCR, indicating an infection rate of 2.5 per 1,000. The full genomic sequence showed 95% identity to the only available ILV genome. This confirms IL circulation in the Pantanal.

The Pantanal region hosts diverse wildlife and hematophagous arthropods, favoring zoonotic virus circulation. Despite scarce data on arboirus vectors, local mosquito species reported as vectors have been found in the north and south Pantanal. In 2009, a flavirus survey in equines from the Ncolia sub-region detected past infection with increasing seroprevalence, Cipore virus, West virus, Louis encephalitis, and IL. The Pantanal is a seasonally flooded 140,000 km. The high prevalence of IL antibodies in horses combined with IL isolation in mosquitoes confirms an arv importance in the region.
Researchers conducted a preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of single-dose mectin (MO) as a new treatment for scabies compared to two-dose ivermectin (IVM) in a porcine model. Scabies is a common dermatological condition affecting millions globally, but current treatments are insufficient and resistance is emerging. MO has a more favorable pharmacological profile, making it a promising alternative. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive MO (0.3mg/kg once) or IV (0.2mg twice) or no treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed by mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-scab Ig antibodies. Plasma and skin pharmacokinetic profiles were determined. At day 14 post-treatment, all MO-treated pigs were mite-free, while only two IV-treated were. MO efficacy was 100% and unchanged until study-end, compared to 62% (26-100) for IV. Clinical scabies, pritus, and anti-s Ig antibodies disappeared in all MO-treated but 75% IV-treated. MO persisted 9 times longer in plasma and skin, covering mite life and enabling long-lasting efficacy. Data show single-dose MO was more effective than consecutive IV, supporting MO as therapeutic approach for scabies.
Researchers have identified the minimum number of proteins required for Staphylococcus aureus to synthesize its cell wall component peptoglycan (PG), a target of many antibiotics. By deleting seven of nine genes encoding PG enzymes from the S. aureus genome, they created a strain capable of PG synthesis catalyzed by only two proteins, penicillin-binding proteins P1 (PBP1) and bi-functional P2 (BP). However, this strain became highly susceptible to cell-targeting antibiotics and displayed impaired virulence in a Drosophila infection model, which depends on specific PG receptor proteins. The study shows that most PG enzymes are redundant in vitro, but important in clinically relevant environments for pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. S. aureus can grow and divide with only two active synthesizing enzymes, identifying the minimal machinery of S. aureus. The research aims to develop antibiotics inhibiting final stages of PG synthesis. The study demonstrates plasticity of the process, as S. aure can synthesize PG using just two proteins, P1 and P2, performing transpeidation and transglyylation reactions. The strain MIN, encoding only P1 and P2, was viable in rich and minimal medium. Deletion of seven genes had little effect on viability, growth, morphology, or PG composition in rich medium. However, in vitro growth is not sufficient to study fitness of pathogen S. aure.
Researchers studied the bacterium Burkholderia pseudallei, which causes a difficult-to-treat disease called meloidosis. They wanted to understand how it infects, invades, and survives in the body and how it gets iron, a crucial for growth. Iron is hard to find in the body, so bacteria have ways to get it. They thought Burkia pseudalle used a common iron-getting system called siderophore, but found a strain that didn't have this system was still able to infect mice. This suggested other systems might be important. They deleted the main iron-getting systems in a strain and found a new way to get iron that wasn't known before. They also found that a system to get iron from hemoglobin, a protein in blood, was important. Without it, the bacterium couldn't get iron from hemoglobin. But, it could get iron from another source called ferritin. This means Burkia pseudalle might use a new way to get iron to grow in the body. This could help it survive and cause disease. The study suggests Burkia pseudalle adapts to body conditions and finds new ways to get iron when one system fails.
Researchers have developed a new tool called COMM (COnsensus Metabolic Model GENeration) to create more accurate and comprehensive models of how cells work. These models, called genome-scale constraint metabolic models (GSMs), are like detailed maps of a cell's metabolic processes, but often have inconsistencies that make them hard to use. COMM automatically identifies and resolves these inconsistencies between different models, creating a more complete and accurate representation of a cell's function. Tests on four organisms showed that the automatically generated models were predictive and more coherent than individual models. This tool is especially useful for complex cases where manual curation doesn't scale, such as in early organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions.

Genome-scale metabolic models are both knowledge databases and mathematical models. A consensus model should be more comprehensive than individual models due to shared and unique parts, and accurate due to reconciling inconsistencies. COMM identifies similarities, differences, and complements of metabolic networks based on common problems during integration and algorithms to resolve. Identifying similar reactions in different compartments is difficult, but an extension could progress this by combining information from metabolites prior to matching. COMM bridges automation and high-quality manual curation for consensus model generation.

These models are organism-specific, containing thousands of metabolites, reactions, and genes. Automatically generated consensus models have higher predictive power than manually curated models and comparable to manually constructed models. COMM increases coherence with biological while maintaining predictive power, important for usability and reliability to elucidate cell interactions.
Researchers have identified two genes, famb and xyl1, that play a crucial role in the development of cartilage and bone in the body. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides cushioning and support to joints, while bone is the hard, calcified tissue that makes up the skeleton. In the process of bone formation, cartilage cells, called chondrocytes, interact with a protein-rich matrix and undergo a transition, or maturation, to become bone. The researchers used zebraf fish to study the interaction between cartilage and bone and found that cartilage inhibits chrocy maturation, which determines the timing of bone formation. They isolated mutants with decreased cartilage and increased bone and identified the genes famb and xyl, which encode enzymes that synthesize proteoglycans, a type of protein in cartilage. Mutants lacked normal levels of proteoglycan sulfate, a key component of cartilage, and formed bone earlier than normal siblings. Chrotes in mutants initiated maturation prematurely, showing increased expression of certain markers and suppressed bone formation. Ultrastructural analysis showed abnormal matrix and cellular features of chrotes in mutants. The study confirms previous findings that fam and xyl are involved in proteoglycan synthesis and reveals their role in cartilage production and timing of skeletal development.
Researchers studied the role of Topoisomerase II (Top) in the separation of heterochromatic regions during meiosis in Drosoph melanogaster females. They found that knocking down Top in the later stages of meiosis caused defects in the separation of heteroch regions after spindle assembly. In Top-expressing oocytes, heteroch regions of achmate and chmate chromosomes failed to separate during prometaph and metaphase, and were stretched into long projections with centromeres localizing near the tips. Despite this, bipolar spindles formed in most Top-express oocytes, but achmate chromosomes failed to move towards the poles during prometaph. Both ach and chmate chromosomes showed defects in orientation. Euchromatic regions separate earlier in prophase, no defects were observed in their separation upon Top knockdown at midphase. Embryos from Top-express females failed to initiate mitotic divisions. The study suggests Topois II resolves heteroch DNA entang during meiosis and these entang must be resolved to complete meiosis.
Researchers conducted a field study to evaluate the effectiveness of using deltamethrin-impregnated collars to control and prevent visceral leishmanias in dogs in a highly endemic area in Brazil. The study took place in two areas: an intervention area where dogs were collared and a control area where conventional measures were applied. Dogs were tested for the disease at the beginning and end of the study and every 7-8 months in between. Dogs in the intervention area that tested positive received new collars and those that tested negative were included. Authorities were notified of positive dogs in both areas, which were euthanized as per Brazilian law. Initially, seroprevalence was similar in both areas, but at the second evaluation, a significant reduction was seen in both areas, with 6.0% in the intervention and 11.0% in control. The intervention showed a 55% protection against the disease. Although incidence didn't differ between areas, an increase was seen in control, possibly due to low seroconversion or loss to follow-up. The study suggests deltamrin-impregnated collars may provide protection over time, but its effectiveness as a public health measure was inconclusive.
Researchers investigated why the mammalian X chromosome has a non-random gene content, with some genes being highly expressed and others not. They proposed that this bias may be due to limitations on gene expression caused by the X being haploid, meaning it has only one copy. They tested this idea using data from the Encyclopedia of DNA (ENCODE) and Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANT5) projects. The results showed that genes on the X chromosome have lower maximal expression levels than those on autosomes, with an average of three times lower. Genes on the X also have less increase in expression compared to their autosomal counterparts in the human-chimpanzee common ancestor. The "traffic jam" model explains why genes on the X have lower breadth of expression and why highly expressed genes are rare on the X but broadly expressed on autos. Tissue-specific genes are also rare on the X and tend to be low expressed, indicating the trend is due to maximal level not breadth. A limit on maximal expression explains biased tissue profiles of X-linked genes. Tissues with highly expressed genes (e.g. secretory, structural) are also have low expression on X. This cannot be fully explained by other models of biased expression. The idea that X is hard to highly express due to transcription jams provides a simple explanation for X's gene content, expression, and evolution.
A recent study investigated the prevalence and population structure of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori in the Baka Pygmies, a subgroup of the Pygmy people in Cameroon. The researchers found that the Baka had a significantly lower infection rate of H. pylori (20.8%) compared to their neighboring agriculturalist non-Baka (80.2%). Multilocus haplotypes were generated for each H. pyl isolate, but no Baka-specific lineages were identified, and most isolates were assigned to the hpAfrica or hpAfrica populations. The hpAfrica population, associated with the Nilo-Saharan language family, was divided into East and West African subpopulations, and a new hp1 subpopulation was identified among Cameroonians, supporting the expansion of Bantu languages. An age-structured model showed that the low H. pyl prevalence among Baka is achievable within a few hundred years, suggesting demographic factors like small population size and low life expectancy led to eradication of H. pyl from individual populations. The Baka were either H. pyl-free or lost their lineages during demographic fluctuations. Coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference showed Baka acquired extant H. pyl through contact with agricultural neighbors.
Dengue virus NS5 is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in capping and replication of the virus genome, as well as interacting with host proteins to modulate immune responses. Unlike other flaviviruses, DENV2 NS localizes to the nucleus during infection, but its role in replication and pathogenesis is unclear. Researchers studied NS of DENV1 and 2, which differ in nuclear localization, using a combination of functional and structural analyses. They found that the C-terminal 18 amino acids (C18) of NS direct the protein to cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively. A low-mic affinity between C18 and nuclear receptor importin-alpha (Imp) allowed the complex to be purified and visualized at 2.2 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography. Structure-guided mutational analysis revealed important residues for NS subcell localization. Notably, a proline 884 allows Imp binding, and mutating it to threonine, present in D1 NS, results in mislocalization to cytoplasm without compromising virus fitness. In contrast, mutating arginine 888, conserved in all flaviviruses, to alanine results in non-viable virus, while R888 mutation leads to severely attenuated phenotype, though NS is in nucleus. R forms hydrogen bond with Y conserved in alliviruses, suggesting evolutionarily conserved function for C18, possibly in RNA interactions critical for replication, independent of subcell localization.
Researchers have developed a new method for mapping neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that can be used by health ministries in endemic countries to determine if a threshold for public health interventions has been reached. The Integrated Mapping (IT) Methodology combines data for lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and is designed to be efficient and practical. It uses World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators for each disease in specific age groups. The study tested the protocol by comparing it to current mapping methods for each disease in one district in Mali and Senegal. Results showed that IT reached the same conclusions as WHO regarding public interventions for trach, LF, and STH but resulted in more targeted recommendations for schosiasis. The methodology was feasible and cost-effective compared to standard, non-integrated WHO methods. This integrated tool can facilitate implementation in endemic countries. 

The IT methodology determines if a disease has reached threshold for public health intervention by balancing epidemiologic rigor and practicality. It does not provide prevalence figures but aims to determine if a threshold has been reached. The approach is logistically practical, cost-efficient and flexible. For schosiasis, the approach results in more targeted interventions compared to district-level implementation by integrated NTD programs. The protocol uses age-specific indicators as recommended by WHO.
In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the phosphatase C14 is required for exit from mitosis and is anchored to nucleolar chromatin by the C1/Net protein until anaphase, when it is released into the nucleoplasm. Two pathways, FEAR and MEN, promote C14 release, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Researchers found that ubiquitination of histone H2 by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase is necessary for C14 release from nucleolar chrom when MEN is inactivated. This process is mediated by histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79, but not histone deacetylase HD2, which associates with C14 onolar chrom as part of RENT. Defects in C14 release were also seen in cells lacking H3 lys 36 methylation and in cells with HD recruited by this modification. These histone modifications are new factors for FEAR components to act on nucleolar chrom. This contrasts with the idea that histone marks act in a combinator code for biological processes.
Researchers have developed a new computational method called GeneProgram to identify groups of genes that work together to perform specific functions in the human body. This method, based on a mathematical concept called Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, addresses challenges in analyzing large datasets of gene expression data, such as differences in cell types and genetic variations across samples. GeneProgram organizes genes and tissues into overlapping groups with consistent behavior, producing maps of expression programs sorted by generality scores that automatically. Using synthetic and real data, Gene outperformed popular analysis methods. The researchers applied Gene to a dataset of 62 time-series gene expression, studying human responses to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. Gene produced a map of 104 expression programs, many of which were enriched for genes in key pathways and bound by NF-κ transcription factors. Gene also discovered programs implicating surprising pathways, such as Wnt and neurotransmitter receptors, in response to infection. The researchers believe this map will guide future experiments, with genes of low generality as potential targets and high generality maintaining common responses in disease states. Gene is a general method for large data and can be applied to new biological datasets.
Researchers have found that a specific type of immune cell, called NKGChi NK cells, plays a crucial role in fighting off cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. These cells produce interferon (IF-γ), a protein that helps fight off the virus. Similar to memory T cells, NKGChi cells can remember past infections and respond quickly to future threats. However, the mechanisms behind this memory-like behavior were not fully understood. The study found that NKGChi cells in people with CMV infection have a specific epigenetic mark on the IF locus, a region that controls IF-γ production. This mark, called CNS1, is also found in memory T cells and helps them produce IF-γ when triggered. The researchers showed that CNS is essential for NKG cells to produce IFγ in response to CMV. This epigenetic mark is a key mechanism for NKG cells to remember CMV and produce IFγ, providing a basis for their memory-like behavior.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Legionella pneumophila regulates its effectors within host cells. An effector proteins are molecules secreted by the bacterium to manipulate host cellular processes for infection. Temporal regulation of these effectors is crucial for distinct activities at different stages of infection. The study found a protein, Lub, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, hijacks the host proteome to target another effector, Sid, for degradation. Delayed delivery of Lub to the cytoplasm leads to shutdown of Sid at later stages of infection. This shows a sophisticated co-evolution between host and bacterium involving an effector as a key regulator of cognate effector function.

LubX acts as a negative regulator of Sid within host cells, the first example of an effector targeting a cognate eff within host. The researchers propose "metaeffector" for this class of bacterial effectors. Determinants of susceptibility are encoded in effectors themselves. Sid is an intrinsically stable within host, but Lub controls instability by targeting for ubiquination. Lub is a metaeff, regulating another eff within host. The targets of E ligases are largely unknown, previous studies aimed at host proteins. Sid is a target of bacterial E ligase. Future studies will reveal effectors implicated in ubiqu system functions as metaeff coordinating expression spatiemporally.

The role of Lub at late infection stages is unclear. Host kinase Cl1 is a substrate of Lub. With findings, one explanation is Lub has multiple targets including Sid and Cl. Accumulating evidence eff proteins as E ubiquinases are prevalent among pathogens.
Researchers studied the genetic changes that occur in the HIV virus when it first infects a new host. They analyzed data from 81 individuals who were infected with a single or closely related viruses and found that some parts of the virus's genetic code changed more quickly than expected. This rapid change could be due to the virus adapting to the host's immune system or reverting to a less fit form that was previously selected out by the immune system. The team identified 24 sites that changed rapidly and found that 14 were in areas targeted by the immune system's T-cells or in specific to the host's HLA. Some of these sites were also changed due to a process called APOB, which helps the virus escape the immune system. Ten sites couldn't be explained by immune escape or APO, including one in the fusion protein gp41. The study also looked at insertions and deletions in the virus and found that changes in the envelope protein's variable region were due to selection, not random mutations. This research provides insight into how HIV evolves when it first infects a new host, highlighting the role of immune escape and APO in shaping the virus's evolution.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how epigenetic silencing works in yeast, focusing on two key chromatin marks: H4 acetylation and H3 methylation. They found that having both modifications is crucial for the stability of epigen states. The model shows that under certain conditions, chromatin can have both active and silenced marks, a state called bivalent. This bivalent state is stable under perturbations like mutations or changes in enzymatic activity. The researchers also found that a limited supply of silencing proteins can lead to counterintuitive responses. They investigated the design of the silencing system and compared it to experimental observations, including the role of Sir protein, spreading, and stability of silenced regions in mutants like Sas2 and Dot1. The model can be extended to include other silencing and active marks, like methylation, to understand which marks are essential for epigen fate and which reinforce one over another. The model captures mechanisms of cooperativity at the molecular level in yeast silencing, including histone modification and protein interactions. Active chromatin sites are not only acetylated but also hypermethylated at certain residues. One protein, Dot, methylates H79 and competes with Sir for the same patch on histone region. The co-occurrence of sil and active marks, called bivalent chromatin, has been discussed in Poly silencing and HP binding. The model shows how bivalent states emerge from known interactions.
Researchers in Uganda studied the gut microbiota (GM) of children hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) to see if it differed between those with edemat and non-edemat forms of the condition. Edemat malnutrition, also known as kwashiork, is the most severe form of SAM. The study included 87 children aged 6-24 months, with 62% suffering from edemat malnutrition and 66% being boys with a mean age of 16.1 months. Fecal samples were collected at admission, DNA extracted, and analyzed by PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Results showed GM differed between the two groups, with non-edemat children having lower diversity. However, beta diversity analysis did not reveal differences between GM of edemat and non-ed SAM. The study suggests non-ed SAM children have lower GM diversity, but no clear compositional differences were found. A link between GM and malnutrition has been reported, with pathogenic bacteria found in malnour children. Transplanting fecal samples from Malian twins with edemat malnutrition into mice showed a direct relationship. GM dysbiosis is associated with malnutrition, but if GM differs between ed and non-ed SAM is unknown. The study's finding of GM diversity differences justifies further research on therapeutic strategies.
Researchers studied the variation in telomere length in 112 wild yeast isolates of Saccharomyces sensu stricto. They found significant variation in telere length among the isolates, with European strains having extremely short telomeres (less than 150 bp) and American isolates having telom approximately three times longer (over 400 bp). Inserting a URA gene near telom allowed analysis of individual telere lengths and telomere effect (TE). Crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telere lengths consistent with multiple quantitative loci (QTL) involved in length. Variation in TE is quantitative but weakly correlated with telere length. Genotyping F1 segregants indicated several QTL associated with telere length and silencing. These QTL include candidate genes but also map to regions with no known telom properties. Transgressive segregation was detected for both phenotypes, validated by reciprocal hemizosity that YU80 and TLC are telere QTL in two S paradox subpopulations. Sequence divergence within Ku80 generates negative epistasis in allelic combinations (American-YU and EuropeanU) resulting in short telomeres.
Researchers have long sought to understand the cognitive and neural processes behind human decision-making by predicting when and how people choose. Sequential sampling models (SSMs) have advanced the field by assuming decisions emerge from a bounded accumulation process, making response times (RTs) predictable. However, these models fail when people are not forced to respond immediately but allowed to sample information sequentially, as the decision-maker may choose to delay and terminate the process, a scenario not accounted for by standard SS. A new SS was developed to predict RTs from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, where participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues, free to respond at any time. Standard SS did not describe RT distributions, but adding a mechanism for postponing decisions to the model obtained an accurate fit. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-frequencies (14-30Hz), indicating responses prepared and inhibited, supporting a decision to not decide. The model also accounted for results of an adapted paradigm where participants pressed a button for more information. Results show computational modeling decisions and RT support understanding hidden dynamics in cognition.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in the SUVH2 gene as the cause of hereditary nasal parakerosis (HN) in Labrador Retrievers, a rare skin disorder causing crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. A genome-wide association study of 13 HN cases and 23 controls found a strong association on chromosome 2. Resequencing of one case's genome revealed 3 non-synonymous variants in the SUVH gene, with one perfectly associated with HN in a cohort of 500 dogs. The candidate variant is a missense in SUVH, a histone lysine 9 (H3) methyltransferase, mediating chromatin silencing. The variant c.972G>T changes a conserved asparagine to lysine in the catalytically active domain. Histopathological studies suggest HN is not due to hyperproliferation but delayed differentiation of kerocytes. SUVH is involved in epetic regulation of kerocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and sealing of mammalian epidermis.
Researchers studied how the mixing of avian and swine influenza viruses in pigs can lead to the creation of new, potentially pandemic-causing strains. They found that when pigs are infected with both avian and swine viruses, genetic mixing occurs in the lower respiratory tract, and the type of virus that is shed from the pig is influenced by the type of cells in the respiratory tract. The study showed that pigs can serve as a "mixing vessel" for avian and swine viruses, which can then be transmitted to humans. By housing pigs infected with both avian and swine viruses, the researchers found 30 different types of reassortant viruses in the lower respiratory tract, but only a few were shed. The type of virus shed was influenced by its ability to replicate in pig nasal cells at 33°C. The study suggests that tissue tropism, or the type of cells in the respiratory tract, plays a key role in selecting which reassortant virus is shed.
A study investigated the effect of maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and prazantel treatment during pregnancy on Schistoma mans infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five. Offspring of Schistoma-infected women in endemic areas may be sensitized in utero, which may influence their immune responsiveness to Schoma infection and associated morbidity. The study examined the effects of prazant treatment of S mans during pregnancy on the risk of S infection among offspring and their immune responses when exposed to S. In a trial in Uganda, offspring of women treated with prant or placebo during pregnancy were examined for S infection and cytokine and antibody responses to SW and SEA, as well as T cell expression FoxP at five years. Of 134 children, 2.4% had S infection at five years based on a single sample. Infection did not differ between children of treated or untreated mothers. Cytokine IFγ, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 and antibody IgG, Ig and IgE responses to SW and SEA, and FoxP expression were higher among infected than uninfected. Prazant treatment S during pregnancy had no effect on responses, except IL-10 to SW which was higher in offspring of women who received prazant than those who did. No evidence found that S mans infection and treatment during pregnancy influence prevalence and intensity S infection or immune response among offspring at five, but observed on IL-10 to SW suggest that S and treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoreg responsiveness in schosomias.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the body's immune cells, called macrophages, can quickly get rid of infectious material. Normally, macrophages use a process called phagocytosis to take in and destroy pathogens, but this process is slow. The scientists found that when macrophages are activated by inflammation, they switch to a faster process called macinocytosis, which allows them to quickly transfer material to lysosomes for destruction. This switch is controlled by a protein called coronin 1, which is activated by a chemical signal. When coron 1 is activated, it turns on an enzyme called PI-3-kinase, which is necessary for macinocytosis. Even without inflammation, expressing a special form of coron 1 can activate PI-3kinase and cause macocytosis. This means that macrophages can get rid of pathogens quickly and efficiently, which is important for the body's defense against infection.
Researchers conducted a study in Arua District, North Uganda to assess community acceptance of tset baits (insecticide-treated targets) in areas where they had not been used before. The study involved 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in 8 villages across the district. Results showed that villagers who had never seen baits before expressed fear and anxiety, associating them with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river", which are linked to illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers in areas where ba had been used previously had positive attitudes and were aware of their purpose and benefits. They reported similar negative perceptions when tset control started a decade ago. The study suggests acceptance varies between villages and is related to duration with tse programs. Success of community-based interventions against tse will depend on engagement and sensitization that reaches all communities, especially in new areas.

The study was conducted in an area of West Nile, North Uganda, where ba have been used in government programs against Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Community acceptance is crucial for effective tse control, as seen in a previous study in Democratic Republic of Congo where negative attitudes led to damage and failure. Efforts to enhance participation include encouraging people to handle ba, construction, deployment, and maintenance in countries like Uganda, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Sudan. In this area, 70 ba were deployed per year, but not regularly monitored, resulting in unsustainable control.

Sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei transmitted by tse, affects West and Central Africa, including the study area. Tse also transmit other species to livestock, causing losses. In H villages, no previous tse programs, ba were introduced as part of the study. 8 villages were included, 4 from H+ and 4 H-.
Researchers have studied the process of recombination in fruit flies (Drosophila melanaster) to understand how it affects evolution. Recombination is a key process that helps selection act on genetic variation in populations. However, previous studies have been limited due to lack of detailed information on recombination rates across and within species. This study mapped recombination in 5,860 female flies, genotyping 139 million SNPs and 106,964 recombination events at 2-kilobase resolution. They created whole-genome maps of recombination and variation among individuals. Results show recombination rates vary greatly at large and small scales. At large scales, recombination rates are highly variable and punctuated, with hotspots and coldspots. At small scales, recombination is associated with sequence motifs and occurs in transcript regions, suggesting chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. This study highlights the importance of considering recombination variation in population genetics and evolution.
Researchers have identified a protein called ID2 (ID2) that plays a crucial role in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in the plant Arabidopsis plant. To understand how ID2 works, they purified the protein and found that it associates with two similar proteins, ID1 and ID2, which are part of the same family as ID2. They discovered that a specific part of ID2, called the coiled coil, is necessary for ID2 to bind to itself, but not to ID1 or ID2. Another part of ID, the X domain, is required for ID to bind to ID1 and ID2. The researchers also found that ID1 is necessary for DNA methylation, RNA accumulation, and gene silencing, while ID2 has similar but not identical roles. Unlike ID, ID1 and ID2 cannot bind double-stranded RNA, suggesting their roles differ from ID in the ID-ID1-ID2 complex. ID1 and ID2 are essential for the complex to function in RDM.
Exposure to Leishmania braziliensis triggers neutrophil activation and apoptosis. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and are rapidly recruited to the site of Leishmanial inoculation. During Leish braziliensis infection, depletion of neutrophils significantly increases the parasite load, whereas co-culture of neutils with L braziliensis has an opposite effect. The co-culture of infected macrophages and neutils induced parasite killing, leading to the question of how neutils respond to L brazili exposure. This study focused on the interaction between neutils and Lili, exploring activation and apoptotic fate. Inoculation of serum-opsonized Lili promastigotes mice neutil accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro exposure of thioglyateelic inflammatory bone neutils to Lili modulated expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CD62, and induced oxidative burst. Using mCh-expressing Lili, effects were mainly observed in infected and bystander cells. Neutil activation with Lili was confirmed by release of TN-α and neutilase. Neutils with Lili displayed markers of early apoptosis. Lili induces neutil recruitment in vivo and neutils exposed to the parasite in vitro through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This may impact parasite elimination, particularly at early stages of infection.
Researchers explored the potential of vaccination as a supplementary control measure for bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle. Currently, vaccination is not used in international control programs and is banned in the EU. Candidate vaccines based on Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmet-Guerin (BCG) interfere with the tuberculin skin test, used to determine if herds and countries are TB-free. New tests, Differentiated Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIV), can introduce vaccination into existing eradication programs. Using herd models from Britain, they estimated the feasibility of supplemental vaccination. The economic impact of TB on farmers is dominated by testing costs and restrictions. Farmers will adopt vaccination if it reduces burden and restrictions. In Britain's testing sequence, the DIV test's specificity, not sensitivity, is the barrier to herd benefit. Relaxing testing could mitigate negative effects, but increase hidden infection in officially free herds. Models explored DIV characteristics for herd benefit. A 99.85% specificity and 40% sensitivity is required. Data from infected animals suggest a cocktail of DIV antigens can achieve 99.85% specificity and 73.3% sensitivity.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds called dihydrobenz[e][1,4]azin-2(3)-ones that show promise as a potential treatment for a parasitic worm infection called Trichuris. This worm infects around 500 million people worldwide, causing physical and educational problems. Current treatments are limited and not effective, making new options crucial. The researchers tested these compounds on a mouse model of the parasite, Truris, and found they paralyzed the adult worms and reduced the ability of eggs to infect a host. The most active compound, dihydrozoxazin O029, was as effective at 25-50 micromolar concentration, similar to existing treatments. Importantly, it showed low toxicity to mouse cells, indicating selectivity for the parasite. Developing a new treatment for a neglected disease is challenging, but dihydrozazones could be given orally or as a spray to interrupt the parasite lifecycle. These results show dihydroazones are a new class of treatment for Trichis, active against both egg and adult stages, with potential for further optimization to improve potency and pharmacokinetics for a clinical use.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of "date" and "party" hubs in protein-protein interaction networks, where "date" hubs have low expression with their partners and "party" hubs have high expression. They proposed that "party" hubs are local coordinators and "date" are global connectors. However, the study found that the importance of "date" hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small number of extremely central hubs, which do not display low expression, contradicting the idea of a link between quantity and function. The "date/party distinction was motivated by a bimodal distribution of hub-expression, but this feature is not robust to method changes. Topological properties of hubs do not correlate with expression, but there is a correlation between centrality and functional similarity of interacting proteins. The researchers suggest thinking in terms of "date/p dichotomy for protein networks is not meaningful, and it's more useful to consider roles of protein-protein interactions than individual proteins.
Researchers have developed methods to use whole-genome sequence data to track the spread of infectious diseases, but a major limitation is the need for genetic diversity to occur on a timescale of outbreaks. This means that only if mutations have accumulated between pathogen genomes can be used to determine the position of individuals in a transmission tree. To compare the usefulness of genetic data in different outbreaks, the concept of "transmission" was introduced, defined as the number of mutations between sequences from transmission pairs. Using literature values, simulations were run with two models to describe the transmission of major pathogens. Results showed that mean transmission varies between pathogens, but is generally low, with many outbreaks having many genetically identical pairs. This limits the ability to reconstruct outbreaks using genetic data, especially for pathogens like Streptoccus, Shigella, and Clostrid, which provide little to no information on individual events. The study highlights the limitations of genetic data in certain scenarios and the need to expand tools to include other types of data.
Researchers studied how genes on the X chromosome that escape inactivation, a process that silences most genes on the X chromosome in female mammals, in mouse tissues and cells. They used single nucleotide polymorphisms to distinguish between alleles and analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes. The study found a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X chromosome, with few genes escaping in most tissues, about 3-7%. However, in embryonic-kid-derived Pki cells, a higher number of genes escaped, 21%, representing both kidney-specific and cell-specific genes. Allele RNA polymerase occupancy and DNase hypersensitivity at gene promoters correlated with escape levels, indicating open chromatin structure. CTCF binding on the inactive X was denser in brain compared to Pki cells, possibly due to compartmentalized structure and fewer escape genes in brain.

The study identified genes expressed from both X chromosomes in mouse tissues, with a minority escaping in tissue and cell-specific manner, indicating tight control of X and escape. The probability of bi-allelic versus mono-allelic expression was calculated using a new algorithm. Surveys in human/mouse cells showed 8-15% consistently escape, 10-13 variable, and 10-20 varying between lines and individuals. Escape from X results in sexual dimorphisms and bi-alle expression of some genes is important for normal female phenotype. Mouse 3-7 genes may be exceptional compared to other mammals with similar human patterns.

Escape genes were distributed along the X, not influenced by distance from the X center, and play roles in regulation and translation, explaining consistent escape. Tissue-specific genes will help understanding sex differences.
Researchers have identified a new cystine protease in the parasite Plasium viv, a type of malaria that causes hundreds of millions of illnesses and deaths worldwide. This protease, called VX-4, has unique properties that allow it to break down different proteins at different pH levels. It is most active at acidic pH 5.5, where it breaks down a protein called Z-Arg-MCA, and at neutral pH 6.5-7.5, it breaks Z-Arg-MCA. VX-4 prefers positively charged amino acids at the first position and less specificity at third and fourth positions. Three amino acids in its pocket are different from similar proteases VX-2 and VX-3. Replacing one of these amino acids, Glu180, abolishes activity at neutral pH. VX-4 is found in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocyte stage of P. viv. It breaks actin at neutral pH and P. viv plasm 4 and hemoglobin at acidic pH. VX-4 shows pH-dependent switching, allowing it to break different substrates in different environments. It might break hemoglobin in acidic foodu, P viv plasm 4 at neutral or acidic, and cytoskeleton in erythrocyte cytol.
Scientists have created a new model to better understand how a type of microbe called Clostridium ljungahli works. This microbe can turn many different substances into useful products, making it a good candidate for sustainable production of chemicals. However, understanding its biology was limited, making it hard to design new strategies. The new model, called iL965ME, includes all major pathways for making proteins, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, and vitamins, as well as RNA and protein synthesis. It's the first for a Gram-positive bacterium and broadens predictability. The model shows how protein and media composition affect metabolism and energy in this microbe, and predicts multiple products like glycerol, a new product for this microbe. It also shows how changing metal availability affects secretion, opening up new ways to optimize fermentation and understand proteome and carbon flux.

The model includes all major metabolic, amino, acid, nucleotide, lipid, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as RNA and protein synthesis necessary for reactions. It also includes cofactors and mechanisms for energy conservation. The model predicts secretion of acetate, ethanol, and glycer during carbon and metal availability, and how protein and media influence metabolic and energy in this microbe. Enzyme rates were approximated due to lack of data, set to 25s-1, average of acetogens. Macromolecular costs were coupled with reactions using COBrame formulation.
Researchers used a panel of human osteoblast cells (HO) to study the genetic control of transcript variation in these cells, similar to previous studies in lymphoblast cell lines (Ls). They found that HO and Ls have distinct gene expression profiles, with some genes specific to each cell type. By analyzing genetic variants, they found that expression of certain transcript forms in HO is controlled by genetic variants, both in a tissue-specific and tissue-independent way. These associations were confirmed by RT-PCR. The study suggests that multiple transcript forms are present in both tissues and genetic can affect the expression of one form over another, rather than an all-or-no effect. Examination of top SNPs from genome-wide association studies of bone density showed overlap with this study's associations, including the FAM118 gene, which was tested in additional studies revealing a novel transcript variant. This approach to examining transcript variation in multiple tissues is useful for detecting common genetic variation between cell types and identifying cell-specific variants that may be functionally important, a next step for genome-wide association studies.
Researchers studied the yeast Saccharomyces eayan, a parent of the lager-brew hybrid Saccharcesorian, to understand why it can't use maltotose, a key sugar in brewer's wort. Unlike most Saccharces cerevisiae and Saccharorian strains, Sacchar eayan can't use maltose because it lacks a maltose transporter gene. However, it has genes that help it use maltose, a similar sugar. To see if Sac eayan can use maltose, scientists made mutants that can't use maltose and grew them on maltose-rich wort. One mutant grew well and fermented maltose and maltose. Genome analysis showed a new maltose transporter gene, made from pieces of other genes. This new gene works like the original maltose transporters and lets Sac eayan grow on maltose. The new gene's structure is similar to Sacorian's maltose transporter, which is similar to cerevisiae and eayan maltose transporters. This suggests that Sacorian's ability to use maltose may have come from similar changes as seen in this study.
Researchers have found a link between the severity of influenza virus strains and how different they are from previous strains of the same type. This relationship helps predict how many deaths a new strain will cause. They developed a method to quickly estimate the impact of new influenza A H1N virus by measuring how different it is from previous H1 strains. This can help create a cost-effective plan to prevent and control the spread of the virus. The study used a simplified model of how the virus interacts with the host to find the connection between antigen variation and mortality. The model only considered strains that cause significant infection in humans, denoted as "antigen strains". The method, called EAD, predicted antigen distance with high accuracy and was tested on H1 virus. Results showed a strong correlation between predicted distance and observed mortality. The method can be used to estimate mortality of future H1 variants and with modification for H2 and B viruses.
Researchers have identified a small cysteine-rich protein, called PEC23, from the Asian soybean fungus Phakora pachyri, that suppresses plant immunity. This fungus causes severe disease in soybeans and its mechanisms of interaction with the plant are not well understood. PEC23 interacts with a soybean transcription factor, GSP12, which is a negative regulator of plant defenses. When GSP12 is silenced, soybeans have constitutively active immunity. The study suggests P23 is a virulence factor that suppresses plant immune responses and interacts with GSP12. P23 has a unique tandem cystine motif found in other rust fungi and interacts with GSP12. Silencing G12 shows it is a negative regulator of plant defense. Infection assays on G12-silenced and P23-silenced soybeans showed no change in disease phenotype, possibly due to redundancy of P. pachy effector proteins. Data show G12 acts as an immune suppressor to ensure plant growth in absence of infection.
Researchers have identified the EphA receptor, a protein on the surface of host cells, as a key player in the invasion and replication of the bacterium Chlamydia trachatis. This bacterium invades host cells and replicates inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion, where multiple host proteins are recruited to support its development. The researchers found that EphA activates a signaling pathway called PI3, which is necessary for the bacterium's replication. Interfering with EphA's binding to the bacter or downregulating its expression significantly reduced infection. The bacter interacts with Eph on the cell surface, internalizing it, and during replication, Eph remains active around the inclusion, interacting with a PIK subunit to activate the PI/Akt pathway. Overexpressing EphA, but not a mutant form lacking the intracellular domain, enhanced PI activation and infection. Despite depleting Eph from the surface, the bacter upregulates it through the ER pathway, keeping infected cells resistant to apoptosis. The study shows Eph is a receptor for invasion and intracellular signaling, a new mechanism by which Chydia subverts host cells and induces resistance.
Researchers have long known that neurons have voltage-gated ion channels in their dendrites, which can make them excitable. However, the role of this excitability in dendritic computation has remained unclear. A new study shows that the output of a model of an active dendritic tree is a highly non-linear function of afferent rate, with a dynamic range of over 50 decibels. This is similar to the double-sigmoid response observed in retinal ganglion cells. The researchers propose that the enhancement of dynamic range is the primary role of active dendritic conductances. They predict that neurons with larger dendritic trees will have a larger dynamic range and blocking active conductances will decrease it.

The study aims to examine the possibility that dendrites are the site of computation. Dendritic spikes are a result of excitable dynamics, but even without plasticity, dendrites can benefit from active conductances for increased range. Neurons have extensive dendritic trees, and much work has been done on their morphology and dynamics. The presence of active channels in dendrites was discovered recently.

The researchers propose that large dendrites amplify weak signals and saturate strong activity. This "dynamic range" problem is a trade-off between sensitivity and saturation, important for neurons, networks, organs, and organisms. The study suggests that under synaptic bombardment, dendritic spikes are responsible for a new prediction: the transfer function is not Hill-like, but double-sigmoid, as seen in retinal ganglion cells.
Researchers studied how to improve the accuracy of models that infer gene regulation from time-series data. Current methods assume mRNA levels represent protein concentrations and changes in gene expression are due to transcription factors, neglecting other effects. They investigated this bias using a combination of models and experiments on the Fli-FlM module in E. coli. coli. They measured gene activity in real-time and estimated protein concentrations and physiological effects using kinetic models. Results show correcting assumptions improves model quality, especially for systems with long protein half-lives and varying expression machinery activity. The approach is applicable to learn regulatory networks from time-series data. In the Fli-FlM module, results highlight global effects and regulation of Fli and FlM halfives for promoter dynamics.

They proposed controls for transcript experiments, constitutively-expressed genes and models to reconstruct protein concentrations and integrate physiological effects. Measuring global effects with a reporter driven constitutive promoter only marginally improved model fit. They estimated Fli and FlM concentrations from promoter activities and plausible halfives, creating a dataset to test mRNA and protein influences on inference. They inferred regulatory and quantitative function of Fli-dependent gene, not regulated by other factors. Estimating protein concentrations from promoter activities and halfives improved inference of interactions and regulation. A model with Fli and FlM as regulators and expression activity is compatible with data. Reconstructing concentrations and quantifying physiological effects have been proposed before, such as for E. coli genes in arginine biosynthesis.
Researchers studied the spatial and temporal distribution of Oligyomys fulcens, a rodent species that carries diseases, in the Agua Buena region of Panama. They analyzed data from a 4-year study of rodent populations in the area, from April 2006 to December 2009, using spatial and statistical methods. The study area was 6.43 square kilometers, with a 0.09 kilometer grid size. The researchers found that O. fulcens populations varied in density and dispersion across seasons and years. The species was absent in late transitional months and re-established in subsequent years. Populations recurred in the same area in first three years, but shifted south in the final year. Spatial analysis showed local populations were about 300-600 meters apart, with sharp borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats. O. fulens showed a changing pattern over time, with shifting hotspots of abundance. This was linked to seasonality and human activities, such as agriculture. These factors define the occurrence, timing, and duration of rodent populations affected by humans, and possible human exposure. The study provides a detailed spatio-temporal analysis of hotspots of rodent habitation and persistence. It highlights the challenges in predicting zoon disease outbreaks at population level, as populations fluctuate over time and are geographically restricted.
Researchers have developed a new method to understand how genetic changes in the influenza A (H3) virus affect its ability to evade the human immune system. This is crucial for creating effective vaccines. The method, called "antigenic tree," assigns weights to each change in the virus's surface protein to show its impact on the immune system. It was tested on data from 1968 to 2003 and found known and new sites that affect the virus's ability to evade the immune system. The technique can be used for other viruses and systems with genetic and phenotypic data.

The method was applied to the major protein of the influenza A (3) virus over 35 years. Branches on the tree represent antigen distances from human viruses and a maximum likelihood of the protein. The impact of amino acid changes on the virus's ability to evade the immune can be determined by experiments, but the new method is faster and less expensive. It uses least squares optimization to fit distances onto a tree for the antigen.

The method was tested on data from 196 to 200 and found areas of the tree corresponding to known antigen types and transitions. It identified isolates with large impact that need to be updated in vaccines. The method is not limited to influenza and can be used for any system with genetic and phenotypic data.
Researchers conducted a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify host factors required for human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infection. They found that a cluster of mitotic genes, or genes involved in cell division, were necessary for the virus to enter the cell's nucleus. The study revealed a new mechanism for how the virus's DNA (vDNA) enters the nucleus: it relies on the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during cell division. In interphase, the virus is engulfed, routed to the perinuclear area, and uncoated, but the DNA fails to enter the nucleus. Upon nuclear envelope breakdown in interphase, HPV infection occurs. During mitosis, the DNA associates with host chromatin on the metaphase plate. The researchers propose that HPV requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis to access the DNA to the nucleoplasm. The study highlights the value of RNA screens in investigating viral infections and provides a resource for future virus-host interaction studies.
Black Sigat or black streak disease, caused by the Dothideomyc fungus Pseudococospora fiji (previously Mycoserella fiji), is a major threat to global banana production. The disease requires frequent fungicide applications, which increase economic and environmental costs, and lead to rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains. To combat this, two strains of P. fiji were sequenced and assembled with a new genetic map. The 74b genome of P. fiji is expanded by LTR transposons, making it the largest in Dothomycetes. Electrophoretic karyotyping and molecular markers showed chromosome polymorphisms and genetic diversity. Genetic differentiation was detected using neutral markers, suggesting selection and limited gene flow. Frequencies of fungicide in treated plantations were higher than untreated P. fiji populations. A homologue of Cladospor fulum Avr effector Pf4 was identified in P. fiji genome. Infiltration of Pf4 into leaves of resistant banana variety Calcut 4 resulted in hypersensitive response, suggesting Cal 4 carries unknown gene recognizing Pf4. The P. fiji genome will aid in fungicide treatment and banana breeding programs.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how specific genes are turned on or off in different species by tracing the evolution of binding sites where proteins attach to DNA. This approach, called the "birth-death model," doesn't rely on comparing DNA sequences between species, but instead looks at when and how often these sites appear in a lineage. The team applied this method to six transcription factors in humans and mice, finding that about 58-79% of their binding sites in humans appeared after they diverged from mice. Over 15% of these sites are unique to humans and are near genes involved in specific pathways, with more genetic variations than older sites. This suggests the method can identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and their role in gene regulation variation across species. Unlike previous approaches, this method uses lineage-specific sites, not just conserved ones, and doesn't rely on cross-species alignments, which can be inaccurate, especially in non-coding regions. The team used ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors, chosen for their diverse functions and well-documented motifs, and availability in human and mouse cell types. The results show lineage differences in evolutionary rates of motifs along a branch in the phylogeny. This study supports the method's ability to identify lineage-specific elements, a step towards understanding regulatory evolution's role in gene variation.
Researchers studied how light affects the circadian clock in zebraf, a vertebrate model that responds to light in most of its tissues. They found that light induces expression of certain genes, including clock genes, in zraf cells in vivo and vitro. However, the mechanism linking light to gene expression was unclear. To understand this, they focused on how light regulates the zraf period2 (per) gene. Using transgenic fish and stably transfected cell-based assays, they defined a Light Module (LRM) within the per promoter. The LRM is necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian regulation. Curiously, the LRM is conserved in vertebrate per genes, even in species lacking light-sensitive clocks. They also found that human LRM can substitute zraf LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zraf cells. The LRM contains E and D-box elements, critical for its function. E-box directs circadian regulation by mediating BMAL/C activity, while D-box drives light expression. The zraf homolog of thyroid embryonic factor binds to L-box and transactivates expression. They showed that mRNA levels are light-inducible and knockdown attenuates light transcription from per promoter in vivo. Their results support a model where light-dependent crosstalk between E and D-box factors determines per expression. This extends understanding of how light entrains the clock and regulates gene expression in vertebrates.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called coronin plays a crucial role in the motility of Plasmodium sporites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. These parasites need to migrate to penetrate tissue and enter host cells. Without coronin, the parasites show motility defects that impair colonization of the salivary glands but not migration in the skin, resulting in decreased transmission efficiency. The study found that extracellular ligands trigger intracellular calcium release followed by actin-dependent localization of coron to the rear of the gliding sporite, initiating motility. Mutational analysis and imaging suggest coron organizes actin filaments for motility. Using coronin-Cherry as a marker, the protein A kinase contributes to actin disassembly.

Coronin localizes to the periphery of sporites in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner and contributes to parasite motility through actin-binding. Parasites lacking coron frequently detach from the substrate and struggle to reattach, suggesting a function in adhesion formation. The study suggests an interplay between TR-family adhesins, actin filaments, and regulating adhesion for sporite migration. Act filaments are linked to transmembrane proteins with adhesive domains, including integrin-like domains, driving motility upon attachment.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism of resistance to a key drug used to treat leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. The drug, amphotin B, is crucial in reducing the global burden of this disease, but few other treatment options are available, making resistance a significant threat. Four lines of Leish mexicana were found to be resistant to amphotin, with altered sterol biosynthesis and sensitivity to pentidine. Genome sequencing revealed a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene ster C-desaturase in one line, but in three others, RNA sequencing showed loss of expression of ster C-methyltransferase (SMT), responsible for resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. MT is encoded by two genes with different expression levels, with reduced expression associated with loss of the 3 untranslated region of the dominant gene due to structural variations at the locus. Regions of homology between the genes and presence of SIDER retrotransposons promote these variations. In one case, loss of MT expression was not associated with loss of virulence in macrophages in vivo. Sequence instability in Leish genomes is known, but associated with a major antileman drug with no fitness costs is a concern.
Researchers investigated how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain. They used electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity in humans performing a visual task where they attended or ignored a stream of gratings with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable orientations. The results showed that surprising stimuli evoked responses were encoded as the difference between predicted and observed features, and attention facilitated this type of information in the brain. This supports a predictive coding theory that attention optimizes expectations by increasing the gain of prediction errors. The study found a significant effect of attention on mismatch responses to surprising but not unpredictable stimuli, starting 150ms after stimulus onset and reaching significance at 350ms. This demonstrates attention boosts prediction errors evoked by surprising stimuli, consistent with a predictive theory that attention optimizes precision by increasing gain of errors. The study aimed to determine what type of information is modulated in the interaction between attention and prediction. They used forward models to quantify selectivity for orientation and mismatch in responses to surprising and unpredictable stimuli in the oddball paradigm. The findings advance understanding of how attention and prediction modulate processing in the brain and support the theory that attention optimizes expectations by increasing gain of prediction.
Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite found in sub-Saharan Africa, is divided into three sub-species: T. b. brucei, T. rhodesense, and T. gambense. T. b. brucei cannot infect humans due to sensitivity to trypanolytic factors (TLF) in human serum, while T. rhodense and T. gambense are resistant. T. gambense has two sub-groups that differ genetically and in human resistance phenotypes. Group 1 T. gambense has an invariant phenotype, while group 2 shows variable resistance. Previous research suggested group 1 T. gambense is resistant to TLF due to reduced TLF uptake, mediated by reduced expression of the TLF receptor, the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HbHR) gene. This study investigates if this is true for group 2 parasites. Isogenic and sensitive group 2 T. gambense were compared to T. bruce parasites. Both resistant and sensitive lines express HHR at similar levels and internalize fluorescent labeled TLF like T. bruce. Both resistant and sensitive group 2, as well as group 1 T gambense, internalize recombinant AP1, but only sensitive 2 are lysed. Data indicate group 1 T gambense avoids TLF, but is resistant to main lytic AP1. Group 2 T gambense is innately resistant AP1, possibly due to same mechanism. However, group 2 Tense variably displays phenotype and does not correlate with HHR expression or expression. Differences in human resistance mechanisms exist between T gamb groups 1 and 2.
Researchers have investigated the role of DNA methylation in controlling HIV-1 latency. They found that methylation of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) is an epigenetic mechanism that prevents reactivation of latent HIV-1 and determines its stability. Methylation acts as a late event during latency establishment and is not required for initial provirus silencing. The study used an in vitro model of reactivable latency and latent HIV-1-infected patients to show that methylation of the HIV-1 5 LTR is an additional restriction that controls resistance to reactivation signals. In latent reservoirs of aviremic patients, high proportions of non-methylated 5 LTR were found. Latency controlled by transcriptional interference and chromatin mechanisms is leaky and easily reactivable. In latent HIV-1-infected individuals without detectable viremia, HIV promoters and enhancers were hypermethylated and resistant to reactivation. However, dense methylation of HIV-1 5 LTR did not confer complete resistance to reactivation with histone deacetylase inhibitors, protein C agonists, TN-α, and combinations with 5-aza-2deoxycytidine. The densely methylated promoter was efficiently reactivated in absence of T cell activation by suberlanide hydroamic acid.
Researchers have created a comprehensive catalog of genetic variations in the fruit fly Drosoph melanogaster, including single nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and structural variants. They used a new approach to identify over 3.6 million distinct variations, including 800,000 insertions, deletions, and complex variants up to 6,000 base pairs long. The study found that single nucleotide polymorphisms are more common near other types of variations, but are not caused by mutations or regions with high variation. Instead, the high density of single nucleotide polymorphisms is due to population processes. The researchers also studied how genetic variations affect gene expression in adult flies by mapping over 2,000 genes and found that insertions make up 10% of these variations and have larger effects than single nucleotide polymorphisms. They discovered more gene associations in males than females and that most variations are specific to each sex, showing a separation of genetic architecture between sexes and importance of factors mediating sex-based expression. Additionally, they analyzed RNA expression in offspring of sequenced lines and found that most variations can be validated in heterozygous individuals. The study expands the catalog of genetic variations in Dophila and provides insights into the complexity of gene expression regulation.
Researchers investigated how the relationship between the amplitude of the rectified electromyogram (EMG) signal and the neural drive to the muscle. The rectified EM signal is commonly used to estimate the neural drive to muscles, but its accuracy can be distorted by the overlap of motor unit potentials, or cancellation. The study used analytical and computational models to examine the impact of cancellation on the correlation between the rectified EM and neural drive. Results showed that the ideal rectified EM without cancellation (EMnc) is a better estimator of the neural drive than the actual rectified EM. Simulations confirmed this, with a strong correlation between EMnc and neural in the 1-30 Hz band at low cancellation levels (less than 40%) and contraction (less than 5% of maximum voluntary force). However, this correlation decreased with increasing cancellation (r=-0.83) at high levels (more than 60%) and contraction (more than 15%). Simulations also showed that stronger neural drive resulted in stronger correlation between rectified EM and neural, with cancellation mainly affecting low-frequency components (less than 5 Hz) of the drive. The study indicates that cancellation distorts the rectified EM signal, making its use as a valid estimator of neural drive limited to low levels and strong synaptic input to motor neurons.
Researchers have identified a key player in how plants respond to aluminum (Al) stress: a protein called YCCA, which regulates auxin production in the root tip of the plant. Auxin is necessary for root growth inhibition in response to Al stress, but the mechanism was unknown. YCCA, a flavin monooxygenase-like protein, upregulates auxin biosynthesis in the root transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. This leads to accumulation of auxin in the root tip and root growth inhibition during stress. The regulation of YCCAs in the root tip and root growth is dependent on ethylene signaling. Disrupting ethylene signaling either enhanced or reduced upregulation of YAs in the root tip in response to stress. Ethylene also enhanced root inhibition under Al was alleviated in Y mutants or co-treated with yucas, an inhibitor of Y activity, suggesting a role of YAs in this process. Eth-insensitive 3 (E3) is involved in regulation of Y9 transcription in this process. Furthermore, PHYTOCHROMEACTING FACTOR 4 (4) functions as a transcription activator for Y5/8. P4 promotes Al-inhibited root growth by regulating local expression of Ys and auxin in the root tip. Al-induced P4 in root acts downstream eth signaling. The study highlights a cascade for Y-regulated aux biosynthesis in root tip mediating growth response to stress.
Researchers have found that certain peptides from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can suppress the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in primates by binding to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, Mam-A*002, on the surface of infected cells. This interaction stabilizes the binding of Mam-A* to an inhibitory receptor, Mam-K3DL05, on NK cells, preventing them from killing the infected cells. Twenty-eight out of seventy-five SIV peptides bound to Mam-A002 suppressed the cytolytic activity of Mam3+ NK cells, including three immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes. Substitutions at the C-terminal end of inhibitory peptides changed them into disinhibitory, and vice versa, without altering binding to Mam002. The effects of these variants on NK cell responses corresponded to their effects on Mam002 tetramer binding Mam3. In mixtures of inhibitory and disinhib peptides, low concentrations of inhibitory dominated to suppress cell responses. Consistent with inhibition of Mam3 NK by epitopes presented by Mam002, SIV replication was higher in Mam002 CD4 lymphocytes co-cultured with Mam3 NK than Mam NK cells.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, a common cause of ear infections, adapts to changing environments. They found that when nutrients are scarce, the bacteria change in a way that helps them survive. This adaptation makes them better at colonizing the body and evading the immune system, leading to long-term persistence. In a model of ear infection, they saw that a strain with this adaptation caused less fluid buildup in the ear, a sign of disease resolution. However, it formed more communities inside ear cells than the original strain, suggesting a reservoir for future infection. This is the first look at how Haemophilus influenza adapts to limited nutrients and shows communities in a model of chronic infection.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Burkholderia pseudalle, which causes melioidosis, interacts with its host's iron levels during infection. Iron is crucial for bacterial growth and immune response modulation. The study found that B. pseudalle downregulates the host's iron exporter ferroin, making more iron available for the bacterium. Supplementing iron with ferric ammonium citrate increased bacterial growth, while iron chelator deferoxamine reduced it. Infected mice had lower ferroin expression, higher liver iron, and lower serum iron levels. Administering ferric ammonium citrate promoted bacterial growth and inflammation, while limiting iron availability improved clearance and survival. The study suggests B. pseudalle modulates iron balance to acquire iron and evade immune responses, promoting intracellular growth.
Researchers have developed a new technique called "functional mode analysis" to identify specific motions in proteins that contribute to their biological functions. Proteins often perform their functions through collective movements of atoms, but pinpointing which motions are linked to a particular function is challenging. The new method uses a set of protein structures and a "functional quantity" that measures the protein's state to detect the motion most related to the function. This quantity can be a geometric, electrical, chemical, or other variable relevant to the protein's function. The motion most likely to change the quantity is also estimated. Two measures are used: the Pearson coefficient for linear correlation and mutual information for any interdependence. This allows a model of the function in terms of a single coordinate. The technique was tested on several proteins, including polyalanine helix, T lysozyme, Trpase, and leucine-binding protein.
Researchers studied the order of intron removal from transcripts of the tubA and gap genes in Euglena gracilis, a single-celled eukaryote. These genes contain both conventional and nonconventional introns, a type of intron not found in other eukaryotes. Nonventional introns do not have the same borders or sequence as spliceosomal introns and form a stable secondary structure, but not like self-splicing tRNA introns. The study found that nonventional introns are removed before spliceosomal introns and that transcripts with conventional intr removed and nonventional present suggest a gap between the two types of splicing. This is the first time order of intr removal has been examined for genes with both types of intr.
Researchers studied the effects of Coxsackievirus B (CV) infection on the development of the heart in mice. CV is a common virus that causes mild fever in infants, but can lead to severe heart problems in some cases. The study looked at what happens when mice are infected with a mild dose of the virus at a young age and how it affects their hearts as adults. Mice infected with CVB showed no symptoms, but when put under stress, their hearts grew and became larger, a sign of heart failure. The virus infected a type of cell in the heart called cardiac progenitor cells, which are important for making new blood vessels. These cells were reduced in infected mice, making it harder for their hearts to adapt to stress. The study suggests that a mild CVB infection in young mice can lead to heart problems later in life.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Burkholderia pseudalle, which causes meloidosis, interacts with immune cells called macrophages. They found that the bacterium activates a protein called caspase-1, which leads to cell death, through a receptor called NLRC. However, at a later stage of infection, caspase-1 activation is not dependent on NLRC. The study identified a pathway involving casases-9 and PAR downstream of NLRC and casase-1. Macrophages without casase-1 showed increased apoptosis, dependent on other casases. The bacterium's flagellin and a protein TSS3 were found to play a role in casase-1 activation. Infection with a mutant bacterium lacking T3 showed reduced casase-1 activation, cell death, and IL-1 secretion. In mice infected with the mutant, bacterial loads were lower, and IL-1, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophils were reduced. The study suggests a major role for T3 in NLRC-mediated casase-1 activation and a contribution of casase-dependent and -independent death in Burkia infection.
Researchers studied the role of Arabidopsis Kβ, a subunit of the SNF1-related kinase complex, in pollen-stigma interactions during pollination. They found that Arabid Kβ is a cytoplasm and nucleus-localized protein in vegetative cells of pollen grains. Pollen from Arabid Kβ mutants could not germinate on the stigma, but germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed compromised hydration of mutant pollen on stigma. Adding water to stigma promoted germination of mutant in vivo, suggesting compromised hydration led to defective germination. Mutant pollen had destroyed mitochondria and peroxomes, and reduced numbers compared to wild type. Arabid Kβ mutants had reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pollen. Adding H2O2 in vitro partially compensated for reduced absorption, and overexpressing Arabid CATAL 3 resulted in compromised hydration on stigma. These results indicate Arabid Kβ regulates ROS by mediating biogenesis of mitochond and peroxomes, required for pollen-stigma interactions.

The study found defective biogenesis of mitochond and perox in Arabid pollen, resulting in compromised germination on stigma. A previous study showed homozygous knockout of Kβ in Arabid could not survive due to abnormal biogenesis. Pollen of mutants germinated vitro but not on stigma, from reduced ROS levels. This provides insights into pollen-stigma interactions. Most grains had normal morphology, but percentage with sunken surface decreased in kinγ mutants. Results confirm defective phenotype from Kβ mutation. Arabid Kβ is pollen-expressed. Mutations result in defective adhesion on stigmas. To determine hydration, evaluated in vitro and vivo hydration of wild and mutant grains. Pollen became rounded after 5 min hydration. Since adhesion and hydration required germination, examined adhesion on stigma.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the enzyme RNase III plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from the expression of toxin genes carried by two prophages, Skin and SP, through antisense RNA. Unlike in other organisms, where RNase is not essential, in B. subtilis, its presence is vital for survival. Researchers found that RNase degrades two toxin-encoding mRNAs, txA and yT, from Skin and SP prophages. Without these prophages or toxin mRNAs, deleting the RNase gene is possible and growth is unaffected. The role of RNase in B. subtil is not related to its function in RNA metabolism or ribosomal maturation, but rather in degrading double-stranded RNA. In B. subtil, trace amounts of 30S rRNA precursor are observed without RNase, indicating other enzymes complete rRNA maturation steps function without RN III. Microarray analysis of B. subtil strains without RNase shows minor contribution to antisense RNA stability. RNase has been involved in bacterial defense against phage DNA in other species and in eukaryotes in RNA interference and microRNA generation.
Researchers studied the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by the parasitic worm Brugia malayi, which causes lymphatic filariasis. They found that EVs are released by all stages of the worm's life cycle, including microfilar, L3, L4, adult, and female worms. The EVs are taken up by mouse macrophages with no preference for stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector molecule trafficking. Chemical inhibitors showed that all stages are internalized by phagocytosis. Proteomic analysis of adult and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the EV proteome, defining the biogenesis of Brug EVs and sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomod cargo. Ivermectin was found to rapidly inhibit EV release by all Brug life stages, also observed in the related worm Dirofilar imitis but not in iverect-unresponsive isolate, suggesting a mechanism for drug action and new platforms for anti-filar drug development.
A study was conducted in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands to determine the prevalence of scabies and impigo, two common and treatable skin conditions. Ten rural villages were included in the study, with 190 residents participating. The total prevalence of scabies was 19.2% and impigo 32.7. The highest prevalence of scabies was in infants under 1 year (34.1%) and children 1-4 years (25.7). Impigo was most common in children 1-4 years (42.6%). Scabies was associated with impigo, with 41.1% of imp cases also having scabies. The study found scabies and impigo are common in the Western Province, with scabies linked to impigo. Community strategies to control sc may reduce both conditions and their complications.
Researchers studied the relationship between immune cells and cell growth in the hippocampus, a part of the brain, in adult mice. They found a strong connection between the number of immune cells and growth in the hippocampus and the proportion of two types of immune cells, CD4 and CD8. This connection is due to genetic differences in the mice, not just abnormal conditions created in the lab. The study used a large group of mice with natural genetic variation, not just knockout mice with specific genes removed. The results show that immune cells play a bigger role in brain growth than thought before. 

The study found that genetic variations that affect cell growth in the hippocampus also affect the proportion of CD and CD8 cells. This is not just seen in lab-created conditions, but in natural variation between mice strains. Previous research suggested immune cells contribute to brain growth, but this study shows a stronger connection. Analysis of a large group of mice found a strong link between immune cells and growth in the hippocampus. Higher growth is linked to more CD cells and less CD cells, with a lower ratio. This accounts for 6% of variation. The connection is stronger than other traits.
Researchers have developed a vaccine, called TVac2, to protect against Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America and emerging in the US. They identified potential vaccine candidates by analyzing the Trypanosoma cruzi database and tested TVac in a mouse model. Mice were immunized with TVac and then infected with the parasite. The vaccine induced a strong antibody response and moderate lymphocyte proliferation. Upon infection, TVac-vaccinated mice had a strong antibody and CD8 T cell response with type 1 cytokines, controlling the parasite burden. In the chronic phase, antibody persisted and CD8 cells with type 1 cytokines subsided, and type 2 cytokines became dominant. TVac-vaccinated mice had no detectable parasite, inflammation, and fibrosis in heart and muscle. In contrast, mice with vector or cytokines only had a mixed response and persistent parasite burden. TVac-induced type 1 responses provided resistance to acute infection and prevented chronic immunology. This is the first report of a vaccine reducing parasite below detection in chronic animals. TVac included antigens were conserved among strains and expressed on parasite stages. Immunized mice had significant anti-parasitic responses. TVac is a promising approach.
Researchers used a machine-learning approach called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to assess the risk of developing type 1 diabetes (T1) based on genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). They tested this approach on three large datasets and found that it accurately predicted disease risk with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.84. In contrast, using only a few known susceptibility loci resulted in poor performance. The study suggests that using many genetic markers together can improve disease assessment. This approach may be feasible for diseases where a significant portion of risk is captured by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) arrays. The researchers used a dataset from the Affymrix genotyping platform and another from the Illumina genotyping platform, with 1,008 cases and 1,000 controls, and 1,529 cases and 1,458 controls, respectively. They also used a third dataset from the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes consortium, genotyped on the same platform as the first dataset. The Support Vector Machine algorithm achieved satisfactory performance when hundreds of SNPs were included in the model, while logistic regression did not. The model can take into account interactions between many markers and additional variables. The study shows that large amounts of data from GWAS can be used for understanding disease, including risk assessment with genetic profiles. Some false positives may arise, but the approach is robust with inclusion of non-contributing markers and established associated markers.
Researchers have studied how memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that provides protection against viral infections, behave in the skin during a secondary infection. They found that these cells can enter the skin without using a specific receptors that help them navigate to lymph nodes, called CD62. This is different from naive CD8 cells, which need these receptors to enter the skin. Memory CD8 cells provide protection against Vaccinia virus, a type of virus, by killing infected cells with a protein called granzyme B. After the virus is cleared, some memory CD8 cells become CD69+, a type of resident cell that stays in the skin and provides protection. This is different from effector memory CD8 cells, which do not become CD69+ and do not stay in the skin. The study shows that memory CD8 cells can quickly enter the skin and provide protection, and then become CD69+ residents to stay and protect against future infections.
Myosin VI, a minus-directed motor protein, plays a crucial role in enriching proteins on the surface of axons in neurons. Researchers engineered a non-neuronal protein to interact with Myos VI, causing it to become highly concentrated on the axonal surface in dissociated cortical neurons. Disrupting Myos VI function or expression leads to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. Myos VI mediates enrichment of proteins on axonal surface by stimulating dendrite endocytosis, a mechanism that underlies localization of many axonal proteins. A version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myos VI is concentrated on axonal surface of cortical neurons in vivo, suggesting a tool for probing circuit and function. Myins help shape polar distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins, necessary for proper electrical signaling.
Researchers have identified a gene called DmaD1 in the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna that plays a key role in determining male development in response to environmental cues. DmaD1 is similar to genes in insects, which are thought to be the sister group of crustaceans, but its regulation is different. Unlike insects, where the gene is sex-specifically regulated at the level of pre-mRNA splicing, Dma1 exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in transcript abundance. During embryogenesis,ma1 is only expressed in males and its transcripts are found in male structures. Knocking downma1 in males results in female traits, while ectopic expression in females results in male-like traits. Another gene,ma2, has similar expression patterns but silencing or overexpression does not induce changes. This establishesma1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype. The study reveals how environmental sex determination is implemented by selective expression of a conserved component in genetic sex determination. It suggests an ancient link between genetic and environmental sex determination.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine against genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), a common sexually transmitted infection that causes painful sores, neonatal herpes, and increases the risk of HIV transmission. The trivalent vaccine contains glycoproteins C, D, and E (g2, D, g2, E) to block virus entry and immune evasion. In rhes macaques, the vaccine induced plasma and mucosal antibodies that block immune activities and stimulated CD T cell responses. After vaginal challenge, a limited infection was detected in naïve, but not trivalent immunized macques. In guinea pigs, the vaccine was 97% and 99% efficacious in preventing lesions, outperforming g2 alone. Vaginal swabs showed reduced HSV-2 DNA and replication in all groups, with fewer days of shedding competent virus in trivalent than g2 immunized animals. The trivalent group had <1% genital lesions and 0.2% shedding competent virus. The vaccine has potential for preventing herpes in humans.
Researchers have developed a new method called Perm-se to map protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of the genome. These regions are difficult to study because short DNA sequences from these areas can map to multiple locations in the genome, leading to inaccurate results. Perm-se uses data from other experiments like DNase-se and histone ChIP-se to improve mapping accuracy. The method was tested on 64 ENCODE ChIP-se datasets from two cell types of cells and found many new protein-DNA interactions in segment duplications. These interactions are less conserved across species but share characteristics with non-repet regions. 

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed sequencing (ChIP-se) is a way to profile transcription factor and histone modifications. It generates millions of short reads. Mapping these to a reference genome is the first step in analysis. To study repetitive regions, a new method called Perm-se was developed. It uses DNase-se and histone Ch-se data to choose between multiple locations for each read. DNase-se finds open chromatin regions with transcription factor occupancy. Perm-se was tested on ENCODE Ch-se datasets and found many new protein-DNA targets in segment duplications. These interactions share chromatin signatures with nonpet regions. A model was created to use DNase priors and map reads from repetitive with high accuracy. Perm-se is versatile and can use multiple data like histone Ch-se.
Researchers conducted a study in Tanzania to investigate the relationship between schistosomiasis and HIV-1 infection. Schosomias affects 218 million people worldwide, mostly in Africa, and previous studies suggest that people with schosias may have a higher risk of HIV-1 acquisition and impaired ability to control HIV-1 replication once infected. The study found that women with schos infection had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition compared to those without, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.8 (1.2-6.6, p=0.019). In contrast, sch-infected men did not have an increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition. Additionally, the study found that HIV-1 RNA levels in post-serconversion blood in HIV- serconverters with schos were significantly higher than those without schos: 4.4 (3.9-4.6) log copies/mL versus 3.7 (3.2-4.3, p=0.017.017). This suggests that pre-existing schos infection increases the risk of HIV-1 in women and raises HIV-1 viral load at time of HIV-1 serconversion. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of schos on HIV-1 susceptibility and control and differentiate by gender.
Researchers have studied the number and sequence of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in human and mouse genomes, including those with cancer. They used a new method called droplet digital PCR to measure rDNA in normal and cancer cells. The results show that rDNA number and sequence can change in cancer. Contrary to expectations, human cancer cells often have fewer copies of rDNA, but with more variation in the number and sequence. This is associated with increased activity of a protein called mTOR, which is involved in cell growth and division. The protein PTEN, a tumor suppressor that regulates mTOR, is also plays a role in maintaining rDNA stability. In a mouse model of leukemia without PTEN, hematopoietic stem cells have fewer rDNA than normal cells, despite increased production of rRNA and protein. Loss of rDNA occurs early and is linked to increased sensitivity to DNA damage. This suggests that rDNA number may be a marker for cancer sensitivity to DNA-damaging treatments.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study how bacteria spread and die within the body during an infection. They used identical bacteria with different tags to track their movement and growth in mice. This allowed them to estimate how quickly bacteria die and multiply, and how the immune system controls them. The study found that shortly after infection, some bacteria quickly die and multiply, creating separate groups in different organs, controlled by the immune system. Later, more bacteria survive and spread to other parts of the body through the blood, with some dying off randomly. This method provides a new understanding of how Salmonella infections work, showing complex and random events drive the disease. The approach can be applied to other host-bacteria combinations, giving a comprehensive view of within-body dynamics. 

The study aimed to understand bacterial growth in the first few days of a mouse Salmonella infection by tracking tagged populations in animals and organs. However, previous methods were limited by sensitivity to conditions and disrupting bacteria and immune response. The approach uses ecological models to derive information from experimental data, but has been hindered by observing key variables in tissues. Tagged strains can transform understanding host-pathogen interactions, provide data for models, and predictions. 

In early stages, bacteria die and multiply in different organs, controlled by the immune. Later, more survive and spread through the blood, with random selection. Identical bacterial populations are a tool for understanding individual events in population dynamics during infection.
Researchers have been trying to figure out how our brains process 3D motion from what we see with two eyes, but existing ideas don't fully solve the problem. A new approach combines velocity, binocular disparity, and other cues to better understand 3D motion. In the context of the "aperture problem", two strategies emerge: (1) preferring slow motion in 3D and (2) cyclopean based on slow 2D motion. Predicting motion direction helps distinguish between these strategies. Theoretical results show velocity and disparity from tracking are needed to solve 3D motion. It's possible motion and disparity are processed in parallel and integrated in the visual hierarchy.

 Current models of 3D motion are insufficient to solve the inverse problem of binocular 3 motion. Velocity in binocular geometry shows additional information is necessary to disambiguate velocity and derive an estimate. Integration of motion and disparity with other cues solves the problem, allowing the system to bind local inputs into a global 3D percept. Geometrically, two planes in binocular geometry define a line in 3 velocity space. Tracking features in depth with bin velocity provides a strategy to disiguate 3D direction and solve the problem.

Three approaches to binocular 3 motion exist: interocular difference, disparity over time, and joint motion and disparity. These have generated research but results are inconclusive and 3D processing remains unresolved.
Researchers have studied the role of two proteins, AlgJ and AlgX, in the acetylation of alginate, a polysaccharide produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa during lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. They determined the structure of Alg to 1.83 resolution and found it to be a SGN hyrolase-like protein, similar to the N-terminal domain of AlgX but with a different electrostatic surface. They identified a conserved catalytic triad of D190, H192 and S288 and showed Alg exhibits acetylease activity in vitro. Residues in Alg signature motifs form interactions critical for alginate acylation in vivo. Using mass spectrometry, they compared Alg and Alg binding to alginate and found Alg binds weakly or not at all, while Alg binds in a length-dependent manner. Alg also used a surrogate acetyl donor to acylate alginate. The study suggests Alg and Alg have separate roles in acylation, with Alg as the terminal transferase.
Candida albicans is a common cause of human fungal infections and a significant source of mortality. To evade detection by the immune system, C. albicans masks its cell wall's inner layer of beta-1,3-glucan with an outer layer of heavily glycosylated mannoprote (mannan). However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can expose beta-1,3-glan, enhancing detection by immune cells like Dectin-1 and C-type lectin. Our lab found that phosphatidylser synthase (Cho) plays a role in beta-1,3-glan masking. A Cho knockout mutant, choΔ, shows increased beta-1,3-gan exposure. Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAP) pathways and upstream Rho small Gases regulate cell wall biogenesis and remodeling. In choΔ, C1 and M1 MAPs are constitutively activated, acting downstream of Gases C42 and R1. C42 activity is upregulated in choΔ. It was hypothesized that C42 or R1 activation causes unmasking. Disrupting M1 does not decrease unmask in cho, and hyperactivating R1 in wild-type increases unmask and activates C1 and M1. Moreover, hyperactivating Ste11 in wild-type leads to C1 activation and beta-1-gan exposure. Upregulation of C1 causes unmask and may be responsible for choΔ unmasking.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to better understand the genetic factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. They analyzed data from 4,914 brain autopsies to identify genetic loci associated with neuropathologic features of AD, such as neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and co-morbid neuropath changes like cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular injury (BI). The study found genome-wide significance for clinico-path AD, NPs, NFT, CA, and L with variants in the apolipoprotein E (APO) gene, GALNT7, ABCG1, and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 associated with NP score, and KCMB2 with HS. Twelve of 21 non-APO genetic loci for clinically defined AD were confirmed in the clinico-path sample, including CR1, BIN, CL, MSA, PICAL, ABC7, CD, P2, SOR1, M2, ZW, and C4. Nine of these loci showed larger odds ratio in the clinico sample. Correlation effect sizes for AD with NFT or NPs showed positive correlation, while for VBI showed negative. Co-mor neuropath features showed only nominal association with known loc. The study discovered new genetic associations with neuropath features and aligned genetic risk AD with neuropologic changes in the largest autopsy of AD and dementias.
Researchers have long used urea as a denaturant to study protein unfolding, but its role in the process is still unclear. Does urea actively unfold proteins or stabilize the unfolded state? To answer this, scientists analyzed 30 proteins with different folds through simulations with urea and various force fields. They found rules for ure unfolding that apply to all proteins, regardless of fold, disulfide bridges, or secondary structure. Urea accumulates near proteins, but less densely than in the unfolded state. Urea doesn't change protein vibrations, but reduces their magnitude, slowing unfolding. Urea's stickiness and diffusion are crucial for unfolding. Long urea near hydrophobic cores stabilize partially open structures from thermal fluctuations. Simulations show ure doesn't favor open states, but actively unfolds, selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded states, driving the protein away from native and thermal conformations.

Urea's role is driven by van der Waals and H-bonding, which stabilize long-living ure near hinges, biasing dynamics towards unfolding. This study provides a complete picture of ure's role in destabilizing folded proteins and its unfolding mechanisms. Urea is a denatur used for decades, but its properties remain elusive. The dominant "direct" mechanism claims ure interacts with exposed residues more than water. Simulations at 8M ure, 368K show unfolding signals, but smaller than stable proteins. Unfolding at 368 is independent of fold, structure, and similar with and without disulf bridges.
A systematic review of epidemiological studies on deng disease in Colombia from 2000 to 2012 found a stable baseline number of deng fever cases with major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The disease spread of deng cases increased, with most of the country affected by 2010. The majority of deng cases were among those under 15 years old. There are gaps in knowledge about d disease in Colombia, including asymptomatic d virus infection, primary infections, and underreporting of disease. Understanding factors that determine disease expression is important for control and management.

The review describes national and regional trends, incidence by age and sex, seroprevalence, and serotype, and other data. It is part of a series on d disease in the Americas and Asia. The review highlights non-severe d cases in 2010 in Colombia. There is lack of information on asymptomatic d virus, secondary infections, and underreporting disease. Improved surveillance can address these gaps.

Disease is a priority in Colombia and control has been difficult. From 2000 to 201, there was a stable annual number of cases with major outbreaks. Between 200 and 201, there was an increase in DH cases, followed by a decrease in 201.
Leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease that affects the skin and mucous tissues caused by Leish parasites. People with TL may also have other pathogens that can influence the outcome of the disease. This review looks at the frequency of TL coinfections in populations, interactions between Leish and other pathogens in animal and human models, and implications for clinical practice. TL is defined as all forms of cutaneous, localized, disseminated, or mucocutaneous leishmanias. HIV coinfection, superinfection with bacteria, and skin manifestations of visceral lemanias are not included.

Studies show that Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection is common in TL patients in Argentina (41%) and helminthias in TL in Brazil (15-88%). Different hypotheses have been explored about interactions between microorganisms, but no clear answers. Interactions may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks that affect quality and quantity of immune responses. Diagnostic problems occur when concurrent infections cause similar lesions (e.g., TL and leprosy), when pathogens are in same lesions (e.g., Leish and Sporothrix schenii), or similarities phylogenetically close pathogens affect diagnostic tests (e.g., serology leishias and Chagas). Coinfections (e.g., helthias) reduce effectiveness of antileman treatment and combinations cause cumulative effects. In TL patients, coinfection is frequent, it leads to diagnostic delays and influences effectiveness and safety of treatment.

Research is needed to understand how coinfections interfere with TL pathogenesis.
Researchers studied how genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) affects the development of immune cells called CD4 and CD8 T cells in rats. The MHC is a group of genes that helps the immune system distinguish between self and non-self. The study found that genetic variation in the MHC region affects the expression of MHC proteins and the ratio of CD4 to CD cells. They used two rat models to study this: outbred heterogeneous stock and a panel of M-recombinant congenic strains. They mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in MHC expression and CD ratio in the outbred stock and found 10 QTL across the genome. The QTL for individual traits colocalized in a region spanning the M. To identify genes underlying QTL, they generated a panel of M-rebinant congenic strains and refined QTL to intervals of 0.25 Mb in the M-I and II regions. An interaction between intervals affected M class expression and selection of CD single positive thymocytes. They mapped effect to transporter associated antigen 2 (Tap) in M-II and classical M class gene (RT-A) in-I. This interaction was revealed by recombination between RT-A and Tap in 0.2 of rats. Variants of Tap alter antigenicity of M class molecules by changing the class ligome. Results show a restricted repertoire leads to negative selection of CD cells.
Researchers analyzed data from Spain's National Hospital Discharge Database to study the evolution of Chagas disease in the country from 1997 to 2011. Chagas is a disease caused by a parasite transmitted through insect bites, common in Latin America. Spain receives many migrants from this region, making it the European country with the most infected patients. The study found 1,729 hospitalizations due to Chagas, with 31.6% being re-admissions. Most cases (90%) occurred between 2005 and 201. Hospitalization rates increased from 18.2 to 24.28 per 100,000 population. 75.3% of hospitalizations were due to Chagas without complications, while 23.4% had complications, mostly heart-related. 84.6% of hospitalizations involved invasive or non-invasive medical procedures. The majority (55.6%) of patients were female, with 16-45 and 46-65 age groups most represented. 50% of hospitalizations had complications. Surgical intervention was documented in 12.2%, while 71.4% had invasive or non-invasive procedures. Urgent admission was the most common. Factors associated with complications were being male, over 45, Chagas as main diagnosis, history of re-admission, and hospital cost over 3,065 euros.
Researchers have developed a new method called Blocuster to identify combinations of genetic factors that contribute to complex diseases, such as psoriasis. These combinations, or "combinatorial interactions," are thought to account for a significant portion of the "missing heritability" of diseases, but have been difficult to discover due to computational complexity and genetic heterogeneity. Blocuster efficiently constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks that segregate homogenous combinations of genetic factors and tests their associations with a given phenotype. The method was applied to psoriasis data, discovering a combinatorial pattern with an odds ratio of 3.64 and a Bonferr-corrected p-value of 5.01×10−16. This pattern was replicated in independent data, showing the method's robustness. Blocuster improves disease prediction and broadens understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis, demonstrating its potential for discovering combinatorial genetic associations in genome-wide data. Aiming to identify combinator interactions in ps pathogenesis, Blocuster was applied to ps cases and controls. The analysis identified a bloc of alleles significantly associated with ps, improving previous results by providing a precise allelic pattern in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. The bloc lies in a diverse genomic region, with 17 alleles in a pattern strongly associated with ps, providing information for future investigations. Blocuster's network is advantageous over conventional GWAS results, as shown in Table 2. The highest odds for a single SNP in ps1 is 2.41, while the bloc as a unit has odds of 3.45. Blocuster identified a ps1, a combination of 17 alleles highly-correlated and exhibiting ps risk as a whole with odds of 3.64 (CI 2.75-4.80) and Bonerr-correct p 5.01×10−16 in discovery. This bloc had odds of 3.86 (CI 2.98-5.01) and p in independent data.
Researchers studied the genetic causes of three severe brain malformations: agenesis of the corpus callo (ACC), cerebal hypoplasia (CH), and polymicrogyria (PM). They analyzed the chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) in 255 ACC, 220 CH, and 147 patients and 2,349 controls. The study found that ACC patients had significantly more rare CNVs than controls, but not CH or PM. Rare CNVs are those that affect less than 1% of the population. ACC patients had more CNVs impacting 20 genes than controls. Independent PCR confirmed that 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which are new mutations not inherited. These CNVs overlapped with those found in patients with autism spectrum disorders. Reports show reduced corpus callo area in autistic patients and social/executive function in ACC. The study refined known CNs, including a 8p23.1-p11 duplication in 2% of ACC. Novel CNs were found in single patients: deletions 1p31.3-p31.1, 1q31.2-q31.3, 5q23.1, 15.11-q13.1 and duplications 2q11.2-q13 11.14.3-p. A patient with microcephaly had paternally inherited 16.13 deletion that included N1. Exome sequencing revealed recessive matally inherited mutation in non-deleted N1. This is the first study of CN in congenital malformations, showing higher gene-rich CN in ACC than CH and PM.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called Yorkie in the regeneration of planarians, a type of flatworm that can regrow lost body parts. They found that Yorkie helps control how planarians respond to injury by regulating cell growth, cell death, and tissue patterning. When Yorkie was blocked, planarians grew too many cells, had too many skin and muscle cells, and couldn't properly sense the size of their body parts after injury. They also found that York blocked planarians couldn't remodel their brain, gut, and pharynx, and midline to match the size of the regenerating part. This suggests York is a key molecule that integrates multiple aspects of injury response, including cell growth, cell death, and patterning. 

The study focused on how York affects stem cell proliferation and early wound response in planarians. When York was blocked, cell growth and wound response were hyperactivated and prolonged. Despite increased growth, stem cells didn't differentiate, and had more skin and muscle cells. This was surprising because York isn't expressed in stem cells. The researchers suggest that York blocks the wound program, increasing stem response through external signals. They also found that same tissues with wound genes were upregulated in York-blocked planarians. This could explain increased growth and failure to regenerate. They tested if changes in wound response explain growth or failure to regenerate. York-blocked planarians showed increased growth, differentiation, and cell death, similar to York's role in intact planarians. More interestingly, key wound genes were upregulated in York-blocked planarians. This suggests York's effect on wound response is direct, as it's expressed in intact planarians before injury.
Researchers have found that the exosomes released by cells infected with the EV71 virus contain a specific type of RNA called miR-146, which helps the virus to replicate by suppressing the host cell's immune response. Exosomes are tiny particles that can transfer genetic material between cells and play a role in viral infections. The study showed that EV71 infection leads to increased exosome secretion and packaging of viral RNA and mi-146. The exosomes contained replication-competent EV RNA with mi-146, Ago, and GW182, and mediated EV transmission independent of virus-specific receptors. Exosomal RNA was transferred and replicated in new cells while exosomal mi-146 suppressed type I interferon response, facilitating viral replication. IF-stimulated factors, BST-2/tether, were involved in regulating EV-induced exosome secretion. In vivo study, exosomal RNA accumulated in tissues compared to free virus. Findings suggest exosomes secreted by EV-infected cells package high mi-146 to facilitate exosomal EV RNA replication in cells by suppressing type interferon response.
Researchers studied the relationship between two genes, PINK and Parkin, which are linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease. PINK is a kinase that helps maintain healthy mitochondria, while Parkin is a protein that breaks down damaged mitochondria. They found a protein, PG5, that binds to PINK and helps regulate its activity. Without PG5, flies with inactive PINK had less muscle degeneration and lived longer. However, PG5 did not affect flies with Parkin mutations. Overexpressing PG5 made PINK and Park problems worse. This suggests PG5 helps PINK keep mitochondria healthy and acts between PINK and Park. 

 Studies showed PINK recruits Park to damaged mitochondria and helps break them down through autophagy. Little is known about how PINK regulates mitochondria through Park. Parkin mutations cause mitochondrial degeneration in some tissues, like PINK inactivation. PG5 is involved in the PINK pathway, so researchers tested if it affects Park phenotypes. Reducing mitochondrial fusion or increasing fission proteins partially rescued PINK and Park phenotypes. PG5 binds PINK and modulates PINK phenotypes. Losing PG5 had little effect on lifespan in PINK flies. The study shows PG5 regulates PINK in flies, but more research is needed to understand how and if manipulating PG5 could help PINK-related Parkinson's disease.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-γ (IFNγ) in the immune response to Mycobacterium ulcerans infection, which causes Buruli ulcer (BU), a chronic skin disease characterized by tissue damage and toxin production of mycolactin. Despite previous research, the immune response to this pathogen and protective mechanisms are not fully understood. The study used an experimental mouse model and found that IFγ is crucial for early host defense against M. ulcer infections. Mice lacking IFγ showed faster disease progression, more tissue damage, and higher bacterial load after five weeks. This indicates reduced ability to kill intracellular bacteria during early growth phase. The study supports the idea that concepts for tuberculosis vaccines may also apply to BU. Reports of spontaneous healing and partial protection by Bacille Calmet-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in humans and mice suggest immune clearance of M. ulcer is possible before large clusters of mycolone form. The study demonstrates key role of IFγ in early defense against M. ulcer infection and indicates activation of macrophage bactericidal activity helps contain infection during intracellular stages.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria, which is linked to various diseases. They focused on how hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, affects ROS production. To understand this complex process, they developed a new method to model electron transport in mitochondria. This allowed them to identify two stable states of operation for respiratory complex III, which can produce different amounts of ROS. Normally, it produces little ROS, but under anoxia can switch it to high ROS production, persisting even after oxygen returns. This was experimentally validated, explaining anox-induced cell damage. Recognizing this bistability may lead to new treatments for oxidative stress. The model can also be applied to other biological systems.

A major challenge in studying ROS production is the many possible states of electron transporters, over 400, which must be considered. This allows complex to operate in low or high ROS modes at the same conditions, explaining differences before and after anox. Experiments confirmed two ROS states in mitochondria at same conditions and switching between them by ADP or anox. Higher ROS were released upon oxygen return after anox. The damaging effect of reoxygen after anox is known, but this study shows ania increase in ROS in isolated mitochondria.

A new method constructs equations for each state based on red reactions between transporters and biochemical mechanism. This allows expanding the model to other parts of transport and metabolism, providing substrates and transmembrane potential. This opens a new direction for detailed analysis of bioenergetic systems.
Researchers studied the role of the gene "huckin" (Hkb) in the development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Hkb is part of the gap gene network, which determines the position of body segments along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis during the blastoderm stage. The team used a systems-level approach to investigate H's regulatory effect on gap gene expression. They found that H is involved in the regulation of the posterior "hunch" (hb) domain, but has no other essential function. H is required for the anterior shift of the posterior border of this domain, which is now correctly reproduced in their models. Gap circuits presented here can reproduce terminal gene mutants, while previous models failed to do so. This is an important step towards understanding the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap network.
Researchers have developed a new treatment for brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that causes significant economic losses worldwide. Currently, there is no effective immunotherapy or biomarker to monitor treatment efficacy, and infected animals remain carriers for life. Two live attenuated strains of Brucella abortus, S19 and 51, were used. S induces antibodies, but is ineffective against intracellular pathogen, while 51 induces cell-mediated immunity (CMI) but is rifampicin resistant. Both are secreted in milk and can infect humans and cause abortions in animals. Bacteriophage lysates retain immunogenicity opposed to killing by heat or chemicals. Researchers report successful immunotherapy of bovine bruclos with phage lysates of RB51 (RL) and S19 (SL). RL induced strong antibody and stimulated CMI. In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from immunized induced interferon production. A single subcutaneous dose of 2ml cocktail (RL and SL) eliminated virulent Bruc from bruclos affected with undetectable by RT-PCR and negative by culture in 3 post-immun. This is first report on minimally invasive monitoring efficacy employing RNA as biomarker and use of RB phage for bruclos in cattle.
Researchers have identified a specific role for the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk2 (Cdk2) in responding to DNA damage in human cells. C2 is active during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, but was thought to be dispensable for cell survival due to compensation by other CDKs. However, replacing wild-type C2 with a mutant version sensitive to inhibition by adenosine analogs revealed a requirement for C2 activity in cell proliferation. The study found that transient inhibition of C2 after ionizing radiation increased cell killing, and that C2 phosphorylated the Nbs protein, a component of the MRN complex required for DNA repair and checkpoint signaling. Inhibition of C2 delayed N1 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased sensitivity to radiation. These results show a non-redundant requirement for C2 in DNA response and a specific target within the repair machinery.
Researchers used a technique called formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to map regulatory regions of the genome associated with hematological traits, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction in megakarycytic and erythroblast cells. They found that the two cell types of cells have distinct patterns of open chromatin, and that open chrom can guide the finding of functional variants. The team identified an open region on chromosome 7q22.3 in megaryocytes but not erythroblasts, which harbors a non-coding variant rs342 known to be associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing this region in 643 individuals provided evidence that rs342 is the causative variant. They showed that C and G differentially bind transcription factor EV1 affecting PI3KCG expression in platelets and macrophages. A protein interaction network in Pikcg knockout mice indicated PI3 is associated with pathways in platelet biogenesis and thrombus formation. This is the first variant to be elucidated among known platelet quantitative loci. The study suggests a mechanism by which non-coding GWA SNP modulates platelet phenotype.
Researchers studied how blocking a specific type of electrical current, called persistent sodium current (INa), affects the respiratory system's rhythm. They used computer simulations to test two common blockers with different mechanisms: tetrodotoxin (TX) and ruzole (R). TX directly blocks the sodium pore, while R shifts the current's inactivation to a more negative direction. In experiments, blocking IN with TX or R suggested IN is crucial for rhythm generation in isolated respiratory neurons and networks. However, results were contradictory, leading to debate about IN's role. Simulations matched various data from isolated neurons to intact networks and generated predictions. Key findings include: (1) a mechanistic explanation for contradictory results in vitro studies, (2) effects of IN block in vitro not equivalent to intact preparations, (3) R's failure to block IN in intact network, and (4) effective block by low TX will stop rhythm in intact network. This supports IN's role in rhythm generation and highlights the importance of considering mechanism when interpreting pharmacological blockade data.
Researchers have found that a microRNA called mi-218 plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of gastric cancer cells. They discovered that mi-218 is decreased in gastric cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body, and its host gene Slit is also low. However, a receptor called Rob1, which interacts with Slit, is negatively regulated by mi-218, creating a feedback loop. When mi-218 is low, Rob1 is not repressed, allowing Sl-Rob1 pathway to activate, leading to cancer spread. Restoring mi-218 suppresses Rob1 and blocks cancer cell invasion and spread in lab and animal tests. The study reveals a new mechanism of cancer spread and suggests targeting mi-218 as a potential way to stop cancer spread.
Researchers have investigated how lowering cholesterol levels in the blood affects the development of atherosclerosis, a condition that can lead to heart disease and stroke. They used a mouse model with high cholesterol levels similar to humans with familial hypercholesterolemia and a genetic switch to lower lipoproteins. Atherosclerosis progressed slowly at first, then rapidly, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. The researchers analyzed the expression of genes in the atherosclerotic lesions and found that accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages led to rapid expansion with foam formation and inflammation, supported by histology. Lowering cholesterol prevented formation of advanced plaques and transcription profiling identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA-inhibition in macrophages incubated with acety-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-accumulation. The study identified a network of atherosclerosis genes responding to plasma-lowering that prevents formation of advanced plaques. This network is of interest for development of atherosclerosis therapies.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes involved in the assembly of the outer layer of Gram-negative bacteria, which is difficult for antibiotics to penetrate. This layer is a major challenge in treating bacterial infections, as few effective treatments exist and resistance is rising. The new method, called a "CPRG screen", was used on a library of single-gene deletions in E. coli and identified 102 genes with unknown functions that likely impact assembly. One of these, Ely (YC), was found to play a role in metabolism of a lipid essential for cell wall and surface polysacchar production. Further study of Ely and other hits may reveal new information on assembly and vulnerabilities for targeting. The CG screen is adaptable to other organisms to study different envelope architectures. Understanding assembly is key to combating resistance, with recent progress made in identifying essential systems, but many aspects remain unclear, including regulatory strategies for layer construction. Further study may reveal new mechanisms and targets. The discovery of Ely as a new factor validates the CG approach. Its functions in lipid metabolism, including Und production or recycling, are consistent with data, and implications for understanding assembly are significant.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze complex biological systems by combining multiple types of data, such as gene expression, protein, and tissue formation, into a single view. They used a technique called semi-supervised learning, which looks at the structure of the data, to merge the information from different sources. This method was tested on fruit fly embryo development data, resulting in a continuous trajectory showing how genes, cells, proteins, and tissues change over time. The approach can be applied to other types of data and is a starting point for further analysis of biological dynamics.

The researchers solved the problem of combining data from different sources by creating 5,512 semi-supervised solutions for each pixel and channel. They combined labeled and unlabeled data, resulting in a multivar trajectory of tissue and molecular dynamics. A dataset of 100 images showed the position of nuclei and distribution of components in the patterning network. The semi-supervised approach was applied to this data by computing similarities between images using common channels.

The challenge of synthesizing data from different observations into a single view is a problem in various fields, but systematic approaches have not been established. This study addresses the task for imaging of developing tissues, where cell fates are established by complex networks. By posing data fusion as a semi-supervised problem, a closed-form expression for variables was obtained using harmonic extension. The trajectories provide basis for advanced studies of multivar processes responsible for developmental pattern formation.

The method can be adapted to other imaging modalities and is a starting point for further analysis and modeling of biological dynamics.
Researchers studied three types of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), PI, PII, and PIII, to understand how they cause hemorrhage by damaging blood vessels. They compared where these enzymes localize in tissue and how they break down basement membrane components in the body. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that PII and PIII SVs co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillaries more than PI SV, which was more widespread in tissue. Patterns of breaking down lamin, type VI collagen, and nidogen in vivo differed, but all three broke down type IV collagen similarly, suggesting breaking this component destabilizes vessel structure leading to hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of exudate showed similarities and differences between SVs' actions. PI broke more extracellular components and fibrin, while PII and P SVs had more intracellular proteins. This study provides clues on how SVs damage microvasculature and cause hemorrhage.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the homeotic genes are arranged on the chromosome in the order of the body segments they affect, with posterior genes repressing anterior ones. However, this rule is qualified by abdominal-A (ab-A) and abdominal-B (Abd-B). In animals lacking Abd-B, ectopic expression of ab-A is seen in the epidermis of the eighth segment, but not the nervous system. Repression in these cells is accomplished by a 92 non-coding RNA called iab-8. This RNA produces a micro RNA to repress ab-A and has a second, redundant mechanism that acts only in cis. Transcription interference with the ab-A promoter is the likely mechanism.

The i-8 RNA interferes with an ab enhancer, which must lie downstream of the i-6 breakpoint, as ab-A is derepressed in PS CNS embryos homozygous for this. The ab-A promoter is the likely target, as the poly A site of i-8 lies 1.1 kb upstream of ab-A initiation and i-8 transcript continues past poly A addition. Embryos with strong ab-A misexpression in CNS show i-8 can only repress ab-A on the chromosome it's transcribed from.

Two mechanisms repress ab-A: first, i-8 miRNA acting in trans, and second, repressive acting in cis. Rearrangements that truncate i-8 near start cause derepression ab-A in CNS, similar to Df3 homozygotes. The same is seen with Fab deletion removing i-8 promoter. A 90-long transcription unit exists between Abd and ab-A, with likely start in i-8 region. RNA in-s hybridizations detect RNA in segments 8 and 9.
Researchers have studied the patterns of focal seizures, which are episodes of abnormal brain activity that start in a specific area of the brain. They found two main types: low-amplitude fast (LAF) and high-amplitude (HAS) oscillations. To understand how these patterns start, they used a computer model of brain tissue and validated it with real recordings of seizures. The model showed that LAF starts with small areas of activity that grow over time, while HAS is a sudden change to a seizure state triggered by a local event. This change is due to increased excitability of surrounding tissue, which doesn't cause seizures but can support them. This difference in excitability explains why some seizures are harder to treat. The model also showed how to measure this excitability using stimulation. The study suggests that surrounding tissue excitability plays a key role in seizure pattern and treatment.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZES-4 that plays a crucial role in the process of fertilization in plants. In flowering plants, sperm cells are transported to the female gamete via a tube called the pollen tube. When the pollen tube reaches the female gamete, two sperm cells are released into the synergid cell to fertilize the egg. The researchers found that ZES-4 is produced in the female gamete and accumulates in vesicles at the secretory zone of the sygid cells. These vesicles are released during fertilization and interact with a potassium channel called K1 in the pollen tube. This interaction causes the channel to open, allowing potassium ions to flow in. The influx of potassium leads to an increase in water, causing the tube to burst and release the sperm. This process is species-specific, meaning it only occurs in certain plant species. The study suggests that this mechanism is a pre-zygotic barrier and may contribute to reproductive isolation in plants.
Researchers have developed a targeted herpes virus, called RM249, that specifically infects and kills cancer cells that overexpress the HER2 protein, a common in ovarian and breast cancers. The virus was tested in mice with disseminated tumors that spread to the peritoneal cavity, mimicking human advanced ovarian cancer. Intraperitoneal administration of RM249 significantly reduced tumor growth, with 60% of mice free from peritoneal diffusion and 95% reduction in tumor weight. The virus also inhibited growth of ovarian and breast cancer metastases in the peritone and brain. RM is effective against HER2-positive cancer cells resistant to trastuzumab, an important for clinical application. Previously, RM showed anti-tumor activity against subcutaneously injected ovarian cancer cells. This study evaluated RM against intraperitoneal cancer dissemination, a common in breast cancer. Results show RM effectively inhibits peritone dissemination of HER2 ovarian and breast carcinomas.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism that regulates the duplication of centrosomes, the structures that form the poles of the mitotic spindle in eukaryotic cells. Centome duplication is essential for proper spindle formation and chromosome segregation, and is controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). The study found that Sfi, a conserved component of centomes, is the first Cdk substrate required to restrict centome duplication to once per cell. Phosphorylation of S1 by Cdk promotes separation of duplicated spindle bodies (SPs) and prevents premature duplication during mitosis. Cells with nonosphorylated S1 show defects in spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth. The findings suggest that Cdk phosphorylation of S1 has a dual function: promoting SP separation and preventing premature duplication. Additionally, the proteinase C14 activates licensing by deosphorylation of S1.
HIV-1 protein Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating viral replication during acute infection by exploiting proliferating CD4+ T cells, particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs), in vivo. Previous studies have shown that V causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HIV-1-infected cells in vitro, and is conserved in transmitted/founder HIV-1 and primate lentiviruses. However, its direct role in vivo was unclear. Using a humanized mouse model, researchers demonstrated that V causes G2 cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CCR+ CD+ T cells, mainly Tregs, resulting in T depletion and enhanced virus production during infection. V-dependent replication and T depletion observed in C5ropic but not Xropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting effects dependent on coreceptor usage by HIV-1. Immune activation observed in Cropic wild-type but not V-deficient HIV-infected humanized mice. Treatment with denileukin difox (DD) to deplete Tregs showed massive activation/proliferation of memory cells compared to untreated. This activation/prolifer enhanced C5 in memory CD+ cells and made them susceptible to Cropic wild-type HIV-1 than V-deficient virus. Results suggest V takes advantage of proliferating C5 CD+ cells for viremia Cropic HIV-1. Tregs in higher cycling state than other subsets, appear vulnerable to V during HIV-1 infection.
Researchers studied the genetic changes in the Plasmodium vivax population in South Korea from 1994 to 2008 using microsatellite DNA markers. P. viv was eliminated in Korea in the 1970s but re-emerged in 1993. To control malaria, understanding the parasite's genetic structure is crucial. The study analyzed 14 microsatellite loci from 163 isolates and found a decrease in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genetic differentiation between years. A Bayesian analysis showed a drastic change in the population in 2002-2003. Relapse and asymptomatic parasite carriage may have influenced the structure, but results suggest P. viv was introduced from other sources, possibly North Korea in 2002-2003. Microsatellite DNA analysis is effective for understanding parasite population dynamics and transmission, aiding malaria elimination in endemic areas.
Researchers have discovered that a specific type of intron, a non-coding region within genes, plays a crucial role in regulating the direction of transcription in eukaryotes. They found that the presence of this intron, called splicing-competent intr, favors the transcription of mRNA over upstream antisense RNA from a promoter. This is an evolutionarily conserved feature among eukotes. The team used a technique called strand-specific transcription run-on analysis to show that the intr is important for promoter directionality. They also found that mutation of the 5 or 3 splice site of the intr reverses promoter direction, indicating that the entire intr, not just the 5 splice site, regulates direction.

Further analysis revealed that the intr recruits termination factors near the promoter region. Removal of the intr or mutation of splice sites affects the localization of these factors. The team previously showed that intr-mediated enhancement of transcription is dependent on gene looping. They now found that looping is crucial for the recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-prox region of intr-containing genes. In a looping-defective mutant, despite normal splicing, the occupancy of factors for poly (A)-dependent termination transcription was compromised, accompanied by a loss of direction.

The study also found that transcription of a subset of yeast genes is dependent on the presence of splicing-compet intr. The intr facilitates recruitment of termination factors CF and CPF in the vicinity of the promoter. The team suggests that intr-dependent looping places termination factors near the promoter for termination of upstream antisense transcription, giving direction to promoter-initiated transcription.
Researchers have identified a novel transcription factor called ZBED, derived from a domesticated DNA transposon, that regulates IGF2 expression and muscle growth. A single nucleotide substitution in the IGF2 gene in pigs abrogates a repressor binding site, leading to a 3-fold upregulation of IGF in skeletal muscle, affecting muscle size, heart, and fat deposition. ZBED is a previously unknown protein specific to placental mammals and silencing it in mouse C2C myoblasts affects IGF expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing identified 2,500 ZBED binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif matching the established IGF site. Genes associated with ZBED sites show significant enrichment in development and transcriptional regulation. Phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED-silenced C2 mylasts, sequence conservation, nucleolar localization, broad distribution, and target genes with essential functions suggest ZBED's importance in placental development, proliferation, and growth.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the RNA editing process in rhes macaque, a close relative of humans, using advanced sequencing technology. They found 31,250 editing sites, mostly A-to-G transitions, in the animal's genome and verified 96.6% of these sites in coding regions and 97.5 in non-coding regions. The study showed that adenosine deamination is associated with A-to-G editing and the sequence and expression of ADAR enzymes determine editing levels across sites and tissues. Some editing sites were conserved across different tissues and species, suggesting evolutionary constraint maintaining double-stranded structure. The findings support the "tinkering" model of small functional sites origination. The study highlights RNA editing as a widespread regulation in primate evolution and provides a framework for understanding in humans.
Researchers have found a new perceptual bias that affects how people perceive visual stimuli in a two-alternative discrimination tasks. In these tasks, observers try to determine which of two stimuli caused a certain responses. To do this, they integrate noisy neural responses into a reliable representation of the likelihood of each stimulus. Ideally, they should evaluate the likelihood with high precision and consider only the relevant stimuli. However, a new study reveals that observers read the representation with low precision when discriminating spatial frequencies. By using spectrally filtered noise, an asymmetry was induced in the likelihood of spatial frequencies. This mainly affected frequencies irrelevant to the task, yet a significant shift in perceived frequency was found, indicating observers evaluate a range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of alternatives.

 In an experiment, filtered noise altered perception of known gratings in a two-altern spatial discrimination, shifting frequency to lower and higher frequencies in low-pass and high filtered conditions. Observers considered unlikely frequencies, lowering detectability and biasing perceived frequency. Log functions were asymmetrical around vertical frequency in low and high filtered noise. Gratings were presented at high contrasts, corresponding to 84% detection in broadband noise. High performance and steep psychometric functions indicate decisions based on vertical frequency.

The study differs from traditional models of visual encoding in noise, assuming external noise affects variability without changing average response. Grating detectability and discriminability were measured in filtered noise, showing dramatic alteration of perceived frequency. Low-pass noise decreased perceived frequency, while high-pass increased.
Researchers have discovered that in Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a crucial role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements. These piRNAs are derived from a long, polycistronic RNA, but in Caenorhabdis elegans, each piRNA is a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit. A 21-nucleotide pi sequence and a 50-nucleotide upstream motif are necessary for expression, and a single nucleotide in the motif determines germline enrichment. Over 70% of Caenorhabdis piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female germl, suggesting these populations have evolved independently. The upstream motif acts as a promoter, specifying which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in which germl. The Caenor genome encodes over 15,000 unique pi sequences, rivaling the number of mRNA genes. Researchers used computational and transgenic approaches to find the conserved motif defines the pi transcription cassette, specifying which sequences are expressed as Caenor piRNAs. The motif also encodes information for germl-specific expression of 21 RNAs. Autonomous expression of synthetic 21 RN was demonstrated from minimal transgenic cassettes with the 8 core motif, 40 intervening spacer, 21 RNA, and 100 flanking context. The organization of endogenous pi loci is dispensable for pi expression, suggesting each locus encodes necessary information for independent transcription.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Brucella uses to replicate within host cells. Bruc replicates in a membrane-bound compartment derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called a vacuole. The study found that the IRE pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated during Bruc infection, but not the PER and ATF pathways. The IRE pathway upregulates genes involved in the secretory pathway, including Sar, Sec, and SecD. These molecules form COI vesicles at the ER exit sites (E) of the cell. The researchers identified a novel host factor, YipA, which activates the IRE pathway in response to Bruc infection. YipA is responsible for phosphorylating IRE, allowing Ire molecules to assemble at ER sites. Without YA, Bruc fails to form ER-derived vacoles and remains in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Autophagy proteins Atg and WI, but not DFC, are required for ER-derived compartment biogenesis. The study proposes a model for Bruc replication using host UPR and ER vacole machineries, both dependent on YA-mediated IRE activation.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBS) and carnation Italian ring spot virus (CV) recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK) into the viral replication compartment to support their replication. The kinase function of V34 is crucial for TBS replication, suggesting that PI(3) phosphoinoside is used by TBS to build the replication compartment. The expression of V34 and abundance of PI(3) increases in the presence of tombusiral proteins, leading to more efficient TBS replication. Overexpression of PI3 phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibits TBS replication on peroxomal membranes and CV on mitochondrial membranes. Purified PI phosphatase reduces TBS assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI with antibody or probe reveals enrichment of PI in replication. V34 is recruited to replication through interaction with p33 protein. Gene analysis in yeast shows TBS requires vesicle transport of V34. Without V34, TBS cannot recruit Rab-positive endosomes, providing membranes for TBS replication. V34 and PI are needed for stability of p33 protein, degraded by 26 proteasome when PI abundance is decreased by V34 inhibitor.
Researchers conducted a study in Iqu, Peru to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypt mosquitoes on deng virus-infected human volunteers for vector studies. The study aimed to examine the transmission of deng virus (DENV) from humans to mosquitoes, a critical component of deng epidemiology. Participants aged 5 years and older with fever were enrolled from clinic and neighborhood studies. Wild, laboratory-reared Aedes aegypt were fed on feile individuals or blood with or collected from participants treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after 14 days for DENV infection and dissemination. A total 58 participants with vireas from 1.3 × 102 to 2.9 × 106 focus-forming units/mL participated in one or more feeding methods. DENV infection rates were not different between direct and indirect-ED feeding, but lower for no additive. Dissemination rates were similar across methods. No differences were detected in D infection or dissemination in fed on participants with different deng severity. The study demonstrates direct and indirect feeding for field-based studies. Direct feeding is preferable in terms of ease, biosecurity, and reliability.
Researchers investigated why some cancer patients respond differently to chemotherapy drugs that target topoisomerase II, an enzyme essential for cell division. They used the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model and found that different strains vary in sensitivity to these drugs. An unbiased genetic approach revealed that a single amino acid substitution, methionine to glutamine in topoisomerase II, explains this variation. The non-polar methine residue increases hydrophobic interactions with the drug etoposide, leading to increased genomic instability. This residue is conserved from yeast to humans, where it differs between two topoisomerase isoforms, methion in hTOIα and glut in hIβ. The researchers showed that this difference affects cytotoxicity of topois II poisons in human cell lines. This explains why hIα and hβ are differentially affected by poisons and demonstrates the utility of C elegans in understanding drug responses.
Researchers studied the genetics of lifespan in long-lived rodents, specifically the African mole rat, to gain insights into mechanisms determining mammalian lifespan. They analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and identified 250 genes associated with enhanced longevity, known as positively selected genes (PSGs). These genes showed an expression pattern in long-lived mole rats and short-lived rats that fits the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging, where genes have opposite effects at different stages of life. The PSGs were enriched in genes related to aging, including cellular respiration, ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway: translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Notably, PSGs included RHE, a regulator of mTOR, and IGF, central to aging pathways, as well as unknown genes like RBL, AM2, PSM1, and GER. Protein modeling suggests functional consequences of amino acid changes under selection. The study provides a resource to link genes and amino acids to aging and lifespan.

The researchers scanned PSG on branches of the African rat family and other rodents leading to longevity, examining more ancestral branches than previous studies. Consistent with observed patterns, lower expression of related genes and pharmacological inhibition was associated with longer lifespan in worms, killfish, and mice. mTOR regulates inflammatory and immune responses. Results indicate PSG changes during aging consistent with antagonistic pleiotropy theory. Gene ontology analysis showed significant downregulation in long-lived and upregulation in short-lived, fitting antagonistic pleiotropy. PSG cover processes regulated by mTOR, translation, autagy, and respiration.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to control the spread of diseases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito by introducing a bacterium called Wolbachia that makes the mosquito sterile or reduces its ability to transmit viruses. They created a new line of Aedes aegypt, called ARP-M, by introducing Wolbach into the mosquito's genetic material. The researchers compared AR-M with the original Aedesegypt line, ARP, and a wild-type Aedesypt with the same genetic background. They found that AR-M had 100% inheritance of Wolbach and showed no difference in survival, fecundity, and fertility compared to the other two lines. However, AR-M males were unable to fertilize wild-type females, while wild males could fertilize AR-M females. When competing with wild males for females, AR-M induced sterility was higher than expected. The Wolbach density in AR-M females was 15 times higher than in AR, mostly due to Wolbach. This corresponded to reduced competence for chikunya and deng viruses, with 5 and 0% transmission rates at 14 and 21 days post-infection, compared to AR females. Results for Zika virus showed no difference between AR-M and AR, but none of AR-M females could transmit Zika. These findings suggest using Wolbach to suppress wild Aedesypt populations.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify peptide-mediated interactions between proteins using high-resolution 3D structures. These interactions occur when a globular protein domain recognizes a linear peptide from another protein, creating a small contact interface. Peptides are often found in unstructured regions of proteins and have a consensus motif complementary to their binding partner's surface. Unlike current methods, this approach focuses on how peptides adopt a defined structure when binding to their partner. Analysis of known peptide interactions showed that their structure can be characteristic of the consensus motif, even if they don't match established patterns. Peptides tend to be stretched and elongated, unlike other peptides of the same length. A Support Vector Machine was used with structure information to scan 50,000 3D protein complexes and identify unnoticed interactions. Derived patterns were compared to established motifs and domains. The method was validated by scanning interactomes of four organisms and found significant over-representations of 64 domain-peptide interactions, 46 of which were new, involving 6,000 interactions.
Researchers studied 49 adults in Zambia with environmental enteropathy, a condition linked to impaired nutrient absorption and vaccine responses. They used confocal endoscopy, histology, and mRNA sequencing to analyze intestinal biopsies and correlated with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and zinc uptake. Confocal images showed widespread small intestinal damage and epithelial defects at villi tips, confirmed by histology and claudin immunostaining. Multivariate analysis found circulating LPS correlated with cell shedding and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). Zinc uptake was reduced in 64% of individuals and correlated with GL-2 in multivariate analysis. Transcript analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins. Epithelial defects are probably sites of bacterial translocation, with increased epithelial surface area increasing translocation burden. GL-2 and other peptides may play a role in mucosal protection in EE.

The researchers also studied zinc uptake in healthy volunteers and found no correlation with epithelial surface area, but transcript analysis showed reduced DMT-1 expression in severe enteropathy, contributing to zinc uptake. Hypochlorhydria was common but not the cause of impaired uptake, as it doesn't depend on gastric acid. The study was restricted to adults and suggests many Zambian adults live with chronic inflammation. Epithelial defects were evaluated semi-quantitatively and quantified in a subset of biies. Claudin-4 immunostaining showed increased shedding and separation, associated with plasma LPS, a component of Gram-negative cell walls.
Researchers have studied a phenomenon called superinfection exclusion (SIE), where some viruses block re-infection of host cells by the same or similar viruses. They found that in turnip crinkle virus (TCV) uses a protein called p28 to achieve this. p28 is one of two proteins encoded by the virus and is responsible for SIE. When p28 is expressed, it blocks replication of TCV replicon, the part of the virus that replicates the virus. Transiently expressed p28, delivered with or before TCVon, also blocks replication. Interestingly, p28's ability to block is enhanced by C-terminal tags but weakened by N-terminal modifications. p28 also forms large, mobile inclusions that trap non-replicating, yet replication-competent p mutants. This suggests p28 forms multimer complexes that intercept fresh p monomers from superfect genomes, stopping replication. This mechanism could apply to other RNA viruses and offer new targets for antiviral therapy.
Researchers have developed a vaccine against Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease, using a plasmid DNA encoding Trypanosoma cruzi transialase (TS) and IL-15. They tested if adding IL-15 to the vaccine would improve long-term protection. Mice were immunized with TS alone or with TS and IL-15, then tested for immune responses and protection against the parasite. Mice with TS alone developed strong immune responses and survived the parasite within 3 months. Adding IL-15 did not improve responses or protection during this time. However, mice with both TS and IL-15 were more protected against the parasite 6 months later than those with TS alone. This was due to more TS-specific T cells that produced IF-γ and expanded well after restimulation. Adding IL-15 to the vaccine improved long-term T cell survival, expansion, and protection against the parasite.
Researchers have identified a protein called WDR1 that plays a crucial role in controlling the levels of a protein called TbK in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. TbK is essential for the parasite's basal body, flagellum, and cell division. The researchers found that W1 interacts with a protein complex called Cull4 and another protein called D1 to break down TbK in the parasite's body and flagum. Without W1, the parasite's body and flagum do not separate properly, and the flagum does not attach correctly. This leads to problems with the parasite's division and movement. The researchers also found that W1 localizes to the parasite's body and flagum during certain stages of its life cycle. They suggest that W1 is a receptor for TbK in the Cull complex that breaks it down Tb in the body and flag. Without W, Tb builds up in the body and flag, causing problems with the parasite's division and movement.
Researchers have found that the RNA helicase DDX3 plays a crucial role in the body's innate immune system, which helps fight off infections. They studied mice without the DDX3 gene and found they were more susceptible to infection and had altered immune cells in their bone marrow and spleen. The study suggests DDX3 is essential for immune function and may contribute to differences in how men and women fight off infections and diseases. 

The study used mice without D3 in their immune system showed changes in bone and spleen cell populations and were highly susceptible to Listeria infection. Data shows a vital role of sex-specific D3 forms in immunity to Lister. This may be because male mice were used for experiments and D3 is weaker in male cells. Alternatively, macrophages may not produce high levels of cytokines. Loss of D3 impacts the immune system through its role in hematopoiesis and response to Lister infections.

The study looked at how D3 deficiency affects genes in macrophages using RNA analysis. Genes changed upon L-infection in male or female cells are enriched for immune terms and D3 altered the transcriptome depended on sex of cells. Researchers previously found D3 regulates IFN transcription in infected cells with viruses or Lister. D3 is in the DEAD RNA helase superfamily with functions in RNA metabolism, transcription, processing, splicing, and translation.
A computational model of the insect pherone transduction cascade has been developed, focusing on the post-effector processes in male moth olfactory neurons. The model includes the production and degradation of second messengers IP3 and DAG, the opening and closing of ionic channels, and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. It is regulated by modulators protein kinase and Ca2-calmodulin, which exert feedback inhibition on effector channels. The model simulates the evolution of chemical species and membrane potential in response to pherone stimulation of various intensities and captures the main features of the dose-response curve, including a wide range of amplitudes and rising and falling times. It also reproduces the second messenger kinetics. The model suggests that two types of depolarizing channels play different roles at low and high pherone concentrations, with the DAG-gated cation channel playing a major role at low concentrations and the Ca2-gated Cl channel playing a major role at middle and high concentrations.
Researchers studied how the tumor suppressor protein p53 responds to cellular stress by binding to specific DNA sequences and activating genes. They mapped p53 binding and histone H3me3 in human cells with and without the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin. The study examined relationships between p53 occupancy, gene expression, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, and p53 sequence conservation. Results showed that p-regulated genes were associated with chromatin status. Highly p-regulated genes were suppressed and marked by repressive histone modifications or CTC binding. p53 sequences in open chromatin were weaker, while those in enhancers and repressed chrom were stronger. p occupancy was correlated with sequence similarity to the p53 consensus but inversely with nucleosome accessibility and conservation. p binding to transposable element repeats was higher and correlated with stronger sequences. However, this was not associated with gene activation. Occupied p in repeats were unique, displaying negative phylo scores and altered histone and DNase hypersensitivity. The study highlights the interaction between chromatin and p53 context in transactivation. The p response appears to be tuned by evolutionary processes leading to repression or utilization of p from transposable elements.
Researchers have developed a new understanding of a specific two-component signaling system in bacteria, where a single histidine kinase (HK) can phosphorylate two response regulator (RR) proteins. This system allows for rapid signal termination, where one RR acts as a "sink" for the other, and also exhibits a sigmoidal signal response, meaning the output remains low until a certain threshold is reached. The researchers identified conditions and parameters necessary for this sigmoid response and found that the level of sigmoidality can be controlled by the presence of the sink RR and an auxiliary protein that binds to HK. This system provides a tunable switch-like processing and a basis for developing threshold devices in synthetic biology.

The study analyzed the dynamics of a motif in bacterial signaling pathways where a single HK can reversibly phosphorylate two RRs, showing it accelerates signal termination and exhibits sigmoidal response. The findings offer a system perspective on natural signaling capabilities and avenues for reengineering. Exploiting the HK-RR system in synthetic circuits requires coupling an output (e.g. RR as transcription factor) to control HK activity. Two-component systems are used in bacteria, eukaryotes, and plants for signal transduction, consisting of HK and RR, with HK activity controlled by stimulus and autophosphorylation.

A generic model of HK-RR was developed and analyzed, showing it can enhance termination and implement threshold response, displaying sigmoidal relationship with low phosphorylated RR levels until threshold crossed. This has implications for bacterial physiology and synthetic circuits. The findings apply to two-component circuits with multiple regulators competing for phosphorylation.
Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to study how yeast cells respond to stress and found that individual cells within the same population show significant variation in tolerance to stress. This variation is not fully understood, so they used single-cell sequencing to quantify transcript changes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells with and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular factors that influence stress response. They found significant variation in yeast cells before and after stress, and a subset of cells decouples ribosomal gene expression from stress response in a way related to cell cycle but not yeast metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing fluorescent regulators revealed coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Transcript analysis suggests cells maintain a filter against decoupled bursts of factor activation but mount stress response coordinated, even in unstressed cells.

The study aimed to understand regulatory networks controlling heterogeneity in transcription and stress tolerance, which could lead to new ways to control population behavior. Results provide new insights into yeast stress response, but many questions remain. They addressed these through single-cell RNA-sequencing and single profiling of transcription factor dynamics before and after stress. Results show variable activation of ESR and condition regulators after stress and heterogeneity in ESR in unstressed due to coordinated and discordant induction E regulators. Cell-to-cell variation in M2 activation could explain heterogeneity stress in culture, but unclear if correlates with broader transcript changes or magnitude in unstressed cells mimics stressed.
Researchers have found that the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypaniasis, accumulates in the reproductive organs of male mice, including the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis. However, it is not found in the lumen of epididym duct or seminifer tubules of the test. This suggests that the majority of parasites are not in immune-privileged sites. Instead, they are associated with inflammatory cell infiltration, degeneration, and tissue rupture of epididym duct, which may lead to reduced fertility. The study shows that, like in the bloodstream and other tissues, male organs, T. bruce is exposed to a strong immune response. Detection of a high number of parasites in this organ opens the possibility of using needle aspiration cytology as a diagnostic tool in African trypaniasis. 

The epididym and test are surrounded by adipose tissue, epidid adipose, a reservoir of T. bruce parasites. Immunohistochemistry with anti-VSG antibody analyzed presence and distribution of tryosomes in test, epidid and epidid adip tissue. Parasites infiltrate fibrous tun that encloses test, but not test itself. Immunoflucent assay may have misidentified test for epidid. The majority of parasites are in epidid stroma and epidid adip tissue, not protected by tissue barriers. Data show T bruce infection is associated with inflammation in male reproductive organs, in tissues with parasites, epidid and epid adip, also test with no parasites. Inflammation is associated with disruption of blood-test and epid barriers at infection stages.
Researchers studied how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) respond to their environment through their sense of smell and taste. They found that the genes that help flies detect chemicals in their environment are regulated differently at different stages of life, between males and females, and in response to social interactions. When flies are exposed to the scent of the opposite sex, it changes which genes are turned on or off. This is different from when flies are in contact with the same or opposite sex. The researchers looked at how these genes work together and found that they are organized into small groups that respond to similar conditions. This allows the flies to fine-tune their sense of smell and taste in response to their environment. The study shows that the genes that help flies sense their environment are highly flexible and can change in response to different situations.
Studies of human trisomies have shown a link between abnormal meiotic recombination and nondisjunction at meiosis I or II. Specifically, failure to recombine or recombination events near or far from the centromeres are associated with human trisomies. Researchers used immunofluorescence to examine meiotic recombination in human females and studied crossover proteins (e.g., ML1) in fetal oocytes to analyze nondjunction-prone chromosomes and genome-wide recombination. Results show ML1 foci are lower than predicted, but pattern conforms to crossover protein expectations. Observations in individual chromosomes indicate "vulnerable" crossover in fetal oocytes, consistent with nondjunction events in adult oocytes.

Meiotic errors cause many chromosome abnormalities in humans, mostly from first division in oocyte. Studies over 10-20 years linked meiotic disturbances to human tris of maternal origin. Researchers evaluated ML1 as crossover marker in females and asked achmate and suboptimal crossover patterns in human meiosis. This report results on 103 prophase oocytes from 31 ovarian samples. Direct analyses crossover in fetal oocytes reveal "ulnerable" configurations consistent with tromic data (e.g., chromosome 16 distal exchanges, 21 proximal distal, achmate). If true, recombination patterns in tris reflected ML foci in pacheneocytes. However, not all clear, e.g., no "spikes" in dist or prox ML1 on 21, despite proximal dist associated tromy 21.
Exposure to the saliva of blood-feeding arthropods, such as mosquitoes and ticks, can have a significant impact on the progression of diseases they transmit. Research on Leishmaniasis and Arboviral infections suggests that pre-exposure to arthrop saliva can alter the immune response of the host, which can either exacerbate or limit symptoms, depending on the system in question. To understand how pre-exposure affects vector control, a model of vector-borne disease was developed. The study found that pre-exposed hosts should increase when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality rates. If pre-exposure leads to rapid clearance of infection, increasing mortality may achieve greater control than expected. However, if pre-ex prolongs duration of infection, control can increase total number of infected. Infections may go unnoticed unless active surveillance is used to detect subclinical individuals, who provide reservoir for transmission and long-term health consequences. Sensitivity analysis suggests negative consequences can be mitigated through integrated management. The immunological and clinical consequences of pre-exposure are largely uncharted for other vector-parite-host combinations. A range of epidemiological outcomes, positive and negative for health, underscore the need to quantify how pre-ex modulates recovery and transmission in vectororne diseases.
Leishmanias is a disease that affects 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases every year. Leish amazonensis is a major agent in Brazil, causing forms from localized cutaneous (L) to diffuse cutaneous leishmanias (D). Researchers studied how the immune system affects Leish proteins by comparing proteomes of amastigotes from BAL/c and BAL nude mice. Thymic nude mice resemble patients with cutaneous leishias, considered T-cell hypersensitive or anergic to Leish antigens. The study found proteins related to oxidative stress and proteases, including oligopeptase and tryparedin peroxidase, which are known Leish virulence factors. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting T cells restrain post-transl modifications in BAL mice. On the other hand, an iso of H70 was increased in amastotes from BAL mice. The study may identify virulence factors and ways of regulating expression.
Activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) plays a crucial role in immunoglobulin (Ig) gene diversification by deaminating cytosines in DNA, leading to somatic hypermutation (SH) and class recombination (CSR). However, A is highly mutagenic and causes genomic instability, contributing to chromosomal translocations in B cell malignancies. Researchers have found that A is regulated by the cell cycle, with degradation occurring more slowly in the G1 phase than in S or G-M phase. Mutations affecting phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter A stability and abundance. To test the role of cell regulation, A was tagged with cell cycle regulators CDT and Gemin to be degraded outside G1 or S2-M phases. Results show that A accelerates SH and CSR in G1, but compromises viability in S2-M. This suggests cell regulates A abundance and determines the ability to respond to A-initiated DNA damage.

A's stability is limited by proteosomal degradation and CRM-dependent export. Catalytic activity can be improved by site mutations, but also stimulate translocations and compromise viability. A-initiated damage can have pathological outcomes, such as chromosomal translocations in B malignancies. Low A levels in G2 may lead to high levels in G1, as seen in A-merryCD1 transfectants. A is a site of regulation, and phosphorylation downregulates SH and CSR.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how a type of bacteria called Clostridium phyfermentans breaks down plant biomass, which is important for the environment, food, and industry. They used three techniques: carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAzyme) assays, RNA sequencing, and anaerobic growth to analyze how the bacteria metabolize plant polysaccharides. Polysacides are complex sugars that make up plant cell walls. The researchers found that the bacteria can break down different types of polysacides with varying efficiency and prioritize some over others. They used RNA sequencing to see how the bacteria respond to polysides by upregulating specific groups of CAymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the sugars. Fifty-six upregulated CAymes were purified and shown to degrade polysides by multiple enzymes, often from the same family but with different specificities and localizations. These enzymes were tested in combination to identify synergies between acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. This study advances understanding of how microbes break down plant biomass. Clostridium phymentans is a soil bacteria with 171 CAyme-encoding genes, including 116 glycoside hydrolases in 44 families. It grows on a panel of plantacides and sugars. RNA sequencing revealed genes whose expression changed on various substrates. Elucidating how microbes metabolize polysides is key to understanding plant-degrading microbial communities and developing enzyme mixtures and recombinant microbes for industrial processing biomass.
In Sierra Leone conducted three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) to control lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 12 districts previously treated for onchocercias from 2008-2010. The MDAs had good geographic and drug coverage. A mid-term assessment in 2011 showed the impact on LF in these districts. Microfilaria (mf) prevalence fell from 2.6% to 0.3%, a decrease of 88.5%. Four districts had 0% prevalence: Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, and Kono. Seven districts had reductions of 70-95%: Bombali, Bonthe, Kail, Kambia, Koin, Kadugu, Portoko, and Tonkol. Pehun had 0% baseline prevalence, maintained. Bomb had 1.58% prevalence, the district with highest baseline 6.9%. Arithmetic mean mf density after MDs 17.59/ml, 65.4 decrease from 50.9/ml and 0.05/ml 96.2 decrease 1.32/ml. Results showed mf <1% in all but one district after MDs. Density reduced 65% among mf-positive and 95.8 for entire population.
Researchers have used high-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA profiling, to study microbial communities in oceans and the human gut. However, analyzing this data is challenging due to its compositional nature, meaning it's based on relative fractions of genes or species rather than absolute abundances. This can lead to unreliable results, as shown by Karl Pearson's work. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, researchers found that compositional effects can be widespread and severe, making many correlations artificial and opposite in sign. Diversity is a key factor that modulates the severity of these effects. A new approach, SparCC, was developed to estimate correlations from compositional data. It was applied to infer a network of interacting species across 18 human body sites. Compared to standard methods, SparCC found 3 spurious species interactions and missed 60% of true interactions in human microbiome data, with most errors in low-diversity samples.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common cause of pneumonia, resists the antimicrobial effects of lysozym, an enzyme found on mucosal surfaces. They found that lyzym's ability to break down peptoglycan, a component of the bacterial cell wall, is key to its antimicrobial effect. Two enzymes, Pgd and Ad, modify peptogcan to make it resistant to lyzym. Experiments with mice showed that pneumocci with these modifications outcompeted those without them when lyzym was present, but not when it was absent. This suggests that peog modifications help pneumoc survive in the presence of lyzym. However, when lyzym was absent, pneumoc without modifications had an advantage. The study shows that peog modifications can be beneficial or harmful depending on the environment.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a major arthropod-borne viral disease causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In Brazil, it is responsible for approximately 80% of deng cases in the Americas, with 5,944,270 cases reported since its introduction in 1986, including 21,596 deng hemorrhagic fever and 874 fatal cases. The study investigated the usefulness of NS1 capture as an alternative to detect DENV in tissue from confirmed deng fatal cases (n=23) in 2002. A total 74 tissue specimens were available: liver (n=23), lung (n=14), kidney (n=4), brain (n=10), heart (n=2), skin (n=1), spleen (n=15), thym (n=3), and lymph (n=2). Three tests for NS1 capture were evaluated: Deng Early ELISA (Pan Diagnostics), Plat NS1 (Bio Laboratories), and rapid NS1 Strip (Bio). Overall, deng fatal diagnosis based on tissues by Deng EL, Plat and NS1 was 34.7% (8/23), 60.8 (14), and 91.3 (21) respectively. Deng EL detected NS1 in 22.9 (17) of specimens and Plat NS in 45.9 (34). The highest sensitivity 78.3 (58) was achieved by NS Strip, with significant differences in sensitivities (p<0.05). NS Strip was most sensitive in liver (91.3), lung (71.4), kidney (100), brain (80), spleen (66.6), and thym (100) compared to other EL assays. This study shows DENV NS capture as a valuable postmortem deng confirmation.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of 718 multiple myeloma (MM) tumor samples from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's Compass Interim Analysis 9 study to investigate differences in molecular alterations between African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) cases. They used somatic whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing to identify mutations and correlated them with self-reported race and genetic ancestry. The study found significant differences in mutation frequencies between the two groups, with B7, BR3, and AUT2 showing higher frequencies in AA cases, which are involved in B-cell malignancies. TP53 and IRF4 mutations were more common in CA cases. This study is one of the most comprehensive genomic analyses of MM in patients of African descent and highlights potential ancestry-related differences in myelogenesis. Three genes known to be involved in B malignancy translocations are new candidates that may have been overlooked due to lack of AA in large genomic efforts. The study emphasizes the need for deeper understanding of oncogenic processes in multi-ethnic cohorts to address disparities in incidence and outcomes among AA patients.
Researchers have found that most mutations in cancer cells are "passengers," which don't affect the cell's ability to reproduce. Passengers can provide information about the cancer's history and serve as a molecular clock. They can also be targets for treatment or treatment resistance. Scientists studied the growth of cancer cells in tumors and metastases by looking forward in time and backward. They calculated the probability and frequency of passenger mutations by time of appearance. This helped create a tree of cancer evolution in individual patients. By looking backward, they estimated the number of cancer cells present when a mutation arose. They derived formulas for subclonal mutations and frequency. Fitting these formulas to sequencing data estimated birth and death rates of cancer cells during early stages.

The ratio of birth and death rates determines the cancer's tree shape, which is star-shaped for fast growth and linear for slow. If a mutation has a certain frequency, how many cells were present when it arose? The answer varies with death-birth ratio, which changes from 0 to 0.99. Frequencies of first and most passengers are influenced by mutation and death-birth ratio. If close to 1, several passengers may not be in the first cell but collected during expansion. If 0.99, about 150 passengers are in more than 1% cells. The formula can be fitted to data to describe the process and extract parameters. It was applied to colorectal cancer data and found neutral evolution during expansion. Passengers can be used to infer the process. For close to 1, the number of subcl above 50 is equal to collected during progression. Subtracting subcl above 50 from allcl will estimate the number in the first cell.
Researchers studied how a protein called huntingtin, which is linked to Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. They looked at how a part of the protein called exon 1 (X1) misfolds when it has many glutamines, a type of amino acid. When there are too many glutamines, X1 can form clumps similar to those found in the disease. The team wanted to understand how X1 misolds to form these clumps. They used computer simulations to study X1 with and its surrounding regions, and found that these regions affect how X1 misolds. The more glutamines X1 has, the more likely it is to form a certain shape that leads to clumps. The surrounding regions of X1 also play a role in this process, with some parts helping to prevent X from forming clumps. The first 17 amino acids of X are more likely to form a certain shape when there are many glutamines. This study helps understand how X1 misolds and how it relates to disease.
Researchers have studied the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats) system, a defense mechanism used by bacteria and archaea to protect against foreign DNA, such as viruses and plasmids. They analyzed over 700 metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project to explore the distribution and diversity of CRPRs in human microbiomes and discover new ones. A targeted assembly strategy was developed to reconstruct CRPR arrays that whole-genome assemblies failed to identify. For each known CRPR type, a consensus sequence was used to recruit reads from datasets and assemble into CRPR loci, extracting unique sequences for analysis. Novel CRPRs were also identified in whole-genome assemblies and targeted to comprehensively identify CRs across samples.

The distribution of CRPRs, including 64 known and 86 novel ones, were largely site-specific. Detailed analysis of several CRPR loci, including novel ones, showed that streptocococcal CRPRs were found in oral microbiomes with ~8,000 unique spacers. Samples from the same individual and site shared most spacers, while different sites from the same individual shared fewer, and individuals almost none. This indicates niche differences impact on CRPR evolution. CRPRs were also used to trace rare species and virus exposure in individuals. The study highlights the importance of identifying CRPR loci for microbiome ecology.

A targeted assembly strategy improved CRPR detection in metagenomic sequences, compared to whole-genome assemblies. Known CRPRs were identified in more human datasets, and novel ones in whole-genome assemblies. A list of known and novel CRPRs was prepared for further study. The strategy is efficient for comprehensive CRPR characterization in human datasets.
Scientists have studied the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to understand its circadian rhythms, or internal biological clocks that synchronize with environmental signals like light and temperature. Previous research showed behavioral rhythms in C. elegans were not robust, and no circadian transcriptional rhythms were identified. This study used genome-wide expression experiments to find light and temperature-entrained transcripts in C. elegans, which exhibited rhythmic expression with 24-hour periods and sustained under constant conditions, indicating circadian regulation. Light and temperature drove gene expression and entrained largely non-overlapping sets. Mutations in a cyclic nucleotide channel required for sensory transduction abolished light and temperature-entrained gene expression, suggesting environmental cues act non-autonomously entrain circadian rhythms. Findings demonstrate circadian-transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and suggest further analysis will provide new information on the evolution and function of this biological clock.
Researchers have studied the effects of mutations in the RAD3 gene in yeast, which is a homolog of the human XPD gene involved in DNA repair and transcription. Two mutant alleles, rad-101 and rad-102, have defects in DNA repair and a hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies suggested that the hyper-Rec phenotype is due to single-stranded DNA gaps converted to double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. However, these studies did not detect reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. The researchers used a system to recover reciprocal mitotic recombination products and found that rad-101 and rad-102 increased crossovers by 100-fold. Mapping showed that three-quarters of crosso reflect DSBs in both sister chromatids (double-chromat breaks, DSBs) and the remainder in single chromatids (SCBs). The ratio of DSBs to SCs is similar to spontaneous recombination in wild-type cells. They mapped 216 genomic alterations, including crosso, conversions, deletions, and duplications, and found an association with regions of recombination and gamma-H2AX. A hotspot for deletions and duplications was found at IMA and H11 near the end of chromosome XV. Comparison with spontaneous recombination in wild-type suggests that some events may be initiated by incomplete repair and DSBs that cannot be repaired by sisterchromatid recombination.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, has a set of simple sequence repeats (SSR) that generate heterogeneous populations through slipped mispairing, allowing adaptation to the changing host environment. Researchers found that an intergenic tract, via slipped mispair, operates as a rheostat to fine-tune expression of the sialic acid adhesin, SabA. They used isogenic strains with varying tract length to show that it affects Sab promoter output, altering H. pylori binding to sial-Lewis receptors on gastric mucosa. Analysis of post-infection clones revealed variable tract length in H. pylori, mirroring host-pathogen interplay where the bacterium generates clones with best-fit phenotypes. In silico and in vitro analyzes showed tract length affects DNA structure and RNA polymerase binding, shifting axial alignment between promoter and UP elements. Additional H. pyl genes with similar tracts show variations modulate promoter output. The study proposes a mechanism mediated by promoter-prox SSR for transcription regulation in bacteria with limited transacting factors.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade the immune system to establish persistent infections and amplify its genome upon cell differentiation. Researchers found that the JAK/STAT transcription regulator, STAT5, activates the DNA damage pathway to induce HPV genome amplification in epithelial cells. STAT5 is a member of the J/STAT family that modulates the inflammatory response and plays a role in cell cycle progression in response to cytokines and growth factors. Studies show that HPV protein E7 activates STAT5 without altering total levels. Inhibiting STAT5 with a drug abolishes genome amplification and late expression in differentiating keratinocytes, but has no effect on undifferentiated cells maintaining episomes. Knockdown studies show STAT5 isoform is responsible and mediated through ATM damage response. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) contributes to effects on ATM pathway. These findings identify a new mechanism where immune regulator STAT5 promotes viral replication through DNA damage response.
Researchers in Nepal identified 13 antigens from Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi that are expressed in the biliary tract of chronic carriers, but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area. These antigens include putative proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. One antigen, YE (ST147), an uncharacterized with ATP-binding motif, gave prominent responses in screen. The response to YE in patients with biliary tract S. Typhi was compared to those without S. Typhi, patients with tyoid fever, and healthy controls. Seven of 10 (70%) chronic carriers, 0 of 8 (0%) bile-negative controls, 0 8 (0%) healthy, and 1 8 (12.5%) Bangladeshis with tyoid had detectable anti-YE IgG in blood. Ig responses were also present. Further evaluation of YE and other antigens by IVAT could lead to improved diagnostic for asymptomatic S. Ty carriers.
Researchers have discovered a new epigenetic phenomenon called transactivation, where non-functional copies of a gene can reactivate the expression of a silenced version of the same gene. This occurs when a non-functional allele of the white gene, which doesn't produce a coding transcript, interacts with a functional copy of the same gene silenced by heterochromatin. The study found that the presence of homologous RNA is necessary for transactivation, and mutations in genes involved in post-transcription silencing affect it. This new level of gene control by homolog RNA in heterochromatic genes was unexpected.

In experiments, non-functional white alleles of the classic marker gene transactivated the expression of a wild-type white gene silenced by heterochatin. The researchers called this phenomenon transactivation. They found that a gene producing only spurious transcription can reactivate a functional copy of the same gene silenced heterochatin, revealing a new level of gene control in heterromatic genes. Data indicate transactivation is a new epetic phenomenon controlling gene expression in heterochatin through homolog RNA.

The mechanisms and features of transactivation differ from other epigenetic events like paramutation, transduction, and transvection. In transactivation, non-coding RNAs influence the transcription state of homolog locus silenced heterochatin. Notably, non-functional white alleles increased the wmh transcript and opened chromatin at the wmh locus. Transactivation is heritable and relies on diffusible homolog RNA, and is affected by genes in postcription silencing.
Researchers have identified a protein called Boophil in the midgut of a tick, Rhipphalus microplus, which is a vector of babesiosis. This protein is a multifunctional enzyme inhibitor that targets thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein. The study aimed to determine how Boophil interacts with these enzymes, modulates platelet function, and inhibits thrombosis in vivo. Boophil was expressed in HEK cells and purified to homogeneity. Using amidolytic and surface plasmon resonance experiments, it was found that Boophil behaves as a classical non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to chromogenic substrates, dependent on both exosite and catalytic site. This inhibition is accompanied by blockade of plate aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot throm in vitro. Boophil also inhibits FXa, preventing activation and kikrein activity, indicating it targets the contact pathway. Additionally, it abates catheps G and plmin-induced plate aggregation and affects elastase cleavage of Tissue Pathway Inhibitor TF. Boophil inhibits carot artery occlusion in vivo by Fe3 and promotes bleeding in mice tail transection. Through inhibition of several enzymes in proteolytic cascades and cell activation, Boophil plays a role in keeping midut environment low hemost and inflammatory response, allowing ticks to digest blood for metabolism and egg development.
Researchers have developed a computer model called the Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEMT) to study how inflammation affects the lining of the intestines. This lining, called the mucosa, is crucial for absorbing nutrients and protecting the body from harm. Its structure and function are closely linked, and changes in its architecture can lead to various diseases. Inflammation is a key factor in many gastrointestinal diseases and can alter the mucosa's shape. To understand how inflammation influences the mucosa, the researchers created SEMT to simulate how enteric epithelial cells behave under different conditions, from healthy to diseased. SEMT reproduces healthy mucosal dynamics and mimics experiments where certain genes are turned off. It also reveals mechanisms like how a protein, PTEN/PIK, connects inflammation and tissue growth, and how cell shedding helps protect against ischemia and chronic inflammation. These findings suggest SEMT can study inflammation in gastrointestinal diseases.

SEMT combines modules for cell signaling, inflammation, proliferation, movement, and morphogen diffusion to maintain mucosa architecture. An agent-based model simulates cellular and molecular interactions maintaining mucosal architecture. SE models crypt-villus tissue as cells replicate, migrate, differentiate, and respond to inflammation. SEMT can represent large epithelial surfaces and is a work in progress, with a minimal set of components to represent mechanisms maintaining mucosal morphogenesis and response to perturbations. Researchers propose diseases can be unified by viewing mucosal architecture as controlled by morph pathways, balancing multiple objectives in health, but disturbed in disease.
Researchers studied the effectiveness of Wolbachia, a bacterium that reduces arbovirus transmission, in controlling Aedes aegypt populations. Traditional methods like insecticide spraying and source reduction have limited success. Wolia was released in a community in Rio de Janeiro for 20 weeks, but failed to spread due to high pyreoid resistance in mosquitoes. A new strain, wRio, was created by crossing wBr females with males from the field to introduce pyre resistance. wRio increased mosquito survival but negatively affected fecundity. Despite this, wRio established where wBr failed, highlighting the importance of matching local genetics, especially pyre resistance, for invasion. Household support was high, reaching 90% for the second release. Temperature did not affect w expression on Brazilian background. Wolia should match insecticide profile of wild population for invasion. Pyre resistance is widespread in Ae populations, future deployments must maintain resistance in lab colonies.
Researchers studied the role of the vaccinia B protein in the poxvirus, a type of virus that causes smallpox and cowpox. They found that the B protein plays a crucial role inactivating a cellular antiviral factor called B, which helps the virus replicate. To understand how B works, they created a virus without the B gene and let it evolve over time to see how it adapts. They found that mutations in the B pseudokinase, a part of the B protein, gave the virus a fitness boost. This suggests that losing the pseudokinase can be beneficial for the virus. They also found that the pseudokin localizes to the nucleus, a rare for a poxiral protein, and reduces B phosphorylation when present, indicating it may enhance antiral activity of B. The study shows that a paralog kinase-pseudase pair can have an epistatic relationship, enhancing B conservation during pox evolution and orchestrating nuclear events during infection.
Researchers studied the behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKKLLKKLL (L) and EAAEAAEAAE (E), designed to form an alpha-helix structure due to their amphipathic properties. These peptides are too short to form stable structures on their own and are often disordered in solution. The team used molecular simulations to analyze their conformation in bulk water and at macroscopic interfaces. They found that the peptides are neither random coils nor fully helices, but adopt multiple conformations with short lifetimes. Conformation changes with environment, such as pH or presence of interfaces. The peptides' response to interfaces depends on their inherent helical tendency in water and surface charge and hydrophobicity.
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a common virus that infects humans in the first years of life and remains latent in various cell types. It can integrate its genome into the telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells, but the mechanism of integration is unclear. Interestingly, HH-6 and other herpesviruses have telomeric repeats (TMR) similar to human telomeres at the end of their genomes. The HH-6 genome has two T arrays, perfect (pMR) and imperfect (impMR). To determine if T are involved in integration, researchers deleted p and imp in the HH-6 genome and reconstituted the virus. Replication was comparable to wild-type, indicating T are not essential for HH-6 replication. To assess integration, an in vitro system was established to evaluate efficiency and maintenance in latently infected cells. Integration of HH-6 was impaired without T and the genome was lost, suggesting integration is crucial for maintenance. Individual deletion of p and imp revealed p plays major role in HH-6 integration, while imp makes minor contribution, establishing a model for HH-6 integration. Data show T are dispensable for replication but crucial for integration and maintenance in latently infected cells.
Researchers have discovered the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the protein D13, a key component of the outer scaffold of vaccinia virus, a type of poxvirus. The structure reveals a double-barrel organization with two jellyroll domains and a head domain that assembles into trimers similar to those of adenovirus and icosahedral viruses. When attached to artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb-like structure similar to the virus's immature particles. This suggests that poxviruses use an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral viruses, infecting all kingdoms of life. The protein D13 is essential for the first step of poxirus morphogenesis, as it can form immature particles without other viral factors, and its neutralization by mutation or rifampin inhibits assembly. The structure of D13 will aid in developing poxirus inhibitors.
Researchers studied the role of auxin and ethylene in root growth in the plant Brachypodium distyon. They found that a mutant with reduced tryptophanminotransferase activity, which is essential for auxin production, had longer roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This contrasts with Arabidopsis, where reduced tryophminotransferase activity leads to reduced root growth and lower auxin levels. In Brachodium, ethylene may inhibit the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis, making aux levels suboptimal for cell elongation. The study reveals a delicate balance between auxin and ethylene to control cell elongation in Brachodium roots and suggests alternative wiring of aux-ethylene crosstalk compared to Arabidopsis. Aux levels are elevated in Brach roots with reduced tryophminotransfer activity, not due to alternative biosynthesis pathways but increased expression of YCCA genes, which convert indole-3-pyruvic acid to auxin. YCCA expression is downregulated by ethylene precursor 1-aminoclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and upregulated in eth-signaling component ethylene 2-like 1, which also displays Brach root phenotype.
Researchers studied how genes in yeast species evolve at different rates and found that the organization of their promoters, called nucleosomes, plays a key role. Genes without a nucleosome-free region, called OP, vary widely between species, while those with a nucleosome region, DPN, remain similar. To see if early evolution affects this difference, they artificially selected for high expression of a protein and surprisingly, both OP and DPN genes increased equally. However, they adapted in different ways: DPN duplicated large regions, while OP favored mutations. When selection stopped, DPN returned to normal levels, but OP did not. This suggests that promoter organization affects early evolution and biases its path. 

In yeast, gene expression divergence is linked to nucleosome organization, connecting evolution with regulation. Genes that diverged quickly lack a nucleosome near start site, OP, while DPN remained conserved. When selection stopped, DPN returned to normal, but OP did not. Results suggest promoter impacts early dynamics and long-term evolution. To test if OP and DPN differ in response to selection, they selected high expression and examined genomic response. Dozens of proteins increased, regardless of class. Forty proteins with mid-to-high levels, no preference, were chosen, distributed between DPN and OP, quantified by nucleosome occupancy. Alternatively, DPN and OP may be subject to similar forces, but more easily satisfied by OP due flexible structure, supporting flexible organization directs evolution path.
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is a cancer-causing virus that activates a protein called Tax, which promotes cell growth and transformation. However, paradoxically, Tax also triggers a cellular aging process called senescence in most cells. Senescence is caused by increased levels of proteins p21 and p27, which are cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that prevent cell division. Researchers found that senescence is a response to Tax's activation of a protein complex called IK/NF-κ, which is involved in cell growth and survival. Senesc induced by Tax in HeLa cells is reduced by mutations that decrease IK/NF-κ activation and prevented by blocking IK-α, a protein that regulates NF-κ. Knockdown of Rel, a subunit of NF-κ, shows it induces senescence by stabilizing p27 and p21 mRNA. The HT-1 anti-sense protein, HB, downregulates NF-κ, delaying Tax-induced senescence. The balance between Tax and HB expression determines HT-1 infection outcome. Elevated Tax drives IK/NF-κ activation and senesc, while HB modulates Tax replication and NF-κ, allowing HT- infected cells to proliferate and persist. Inactivation of senescence can lead to persistent NF- activation and leukemia.
Researchers have proposed a new model of how the frontal lobe, a part of the brain, helps us make decisions in uncertain and changing situations. Current models don't fully explain how we make decisions in everyday life. The new model, called PRO, shows how the frontal lobe works in real-life situations and why people make different choices. It says the frontalobe monitors up to four strategies at a time and chooses the best one that works. If one doesn't work, it tries a new one from memory and checks if it's good, then uses it. The model shows the frontalobe has a limit of four strategies, but makes up for it by creating new ones in uncertain situations. This helps us adapt to new situations.

The model, PRO, explains how the frontalobe creates, stores, and chooses strategies for action. It shows how it balances trying new and using what we already know to make good choices. The study supports the idea that the frontalobe uses reasoning, learning, and creativity to make good decisions. The model shows how the frontalobe makes many strategies for action in changing situations. It uses what we already know and creates new ones to make good choices.

The frontalobe manages what we do by using what we know from memory. It adjusts what we do to get the best outcome. But how do we make many strategies and choose new ones? Little is known about how the frontalobe chooses between using what we know, switching to new, or making new ones.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to study the long-term effects of pharmacological treatments on diseases. This method uses mathematical modeling to predict how molecular adaptations change over time in response to treatment. A time-dependent parameters are used to describe the dynamics of these changes, making use of experimental data from different stages of the intervention. This approach provides insight into the underlying biological systems and identifies areas for further study to understand the treatment outcome.

ADAPT was used to investigate the effects of activating the liver receptor LXR, a potential target for treating atherosclerosis. Unexpectedly, the analysis showed that the liver's ability to clear cholesterol decreased with prolonged treatment, contradicting the expected increase in cholesterol efflux and excretion. This was confirmed by experimental measurements of the scavenger receptor B1 in liver membranes.

ADAPT can also identify potential side effects and design new interventions to prevent them. The method employs time-dependent parameters to capture interactions with the proteome and transcriptome, which are often not well understood. It was applied to a model of hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism to predict adaptations upon treatment with the LXR agonist T131.
Researchers have proposed a new hypothesis on how the spinal and cerebellar neuronal circuitry works together to coordinate multi-segment limbs and bodies. They suggest that sensory and motor signals are combined in the neurons of the spinocerebell pathways, allowing for a wide range of functions, including spatial and temporal dependencies between limb segments. However, the number of granule cells limits the number of recombinations that can be represented in the cerebellum, making random recombination of sensory and motor signals not a good strategy. Instead, the spinal circuit provides useful recombinations, described as linear projections through multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. Granule cells, aided by Golgi cells, enhance these projections, allowing Purkin cells to approximate non-linear functions. This hypothesis provides a new view on the function of spinal and cerebell gran layer, illustrating how the cerebellum's coordinating functions are supported by recombinations from the spinocbell system.

The spinocbell system avoids superfluous recombinations by combining signals and commands in individual neurons, allowing "good" recombinations to be formed with high probability. The spinal circuit makes sensorimotor functions available to the cerebell through SCT systems, and the granule receives this information. The spinocbell network's structure before the gran layer must be considered to lift the curse of dimensionality. A simplified example of controlling a planar double arm illustrates coordination. The researchers seek a theoretical explanation for these observations in terms of spinal and cerear circuitry, providing integration across dimensions for coordination.
Researchers used next-generation sequencing to study the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the Chikungunya virus (CHV). They identified 88 known and 79 miRNAs in uninfected and CHV infected mosquitoes, respectively, and nine novel miRNAs in mosquitoes. The study found that CHV infection altered the expression of 77 miRNAs, specifically eight of which were upregulated. The researchers predicted the targets of these miRN and classified them into pathways. This study provides insight into the modification of miRN during CHV infection and identifies potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies. 

The researchers used next-generation sequencing to profile miRN in Aedes aegypt cell line upon CHV infection. They identified 90 miRN in mosquitoes, eight of which were common to uninf and infected and differentially regulated upon CHV. Computational analysis predicted the targets of modulated mi and studied pathways in mosquitoes. The study analyzed the distribution and abundance of mi and evaluated modulation upon CHV. Prediction and pathway analysis of mi shed light on the role of mi in CHV infection.
A study estimated the economic burden of Cysticercosis (CE) in Iran, a parasitic disease affecting humans and livestock. The study used data from hospitals, literature, and government reports to determine the prevalence and incidence of CE in humans and animals. It also obtained economic data on treatment costs, productivity losses, and livestock losses from national and international datasets. Monte Carlo methods were used to account for uncertainty. The study estimated 1,295 surgical cases of CE per year from 2000-2009 and 635,232 asymptomatic individuals living in the country. The overall cost of CE in Iran was estimated at $232.3 million, including direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was $93.3 million and livestock $132 million. The cost per case was $1,539. CE has a significant impact on Iran, costing 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. A surveillance system and control program are necessary to reduce the burden. A cost-benefit analysis of control programs is recommended, incorporating losses due to CE in Iran.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of mouse polyomavirus (MPV) infection in mouse cells to understand how the virus interacts with its host and regulates gene expression. They used deep sequencing to follow MPV infection in NIH3T cells at various times and analyzed both viral and cellular transcriptomes. The study revealed a dynamic regulation of viral and host gene expression, including widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts late in infection. By 36 hours, 359 host genes were upregulated and 857 downregulated. Gene ontology analysis showed transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated, while those in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc binding, SH domain, and GTP activation were downregulated. Noncoding RNAs were also altered, with MALAT1, involved in splicing and a marker in late cancers, downregulated and others upregulated. This study provides new insights into MPV lifecycle and its effects on cell growth and metabolism.
Hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon each year, but many experience severe performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, known as "hitting the wall," and drop out before the finish. Analyses of endurance have suggested that glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, making "hitting the wall" inevitable, or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon without "hitting the wall." However, a new study demonstrates that energetic constraints on runners are more subtle and depend on physiologic variables, including muscle mass, liver glycogen, and running intensity, in personalized and quantifiable ways. The study estimates the distance at which runners exhaust glyc stores as a function of intensity, providing a basis for guidelines to ensure safety and optimize performance by setting paces and prescribing mid-race fueling to avoid "the wall." The analysis sheds light on standards in marathon that have remained empirically defined, such as qualifying times for the Boston Marathon.

Carbohydrate loading before running influences performance by permitting a runner of given capacity and muscle to run at speeds without "hitting the wall," succumbing to exhaustion. Typical glyc loading allows runners to complete a marathon safely between four and five hours, as indicated by intersections with the border of the "Gcogen Supercompensation" region. The likelihood of "hitting" during a marathon peaks around mile 21, followed by a decline. The model incorporates running cost and dependence on exertion, revealing dependencies of distance to glyc depletion and fastest pace without exhausting stores.
Researchers studied how different strains of Toxoplas, a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, interact with mouse immune cells called macrophages. They infected mouse macrophages with 29 different Tooplas strains from around the world and used a technique called RNA-sequencing to see how the parasite and host cells respond. The study found that different strains of Tooplas have unique ways of interacting with macrophages. Some strains activated a strong inflammatory response, while others did not. They also found that atypical strains, not part of the main group I, II, and III, activated a type of interferon called IFβ in macrophages, which helped kill the parasite. This was independent of another type of interferon, gamma, and dependent on receptors in the cell called Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic retic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG) in fibroblasts. The study showed that atypical strains have unique ways of interacting with host cells, which might explain why they cause more severe disease in humans. The research provides a global view of how cells and parasite respond to infection with both typical and atypical Tooplas, and identifies new host responses and parasite effectors specific to each strain.
Researchers have studied the process of recombination in enteroviruses, a mechanism that allows these viruses to acquire new genetic material and contribute to their diversity and the emergence of new strains. Despite its importance, the process is not well understood. They used a new approach to isolate chimeric polioviruses with duplicated sequences at the recombination site and found that these viruses with imprecise junctions had increased fitness. However, these viruses lost the duplicated sequences over time. Mutations that affected the polymerase or replication altered the yield of recombinants, but not non-recombinant viruses. This suggests that recombination is a replicative process that can be enhanced or reduced. The study proposes that recombinants result from a biphasic process: an initial recombination followed by resolution of extraneous sequences and optimization of fitness. This has implications for understanding evolution in positive-strand RNA viruses.
Researchers have identified a new route for the clearance of norepinephrine (NE) in white adipose tissue, which is mediated by the organic cation transporter 3 (Oct) in adipocytes. This route is distinct from previously known routes such as sympathetic neurons or macrophages. Oct is highly expressed in white adipose tissue and has the greatest uptake rate of NE compared to other routes. Adipocytes express high levels of enzymes for NE degradation, providing the basis for clearance by Oct. Administration of Oct ablation induces higher thermogenesis and lipolysis compared to controls. After cold challenge, white adipose tissue in Oct-deficient mice shows stronger browning and elevated thermogenic genes, involving β-adrenergic receptor activation. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed to compensate for loss of ATP in Oct-deficient mice. Inhibition of β-AR abolishes lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct-deficient adipose. Reduced alleles of Oct are associated with increased basal metabolic rate. Oct governs β-activity as a NE transporter in adipocytes, offering therapeutic potential for metabolic disorders.
Researchers have found that the protein HP1 proteins, which play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, interact with a specific region of histone H3, a key component of chromatin, in addition to their known binding to methylated histone tails. This region, called the globular domain, is located at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin structure, and is also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, which remodels chromatin. The interaction between HP1 and the glob domain of histone H is necessary for HP-mediated repression, as SW/S remodeling is inhibited in the presence of HP proteins. In contrast, SW/S functions as an activator, HP proteins are recruited by methylated histone tails and may function as sensors of unwanted SW activity, binding to uncovered nucleosomes and blocking the reaction. The study suggests that HP proteins use this property to detect and arrest chromatin remodeling.
Researchers have identified a property of RNA called self-containment, which refers to the tendency of a sequence to maintain its secondary structure regardless of its surrounding nucleotide context. They developed a scoring method called the self-containment index to measure this property and found that microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit high self-containment, consistent with their requirement for structural invariance during biogenesis. In contrast, most other structured RNAs do not show self-containment. Analysis revealed a trend towards higher self-containment among conserved miRNAs, suggesting it may be a characteristic of miRN acquiring new genomic contexts. miRNAs display enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, and a trend towards natural selection for self-cont in functional classes. The researchers suggest self-cont arises from selection for robustness against perturbations and invariance during biogenesis and modular composition of function. Self-cont will be important for RNA annotation and design.
Researchers have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that play a crucial role in limiting the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea and Plectphaella cucina. Mutants defective in any of these TFs showed increased susceptibility to these pathogens, indicating their importance in disease resistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed a common signature of 77 up-regulated genes in these mutants, including several encoding secreted peptides named PROIR (provulence factors). Forward and reverse genetic analysis showed many PROIRs contribute to disease susceptibility to necrophic pathogens. The TFs and PROIRs identified are novel determinants of plant susceptibility to necrophic fungal pathogens.
A protein called FOX1 plays a crucial role in making the uterus ready for embryo implantation. The uterus needs to be receptive for the embryo to attach and grow. If the uterus is not ready, it can lead to pregnancy loss or failed attempts at in vitro fertilization. Researchers found that removing FOX1 from the uterus in mice made them infertile due to changes in cell structure and increased cell death. They also found changes in gene expression related to cell invasion, transport, and signaling pathways that help the uterus prepare for implantation. One of these changes was an increase in progesterone receptor (PGR) signaling, which was due to PGR staying in the uterus cells during the implantation window. PGR and FOX1 have a reciprocal relationship, with P staying in the nucleus and FOX1 in the cytoplasm. This was also seen in human uterus samples during the menstrual cycle. The study suggests that FOX1 and PGR work together to make the uterus ready for implantation.
Researchers developed a statistical model to map the spread of deng cases in Bangladesh, accounting for the problem of under-reporting, where many cases go unrecorded. They analyzed district-level data from 2000 to 2009, using a negative binomial generalized linear mixed model that accounted for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal effects. The model found that mean temperature and its interaction with temperature range, lagged by two months, were significantly associated with deng incidence. Densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence. The model estimated that 92% of annual deng cases occurred between August and September. Cases were reported across the country, with 94% in the capital Dhaka, located in the middle. Less than half of affected districts reported cases as observed from surveillance data. The proportion varied by month, with higher in high-incidence districts but dropped towards the end of transmission.

The study provides model-based estimates of monthly deng distribution in Bangladesh, accounting for under-reporting. It contributes to prioritizing and targeting deng control and elimination across the country. However, under-reporting was not considered, nor geographical variation in transmission factors like climate and socio-demographics. The aim was to map monthly variation in deng incidence at district-level in relation to climatic and demographic factors, adjusting for under-report.
Researchers have discovered a new type of preferred places that mice visit in an open environments, which they call "knots". These places are characterized by high tortuous paths with twists and turns, and are typically visited sporadically during a session. Mice perform a behavior called "knot-scribling" while in these places, which involves tracing a winding path with twists and turns. Knots are distinct from "home" places, where mice spend most of their time, and are often located near the point of entry into the arena. Unlike home places, knots have high speed on the way in and low speed on the way out. The establishment of knots is influenced by stress and arousal, as injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed area enhances the formation of knots. In an environment without cues, mice create a self-generated landmark by twisting and turning, creating a centrally located knot. Knot-scribling may help mice obtain an overview of the environment, recalibrate their map and compass, and improve interpretation of the scene through vestibular input.
A new compound called NG04 has been identified as a potential treatment for fungal infections caused by the pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. This fungus is a major cause of death worldwide, especially in people with weakened immune systems. NG04 was found to be effective in killing the fungus while sparing human cells. Researchers used high-resolution techniques to identify the protein Sec14 as the target of NG04. Sec14 is involved in the fungus's ability to cause disease and is also essential for its survival. Mutations in Sec14 made the fungus resistant to NG04. The team tested NG04 on clinical isolates of the fungus and found it inhibited growth. NG04 also showed activity against a strain resistant to the common treatment fluconazole. The study suggests NG04 as a starting point for new antifungal treatment.
Researchers have identified a potential new treatment for schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is often linked to poverty. The current treatment, praziquel, may not be effective due to parasite resistance, so new options are needed. Mefloquine, an antimal drug, shows promise in treating schosomiasis in mice. A single dose of meflo (200-400mg) reduced worm burden by 72-100% in mice infected with adult Schistoma mansoni or S japonicum. Importantly, young stages of the parasite were also affected. Both meflo enantiomers were effective in mice with subpatent or patent infections. Further studies will explore how meflo works and its effect on other parasites. Malaria and schosias coexist in some areas, so it will be interesting to see if meflo can treat both.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to map the distribution of podoiosis, a non-filar elephantiasis that causes massive swelling of the lower legs. Podoiosis was identified as a neglected disease by the World Health Organization in 2011. The study used a multi-stage sampling design and surveyed 76 villages from 40 districts in 10 regions of Cameroon. Individuals 15 years old or older were screened for lymphedema, and a clinical algorithm was used to diagnose podoiosis excluding filarial lymphema. Of 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated, 83 with lymphema were identified, but none were positive for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen or DNA. 52 cases of podoiosis were identified after applying the clinical algorithm, with a prevalence of 0.5% (95% CI 0.4-0.7). Podoiosis was found in every region except two villages in Adamawa, with 17 districts having no cases, 15 with 0.2-1% and 8 with 1.2-2.7%. The study demonstrates low but widespread distribution of podoiosis in Cameroon. Designing a podoiosis control is vital, a health response to the burden is important through surveillance and morbidity services.
Notch signaling plays a crucial role in regulating the adhesion of germline stem cells (GSCs) to their niche in Drosophila. As flies age, Notch signaling increases in GSCs, leading to their removal from the niche. Research shows that Gs with low levels of Notch signaling exhibit increased adhesion to the niche, outcompeting neighbors with higher levels of Notch. Adhesion is altered through regulation of E-cadherin expression. Enhancing Not signaling in Gs hastens age-dependent loss from niche, and is partially mediated by lethal. Disrupting Not signaling in Gs does not delay G loss during aging, nor affects BMP signaling, which promotes self-renewal of Gs. In contrast, Not activation in niche maintains niche integrity, mediating G retention, is reduced with age, indicating Not regulates niche occupancy both intrinsically and extrinsically.
Researchers studied the UL97 protein of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a kinase that phosphorylates the retinoblastoma (R) tumor suppressor and lamin A proteins, which are also substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). They found that UL97 has authentic CDK-like activity. Seven human herpesviruses encode a kinase with sequence homology to UL97, termed conserved herpesvirus kinases (CHPs). To determine if CD-like activities of UL were shared by all CHPs, the researchers expressed epitope-tagged alleles of each protein in human cells to test R phosphorylation, lamin A and nuclear disruption, or S. cerevisiae to assay CD function. They found that ability to phosphorylate R and lamin was shared by all CHPs from beta and gamma-herpesviruses, but not alpha-herpesvir homologs. Similarly, all beta and gamma CHPs displayed CD activity in S. cerevis, while alpha did not. Researchers identified virally CD-like kinases, nomenclature abbreviated as v-CDs. They found other non-CD activities for UL (dispersion promylocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and cytoplasmic nuclear aggres) weakly conserved among CHPs, not segregating to viral families. Data indicate these kinases, targets of approved antiviral drugs, serve overlapping and non-overlapping functions during infections.
A systematic review was conducted to determine the global distribution of Burkholderia pseudallei, a bacterium that causes meloidosis, and to develop guidelines for environmental sampling. The review found that the distribution of B. pseudallei is patchy, with a lack of studies in areas where meloidosis is suspected to occur. The methods used to detect B. pseudi were variable and not robust. A consensus was developed to reduce false results and provide affordable methods for developed and developing countries. The guidelines aim to create a comprehensive global map of B. pseudi.

B. pseudi was detected in 82% of 61 studies using culture or PCR, but some isolates may be non-pathogenic Burkia spp. Negative surveys were reported in Kenya, Australia, and the USA, where a B. pseudi-like organism was later identified as B. okomens. Melosis is a disease caused by B. pseudi, first described in Burma in 1912, with most cases in Thailand and Darwin, Australia. 82% of studies detected B. pseudi using culture or PCR, with strains confirmed by genotyping in France, Burkina Faso, Madagascar, and Niger. 7 studies reported detection of B. For example, a survey in Vient City, Lao in 1998 found B. pseudi before human cases. This led to identifying B. pseud in clinical specimens, with the first case in 199, followed by 560 cases in 12 years.
Researchers have discovered a new way to stop the deng virus from entering cells by targeting a specific part of the virus called the fusion protein. This protein helps the virus merge with the cell membrane, allowing it to infect the cell. The team found peptides, short chains of amino acids, that bind to an intermediate stage of the fusion process. These peptides block the virus's ability to infect cells in a dose-dependent manner, meaning the more they bind, the less the virus can infect. This happens even if the peptides are removed from the virus before it enters the cell. The peptides bind to the virus before it reaches the cell and are carried inside with it, where the acid triggers the fusion process. This binding depends on movement, as there is no effect if the virus is kept at 4°C instead of 37°C. The researchers propose a two-step model for stopping the virus entry by targeting this pathway. Their findings support how the virus changes shape promotes fusion and suggest ways to block flavivirus entry.
Researchers have developed a new method to sequence the entire genome of Vibrio cholera, the bacteria that causes cholera, from dried stool samples on filter paper. This is significant because cholera is a major global health concern with 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually. Outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen remind us that cholera is still a threat. The new method is low-cost, safe, and sustainable, and can be used in resource-limited settings. It provides data on circulating cholera strains, which can inform public health policy on control and elimination. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to sequence the V. cholera O genome from stool enriched alkaline peptone water (AP) and culture isolates on filter paper. The minimum amount of V. cholera DNA needed was 0.02 ng/μL. GS confirmed the presence or absence of genes of interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci. It also identified co-infecting pathogens in the gut, which may impact disease severity. GS placed the strains in the global cholera phylogenetic tree, identifying them as the 7th pandemic El Tor. GS allowed mapping of reads from AP-enrich specimen and culture isolate filter papers provided valuable epidemiological information on V. cholera strains in remote settings. Results showed co-infecting pathogens and specific V cholera strains in endemic areas.
Researchers have identified a protein called Dyne that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and organization of epithelial cells, which are layers of cells that line organs and glands. Epithelial cells have distinct top and bottom sides, or apical and basolateral, that must be precisely organized for proper function. However, little was known about how individual proteins become localized to these areas. A genetic study in fruit flies found that Dyne is essential for apical-bas polarity. Dy acts through a protein called Stardust (Sdt) to target a transmembrane protein called Crumbs to the apical side. The researchers found that Stardust mRNA is localized to a specific part of the gene that is only present in early stages of epithelial development, but not in mature cells. This is the first demonstration that Dyne is required for epithelial polarity and suggests that mRNA localization may play a role in regulating ap-bas organization. The study also shows that alternative splicing, a process that creates different versions of a gene, is used to control mRNA localization during development.
Researchers have found evidence that the Leishmania parasite, which causes leishmaniasis, can exchange genetic material within its own cells, a process called intraclonal exchange. This contradicts previous belief that the parasite reproduces clonally. To test this, scientists created transgenic Leish lines that express green and red fluorescent markers, linked to drug resistance. They fed these lines to sand flies, Phlebotus periciosus, and found that the markers were exchanged within the fly's midgut, indicating genetic exchange. The hybrid offspring had triploid DNA content and was stable throughout the parasite's life cycle. Infections with the hybrid in mice showed reduced parasite loads in spleen and liver, similar to uninfected mice, and lower arginase activity. This suggests the hybrid is less virulent. The study confirms Leish can mate within its natural vector, the sand fly, and the hybrid is stable but less virulent.
Researchers studied Leishmania donani strains from patients in Ethiopia with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV co-infections. They analyzed DNA from 63 strains using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS), cystine protease B (cp), and HASPB. The ITS and cp PCR identified the strains as Leishmania donani. However, the HAS PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic location. Most strains from northwestern Ethiopia produced a 290bp product, while a minority gave 410 amplicons, all from HIV-VL co-infections. Southwestern strains produced 450 amplicons, with smaller products observed in three. Sudanese strains had amplicons identical to northwestern, while Kenyan gave larger products 500-650bp. High-resolution analysis distinguished different products. Sequence analysis showed the HAS repeat region in Leish donani comprised polymorphic 13-14 amino motifs. The 13 amino peptide, prevalent in Leish donani, is rare in Leishum. The order of repeats in Leishani varies between regions. The HAS region shows considerable polymorphism among Leish strains from East Africa. This should be considered when designing diagnostic and vaccine assays based on this antigen.
Researchers have identified specific regions in the HIV-1 genome where recombination is more likely to occur, contributing to the diversity of the virus. They developed a probabilistic model to predict where recombination happens based on local sequence identity and compared it to the distribution of breakpoints in the HIV-1 pandemic. The model accurately predicted the frequency of inter-subtype recombination across much of the genome, indicating that local sequence-dependent recombination is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations. However, some regions showed more or fewer breakpoints than expected, suggesting natural selection influences recombination patterns. The envelope gene had fewer breakpoints, indicating recombinants in this region are less likely to be successful. Breakpoints at higher than predicted were near the envelope, indicating selection for these recombinants due to this region's tendency to be recombined as a unit. The study found that only a minority of recombination events are significant to HIV-1 evolution, despite diverse recombinant forms in the population.
Researchers in neuroscience rely on computational modeling to understand brain function and behavior. However, previous methods have addressed two related problems separately: estimating individual parameters in a population and comparing models. These problems are interconnected because population parameters depend on which subjects express the model. A new framework, hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI), combines approaches for concurrent model comparison and parameter estimation at the population level. This framework has advantages for both estimation and model comparison theoretically and experimentally. Parameters estimated by H show smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison by H is robust against outliers and not biased towards simplistic models. The fully Bayesian approach enables researchers to make inference on group parameters by H-test.

 A novel method, hierarchical Bayesian inference, solves problems by addressing model and comparison within the same framework using variational techniques. The approach has consequences for parameter and model estimation. A fully Bayesian quantifying uncertainty at group enabled statistical tests about parameters and errors. Empirical Bayes play a role in modern statistics.

 The HBI framework is hierarchical, regularizing individual parameters across individuals, and Bayesian representing uncertainties at both levels. Evaluating a model for a subject precedes estimation of its values; previous research used separate tools. However, the questions are interconnected because parameters depend on subjects expressing the model. This work addresses from a Bayesian viewpoint. Issues of inference both parameters and models remained with previous methods. Notably, the best-fitting may vary subject to subject, hierarchical estimation assumed the model expressed all.
Researchers studied how the development of the auditory circuitry in the brainstem, specifically the part of the brain responsible for processing sound and hearing. They found that a group of cells called rhombomeres, which contribute to brainstem development, play a crucial role in forming sensory and motor components of the auditory system. These components include the ventral nucleus of the lemniscus, ventral cochlear nuclei, and olivochlear neurons. The assembly of these components is necessary for sound perception and depends on interactions between two specific genes, Hox1 and H2. In mice without these genes, transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is lost, leading to hearing impairments. On the other hand, H2 regulates axon guidance and controls contralateral projections from the ventral cochlear to the trapezoid nucleus, a circuit involved in sound localization. Each rhomere and its associated genes control distinct sub-circuits in the developing brainstem.
Scientists have sequenced the complete genome of a marine bacterium called Saccharagus deans strain 2-40, which is capable of breaking down complex carbohydrates. This bacterium is part of a newly discovered group of marine bacteria that recycle complex carbohydrates. The genome analysis shows that it has many enzymes that can break down complex carbohydrates, and some of these enzymes have unique structures. Researchers think these features help the bacterium break down complex carbohydrates in the ocean. This is the first time a marine bacterium's genome has been sequenced that can break down plant cell walls, a key part of the carbon cycle not well understood in the ocean.

The study found that the bacterium's enzymes are regulated in different ways, and more complex carbohydrates require more enzymes to break down. Glucose, a simple sugar, is a key to regulating the enzymes. The bacterium can grow on plants as its only food and break them down completely, a first time a marine bacterium has done so. The bacterium is related to others that break down cellulose, a plant material, and nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live with worms.

The study suggests the bacter has a key role in the ocean's carbon cycle, breaking down complex carbohydrates from plants and animals. It's an important, understudied system. The bacterium's genome has been fully sequenced and is available online.
Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus that causes significant childhood neurological infections in Asia. Over the past 20 years, JEV genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to I (GI). The reason for this shift is unknown. Culex (Cx) mosquitoes are common in China and play a key role in JEV transmission. This study used Cx pipiens mosquitoes from China to explore if they played a role in JEV shift. Female Cx pip mosquitoes were exposed to GI or GIII JEV strains. Midgut, organs, and saliv glands of infected mosquitoes were collected at 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) to measure infection, replication, dissemination, and transmission of JEV. Cx pip mosquitoes were competent for both GI and GIII infection with similar rates and kinetics. Both genotypes disseminated to secondary organs at similar rates. GI-infected saliv glands were positive at 16.2% at 7dpi, while GIII was undetectable. However, 29.4% and 36.3% were positive at 14dpi. No difference in transmission rate between GI and G-infected was detected. Data showed GI and GIII have similar infectivity in Cx pip, suggesting C pip may not play a role in J shift.
A two-year review of dengue deaths in Malaysia between 2013 and 2014 was conducted to study demographics and clinical characteristics associated with deng deaths. A total of 322 deng deaths were reviewed, with a mean age of 40.7 years and 72.5% were adults. Diabetes and hypertension were common co-morbidities among adults and elderly. The most common symptoms were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy being more common in children and abdominal pain in adults. 22.4% had no symptoms and 34% were suspected deng at initial presentation. Adults developed severe plasma leakage and more than half suffered multi-organ involvement. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) contributed to 70% of deaths, followed by severe involvement 69% and bleeding 29.7%. In Malaysia, deng deaths primarily occurred in adults and SS was leading cause of death regardless of age. The study highlights the need for early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent deng deaths.
Researchers studied how female fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, choose their mates to maximize reproductive success. They found that insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, affects female attractiveness. Insulin signaling in the body's fat and ovarian cells, called follicles, sends signals to pherom-producing cells called oocytes. These signals are crucial for female attractiveness. Manipulating insulin in these cells changed attractiveness, while manipulating in the body had opposite effects. This suggests a connection between insulin in the body and ovaries. Insulin signaling in follicles increased attractiveness, while in the body decreased it. This also affected fecundity, or ability to produce offspring, in the same direction. Cuticular hydrocarbons, chemical cues, responded differently to body and follicle manipulations, indicating separate pathways. Insulin signaling in body and follicles are linked to attractiveness and fecundity. The study found a system where attractiveness and fecity are connected, both influenced by insulin in body and follicles.
During the 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, the virus spread unevenly affected the hardest-hit countries Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. To understand how the virus spread, researchers used a statistical approach to estimate the basic reproduction number (R) for each district and country, using weekly case numbers. They found R ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone. At the national level, R was estimated at 0.97 for Guinea, 1.26 for Liberia, and 1.66 for Sierra. The study suggests that urbanization, such as high population density and wealth, contributed to the spread of EVD.

The researchers used district-level data from the epidemic and a statistical model to calculate growth at country and district levels. They estimated the transmissibility of EVD as R for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra, and their 53 districts. They explored the relationship between R and socio-demographic variables as drivers of E transmission at a population level.

The Ebola outbreak started in December 2013 in Guinea and became the largest EVD epidemic ever. Studies have discussed the geographical heterogeneity of transmission in West, but not considered it in analysis. The epidemic has a multi-level structure and national curves are an overlay of local outbreaks. Only 9% of districts had a functioning Ebola Treatment Unit in the first eight weeks of the wave.

The study used weekly E cases in each subunit of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra, available at the World Health Organization website. Findings are compatible with disease drivers, but factors cannot be answered with this design and data. The mixed model is a strategy to quantify local growth during a large-scale epidemic and confirms geographical heterogeneity in E in West.
Researchers investigated the relationship between a protein's age and its rate of evolution. They used a large dataset of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins with mapped structures to study the interplay of age and structural properties as determinants of evolutionary rate. The study found that previously observed correlations between structural and evolutionary rates also held within age groups, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and rates. However, age also played a role in modulating the relationship between solvent and rate. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, tended to evolve faster than older ones. The researchers showed that reported relationships between age and rate could not be explained by structural biases among groups. They introduced a knowledge-based function to study stability of proteins through large computation and found that older proteins were more stable in their native structure and robust to mutations than younger ones. The study underscored that determinants, both intrinsic and historical, interact to determine protein evolution.
Polycomb-like 3 (P3) is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that promotes embryonic stem cell (ES) self-renewal by regulating gene expression. Researchers identified P3 as a binding partner of Suz12, a core component of PR2, using mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation. Knocking down P3 in ES cells increases spontaneous differentiation, but not early differentiation, indicating P3 has a specific role in self-renew. Consistent with P3 promoting PR2 function, decreasing P3 reduces H3me27 levels, while overexpressing P3 increases H3me levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-q) show P3 co-localizes with Suz12 and depletion of P3 decreases Suz binding at 60% of PR2 targets. Mutation of conserved residues in the P Tudor domain of P3, implicated in recognizing methylated histones, compromises Hme formation, suggesting the Tud domain of P3 is essential. P3 and its paralog P2 exist in different PR complexes but bind many of the same PR targets, particularly Cp islands regulated by P3. P3 is critical for ESC selfnew, histone methylation, and PR2 recruitment to a subset of genomic sites.
Researchers have studied how the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans regulates its chemosensory behavior in response to changes in feeding state. They found that the expression of a chemoreceptor gene, sr-234, in the AD sensory neuron of C. elegans is regulated by the transcription factor MEF-2 and basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) factors. MEF-2 acts together with bHL factors to regulate sr-234 expression as a function of feeding state. A cis-regulatory M2 site is necessary for starvation-induced downregulation of sr-234, while an E-box binds bHL factors to drive sr- expression in AD. HL-2, HL-3, and HL-4 act in AD neurons to regulate sr-234. Expression of sr- in AD neurons is also regulated by MX-3 and HL-30 in the intestine, dependent on insulin signaling in AD neurons. Intestine-to-neuron regulation of sr- involves a subset of insulin peptides. These results suggest chemore gene expression is regulated by cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms mediated by MEF and bHL, allowing animals to fine-tune chemens responses to feeding changes.
Researchers investigated the link between mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer (BU), a destructive skin infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, in southeastern Australia. Mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria, from 2004 to 2009, and tested for M. ulcer using real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed BU cases in residents during the same period was tallied to determine the average incidence in each location. A strong correlation was found between the detection of M. ulcer in mosquitoes and the risk of disease (r = 0.99, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p<0.001). The study suggests mosquitoes play a role in transmitting M. ulcer to humans in southeastern Australia, supporting public measures to minimize mosquito bites in residents and visitors in endemic areas. The study also raises questions whether mosquitoes are involved in transmission in other BU areas, such as Queensland and Africa, where most cases occur.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in the MRS2 gene in rats that causes demyelination, a condition characterized by severe myelin breakdown in the central nervous system after normal myelination is complete. The mutation is a G-to-A transition 177 base pair downstream of exon 3 of the MRS2 gene, creating a novel splice site that inactivates the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type MRS2 DNA confirmed the findings. M2 encodes a component of the Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria of yeast and human cells. Rats with the mutation have major mitochondrial deficits, including elevated lactic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, 60% reduction in ATP, and swollen mitochondria in oligodendrocy cytoplasm. M2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats show M2 is dominantly expressed in neurons, not oligodrocytes, and ultrastructurally observed in inner mitochondria membrane. Observations suggest dmy rats suffer mitochondrial disease and myelin maintenance mechanism different from production. Mg+ homeostasis in mitochondria essential for myelin maintenance.
Microarray-based gene expression signatures hold promise to improve disease diagnosis and prognosis, but current documentation standards hinder their application in clinical practice. Researchers analyzed eight publicly available clinical microarray studies and found that study-internal and study-external diagnoses often disagreed, with discrepancies as high as 30% in the worst-case and 18% in median scenarios. This is because documenting a signature is conceptually different from reporting a list of genes. The exact specification of a classification rule alone does not define a signature unambiguously. A proposed documentation strategy, which includes quantitative information, reduced the median discrepancy to 1%. The process of bringing microarray expression signatures to clinical practice can be improved and made more reliable with better documentation. 

A study of eight clinical microarray studies showed that current documentation has shortcomings: using documented information, a study-external might receive a different diagnosis from the original. To address this, guidelines and methodology for building unambiguous signatures were proposed. The approach reduced ambiguity to a minimum. Rawarray data is subject to noise, variation not due to signal but measurement or experimental error. Preprocessing is common prior to analysis. Consistency of diagnoses on gene signatures depends on documentation. Optimal was obtained using the proposed strategy. No strong evidence was found favoring one approach over the other. Micro signatures hold promise to improve diagnosis, but evaluation is difficult and subject to research. A signature needs to hold independent information to existing markers. Before impacting practice, they need to be communicated for evaluation and use in routine, requiring unambiguous documentation.
Researchers have studied the structure of a protein called curli, which is secreted by a type of bacteria called Enterobacteraceae. Curli helps the bacteria stick to surfaces and form communities called biofilms, making them more resistant to stress. The team found that curli's structure is similar to human amyloid, a protein linked to Alzheimer's disease. They tested peptides designed to stop Alzheimer's amyloid from forming, and found they also stopped curli from forming and reduced biofilm in Salmonella bacteria. This suggests that these peptides could be used to fight bacterial infections by targeting amyloid biofilms. The study also showed that cur can seed amyloid formation in other proteins, like Alzheimer's amyloid, supporting the idea that amyloids from different species can interact. The research provides insights into how curli forms and proposes a new way to stop amyloid biofilms. It also suggests that amyloids from bacteria could contribute to neurodegenerative diseases.
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a significant cause of encephal in Asia, with high fatality rates and neurologic sequelae among survivors. In the Philippines, the epidemiology of JE is not well defined. A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011-2014 was conducted to support consideration of JE vaccine introduction into the national schedule. The review identified 29 reports on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic, 18 clinical, and 8 animal studies. Clinical studies reported 257 laboratory-confirmed JE cases from 1972-2013, with JE virus as causative in 7-18% of meningitis and encephalitis and 16-40% encephal cases. Predominantly affected children under 15, with 6-7% resulting in death. Surveillance from 2011-2014 identified 73 laboratory-confirmed JE out of 497 tested. This review demonstrates endemicity and geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting vaccine use in the country. Continued surveillance and laboratory confirmation is needed to quantify burden, guide prioritization of high-risk areas, and age and schedule of vaccine introduction, and measure preventive measures against this public health threat.
Researchers investigated the origins of genetic robustness in bacteria, which is the ability of a species to withstand genetic perturbations. They studied the metabolic networks of hundreds of bacterial species in various simulated environments and found that variations in robustness reflect ecological adaptations. Robustness was decoupled into two components: environmental, responsible for 20% of non-essential reactions and associated with species' lifestyle, and environmental-independent, associated with intrinsic metabolic capacities. Species with high robustness were fast growers or producers of secondary metabolites. Reactions uniquely susceptible to perturbations in pathogens were identified as potential drug targets.

The study used a computational approach to analyze metabolic networks and found a significant association between robustness and metabolic capacities, supporting the idea that increased capacities drove the evolution of robustness. Robustness can be studied at various levels, from molecular to organismal, where it's considered robust if a mutation has insignificant effect on a trait. Environmental robust differs across species, some can grow in various habitats while others have specialized requirements.

The contribution of environmental robust to genetic was demonstrated by a new pathway allowing a species to use an external metabolite as alternative to an existing one, promoting robustness. Environmental robust also correlates with modularity of metabolic networks. The effect of environmental on genetic robust was studied in yeast, where half of non-essential genes were active under restricting conditions. However, environmental cannot fully explain dispensability, other hypotheses propose adaptive origin.
Researchers conducted a randomized trial to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on antibody responses to measles catch-up immunization in pre-school children and the impact of prazantel treatment on this outcome. The study, called the Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunization (IMCI) study, took place in Enteb, Uganda and included 193 Schistoma-infected and 61 uninfected children aged 3-5 years. Infected children were randomly assigned to receive prantel 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles immunization. Plasma-meas Ig was measured at enrollment, 1 and 24 weeks after immunization. The primary outcomes were Ig levels and percentage of participants with protective levels against measles. Results showed that Schistoma-infected children had lower anti-meas Ig levels and percentage with protective levels compared to uninf children. However, those treated with prant before immun had higher anti-meas Ig levels than those not treated. At 24 weeks post-immun, Ig levels did not differ between groups, but tended to be lower in previously-inf children still positive for Schoma than those who became negative. The study suggests Schoma infection impairs antibody response to measles immunization and prant treatment improves it.
Researchers have developed new statistical tools to study the evolution of bacterial populations on a large scale. Traditional methods, such as phylogenetic analysis, are limited when dealing with extensive sampling and recombination. The new tools, implemented in software called BAPS, can detect recombination between populations and describe the shape of a population in sequence space. This is demonstrated with data from the Neisseria genus, where genetic tools are combined with phylogen analysis. BAPS can capture various biological signals in molecular data, but interpretation must be done with care using complementary methods and knowledge of the strains. A sample of 508 Neisseria strains is used to show the complexity of the methods. The population is assumed to have a common ancestor and local ancestors from a global ancestor, enabling a tree representation of relationships. Traditional genetic tools are not applicable to bacterial data due to lack of population conditions, while phylogen analysis may distort relationships with recombination. The new tools in BAPS enable analysis of population structures on an unprecedented scale, overcoming computational complexity of standard methods. The Neisser species are chosen for validation due to frequent recombination and horizontal gene flow between species.
Researchers have long believed that brain rhythms play a crucial role in cognitive abilities such as attention. Recent studies have shown that beta activity in the 20 Hz frequency band is linked to attention, with top-down beta rhythms generated in higher areas sending signals to sensory areas supporting attention gain. To understand the role of beta and its mechanisms, a model of cortical areas was built. The simulation showed that top beta can activate projections from layer 5 to 4 and 2/3, responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Inhibitory neurons were found to resonate at 20 Hz and modulate superficial activity in an attention-related manner. This provides a potential mechanism for cholinergic to support selective attention.

A model was used to explore the effect of top beta on layer 5 neurons. Results suggested mechanisms for selective attention: cells resonating to beta can modulate superficial activity by projecting to upper layers. Two types of projections from 5 to upper layers were found, associated with beta activity in superficial in line with neural modulation by attention. Top beta associated with attention can enhance gamma in 2/3, reduce beta in 2/3 and 3, and spiking of 2/3 cells. Excitatory interneuron connections gave rise to biased competition, consistent with lateral in the model. This is in line with models that top signals can bias, but adds that interamin interaction regulated by beta supports attention.

A model was used to address whether beta can bias competition and how it achieves this. Top beta was tested to reproduce physiological findings that stimulus generated gamma and spiking, and attention enhanced neural responses. Inputs simulated by 100 Hz trains of EPs were introduced to 4 and cells of columns.
Researchers have developed a new method called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS) to calibrate and predict stochastic compartmental models of epidemics. These models are useful for studying the emergence of new pathogens when the number of infected individuals is small. However, current methods for estimating and predicting these models are limited. SS applies a linear approximation to describe the size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the epidemic state using new observations. The method was tested on simulated outbreaks of a viral pathogen and showed accurate estimates of key parameters, such as duration of infectiousness, R0, and Reff, and the number of unobserved individuals. It also accurately predicted future hospitalizations and attack rate. SS outperformed three benchmark methods: likelihood with Poisson assumption, particle filtering, and Kalman filter in most scenarios. This method may improve current approaches for calibrating and predicting stochastic epidemics.

The method uses data available during the early epidemic period, such as weekly new case counts, as a proxy for incidence. It addresses challenges in parameter estimation and prediction when the true state is partially observed and disease spread is stochastic. The posterior from previous observations can be used as prior for new data. The goal is to improve predictions about future epidemics. The method was tested with competing approaches in accuracy, estimating parameters, predicting behaviors, and inferring the current state. Performance was sensitive to noise and model misspecification. Estimating parameters is challenging during emergence due to stochastic dynamics and partially observable processes.
Researchers have discovered that human perception is influenced by two opposing forces: adaptation and past decisions. In a series of experiments, they used multilevel modeling and cross-validation to investigate how previous stimuli and decisions affect behavioral responses in forced-choice tasks. The results showed that perceptual reports are biased by a hierarchy of serial processes: low-level adaptation pushes perception away from previous stimuli, while decisional pulls towards the past. This hierarchy of dependence arises from decision templates, not low sensory processes. A two-process model suggests that decision persistence compensates for adaptation, leading to attractive biases in perception. A unified account proposes distinct mechanisms at different stages promote differentiation and integration of visual information over time.

The study used multile modeling and cross-validation to characterize serial dependence, concluding: two forces interact at any moment shaping perception, biasing appearance towards or away from past. Repulsive forces dominate low-level adaptation after stimuli require perception. The goal was to determine if dependence depends on past stimuli or previous response. Recent work showed past biases decisions about present input, but history may combine or outweigh stimuli. This result supports a hierarchical view and shows decision affects even with new stimuli.

The study provides a unified account of perceptual and decision processes, proposing a model of dependence where adaptation and decision interact shaping experience and reactions. Contrary to low continuity, dependence originates from response changes in early neurons, not later stages. However, results show two mechanisms: repulsive after sensory and attractive perceptual.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called CY in the circadian clock system of fruit flies (Drosophila). CY has a DNA-binding domain but lacks an activation domain, and most of its transcriptional activity comes from a glutamine-rich region of its partner protein CLK. To understand its role in circadian timekeeping, they created a CY-viral protein 16 (VP) fusion, adding a potent viral transcription activator to CY. This enhanced CLKCY-VP complex's transcriptional activity compared to the normal CLKCY complex. Flies expressing CY-VP had increased levels of CLKCY target mRNAs and a shorter period, suggesting circadian transcription contributes to period determination. Reporter gene expression in CYVP-expressing flies showed the short period was due to rapid transcription. Behavioral effects required the per promoter, indicating increased transcription, not just higher PER levels, caused the effects. This suggests timing of transcription, not activation, is key to behavioral changes in CYVP-express flies. The study indicates circadian transcription contributes to core function in Dophila.
Scientists have long believed that horizontally acquired genes, or genes passed from one species to another, can function independently and confer new traits. However, researchers found that existing proteins in an organism can limit the functionality of a horizontally acquired gene if it interacts with an ancestral pathway. They studied the horizontally acquired pmr gene in Salmonella, which activates the Pmr/PB system, but not in the closely related Escherichia coli. The pmr protein in Salmonella binds to phosphorylated Pmr, protecting it from dephosphorylation by mr, leading to transcription of mr-dependent genes, including polymyxin resistance. They found that E coli pmr can activate Pmr/PB in Salmonella, but not in E coli, suggesting a difference in controlling mr levels. E coli mr displays higher phosphatase activity towards mr than Salmon mr, and identified a mr domain responsible for this property. Replacing E coli mr with Salmon mr restored E coli resistance to polymin under mr-inducing conditions. This shows that differences in biochemical activities of ancestral proteins dictate horizontally acquired gene's ability to confer species-specific traits, and acquired genes can potentiate ancestral loci.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes involved in the early stages of cell differentiation, a process by which cells become more specialized. This method, called Differentiation-Test, analyzes gene expression data from a mixture of cells without separating them into different types. Previous methods often included genes that respond to differentiation, not regulate it. The team applied Different-Test to mouse embryonic stem cells and found Smad1, a new regulator of pluripotency and self-renew. They used short RNA to study two regulators detected by Different-Test, Smad1 and P2, and found lower expression in differentiated cells. The researchers separated regulators into two modules: upregulated during differentiation and downregulated pluripotency.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze genetic data from next-generation sequencing studies, called unbiased clustering of gene variants with phenotypic-link network. This method helps identify functional relationships between genes and their roles in diseases, even when the function of many genes is unknown. Traditional methods use large-scale data, such as protein-protein interactions and gene-expression networks, but can be affected by bias, leading to false findings. The new method controls for bias in gene length, which can lead to exaggerated results. It uses over 100,000 human-mammalian genotype-phenotype relations and semantic similarity to enhance the network. The researchers tested the method with different data and networks and found that genes associated with the same disease cluster more in the integrated phenotyp-link network than other networks. This method can identify functional associations among mutated genes in the same disease, even after accounting for sequencing bias. It can also cluster genes underlying polygenic disorders. The method was compared to another network, NETAG, developed by Gil and colleagues, and found similar results. This approach is useful for rare disease studies, as case-control studies have limited power to associate variants with disease. Functional-enrich approaches, like this method, identify shared functions in mutated genes, becoming standard in variant interpretation.
Mexico implemented an 8% tax on non-essential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100g and a peso-per tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SBs) in January 2014 to prevent obesity and diabetes. This study evaluated changes in volume of taxed and untaxed food purchases in the first year after the tax, stratified by socioeconomic status (SES). The study used data from 6,248 households in Nielsen's Mexico Consumer Panel (2012-2014) and analyzed volume of taxed and untaxed food purchases from 2012-2014. Results showed a 5.1% decrease in taxed food purchases beyond expected trends, with no change in untaxed purchases. Low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed food than expected, medium SES 5.8% less, and high SES no change. The study's limitations include inability to infer causality due to national implementation and lack of control group, sample only urban areas, and 2 years prior data. Household purchases of non-essential foods declined in the first year after the tax.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain the behavior of collision-sensitive neurons in the brain, which are responsible for detecting objects approaching objects in the visual field. These neurons integrate information from a large area of the visual field and respond best to objects on a collision course. A previous model used a power law to scale inhibitory input, but this new model assumes noisy channels with a threshold. The result is an approximate power law from pooling these channels. This mechanism can predict characteristics of the Lobula Giant Detector Neuron (LG), a well-studied neuron in locust that responds to approaching objects. The model depends on noise in the inhibitory pathway but is robust to noise in the excitatory pathway.

 The new model, called "n-ψ", is biophysically plausible and based on a predecessor that used a power law for inhibitory input. It's not as detailed as other models but explains many characteristics of collision-sensitive neurons with a maximum response before collision. Noise plays a key role in approximating a power in the inhibitory pathway by smoothing. This is due to integrating many inhibitory inputs. A power alone doesn't suffice, as it distorts the LG's response to approaching objects. The model "noisy" or "n-ψ" is based on an equation describing the membrane potential of the LG neuron. It receives Θ and Θ as input and integrates by the dendritic tree. Conditions are noise across channels and a threshold.
Cameroon has been endemic for Buruli ulcer (BU) since 1969, but control efforts began in 2002. The National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme (NBPUC) aimed to detect cases early, confirm 70% by PCR, treat all according to guidelines, and heal 95% without joint limitation. From 2001-2014, 370 cases were reported, with a significant drop from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of endemic districts rose from 2 to 64, with 5 functional diagnostic and 2 planned for 2015. The health system was strengthened and research gained interest. Although control began 30 years after the first cases, progress was made in detection, management, system, and research. However, reduced resources led to a drop in performance since 2010.
Researchers investigated how people's confidence in their choices affects learning and decision-making in situations where outcomes are either gains or losses. They found that people are more confident in their choices when learning to gain compared to avoiding losses, despite equal performance in both contexts. A computational model showed that this bias is due to "context-value", an estimate of the average value of options, necessary for equal performance in both gain and loss domains. This bias is the first found in a reinforcement learning context and is domain-general, suggesting important implications. The study also showed that in uncertain environments, people's learning strategies differ when outcomes are framed as gains or losses, despite similar behavior. A previous study found that stakes can bias confidence in choices, with gains increasing and losses decreasing it. The researchers hypothesized that people would be less confident in choices to avoid losses compared to gains, and that this would be due to learned-value. They tested this in a task where outcomes were either gains or losses, and found people performed equally well in both. The study suggests confidence can be a meta-cognitive variable for comparing learning strategies and deciding whether to adjust them. Despite recent models of confidence in decision-making, how people estimate confidence in reinforcement learning is poorly understood.
Researchers have studied the role of a protein called ns3 in the replication of alphaviruses, a type of virus that causes diseases such as chikungunya and sindbis fever. Ns3 is part of the virus's replication complex and has a conserved amino-terminal domain that helps with RNA synthesis and a poorly conserved carbox-terminal region. They found that the carbox-terminal of ns3 has a proline-rich sequence that binds to a protein called amphiphin, which is found in host cells. This binding is important for the virus to replicate. The researchers tested this by mutating the proline sequence in ns3 and silencing amphin expression, which impaired virus replication in cells. They also infected mice with a virus that couldn't bind to amphin and saw decreased mortality. The study shows that ns3 binding to amphin is a key interaction that helps the virus replicate in host cells.
Researchers studied 123 strains of a disease-causing fungi in Brazil, known as chromoblastyc, to understand its diversity. They used DNA sequencing to identify the species. The fungi were divided into three groups, with Fonseea being the most common, followed by Rhinadiella and Cyellophora. Fonsea pedso was the most prevalent, found in 80% of cases, followed by 13% for monora, 3 for nica, and 1 pnius. Two new species, Rhinadi and Cyello, were also found, making up 3 and 1% of cases, respectively.

The study analyzed 123 clinical cases from different areas in Brazil. The fungi were polyphyletic, meaning they didn't form a single group, and were divided into three clades: jeansme, biana, and europaea. Fonica and pni were in jeansme-clade, Rhadi in europ-cl, and two new species were found. Fonsea pedso and monora are common in humid climates, while nica is in southern China. Four Fonsea species were found in Brazil, with pedso and nica associated with chromobycosis.

The Brazilian isolates were from humid zones, no Cladiophora was not found, as it's in arid conditions. 98% were Fonsea pedso, 13% monora, 3 nica, and 1 pni. Two new species, Rhadi and Cyello, were found causing chromyc infections. Three genera were recognized: Fonsea, Rhadi, and Cyello, no Cladi found due to climate.
Listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria, infects host cells by causing DNA damage, but how it affects the cell's response to this damage is not well understood. Researchers found that Lister monocogen induces DNA breaks in host cells, but surprisingly, the cell's response to these breaks is only moderately activated. They discovered that the bacterial toxin listerolysin O (LO) blocks the cell's response to DNA damage by degrading the sensor Mre protein. Knocking out or inactivating proteins involved in the response promotes bacterial replication, showing the importance of this mechanism in controlling infection. The study highlights that dampening the cell's response is crucial for successful infection.

The researchers also found that deleting or inhibiting proteins involved in the response leads to higher levels of infection, demonstrating that the response can be a negative regulator of bacterial infection. Other bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoe, have been shown to induce DNA damage, but this has not been studied in Lister infection. Listerol induces degradation of Mre, a major sensor of damage, through proteome degradation. Results show that dampening the response is important for infection as inhibiting proteins in this pathway increases bacterial. The study uncovers L monocogen's subversion of response during infection and role in blocking bacterial proliferation.

Infection with L monocogen induces DNA breaks and activates response in cells in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, monocogen dampens activation of DNA-damage pathway through bacterial LO. The bacterium monocogen provokes breaks in host while controlling ensuing response. Wild type bacteria modestly induce response, but Δl mutant lacking LO does significantly. Further, LO dampens response through degradation of host Mre. Consistent results, extracellular Lister (infection with Δl mutant or pretreatment with cytochal prior infection wild type) shows same level γ2 as observed infection monoc able invade cells.
Researchers have identified a protein called bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) as a key player in the infection of two common human viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2. They found that blocking a specific part of the protein, called the BD domain, with a compound called JQ, increased the viruses' ability to infect cells. The team showed that JQ works by changing how BR4 interacts with other proteins to help the viruses replicate. BR4 helps the viruses by forming a complex with two other proteins, CDK and RNA polymerase II, and JQ promotes infection by directing this complex to the viruses' genetic material. Suppressing BR4 or blocking CDK activity reduced the viruses' ability to infect cells. The study suggests that JQ enhances infection by switching BR4's function to regulate viral gene expression by targeting the viruses' genetic material. This is the first time BR4 has been linked to viral infection and shows its essential role in the process.
Researchers studied the microbial communities in the mouths of children with a rare and devastating disease called noma cancrum, which causes severe facial disfigurement in over 140,000 malnourished children every year. The cause of noma is still unknown, but a mix of microbial infection, poor oral hygiene, and weakened immune system likely contribute to the development of oral lesions. These lesions are entry points for unidentified microorganisms that trigger gangrenous facial infections. To catalog bacteria in noma lesions and identify potential triggers, researchers analyzed 16S rRNA gene fragments from 60 samples of gingival fluid from 12 healthy children, 12 with noma lesions, and 12 with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG) lesions and healthy sites. Compared to healthy individuals, samples from diseased mouths were enriched with Spirocha and depleted Proteobacteria. Samples from healthy sites of diseased had similar proportions of Spiro and Proteobacteria to controls. Samples from n mouths did not have higher Fusobacter abundance, casting doubt on its causative role. Microbial communities from n and AN lesions were dominated by Prevotella intermedia OT, less abundant in healthy sites. Multivariate analysis confirmed different bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites. Several OTUs in Erysotrichales, Cloidales, Boid, and Spirotales were identified as indicators of noma, suggesting one or more microbes in these orders associated with development.
Bacillus thuringis, a bacterium that infects insects, uses a communication system called quorum sensing to adapt to its environment and decide whether to form spores or commit to a necrotrophic lifestyle. Quorum sensing is a way bacteria talk to each other through signaling molecules. In Bacillus thuring, this system is regulated by a family of proteins called RNPP. One of these proteins, Npr, acts as a transcription factor when bound to its signaling molecule Npr, turning on genes for survival in the insect cadaver. However, researchers found that Npr also inhibits sporulation, the process of forming spores, in the absence of Npr. Npr prevents the phosphorylation of SpoF, a protein needed for spore formation, thus delaying the process. Npr's function is similar to Rap proteins, which don't bind DNA but control gene expression through protein interactions. Residues that interact with SpoF suggest common inhibition of spore formation. Npr's structure is flexible, like Rap. The study proposes that Npr has two functions: binding Npr switches it from inhibitor to activator of necrotrophic lifestyle. Npr coordinates sporulation and necrotism, ensuring bacteria survival and spread during infection.
Researchers have developed a new computational model to predict the effectiveness of HIV treatment with antiretroviral drugs. This model, called proteochem, combines information about the chemical properties of the drug and the target it interacts with, in addition to the genetic information of the virus. The model was trained on a large database of over 300,000 data points of drug-virus interactions, and was able to predict the effectiveness of drugs with an error rate of less than 0.5.5. When compared to previous models that only used genetic information, the new model performed better in predicting resistance and identifying new mutations that cause resistance. The model was also applied to a public database and correctly predicted resistance in 84% of cases, compared to 80% by previous models. The researchers conclude that protechem models can accurately predict resistance based on genetic information, even for new and mixed mutations. The model also informs the user about the reliability of predictions.
Researchers have proposed an alternative explanation for the mechanism of chemotaxis, the process by which cells move towards chemical attractants. The traditional view is that attractants cause actin polymerization, leading to pseudop formation and movement. However, this study suggests that pseudops are formed by a self-generated cycle, and attractants modulate this cycle rather than directly causing actin polymerization. A computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis based on pseudop autocatalysis was developed to test the explanatory and predictive powers of this mechanism. The model reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemotaxis, simulates cell polarization and persistence, and predicts pseudop bias in attractant gradients. It also predicts lateral pseudop initiation in high attractant gradients. To test the model's ability, a prediction was made that the angle between successive pseudops at the front of the cell would increase with the difference between the cell's direction and the attractant gradient. This was measured in Dictyostelium cells under different conditions and agreed with the model well. The model and data suggest that rapidly moving cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils have an intrinsic pseudop cycle at the heart of motility, implying that chemotaxis relies on modification of pseudop behavior rather than generation or actin polymerization by attractants.
Researchers studied how fleas transmit the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which causes the plague, to rodents. They found that fleas can transmit the bacterium in two ways: early-phase transmission (EPT) and bio-dependent transmission (BDT). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and rodent species. To understand the mechanism of E, they fed fleas bacteremic blood from mice, rats, guinea pigs, and gerbils. The location and characteristics of infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pest were assessed 1-3 days post-infection. Surprisingly, 10-28% of rodent fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea blood regurgitated a portion of the infected meal into the esophagus within 24 hours. This phenomenon is called post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). In contrast, PIER was rare in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER correlated with accumulation of dense aggregates of Y. pest, red blood cells, and hemoglobin that filled the proventulus. At next feeding, fleas with P were 3-25 times more likely to be blocked with blood retained in the esagus than fleas without P. Three days after feeding on bacteremic blood, Oropsa montana transmitted significantly more CFU than groups using mouse blood, and this transmission was bio-dependent. Data support a model where E results from regurgitation of pest from obstructed foregut and E and B can sometimes overlap.
Researchers have found that positive correlations between the activity of neurons in the brain can actually improve the accuracy of coding, rather than hinder it. Contrary to previous studies, which suggested that correlations were detrimental or only marginally beneficial, this study shows that they can enhance performance by astronomical factors. The probability of error can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude and the number of stimuli that can be encoded can be increased tenfold. These effects do not require unrealistic correlation values and can occur in populations with just a few neurons. The study also shows that heterogeneity in activity is beneficial and that both error suppression and enhancement depend on a specific pattern of correlation. Tuning one or several parameters can lead to perfect coding, where the pattern of positive correlation leads to a "locking" of response that eliminates variability for stimulus discrimination.

The study demonstrates that certain patterns of positive correlation can suppress errors in a two-alternative task. The idea that correlations can be favorable to coding was previously noted, but the degree of enhancement is extreme, several orders of magnitude rather than a few percent. While some patterns are forbidden, responses are still variable and correlation can have moderate values similar to those measured. If the population is close to the singular limit, fine-tuned, even coding is not perfect can obtain an enhancement of performance compared to independent neurons. The role of heterogeneity is a general feature of coding and has been shown in various approaches. The phenomenon where correlation suppresses errors and boosts capacity is called high-fidelity coding.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine against cholera, a severe diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholera bacteria. The vaccine combines a specific part of the bacteria's outer layer, called OSP, with a fragment of tetanus toxin. They tested the vaccine in mice, varying the amount of OSP, ratio of OSP to tetanus fragment, and adjuvant, and route of injection. Mice developed antibodies and immune cells against OSP and Vibrio, but not against tetanus. Intestinal immune response occurred with intradermal injection. Responses were similar across variations, but blunted at highest dose. No difference with or without adju. The vaccine protected 55% of mice from cholera challenge. The new vaccine induces memory and protection against cholera in mice. An effective cholera vaccine would be beneficial, especially for children who poorly respond to outer layer antigens.
A study was conducted to investigate the cross-reactivity of immunochromatographic test (ICT) cards in areas with contrasting endemicity of Loa loa and Mansonella perans in Cameroon. The study assessed the prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Mansonella perans in 42 villages across three regions of the Cameroon rainforest. Blood samples were collected for detection of circulating filarial antigen by ICT and assessment of microfilaria using thick smear. Clinical manifestations of lymphatic filariasis were also assessed. Overall, 219 individuals participated in the study, with 24 testing positive by ICT, ranging from 0% in South-west to 2.1% in North. Lymphedema was diagnosed in 20 individuals, with majority in North, none tested positive by ICT. No microf W. bancfti found in blood of individuals with positive ICT or lymphedema. Positive ICT associated with high Loa microf intensity, 21 with over 8,000 Loa/ml (odds ratio 15.4; 95%CI 6.1-39.0; p<0.001). Strong association observed between Loa prevalence and ICT by area, 1% positive in areas with Loa above 15%. No association ICT and M perans prevalence (Spearman rho -0.200; p0.747) and M density (odds 1.8;95CI0.8-4.2; p0.192). The study confirmed association ICT and Lo intensity at individual level, and demonstrated strong association with Lo prevalence. Results suggest main confounding factor for ICT are high Lo levels. Findings indicate W bancft less prevalent in Central region than assumed, accurate re-mapping useful for shrinking LF map distribution.
Researchers have studied how the SARS-CoV virus replicates in host cells. They found that it uses a network of modified endoplasmic reticulum, a type of cell membrane, to replicate its RNA. This network is made up of convoluted membranes and double-membr vesicles (DMVs) that are 200-300 nanometers in diameter. The DMVs are not isolated vesicles, but part of a larger network. They contain viral replicase subunits and double-stranded RNA, where RNA synthesis occurs. However, it's unclear how DMVs form and where RNA synthesis happens. The virus reorganizes host cell membranes to create a network for replication and hide from antiviral defense. This study helps understand early stages of coronavirus life cycle and virus-host interactions.
Researchers have long understood that roots play a crucial role in absorbing water and nutrients from the soil, but the exact mechanism behind this process has been unclear. A new study on Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant species commonly used in scientific research, sheds light on the role of suberin, a chemical compound found in roots. The study found that suberin acts as a barrier in the root, limiting the movement of water and nutrients to the rest of the plant. Plants with higher levels of suberin, called es1 mutants, showed reduced water loss and increased water efficiency during growth. These changes in suberin and water transport were linked to changes in nutrient accumulation in the leaves, with decreases in calcium, manganese, and zinc, and increases in sodium, sulfur, selenium, and molybdenum. The study provides direct evidence that suberin plays a key role in controlling water and nutrient uptake to the leaves. The changes in leaves also suggest that a significant portion of calcium and manganese transport occurs outside the cell walls of the root.

Experiments on Arabidopsis without suberin resulted in reduced water loss, wilting, and changes in the nutrient balance, including increases in sodium, sulfur, selenium, and molybdenum, and decreases in calcium and manganese. Grafting experiments confirmed that these traits were due to elevated suberin, providing evidence that sub acts as a barrier to water and ion transport. Elevated suberin in es1 should enhance this barrier, reducing water movement to the shoot and loss from the root to soil. The study found that daytime water loss in es1 and es2 plants was 15% of wild-type plants. These findings support the model that suberin acts as a barrier to water and nutrient transport. The study suggests that increasing suberin may be a way to develop drought-resistant crops with improved water use efficiency.
Researchers investigated the kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating the reproducibility of the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction. They used a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CT) model based on the biochemistry of rhodin activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model reproduced both wild-type (WT) and mutant responses with variable numbers of phosphorylation sites. The sources of variability were dissected into components: random number of turn-off steps, random sojourn time between steps, or both. Results showed that only randomness of soj times in phosphorylated states contributed to coefficient of variation (CV) of response, while randomness of number of turn steps had negligible effect. This contradicts the view that larger number of decay steps makes response more stable.

The biochemistry of rhodin deactivation was put into a stochastic framework, reproducing SPR in WT and mutant mice, and analyzing randomness of each phosphorylation state. This was interfaced with spatio-temp model, tracking diffusion of second messengers and geometrical changes on photoresponse. The prevailing view is that activation causes variability, deactivation suppresses, and more decay steps make response stable. However, analysis of mice with 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6 phosphorylation sites showed inconsistencies. Mechanistically, probability of light-activated rhodin dissociating without adding phosphate increases with phosphates, reaching 1 when all sites are phosphorylated, consistent with in vivo observations. Initial deactivation is attributable rhin phosphorylation, preserved in arrest knockout mice. Deactivation stops at peak suppression and remains steady. Mutant rhodins with fewer phosphorylation sites generate SPR of extended durations.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical framework to study the dynamics of reaction networks within cells that are influenced by factors outside the network, such as fluctuations in the number of ribosomes in a gene regulatory network. Current models that account for these external factors are difficult to analyze. The new approach, called "uncoupling," separates the network from its environment by incorporating the environment's effect into a new model. This is done by "marginalizing" fluctuating external components, such as chemicals, to obtain a decoupled model. The team derived process and master equations for this model and showed how simulations can be performed. Studies demonstrate the significance of this approach.

The goal is to create a "self-contained" model that summarizes all behaviors under possible external fluctuations. This model can be used for uncoupled analysis of a network with external noise. The provided answer is marginalizing the system with respect to external fluctuations. There is evidence that biochemical networks need to account for both intrinsic and extrinsic noise from the intracellular environment. Studies do this by extending the model's state with environmental species, whose dynamics are described with the system of interest.

The uncoupled dynamics provide a tool to study how stochasticity is propagated in reaction networks. Environmental noise splits into two terms: one suppressed and one sensed by the network. In Monte Carlo simulations, the decoupled process reduces computational effort, especially if the network is costly. This highlights the framework as a tool to split biochemical networks into parts that are easier to simulate.

The time-evolution of a reaction network is described by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with species and channels. The state at time is and its path on intervals.
Researchers have developed a new brain-machine interface (BMI) system that allows people to control devices with their thoughts at a faster and more precise scale than current systems. The system uses two main components: an infinite-hor feedback model of the brain's behavior and a point model of neural spikes. The feedback model infers the user's motor intention and is used for training and adaptation. The point model enables processing and adaptation with every spike, unlike current decoders that adapt in batches. Experiments in a non-human primates showed improved performance with the new system compared to current methods. Spike-based adaptation was faster and more consistent than batch-based and robust to initial conditions. The system also controlled tasks beyond those used in training. This has implications for developing clinically viable neuroprosthetics.
Researchers studied how the retina responds to different types of visual stimuli, such as movies and white noise patterns, to understand how it processes information. They found that the retina doesn't completely eliminate redundancy in responses, but rather reduces it to a lower level, similar to responses to white noise. The amount of redundancy varies with the type of stimulus, but is less than predicted by a simple model of neural response. 

The retina maintains a moderate level of correlation across a range of stimuli, from white noise to movies with both spatial and temporal correlations. The amount of correlation changes between stimuli is less than predicted by a simple model. Experiments showed the retina doesn't fully decorrelate input, even with least correlated noise, some correlations remain between ganglion cell spike trains. Results are similar to previous studies on LGN and visual cortex, which differ in structure with natural versus random stimuli. Gain of ganglion cells responding to correlated stimuli changes with input contrast, i.e. standard deviation of nonlinearity in linear model. The retina may adjust coding strategy to represent new stimulus efficiently.
Researchers have developed a new approach to predict genetic interactions between genes, called synthetic lethality, which occurs when a combination of mutations results in a surprising effect. This is important for understanding how proteins work together in pathways and the causes of human diseases. The new method, called Multi-Network and MultiClassifier, improves upon existing approaches by using a large number of features from various data sources, including known interactions. These features are independent of known interactions, unlike previous methods. A non-parametric classifier is used to predict interactions, allowing multiple procedures to be combined. Experiments showed this approach outperformed the current method. Using this, the first yeast transcription factor genetic network was created, supported by literature. The approach was also used to predict interactions between non-essential genes in yeast. This method is expected to uncover new interactions in yeast and higher organisms like mouse and human, where few have been identified.
The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GAH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA data to support collaborative research. Its goal is to generate a comprehensive understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the predisposition genes BR1 and BR2. The project integrates variants from public databases into a single site, www.brca.org, providing a reliable and accessible record of interpreted variants. Over 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number in the next-largest database, with approximately 7,250 classifications. The data is based on information from clinical databases, such as the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and Leiden Variation Database (LOV), as well as population databases linked to a single access point. The BR Challenge brought together the international Evidence Network for Interpretation of Genetic Mutant Alleles (ENIG) consortium, expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and providers to advance understanding BR1 and BR2 variation. Ongoing work includes contact with centers for BR1 and BR2 data, development of methods for genetic variation extraction, and engagement with communities to understand clinical significance.
Malaria, a disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in over one million deaths annually. The parasite's life cycle involves rapid multiplication in humans and mosquitoes, requiring adaptation to various environments. To cope with reactive oxygen species and maintain redox processes, Plmodium relies on adequate redox balance. Researchers have mapped the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox proteins in Plasium falcum, revealing the first complete redox compartment map. Two Plasium peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxal system are targeted to the apoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. The compartmentation of thiorexin and glutaredin-like proteins is also described. Notably, Plium uses alternative translation initiation (ATI) to target two major antioxidant enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioreductase, to different locations. This dual localization by ATI may occur in other Apicomplex parasites, opening avenues for therapeutic intervention.

The study provides the first comprehensive subcellular compartment of red metabolism in malaria. The apoplast, a non-photosynthetic plast of Plasium, contains plant-like metabolic pathways, including fatty acid and heme biosynthesis. Until now, antioxidative capacity of the apoplast was unknown. Two major antioxidants, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, are absent in the parasite. This offers potential for chemotherapeutic agents disrupting Plas redox balance. Many redox enzymes contain targeting sequences, but localization has not been demonstrated due to parasite's rapid multiplication, intracellular digestion, and host immune system ROS. Plasium has two NAD-dependent red systems with broad antioxidant mechanisms. The study maps Plas red system, understanding cellular functions and interactions, and demonstrates ATI in Apicom parasites for protein localization.
Researchers studied the role of electrostatic interactions in the binding of a protein called PUM to its partner Mcl-1. PUM is an intrinsically disordered protein, meaning it doesn't have a fixed shape, and folds into an alpha helix when binding to M-1. The team used a computer model to simulate the binding process, taking into account electrostatic forces, and compared it to experimental data. They found that intramolecular electrostatic interactions have little effect on PUM's shape before binding. However, intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native electrostatic, play a key role in forming the initial complex. The model revealed more about the binding process than experimental data alone, highlighting the importance of electrostatic interactions in IDP binding. This approach can be used to predict results of mutational studies.
Researchers studied the behavior of Polycomb (Pc) proteins, which play a crucial role in silencing gene expression during development, in fruit fly embryos. They found that these proteins form structures called Polycomb bodies, which contain silenced genes, and move within the nucleus. Using live imaging, they tracked the formation and movement of these bodies during embryogenesis, comparing them to condensed chromatin. Results show that Poly bodies correspond to 3D structures of genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During early development, Poly and Polyhomeotic (Ph) proteins accumulate in bodies, which form on euchromatin domains with histone H3-methylated K27. Time-lapse analysis revealed two types of motion: long-range movement of bodies and chromatin, and fast motion of individual bodies and chromatin. Both types move within smaller volumes than chromosome territories, limiting interaction with other nuclear structures. Fast motion decreases in late stages, suggesting chrom dynamics in gene silencing maintenance.
Researchers used ultra-deep sequencing to study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in mice to understand their role in aging. They found that mice with a proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerase, called mt mutator, had 10 times more mutations than normal mice. These mice also had high levels of linear mtDNA fragments and low levels of circular deletions, which contradicts previous claims that deletions drive aging. Sequence analysis showed most mutations were inherited from mothers, not acquired during life. No increase in mutations or deletions were found in normal mice with age, questioning their role in aging. Oxidative damage was also not a major cause of mutations. The study suggests most mtDNA mutations occur during development, not due to damage later in life.
Researchers have discovered a new type of ATP synthase enzyme in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum that uses sodium ions (Na+) to generate a transmembrane gradient. This enzyme, called F1-ATP synthase, has a novel Na+ recognition motif shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and energy simulations of the enzyme's rotary element, the c-ring, indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity measurements showed Na stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to Na ionophoresin. Furthermore, Na has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting ion sites, both the ATPase and c-ring. Evidence of Na coupling is provided by two crystal structures of the c-ring solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 and 2.6 resolution at pH 5.3 and 8.7, respectively. Na ions occupy all sites, coordinated by four amino acids and a water. Intriguingly, two carboxylates mediate ion binding. Simulations and experiments demonstrate this implies a proton is bound to all sites, although Na alone drives the mechanism. The structure reveals a new mode of ion coupling in ATPases and provides a basis for drug efforts against opportunistic pathogen.
Researchers studied how T cells, a type of immune cells, recognize and respond to foreign substances on the surface of other cells called antigen-presenting cells. They found that in the body, T cells respond best to substances with moderate strength of recognition, not strong or weak. This is different from what happens in lab experiments, where strong recognition is thought to lead to best response. They tested this by giving T cells substances with different strengths of recognition and tracking their response. Contrary to expectations, cells responded best to substances with moderate strength, not strong or weak. Cells that responded to strong substances had problems with signaling, growth, and function over time. This shows that how cells work in body is different from lab experiments and highlights importance of considering how substances work in body when designing vaccines.
Researchers studied the genome of the fungus Nect haematocca, a member of the Fusarium solani complex, which includes over 50 species that can cause disease in plants and infect humans. They analyzed the most studied member, N haematocca mating population VI (MP), and found that genes controlling its ability to colonize specific habitats are on extra chromosomes. Optical mapping showed that this isolate has 17 chromosomes, ranging from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb, with a total genome size of 54.43 Mb and 15,707 predicted genes, the largest in ascomycetes. Two classes of genes contributed to expansion: those not found in other fungi, including its relative Fusarium gramineum, and those common in single copies in other fungi but multiple in N. haematocca MP. Some may be from duplication, others from horizontal transfer. Supernumerary chromosomes 14, 15, and 17 were confirmed by absence in pulsed gel electrophoresis, lacking isolate-specific sequences on their ends. They have more repeats, unique genes, and lower G+C content than others. The origin of extra genes and chromosomes is unknown, but expansion and size fit species' diverse habitats. Unique genes on supernary might explain isolates' different niches.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how herpesviruses, a type of virus, leave infected cells using live cell microscopy. They used a technique called total internal reflection fluorescence (TIR) to image the virus near the cell membrane and a pH-sensitive probe to track when the virus leaves the cell. The study focused on pseudorabies virus (PR), a type of herpesvirus, in non-polar epithelial cells. They found that individual virus particles travel to the membrane inside acidified secretory vesicles, which are regulated by Rab GTPases, Rab6, Rab8, and Rab11. These vesicles move quickly to the site of exocyt, often near patches of LLβ, a complex that anchors microtubules to the membrane. The vesicles dock and fuse with the membrane, releasing the virus. After exocyt, the virus remains on the cell surface.

The study contradicts a previous research on herpesvirus-1, which observed membrane invaginations with many particles but not individual exyt events. The new study found particles are confined to the membrane before and after exyt, and move sharply after pH change. They also identified Rab proteins associated with exyt and found no evidence for cytoskeleton-deocyt sites. The study proposes an integrated model of intracellular transport and exyt mechanisms for herpesvirus egress.
Researchers investigated the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on the intestinal microbiota and immune response in 109 primary school children in Taiwan. The study found that Enterobias increased gut diversity, which peaked after mebendazole treatment. At the phylum level, pinworm and meendazole were associated with decreased Fusobacteria and increased Actinobacteria. The probiotic Bifobacterium abundance increased after enterobias and meend treatment. Intestinal SIg levels were lower in the pin-infected group, but elevated in the meend-treated group. A higher pre-treatment Salmonella proportion was linked to increased SIg after meend dewing. The study suggests that exposure to pin and meend is associated with increased bacterial diversity, Actinob, and probiotic Bifobacterium, and decreased Fusob. Intestinalg levels were lower in pin-inf, but increased in meend-treated. 

The study supports previous findings of increased diversity in helmin-infected microbiota. Further research is needed to determine if pin and meend alter commensal metabolism and host immune response. The change in microbial composition after meend in pin-inf children may be due to late effects of enterobias. More experiments, including animal studies, are required to understand relationships between pin, microbiota, and immune. The immunomodulatory effect of pin may depend on individual microbiota interaction.
Researchers studied the genetics of root length in Arabidopsis thalian, a plant species, and found that most of the genetic variation in root length was not due to individual genes acting alone, but rather to interactions between genes. This is known as epistasis, where two or more genes work together to affect a trait. They used a method called genome-wide association analysis to identify genes involved in root length and found four pairs of interacting genes that explained a large part of the variation in the population. These genes were not detected in a standard analysis that only looked at individual genes. The researchers estimated that half of these interactions were real, not false positives due to the small population size of the study. They found functional genes in three of the pairs that affect root development. The study shows that epasis can explain why some traits have low heritability, or genetic variation, and why some genes are not detected in standard analysis. It also highlights the importance of accounting for epasis in genetic studies.
Researchers analyzed 30,506 mitochondrial DNA (mt) sequences from around the world to understand how genetic background influences the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mt mutations. They found that the likelihood of having two or more disease-causing mutations was 6 times lower in certain mt haplogroups, suggesting that the background plays a role in acquiring or retaining these mutations. The study also showed that disease-causing mutations were more frequent in younger sequences and genomes, and that some mutations recurred within the same phylogenetic cluster. This implies that natural selection may have purified these mutations in older populations, explaining why they are less common in specific ethnic groups. The researchers also found that 43% of disease-causing mutations were associated with specific haplogroups, raising the possibility that some are not directly pathogenic. The study's dataset was representative of global populations and not enriched with rare variants or mutations from patients with mitochondrial diseases. The findings suggest that mt background is a general factor in disease-causing mutations, not limited to a few examples.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study how cells interact and move together in groups, a process called collective motility, which is crucial in cancer, embryonic development, and wound healing. To understand these interactions, scientists use microped substrates that restrict cell migration to one-dimensional paths, leading to frequent collisions between polarized cells with limited outcomes: reversing, sticking, or walking past each other. The model, including cell shape mechanics and contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), reproduces all observed collision cases. A balance between cell polarization, IL, and adhesion governs the outcome. Parameters controlling transitions between outcomes are cell adhesion strength, propulsion, and IL rates. This suggests why different cell types behave differently and how interventions affect collisions. To replicate heterogeneity in neural cell collisions, parameters must be tuned or assume cell-to-cell variation in adhesion.

The model goes beyond generic mechanisms like flocking, alignment, or velocity, and highlights the importance of cell shape and adhesion in collective migration. A minimal model would expect adhesion to reduce walking, but our results are surprising. Combining shape and adhesion may lead to new effects. The model describes crawling and collision dynamics on microped substrates, applied to neural crest cells, reproducing four phenotypes observed in crest and metastatic epithelial cells. Simplified models would not capture these effects, emphasizing the need for biochemical interactions and contact dynamics. Results show coupling shape and biochemistry can lead to non-intuitive adhesion effects.

Collective migration, where cells move together, is vital in immune response, development, and cancer. Cell interactions create new dynamics not seen in isolated cells.
Researchers have been trying to understand how thioredoxin (Tr) breaks down its mixed disulfide complex for over 20 years. A key to this process is the interaction between Tr and its partner, arsenate reductase (Ars). In this complex, a disulfide is formed when Tr's cysteine attacks Ars's cysteine. To study this process, scientists used computer simulations, biochemical experiments, and mutant Tr variants. They found that changes in the disulfide's shape bring Tr's cysteine in contact with Tr's cyste, making it more reactive. Tr's cystine is more reactive than Ars's cystine, and it attacks Tr's cyst, not Ars's. This study provides new insights into how Tr breaks its disulfide with its partner. 

Tr converts oxidized Ars back to its original state by attacking Ars's cystine. Tr's cystine attacks Ars's cyst in the disulf, reducing Ars and forming a mixed disulf between Tr and Ars. In this complex, Tr's cystine attacks Tr's cyst in the disulf, forming a new disulf. Tr's cyst is more reactive than Ars's, leading to the release of Ars. A cycle, Tr's cyst attacks Tr's cyst in the disulf, releasing oxidized Tr and reduced Ars. The mechanism of Tr's cyst deprotonation has been debated for 20 years. In the Tr-Ars complex, Tr's cyst attacks Tr's cyst in the disulf. Both Tr's cyst and Ars's cyst can be thiol, but Tr's is favored. Tr's cyst must be thiol to attack Ars's disulf. In Tr's active site, alpha helix and hydrogen bond stabilize Tr cyst as thiol. With oxid Ars as substrate, Tr's cyst attacks Ars's cyst in the disulf. This explains why Tr's cyst attacks Ars's disulf. In this reaction, Tr's cyst is thiol, unlike Tr's.
People's preferences are not fixed and can be influenced by the preferences of others. Researchers hypothesized that people are uncertain about their own tastes and can learn about them by considering the preferences of others and updating their beliefs. A study of 14-24 year olds examined discounting behavior, including variability before and after observing another person's choices, found evidence for uncertainty and Bayesian updating. Participants' decision variability was better accounted for by a random taste model than a response noise model, and taste shifts were described by a Bayesian model taking into account uncertainty and social information. 

The study modelled subjects as uncertain about their own tastes, reflected in choices before learning others' preferences. The taste-uncertainty (K) model assumed subjects updated a distribution over own taste and sampled to make a choice on trial. The premise is subjects are uncertain about own taste, not beliefs given tastes. Uncertainty in absence of social influence is a basis for preference shift. 

The paradigm of discounting modelled learning from others' preferences to form one's own. Tested in a study of 700 young people, providing novel contributions. Evidence of social information Bayesian updates preferences, better fit of K model, dependence of preference-shift choice and decrease in uncertainty with age suggest variability reflects uncertain taste, not response noise. Uncertainty does not necessitate variability, people might estimate own taste by samples and act.
Scientists have been trying to understand how different signaling pathways in cells communicate with each other to produce a coordinated response. In yeast, multiple pathways regulate filamentous growth, a complex response that occurs under specific conditions. Researchers used a new approach called secretion profiling to measure the release of the extracellular domain of Ms2, a protein that functions at the head of the filamentous growth MAP pathway. They found that many pathways that regulate filament growth, such as R, R101, O1, and RT, were also required for MAP activation. This suggests that these pathways are connected in regulatory circuits, showing a systems-level coordination of this response.

The study identified four regulators of filament growth that are also required for MAP signaling. The connections between R101, O1, and RT pathways to MAP regulation are new. They found that the AS and other pathways converge on the promoter of the upstream regulator MS2 of MAP. Other regulators of MAP included components of AS and the inositol transcription factor O1, which has been tied to filament regulation. The discovery that many growth pathways impinge on MAP suggests systems coordination between pathways that regulate growth.

The researchers tested other filament regulatory proteins. It's unclear if these function together or independently to regulate growth, as many proteins have been implicated in the response. To identify new aspects of regulation, they developed a screening to identify regulators of MAP that controls growth. This allowed examination of genes in the background, where growth occurs in MAP-dependent manner. Approximately 390 genes influenced secretion when overexpressed.
Researchers studied how changes in gene expression contribute to the evolution of different body shapes in filamentous fungi. They grew five species of fungi, Sordomycetes, in a common environment and measured gene expression at five stages of development. By comparing gene expression, they found which genes increased the most across development. Knocking out these genes in two species showed altered fruiting body development. This approach found relevant genes more efficiently than studying whole genomes or gene families. Combining expression and knockout helped refine networks of genes controlling fruit body development, a complex process in multicellular organisms.

Fungal fruiting bodies have similar stages but different shapes. This makes them ideal for studying how common and different developmental sources of similar traits and how new traits arise despite existing networks. Researchers found key genes in Neurospora and Fusarium for development and reproduction. A systematic approach compared and contrasted gene programs across species. Mapping properties of developmental processes is key to understanding how evolution occurs.

Bayesian networks based on gene measurements are hypothetical until verified by specific studies. Combining with knockout helps understand relationships among genes in a process and how they evolved. Estimating expression in ancestral lineages identifies changes that may be key to morphological innovation. If complex traits depend on expression, changes should map to regulation.
Researchers have found a new way to introduce genetic material into the eggs of a parasitic flatworm called Schistosoma mansoni, which causes schistosomiasis in humans. They used a technique called electroporation to deliver genes and other molecules into the eggs. Electrop is a method that uses electrical pulses to make holes in the eggshell, allowing the material to enter. The researchers tested electrop with different types of genetic material, including a fluorescent dye, a gene that makes fireflies glow, and a virus that infects cells. They found that electrop was more effective than just soaking the eggs in the material. The virus was detected in the larvae that hatched from the eggs that were electroped, but not in those that were just soaked. The virus was also found in the germ cells of the larvae, which are the cells that will become adult worms. This suggests that electrop can be used to introduce genes into the germ cells of the worm. The researchers also found that electrop was more effective with a virus that was coated with a protein that helps it enter cells. The virus was detected in the larvae that hatched from eggs that were electroped with this virus, but not in those that were just soaked. The virus was also found in the germ cells of the larvae. This suggests that electrop can be used to introduce genes into the germ cells of the worm.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Perturbation Markovian Transmission (PM) to study the dynamic behavior of large molecular assemblies in cells. These assemblies are crucial for various biological processes and signaling between different parts of the machine are vital for cellular function. However, previous studies on topology and fluctuation dynamics of coarse-grained networks do not provide information on time-dependent behavior of these assemblies. The PM model monitors responses of over 8,000 residues across 6 decades from initial perturbation to equilibrium using Klov subspace projection, yielding rich information. Criteria of relaxation time, flow change, and oscillation identify key residues for movement, signaling, and binding. Analysis of the GroEL-Gro chaperone system showed 71-84% accuracy with experimental studies. This approach is general and can be applied to other machineries like virus and ribosomal complex.

The PM model probes the assembly with perturbation and assumes transmission by Markov processes through contacts between atoms and residues. It aims to study how parts respond to signal. The perturbation is given, and response can reveal biologically important information. The method monitors time-dependent responses simultaneously from perturbation until equilibrium. It can also study signal pathways by perturbing local regions like surfaces and is effective for large assemblies requiring small time.
Researchers studied the role of fungal lectins, a type of carbohydrate-binding proteins, in the defense of fungi against predators. They used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism and found that feeding it with a lectin from the mushroom Coprinus cinerea, CGL2, inhibited its development and ultimately killed it. The lectin's toxicity depends on its interaction with a specific sugar-containing glycojugate on the nematode's surface. A screen for resistant mutants identified the glycojugate as a Gal1,4Fuc1,6 modification of the nemode's N-gly core. Analysis of Nly structures in wild and resistant nemodes confirmed this finding and identified a novel glycosylase required for its biosynthesis. The crystal structure of the lectin and glycojugate complex revealed the basis of their interaction. The study suggests that fungal lectins play a role in defense against predators by binding specific glycojugates of these organisms.
A long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4 T cells is a major barrier to curing HIV and has been extensively studied. However, the effect of these reservoirs on the evolutionary dynamics of the virus has received little attention. Researchers developed a within-host quasis model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir and nested it into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. For biologically plausible values, the presence of a reservoir severely delays evolutionary dynamics within a host, with longer delays associated with larger reservoir sizes and homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. These delays change the dynamics of the virus at the epidemiological scale. In particular, the delay within evolutionary can be sufficient for the virus to evolve intermediate loads consistent with maximising transmission, as observed, not very high loads previous models predicted. This effect can be enhanced if viruses similar to those initiating infection are preferentially transmitted. Results depend on within characteristics such as reservoir size, with evolution observed only when dynamics are sufficiently delayed. The reservoir plays an underappreciated role in both within and between viral evolution.
Researchers studied how the Coxsackievirus B3 (CV3) virus affects the immune system's ability to detect and respond to it. They used special T cells, called CD4 and CD8 T cells, to see how the virus interacts with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) pathway, which helps the immune system recognize infected cells. The study found that CV3 almost completely blocks the MHC I pathway, making it hard for CD8 T cells to detect the virus. In contrast, the virus doesn't affect the MHC II pathway as much, allowing CD4 T cells to still respond. The researchers also found that these CD4 cells can fight the virus and remember it for future infections. This has implications for how the immune system deals with Coackievirus infections.
Researchers conducted a study to compare the effectiveness of high-dose intravenous methylprednisone and oral prednisone versus intravenous saline and oral prednisone in treating leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. Forty-two individuals were randomly assigned to receive methylprednisone followed by predone or predone alone. The study found no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or improvement at the end of the study. However, those treated with methylprednis were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and 113. The study also showed that 50% of individuals with Type 1 reactions and nerve impairment required additional predone despite 16 weeks of corticosteroids. This supports the use of prolonged corticosteroid treatment for Type 1 reactions and investigation of factors for recurrence after corticoid treatment.
Researchers investigated how regulatory T cells (Treg) affect CD8 T cell responses in people with chronic HIV infection. They compared Treg from HIV-infected individuals (T/HIV+) to those from HIV-negative individuals (T/H-). Unlike T/H-, T/H+ did not suppress polyclonal autologous CD8 T function, suggesting a defect in suppressive capacity or lack of sensitivity of effector cells. However, T/H+ inhibited IFNγ expression of autologous CD8 cells stimulated with CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) antigens, but not HIV-specific CD8 cells. In cross cultures, T/H- inhibited differentiation of CEF or HIV-specific CD8 cells from infected patients. PD-1 and PD-L expression was higher on HIV-specific CD8 cells compared to CEF CD8 cells, and did not change after T depletion or co-culture with T/H-, unlike C-specific CD8 cells. T/H+ showed defect in modulating differentiation and expression of PD-1/P-L on HIV CD8 cells. Results suggest this defect might contribute to exhaustion of HIV-specific T responses.

Treg from HIV+ donors with controlled viral load inhibited differentiation of naïve CD T into CCR- CDRA EM cells and favored accumulation of cells with CM CDRA+CCR+ phenotype. In chronic infection, T may exert subset-specific inhibitory effects on CD8 cells. Failure to contain HIV-associated activation is due to impairment of T function and responsiveness of effector clones, associated with high PD-1/P-L levels. In cross cultures, T/H- suppressed IFγ by G-specific CD8 better than patients' T (mean inhibition 53±12 vs 22; P 0.05).
Researchers investigated the potential of Wuchereria bancrofti glutathione-transferase (GST) as a vaccine candidate for lymphatic filariasis. They cloned the GST gene from the third larval stage of W. bancroft and expressed and purified the recombinant protein. Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area showed significant levels of anti-GST antibodies compared to those who were microfilaric or had clinical symptoms. Isotype analysis revealed a predominance of IgG and Ig3 antibodies in endemic individuals. The recombinant GST retained enzymatic activity and antibodies from endemic sera inhibited this activity. Similar results were obtained with anti-G antibodies in a neutralization assay. Brugia mal GST and WGST showed significant similarity. To evaluate vaccine potential, B. mal was used as a challenge. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay confirmed the role of human and mouse antibodies. Subsequent vaccination in a jird model showed 61% protection against B. mal infection. The study suggests WGST is a potential vaccine against lymphatic filariasis, with 61% protection in a j model. The protein retained enzymatic activity and this appears critical for parasite survival in host.
CRISPR-C9 technologies have revolutionized genome editing of experimental organisms and hold immense therapeutic potential. However, concerns remain about potential off-target effects. Recent studies used whole-genome sequencing of edited embryos to search for de novo mutations, which may represent changes introduced by poor editing. These studies used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls, making it difficult to distinguish generational or colony differences from true mutations. This study used a trio design and sequenced parents and 19 embryos, 10 of which were edited with well-characterized gRNAs targeting the coat color gene. Detailed analysis revealed that if CRIS mutagenesis caused SN or indel off-target mutations, the number was not distinguishable from background mutations due to other processes. This supports efforts to develop CRPR-C9 as a therapeutic tool.
Researchers have identified two proteins, Hypersensitive to Red 1 (HR1) and Phosphatase 7 (PP), that play a crucial role in controlling the opening and closing of stomatal pores on plant leaves. Stomatal pores regulate carbon dioxide uptake for photosynthesis and water loss through transpiration, affecting photosynthesis, water efficiency, and crop yields. Blue light is a key environmental signal that regulates stomatal opening, perceived by blue/UV light-absorbing cryptochromes phototropins. The researchers found that mutations in HR1 or PP lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under light. Both HR1 and PP are expressed in guard cells in response to light-dark or dark-light transition. HR1 interacts with PP through its N-terminal zinc finger motif and requires PP for stomatal response. HR1 is phosphorylated in vivo and PP dephosphylates HR1. In the dark, HR1 is dephosphylated in a 193kDa complex, while light increases to 285Da. In PP mutant, this shift is impaired and HR1 is predominantly phosphorylated. The study proposes that HR modification by PP under light is essential for proper conformation and assembly of functional HR complex.
A Mediator subunit MDT-15 plays a crucial role in adapting Caenorhabditis elegans to ingested materials, including nutrients and toxins. MDT-15 is part of the Mediator complex, a group of proteins that helps regulate gene expression by interacting with other proteins. In C. elegans, MDT-15 works with the hormone NHR-49 and sterol-binding protein SBP-1 to control fatty acid metabolism. Research shows MDT-15 is involved in detoxification, the process of removing toxins, and heavy metals. Worms without MDT-15 or a mutated mdt-15 gene are more sensitive to toxins. MDT-15 also affects stress responses related to eating, but not other stresses like heat. A previous study found MDT-15 and N-49 regulate fasting response. This suggests M-15 integrates multiple pathways to monitor ingested materials, including nutrients and toxins. 

 Studies show M-15 contributes to at least two detox pathways in C. elegans. M-15 interacts with N-49 and SB-1 to express metabolic genes. M-15 may also respond to environmental toxins and metals with different factors. A previous study found M-15 impacts fatty acid metabolism in N- and -dependent ways. M- conveys FA desaturases by SB-1, a protein that regulates FA and cholesterol. M- affects energy genes that respond to food and detox genes to contaminants. Several M- targets are affected by mutations that alter life span, and stress is linked to life extension in C. elegans. M- is part of a system that coordinates ingestion stress, ensuring health and longevity.
Researchers have long believed that the hippocampus, a brain region responsible for spatial navigation, encodes geometric information such as distances and angles. However, since the hippocampus is made up of patterns of spiking neurons, downstream regions must translate these patterns into accurate information about an animal's environment. The researchers hypothesized that the pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information and since coiring implies spatial overlap of place fields, a map by coiring will be based on connectivity and adjacency, a topological. They tested this hypothesis with a model of hippocampal activity, varying parameters firing rate, place size, and number of neurons in simulations of rat trajectories in topologically and geometrically distinct environments. Using computational tools from algebraic topology, they found that patterns of coiring convey topological information about environment in biologically realistic time. Simulations revealed a "learning" region where interplay between parameters produce hippocal states more or less adept at map formation. For example, lower number of neurons can be compensated by adjustments firing or place size, but beyond point formation fails. They propose this region provides a theoretical lens to view conditions impairing spatial by altering cell rates or specificity.
Researchers have investigated the process by which the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is secreted from infected cells. The current understanding of this process is incomplete, so they used a combination of RNA interference (RNA) analysis and live cell imaging to gain a detailed understanding of how HCV is released. The RNA analysis identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP vesicles and proteins, and recycling endosomes. The results support a model where HCV is enveloped at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. To further study this, a tagged HCV was created with a tetrystine (TC) insertion in the core (TC) to monitor the dynamics of HCV trafficking in association with cellular cofactors. Only trafficking events required for essential H assembly factor NS2 were quantified. TC trafficked to the periphery microtubules and movement was inhibited by nocodazole. Subpopulations TC localized to Gol and co-trafficked with recycling endosome components. Silencing recycling component Rab11 resulted in accumulation of H at Gol. Majority trafficked with apolipoprotein (Apo) and VAMP vesicles. This study identifies new cofactors of H egress and dynamic studies H trafficking in infected cells.
Research has identified a link between the loss of an imprinted gene, Grb10, and tumor formation in mice with a genetic mutation of the Neurofibromatosis tumor suppressor gene 1 (NF). Imprinted genes are expressed from one parent and loss of the expressed allele leads to complete loss of protein. Gr10 is an imprinted and analysis of cell lines and tumors shows the expressed allele is commonly lost in NF mutant tumors. Studies found that restoring Gr10 in NF mutant tumors decreases growth, proliferation, and downregulates Ras signaling. Conversely, silencing Gr10 in untransformed cells increases proliferation and Ras-G levels. Expression of a constitutively activated ME rescued cells from Gr10 reduction in colony formation. These studies show Gr10 loss can occur in tumorigenesis and promotes Ras hyperactivation, a feature of tumor development. In a NF mutant mouse model, this work identifies a role for an imprinted in tumenesis.

Gr10 is a negative regulator of Ras signaling and contributes to dysregulation in NF-mediated tumenesis. Findings demonstrate a previously undescribed role for imprinted in disease and suggest mutations in im genes should be considered by parental origin. Gr10 loss has implications for types of tumors that can arise after loss. A mouse model produced F mice inheriting mutant NF copy and loss Gr10 with NF from maternal chromosome 11 is equivalent to Gr10 null in non-NS tissues. Gr10 is lost in most tumors in NF mutant mouse model. Functional studies show Gr10 promotes oncogenic through Ras and MAPK signaling. Data suggest Gr10 functions as negative regulator of growth factor signaling and loss contributes to tumenesis.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to predict threats from environmental cues, a fundamental skill found in many species, through Pavlovian fear conditioning. This process involves associating neutral cues (conditioned stimuli) with aversive events (unconditioned stimuli). Despite many studies on neural mechanisms, computational understanding is fragmented, with different models giving opposing predictions for trial-by-trial dynamics of autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses. The team used a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling to obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses during Pavlov fear conditioning. They considered non-probabilistic, probabilistic, and non-learning models, as well as different functions to link models with AN activity. Across three experiments, skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size (PS) responses were measured. A probabilistic model best explained AN responses, with SCR tracking a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, and PS tracking expected outcome alone. By combining psychophysiological modeling with learning theory, the team provided evidence that Pavlov threat formation in humans relies on probabilistic inference and uncertainty estimation. This could inform neural implementation of aversive learning theories.
Researchers have identified a new regulator of fungal reproduction in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, called Pom, which suppresses the septation and conidiation process. Septation is the process of cell division in fungi, while conidiation is the production of spores for reproduction. Without Pom, the fungus has defects in septation and coniation, but overexpressing Pom stops septation and coniation. Pom works by affecting the phosphorylation of a protein called HogA, which is part of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) pathway. This pathway responds to stress and environmental factors. Under normal conditions, Sep, another regulator, positively phosphorylates HogA, while Pom negatively affects this process. However, under osmotic stress, the phosphorylated Hog can bypasses the need for Sep, a key player in early cytokinesis, but not Mob/Sid, the last in the septation kinase cascade. This shows interaction between the septation and MAP pathways. Pom and Sep regulate Hog phosphorylation through upstream kinases.
Researchers investigated the association between Leish RNA virus 1 (LRV1) and mucosal manifestations of tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) in 156 patients in Brazil. Tegary leishias is endemic in Latin America and causes approximately 20,000 cases per year, but its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Clinical manifestations range from cutaneous leishias (CL) to severe disseminated leishias (DL), mucosal leishias (ML), and diffuse cutaneous leish (DCL). The study found five Leish species: 77.6% were Leishmania Viannia braziliensis, 11.5% Leish V. guyensis, 1.8 Leish V laini, 1.3 Leish Leish amazonensis, and 1.3 Leish V shawi. LRV was detected in 54 Le brazili, 5 guy, 2 amazon, 1 lain, and 6 inconclusive samples. Patients with CL+ML and DCL were excluded from analysis. Association between LRV and disease outcome was tested in 147 patients (109 CL and 38 ML). 71.1% muc lesions were LRV+ and 28.9 LRV-, 36.7 cutaneous lesions were LRV+ and 63.3 LRV-. The ratio LRV+/LRV- was 2.93 (CI 1.57-5.46, p<0.001), indicating LRV is associated with muc leishias as in animal models and not the only factor in disease.
Type I interferon (IFN) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumocococcal disease by inhibiting bacterial migration from the lung to the bloodstream. Research shows that mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against type interferon exhibit enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumoc infection, while maintaining bacterial numbers in the lung. In contrast, treatment with IFβ or IF-inducing double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C) reduces development of bacteremia following intranasal infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. IFβ leads to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of pneumoccal receptor platelet activating factor (PAF receptor). In accordance with these findings, IF reduces pneumoccal invasion and migration across epithelial and endothelial layers, and Ifnar− mice show enhanced lung permeability. The study identifies IF as an important component of host defense that regulates mechanisms involved in pneumoc invasion, including PAF-mediated transcytosis and tight-dependent perellular migration, limiting progression from localized lung to invasive disease.
Researchers have developed a neural network with multiple layers that can learn a complex foraging task. The network uses two types of plasticity: one that changes based on reward and one that doesn't. This is different from previous networks that only used one type of plasticity. The new network has three layers: one for input, one hidden, and one for output. The hidden layer uses non-reward plasticity to recognize patterns and the output layer uses reward plastic to make decisions. This combination allows the network to learn without labeled data and distinguish between good and bad patterns. Synaptic noise helps the network try different strategies to solve the task. The study shows that a network with these properties can solve a complex foraging task involving pattern recognition and decision. 

The researchers built on a previous network with one layer that learned foraging in a virtual environment. The new network has two layers with plastic connections and uses both reward and non-reward plasticity. The connections go from input to hidden and from hidden to output. The new network can solve a more complex foraging task than the previous one-layer network. Plasticity has been used in models for pattern recognition and reward for overcoming problems. This study combines both in one model for high performance in discrimination and decision-making. The components have been studied separately, but this study links them together for complex solving. Synaptic plastic follows rules and reward plastic between layers and nonward between hidden and output.
A protein called ELF5 plays a key role in the development of a type of breast cancer called luminal breast cancer. In this cancer, ELF5 helps the cancer cells grow and spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs. Researchers found that ELF recruits a type of immune cell called myeloid-derived suppressor cells to the tumor. These cells help the cancer grow and spread. When these cells were removed, the cancer did not spread as much. In people with luminal breast cancer that had high levels of ELF5, they had more immune cells in the tumor and less time to live without the cancer coming back. This suggests that ELF helps the cancer grow and spread by working with the immune system. This is important because ELF has also been linked to cancer becoming resistant to hormone therapy. The study found that in mice and people with luminal breast cancer that ELF5 helps the cancer grow and spread by working with the immune system.
Recent research has shown that the interaction between chromatin loops plays a crucial role in determining cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. Chromatin loops are characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication. To understand how these factors affect gene expression, a model was developed that maps interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of transcription. The study found that nested loops enhance expression and reduce noise, while alternating loops have opposite effects. Comparing facilitated and direct looping, the former performs better in controlling expression and tuning noise, but this control is distance-dependent, with a limit where the difference between the two forms disappears. The results support the chromatin-looping hypothesis.
Researchers have developed a new approach to create riboregulators, which are RNA molecules that can control gene expression without the need for extra proteins. Traditional riboregulators rely on proteins like Hfq and CRISPR, which can be burdensome and unstable. The new approach, called translation inhibiting RNAs (tiRNAs), focuses on thermodynamic and structural features that affect translation initiation. From a library of 12 features, 6 were selected and used to design 18 ribgulators, which reduced protein expression by up to 60%. A model was created to link tiRNA properties to gene repression, showing both structural and thermodynamic features are important for efficient repression. This method enables reliable design of effective ribg, expanding the toolbox for gene modulation.
Researchers studied how groups of neurons in the brain's cortex communicate with each other to form memories and behaviors. They recorded electrical activity at multiple sites in the brain of awake monkeys and lab-grown brain tissue. They found that when a group of neurons' activity reaches a certain level, it sends a signal to other parts of the brain without delay. This signal, called a coherence potential, can last hundreds of milliseconds and carries information like a single neuron's action potential. However, it has a unique shape, allowing it to encode and identify specific associations. This behavior is similar to how ideas spread in social networks.

The researchers used existing methods to identify groups of neurons working together, such as synchronized activity and similar patterns. They also found waves spreading across brain areas, raising questions about how signals travel between regions and interact. In the study, signals were shown to organize like neuronal avalanches, suggesting preservation of underlying activity. The shape of the signal often predicts behaviors better than individual neurons, supporting the idea that coherence represents meaningful information transfer in the network. The researchers looked for preservation of the pattern associated with coherence, but only a small number of neurons near the electrode could be resolved, a small sample of the activity.
Scientists have long known that the size of a cell's nucleus is related to its overall size, but the exact mechanism behind this relationship is unclear. To investigate this, researchers conducted a genetic screen in yeast to identify essential factors involved in nuclear size control. The study found 25 factors that affect nuclear size and implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in this process. The research revealed a wide range of nuclear sizes, from small to large, and highlighted the importance of cellular processes and structural components for size control. 

The study used yeast to generate cells with varying volumes, observing a consistent nucleus-to-cell ratio. In small-scale experiments, nuclear size increased with cell volume during the cell cycle, maintaining a constant ratio. However, a sudden increase in size occurred during DNA replication. Yeast Schizoscharomyces pombe is genetically simple and undergoes closed mitosis, making it a useful for studying nuclear size control. A screen of non-essential mutants implicated nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis in size. This suggests regulation of global processes, nucleoplasmic transcription and cytoplasm translation, and specific nuclear components are important for size.

In multicellular organisms, the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio varies between cell types but is generally within a narrow range for each. Evidence suggests size is determined by volume or related to it, not directly by DNA. Size correlates with volume in both budding and fission yeasts across a wide range.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effects of deep brain stimulation (DB) on patients with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor (ET). The model uses coupled oscillators to represent brain areas generating pathological oscillations. A reduced form of the Kuramoto model was used to analyze how patients respond to stimulation when oscillations have a given phase and amplitude. The study found that the best stimulation strategy should be phase-specific and have a greater effect when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. This prediction was compared with data from ET patients. A new hybrid strategy combining two closed-loop approaches, phase-locked and adaptive DB, was proposed.

The model's phase-dependent effects have been shown to generalize to other models and biologically realistic neural circuits. However, predictions have not been compared to experimental effects of closed DB. Two closed-loop approaches, adaptive and phase-locked DB, were focused on. Adaptive DB applies high stimulation when oscillations exceed a threshold, while phase-DB stimulates according to instantaneous phase, roughly matching ET's tremor frequency (5 Hz).

The model describes how neural oscillators give rise to oscillations like LFP and tremor. Classic oscillators correspond to individual neurons producing spikes. Some report the phase response curve (PRC), describing changes in oscillations as a function of stimulation phase. Coupled models have been used to describe DB effects at particular phases. Wilson and Moles found optimal intensity depends on phase of ongoing oscillations.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool to detect Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite causing intestinal and liver disease, in Biomphalaria snails, its intermediate host. The tool, called Biom-LAMP, is a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. It can detect 0.1 fg of S. mansoni DNA in 63 minutes at 63°C. BiomAMP was tested on snails exposed to miracidia at different times post-exposure: prepatent period, light infections, and pooled samples. DNA was extracted using a commercial kit or simple NaOH method. BiomAMP detected S mans DNA in all snail groups without complicated procedure. This assay is suitable for large-scale field surveys in schistosomiasis endemic areas with basic facilities. The development of inexpensive, field-applicable assays for snail screening is crucial for schosiasis elimination. No LAMP has been evaluated for S. mans before. This new assay can monitor infected snails in endemic areas, providing effective control measures.
In Sri Lanka, deng has been a reported as a public health problem since the 1960s and is a priority for public health authorities. The Ministry of Health is responsible for controlling deng and other outbreaks, and providing care to deng patients at secondary hospitals. The involvement of many public staff in deng control and free care at hospitals is a financial burden on the health sector. This study estimated the public costs of deng control and hospitalizations in Colombo, the most urban district in Sri Lanka, in 2012 from the Ministry's perspective. Costs were collected and analyzed using a combination of activity and costing approaches. The total deng control and hospitalization cost was $3.45 million ($1.50 per capita) in Colombo in 201. Personnel costs made up 79% of deng control and 46% hospitalization costs. The per capita cost of deng control was $0.42. Hospital costs ranged $216-609 for pediatric and $196-866 for adult cases by disease and treatment. This is the first assessment of deng burden on the public sector in Sri Lanka. The results suggest deng poses a major economic burden on the health in Sri Lanka.
A long-standing debate has surrounded the contribution of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers and Neolithic farmers from the Near East to modern European populations. Haplogroup Rb1b2 (R-M269) is the most common European Y-chromosome lineage, increasing in frequency from east to west and carried by 110 million European men. Previous studies suggested a Paleolithic origin, but new research shows the distribution of microsatellite diversity is best explained by spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic. This indicates most European Y-chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion. This pattern contrasts with maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, suggesting a unique role for males in the transition.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between movement variability and the speed of motor learning. Contrary to previous suggestions that variability increases learning speed, computational modeling shows it can have both positive and negative effects. Experiments also found decelerating effects. A meta-analysis of published studies found no statistical relation between variability and learning rate across a range of experiments. Motor learning is complex and further research is needed to understand factors involved.

 Simulations showed variability does not typically increase learning and sometimes slows it down. This does not rule out a possible positive correlation between variability and learning. Factors can affect learning and variability in different ways, leading to positive, negative, or zero relations. Variability may be correlated with learning in a task-specific way, depending on which factor affects performance. To test this, computer simulations were run with an optimal learner model. Variability is a problem for movement control and has attention. Studies on variability and learning are sparse, except those show reduction is a characteristic of learning.

Simulations suggest relation between variability and learning varies in adaptation, depending on which factor dominates performance. Divergent results can be explained by uncertainty or noise. People converge to solutions where variability minimally impacts accuracy. A study showed initial variability can predict learning in tasks. It was the first to show a facilitatory effect for adaptation.
Researchers have studied the interaction between a protein called RelA and a co-activator called CB/p300, which plays a crucial role in the transcription of genes involved in immune response, inflammation, and cell survival. RelA binds to CB/p300 through two parts: the DNA-binding domain of Rel interacts with the K domain of CB/p300, and the transcription activation domain of Rel binds to the TAZ domain of CB300. Phosphorylation of a specific site on Rel is necessary for this interaction to occur. The researchers used NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of the Rel:CB complex and found that the activation domain of Rel folds upon binding to TAZ through hydrophobic sites on its surface. They also created mutants that selectively disrupt the interaction and found that many Rel-activated genes are affected by this interaction, more than previously thought. The interaction controls the response of NF-κ through a negative feedback loop and CB/p300 is recruited to Rel target gene promoters, suggesting a role in Rel recruitment.
Researchers have developed a new method called Time-course Gene Set Analysis (TSA) to analyze gene expression data from repeated measurements over time. This method is an extension of gene set analysis, which considers groups of genes together in analysis. Unlike previous methods, TSA can use all available measurements, even if some are missing, and accounts for differences within gene sets. It identifies significant changes in gene expression over time and compares patterns between conditions. The method was tested on two real datasets: an HIV vaccine trial and a study on influenza and pneumocococcal vaccines. In the HIV trial, TSA found significant changes in 69 gene sets over time, while other methods failed to detect any pattern. In the influenza study, TSA identified 4 gene sets linked to the vaccine, but not previously associated with pneumococcal vaccine. Simulations showed TSA's good performance and increased power compared to other methods. The method is available as an R package for the community.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the global distribution of Plasmodium vivax, a type of malaria parasite that has been less studied than Plasium falciparum. They used data from 9,970 surveys from 1985 to 2010 and a statistical model to estimate the parasite rate in every 5x5 km square. The map shows that Plas viv is found in a narrow range of areas, mostly in the Americas, Africa, and parts of Asia. The Americas have 22% of the area at risk, but only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk. Africa has 3.5% of the risk, mostly in Madagascar and the Horn of Africa. Asia has 82% of the risk, with high areas in India and Myanmar. South Asia has the highest risk, in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The map is meant to help plan control and eliminate Plas viv.

The researchers used a method called model-based geostat to create the map. This method uses data from nearby areas to estimate the parasite rate. They also used information on a gene that makes some people resistant to the parasite. The map is most certain in areas with low parasite rates, but less certain in areas with higher rates. The map does not measure how many people are infected, just how many have the parasite. The map is based on an assumption that some people are resistant to the parasite.

The researchers tested the map and found it was mostly accurate, with a small error of -0.41 in the Americas, -0.03 in Africa, -0.43 in Asia, and -0.43 in South Asia.
Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, expresses several cell-wall anchored proteins that help it stick to host cells and tissues and evade the immune system, making it more virulent. One of these proteins, clumping factor B (ClB), has been shown to help S. aureus colonize the nose by binding to a protein called loric in the nasal lining. However, its role in skin and soft tissue infections was unknown. This study found that ClB plays a key role in abscess formation and bacterial load early in infection, and works by binding to loric in the abs tissue. A vaccine targeting ClB induced both antibody and cellular responses, protecting against S. aureus skin infection. This study identifies ClB as a promising antigen for future skin infection vaccines.
To achieve the UNAIDS goal of reducing new HIV infections to 500,000 by 2020, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key strategy. Currently, Truvada (emtricabirine-tenofovir) is the only approved EP medication, but it's costly and requires daily dosing. To improve EP, next-generation regimens, including long-acting formulations, are being investigated. However, preclinical testing often fails to translate to clinical efficacy, and quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic. To prioritize and design EP regimens, tools are needed that integrate pharmacological, viral, and host factors determining prophyl efficacy. A stochastic approach was developed to predict prophyl efficacy, using dolutegravir (DT) as an example. Combining DT's population pharmacokinetics with the framework, predicted plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50-90% and 90% sexual transmissions, respectively. Daily EP with 50mg DT prevented 99-100% and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing were missed. EP 'on' demand prevented 79-84 and 80% when initiated within 6 hours after exposure and continued. The framework can be adapted to other EP candidates, indicating oral 50 DT is inferior to Trada. Predicted 90% concentrations guide release kinetics of developed DT nano-formulations.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) uses autophagy to enhance its replication, but how it regulates the autophagy pathway is unclear. Researchers found that HCV induces the expression of Rubicon and UVR, which inhibit and stimulate the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. Rubicon is induced early, while UVR is delayed, leading to accumulation of autagosomes at early in infection. Rubicon inhibits maturation of autag in H-infected cells, confirmed by siRNA knockdown and overexpression. Rubicon enhances maturation of autag. Rub plays a positive role in H replication, suppressing its expression reduces replication and overexpression enhances. In contrast, overexpression of UVR facilitates maturation of autag and suppresses H replication. The H subgenomic RNA replicon, expressing nonstructural proteins, induces Rubicon and autag accumulation. Analysis shows NS4 protein induces Rubicon and autag. Results indicate H, by differentially inducing Rub and UVR, temporally regulates autagy to enhance replication.
Cyclin-like 1 (Cny1), a newly identified member of the cyclin family, is highly similar in protein sequence to Cyclin Y (Cny). However, its function is poorly characterized in any organism. Research found that Cny1 was most abundantly expressed in the testis of mice, seven times higher than the level of Cny. Male C1- mice were infertile, whereas male and female C- mice displayed normal fertility. This suggests C1, not C, is indispensable for fertility. Spermatoa from C- mice displayed impaired motility, thinned annulus, and bent head. Found protein, not mRNA level of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CD16) decreased in testis C- mice. Study demonstrated C1 interacted with CD, interaction increased stability, and kinase activity of CD. Observed alteration phosphorylation of CD in presence C1. Identified phosphorylation sites CD by mass spectrometry revealed several modifications N-terminal CD indispensable C1 binding and modulation CD kinase activity. Results reveal previously role C1 regulating spermatogenesis through interaction and modulation CD.

C1 and CD16 complex essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility in mouse. C1 specifically expressed in testis, C- mice sterile, healthy, normal testosterone, mating. C1 may molecule for male contraceptive, screening drugs inhibit C expression C1 or C/CD activity. Study showed C- mice reproduct normal, deletion C1 leads infertility male, not female, cooperating CD maintaining enzymatic C1CD complex plasma sperogenic cells. Unlike homologue C, uniform pattern C1 high in testis. Data defects impaired motility C- spermzo prevent entry oocytes, fertilization. Other uncharacterized defects might involved. C1 and C share similarity protein, examined compensatory effects mice. Spermzo C- displayed phenotype C- cells. However, reported C1 no interactions CD in vitro system, conflicting results. Evidence β-act levels C- sperm ascribed shedding cytoplasm contents rather cytoskeleton. Cycl always CD partners, testicular CD found highly expressed.
Enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (EHE) strains cause diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome due to toxin-mediated vascular endothelial injury. HE hemolysin (HE-H), a member of the RTX repeats-toxin family, is an increasingly recognized E virulence factor. The toxin exists as free HE-H and HE-H associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by HE during growth. While the free toxin is lytic to human endothelium, the effects of OM-associated HE-H on vascular endothelial and epithelial cells, major targets during HE infection, are unknown.

Using microscopic, biochemical, and flow cytometry analyses, human microvascular endothelial (HBMEC) and Caco-2 cells demonstrate OM-associated HE does not lyse cells but triggers apoptosis. OM-associated is internalized by HBME and C-2 via dyn-dependent endocytosis and trafficked into endosomal compartments. Upon acidification and pH drop, HE is separated from OM, escapes lysosomes, probably via pore-forming, and targets mitochondria. This decreases mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cytochrome translocation to cytos, indicating HE-mediated permeabilization. Subsequent caspase and casp-3 activation leads apoptotic death evidenced DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation.

The ability OM-associated to trigger apoptotic pathway in humanvascular and epithelial cells indicates a mechanism HE involvement in pathogenesis HE diseases. OM-mediated intracellular delivery represents a recognized mechanism for bacterial to host target mitochondria.
Researchers have discovered a feedback loop between two proteins, P-TEbdk and histone H2 ubiquitylation, that regulates gene expression in yeast. PTEb is a protein that helps RNA polymerase II, an enzyme that reads DNA to make RNA, move along the DNA. Histone modifications, chemical changes to histone proteins, have roles in starting gene expression, but their functions during gene expression are not well understood. Histone H2 ubiquitylation, a type of histone modification, plays a role in coordinating other histone modifications and regulating gene expression.

In yeast, Schizoscharomyces pombe, researchers found that lowering PTEb activity or preventing its substrate phosphorylation reduces histone H2 ubiqulation. Conversely, mutations in histone ubiqulation pathway impair PTE recruitment to chromatin and decrease phosphorylation of its substrate. Surprisingly, mutation of histone ubiquitin-acceptor residue relaxes PTE activity and PTE mutations suppress cell morphology defects in histone-deficient strains. Genome-wide analysis shows opposing effects of PTE and histone ubiqulation on transcribing RNA polymerase II.

The study reveals a balance between PTE and histone ubiqulation is necessary for gene expression. Loss of hist ubiqulation disrupts this balance and leads to aberrant expression and cell morphologies. The research also suggests other pathways can modulate PTE and histone ubiqulation functions. The study strengthens the idea that PTE activity is required to overcome repressive histone modifications.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South America. Researchers analyzed the largest YF dataset to date, comprising 133 isolates from 22 countries over 76 years, to understand its evolutionary history. They found that current YV strains emerged in Africa 1,500 years ago and arrived in the Americas via the slave trade 300-400 years ago. These viruses spread across the continent and persist in South America's jungles. The study shows how genetic data can test viral dispersal and demographic hypotheses and human migration's role in disease spread.

The analysis included 71 additional sequences, making 133 isolates from 22 countries (14 African, 8 American). Phylogenetic analysis divided YV into two groups, with distinct lineages in Africa and Americas. West African outbreaks occur annually, with 5 cities facing epidemics since 2001. However, analysis found no difference in dynamics between African and American viruses, nor increased diversity expected in epidemics. The virus established a sylvatic cycle in Amazon, Orin river basins, vectored by mosquitoes. The slave trade introduction hypothesis has been repeated, but not rigorously tested with sequence data and phylogen techniques.

YF is a feared disease, causing large outbreaks in 15-19 centuries, shaping settlements and colonial powers. It's a Flivirus family member, with vector-borne pathogens like deng, encephalitis, and West viruses. Previous studies suggest YV originated in Africa, with deepest phylogen split between East and West isolates.
Researchers studied a virulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, in an infant mouse model of colonization and disease transmission, with and without influenza A (IAV) co-infection. They aimed to identify vulnerable points in the steps involved in pneumocococcal pathogenesis. The study found that in the setting of IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and transmission between hosts. These bottlenecks were not associated with genetic adaptation of the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining the number of organisms in secretions is critical to overcome.

The researchers used an animal model to study the consequences of bacterial colonization, including localized disease and host-to-host transmission. They found IAV increased the burden of colonizing pneumocci, consistent with prior observations in mice. By targeting stages when bacterial size is restricted, there is less opportunity for selection among phenotypically and genetically diverse pneumocci. The study employed an infant model that recapitulates key pneumoccal path features. Regardless of IAV-infection, sampled at 12 days prior to onset, detection of pneumonia by lung homogen culture was unusual.

A type 6 clinical S pneumonia isolate was tested in an infant mouse model with intranasal challenge at 4 days. An advantage is that mice are susceptible to low colonizing. To examine IAV co-infection, mouse-adapt strain 31 was inoculated at 8. To understand mechanisms of protection, steps during pneumocci pass through bottlenecks were identified - a reduction in size due environmental constraints. Bottleneck would occur if only infecting organisms pass host or evade local defense.
Researchers have identified two proteins from the saliva of the sand fly Phlebotus orientalis that can be used to detect if people have been bitten by this fly. This fly is a vector of the parasite Leishmania donani, which causes a serious disease called visceral leishiasis in Eastern Africa. The researchers created copies of these proteins, called recombinant proteins, and used them to test the blood of people from Sudan and Ethiopia, where the disease is common. They found that 52% of people from Sudan and 34.5% from Ethiopia had antibodies against these proteins, showing they had been bitten by the fly. This is the first time using recombin proteins to detect antibodies against this fly bites. The two proteins, mY1 and m5, are good markers for exposure to the fly and can be used together to increase the accuracy of detection. These proteins are specific to this fly and do not react with other similar flies that do not transmit the disease. The study suggests that using these proteins can simplify detecting people bitten by the fly in areas where leishias is common.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI) is a genetic element associated with multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteraceae. It is mobilized by IncA and Inc plasmids, also known as A/C plids, after excision from the chromosome, triggered by the transcription activator ACD encoded by these plids. Although SGI is not self-transmissible, it carries genes tra, NS, traH, and traG, coding for homologs of the mating pore subunits Tra, Tra, Tra, and Tra, encoded by A plids. Researchers investigated the regulation of tra and tra and role in SGI transmissibility. They found that expression of these genes is inducible by ACD and essential for SGI mobilization. Tra and Tra are required for Inc plid transfer, but SGI can rescue mutants of each gene, showing Tra, Tra, and Tra are functional. Complementation of Tra and Tra mutants showed that Tra and Tra replace Tra and Tra in the pore encoded by plids, and Tra and Tra are required for SGI optimal transfer. Remodeling the Inc-encoded pore by SGI enhances transfer rate over the plid. Tra is crucial for DNA transfer between cells bearing Inc plids, suggesting SGI disables Inc-encoded exclusion mechanism. Tra facilitate invasion of SGI in populations bearing plids.
Researchers studied the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo kinase Cdc5 in the DNA damage checkpoint response. The checkpoint is a mechanism that prevents cell division when DNA damage is detected, allowing time for repair. However, when damage is persistent, cells can adapt and escape the checkpoint to continue division. The study found that Cdc is necessary for adaptation and its overexpression promotes it, indicating that high levels of C5 modulate the checkpoint's ability to inhibit the cell cycle. They pinpointed the step in the pathway where C5 acts by overexpressing it in damaged cells and examining individual steps of checkpoint activation. C5 overproduction had little effect on early steps leading to Rad53 activation, a key checkpoint protein, but significantly reduced its hyperphosphorylation, which is necessary for cell arrest. This suggests C5 attenuates the checkpoint through loss of hyperphosphorylated Rad53, allowing cells to adapt to damage. This mechanism is conserved in vertebrates, as polo kinase homologs inhibit checkpoint activation of downstream kinases. In yeast, cells unable to repair damage will eventually override the checkpoint and continue division, a process called adaptation. The timing of adaptation correlated with loss of Rad activity, suggesting it may be a consequence of C5-mediated inhibition. Studies in higher eukotes show polo can inhibit checkpoint response after damage. The study suggests C5 does not inhibit formation of the Rad-Rad complex but blocks ability of Mec-primed Rad molecules to produce hyperphosphorylated53 in vivo.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework, called the Kirchhoffern-Planck (KNP) framework, to study the movement of ions and electrical potential in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain on a large spatial and temporal scale. This is important for understanding conditions such as seizures, stroke, and depression, which involve changes in ion concentrations in the ECS. Previous models were limited to small spatial and temporal scales or simplified processes. The KNP framework assumes electroneutrality, making it possible to run simulations on larger scales on a standard computer. It was used to simulate the dynamics of ions and electrical potential around a detailed pyramidal cell, showing the neuron's contribution to electrodiff effects and the framework's efficiency. The KNP can be applied to more complex biological systems to explore pathologies with large ECS variations.

A reliable estimate of electrodiff effects requires knowledge of all ion concentrations, which is currently unfeasible experimentally but achievable with computational models. Most models only partially or ignore ion dynamics. The 3D KNP model predicts ion concentrations in all directions and can be applied to various biological problems. It addresses diffusion due to concentration gradients on large scales. Models without ion dynamics are not applicable to pathologies and neglect diffusive effects on potentials.
A proposed budget cut to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for mosquito-borne disease surveillance, such as deng and West Nile virus, could leave the country unprepared to handle emerging and existing diseases. To demonstrate the consequences, researchers evaluated the impact of delayed responses to deng epidemics in a developed urban environment. They used a mathematical model to simulate scenarios of delayed response to deng introduction in Cairns, Queensland, Australia, and coupled the results with surveillance and management costs to estimate cumulative costs. The study found that halting surveillance increased epidemic management costs by an order of magnitude compared to sustained surveillance and early detection. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance were lower than responding to vector-borne pathogens, even without considering human lives and well-being. The analysis provides a science-based justification for reassessing the CDC budget cut and emphasizes the need for sustainable vectororne surveillance systems.
Dengue is a significant infectious disease worldwide, and in Nicaragua's capital, Managua, suspected cases among children have been documented, but not among adults with undifferent fever. A study in semi-urban and rural Nicaragua found that 63.5% of 740 patients with acute febrile illness were seropositive for deng at enrollment. The seropreval increased with age, reaching 90% in those over 20 years. Acute deng serotypes 1 and 2 were identified in 5.1% of patients. Only 8.1% of confirmed cases were clinically suspected. Dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in western Nicaragua. Since Zika virus is transmitted by the same vector and associated with severe congenital infections, the population is at risk of being devastated by the Zika epidemic that has reached Central America.

In a hospital cohort of children and adults with acute febr illness, deng was identified as etiologic responsible for 5.1% of febr illnesses. Testing confirmed by paired sera for IgM and Ig, 24.3 were confirmed by PCR. Serology limitations include cross-reactions between deng and other flaviviruses, but deng was the only flavivirus circulating in Nicaragua. 63.5% of patients were seropitive for deng Ig at enrollment. Seropreval was 22% in <5, 57 in 5-9, 77 in 10-14, 86 in 15-19, 91 in 20-24, 95 in 25-29, and 100 in ≥30. Patients with and without deng had similar clinical features to other febr illnesses.
Plant-parasitic nematodes are destructive pests that cause billions of dollars in losses annually. Effective defense against them relies on recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized receptors, leading to activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Research has extensively characterized PT in various plant-pathogen interactions, but less is known about PT in roots and plant-nemat interactions. This study shows nemat-derived protein elicitors can induce PT in Arabidopsis, dependent on the immune receptor BAK. Consistent with BAK's role, a leucine-rich receptor-like kinase, NIL1 (NIL1), is regulated upon nemat infection. NIL1 is essential for PT responses to nematodes, and loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to broad nematodes. NIL1 is the first immune receptor involved in basal immunity PT in plants or animals to nematodes. Manipulating NIL will provide options for nemode control in crops.
Researchers studied how the anti-cancer drug milteine affects Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis. They treated adult worms with miline in a lab dish and found that it exposed new antigens on the worm's surface. These antigens are normally hidden from the host's immune system during infection. The researchers used antibodies to identify the exposed antigens and found three proteins: fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. These proteins were also found on the surface of 3-hour schosula and caused the parasites to clump together, suggesting they may help the immune system fight the parasite. This is a new way miline works to kill schos. The study suggests that miline unmasks antigens the parasite normally hidden from the host, similar to another drug praziquel. These antigens could be targets for new treatments and antibodies against them may make miline more effective and help prevent re-infection.
Researchers have studied how the bacterium Bacillus cereus acquires iron from its host, a crucial for growth and virulence. Iron is hard to obtain due to its low solubility and bioavailability, so bacteria have developed systems to extract it from various sources like heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin. While iron acquisition from heme and hemoglobin is well understood, little is known about ferritin, a 24-mer protein storing thousands of iron atoms. IlsA, a surface protein in Bacillus cereus, binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. This study shows Ils acts as a ferritin receptor, causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface. Ils binds several types of ferritins through interaction with subunits, enhancing iron release from ferritin. Disrupting siderophore bacibactin production reduces Bacillus ability to use ferritin for growth and attenuates virulence in insects. A new model of iron acquisition in Bacillus is proposed, involving Ils binding to ferritin followed by siderophore-assisted iron uptake. This highlights the interplay between surface protein and siderore, providing insights into Bacillus adaptation and pathogenesis.
Researchers have developed a new thermodynamically consistent model of the post-translational circadian clock in the cyanobacter Synechoccus elongatus. The clock is driven by a protein phosphorylation cycle of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a hexamer, with each monomer consisting of two domains, CI and CII. Both domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only CII can be phosphorylated at two residues in a specific sequence. The new model suggests that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active and inactive conformation. Phosphorylation of CII provides the timer for hydrolysis in CI. The model also explains how KaiA stimulates phosphorylation of KaiC and the differential affinity of Kai for different Kai phosphoforms generates the temporal order of phosphorylation. As phosphorylation in CII rises, release of AD from CI slows, making the inactive conformation of Kai more stable. Inactive Kai binds KaiB, stabilizing the state and sequestering Kai, leading to dephosphorylation. A kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm simulates the system, showing the model describes experimental data.
Hepatitis B virus (HB) suppresses the immune response to establish a persistent infection. Despite being a DNA virus, HB's pregenomic RNA can be sensed by RIG and activate MAV, leading to interferon (IFN) synthesis. However, the mechanism behind HB's failure to induce interferon-β (IFN) synthesis remained unclear. Researchers found that HB induces parkin to recruit the ubiquitin assembly complex (LAC) to mitochondria, blocking IFN synthesis. Park interacts with MAV, accumulating unanchored polyubiquitin chains on MAV via LAC, disrupting MAV signalosome and IRF activation. This study highlights park's role in antiviral signaling involving LAC recruitment to mitochond. Results provide avenues for investigating mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity.

HB is considered a stealth due to evading immunity and causing chronic infection. Reports show HB cripples RIG-MA signaling and a study shows RIG senses HB RNA to stimulate IF production but not IF. Notably, perisomal MAV stimulates IF via IRF. This suggests MAV signaling for IF production is suppressed in HB infection. Park's role in suppressing MAV signaling via LAC recruitment to mitochondria is likely. Park interacts with MAV and potentiates this interaction. HB activates R-MA axis to countermeasures to abrogate IRF activation and IF synthesis. HB induces Park translocation and Park-dependent mitagy to promote persistence. Mitochondrial dynamics and mitagy modulate antiral signaling.

HB-localized Park interacts with MAV, causing ubiquination. Park recruits LAC to mitochond, enriching M-linked polyubitin on MAV, disrupting TRs and IRF activation. Park modulates LAC activity and LAC abrogates MAV signaling via MAV-TR or TRIM. Park silencing restores IF in HB cells upon R agonist stimulation. Findings establish park's role in MAV during HB infection.
Researchers have identified a novel superantigen, pT, encoded by the gene of Pseudomonas fluoresens, which is associated with Crohn's disease. They determined the crystal structure of pT at 1.7 Å resolution and analyzed its interaction with human class II MHC. Both pT and its homolog PA5 bound to mammalian cells and stimulated human lymphocyte proliferation. This binding was inhibited by anti-class II M HLA-DR antibodies, and to a lesser extent by HLA-DQ and DP antibodies, indicating class II MHC specificity. pT efficiently precipitated endogenous and purified recombinant HLA-DR molecules, indicating direct interaction with HLA-DR. Competition studies showed pT and superantigen Mycoplas arthritidis mit (M) competed for HLA binding, indicating overlapping sites. Structural analysis placed pT in the Tet-family of DNA-binding regulators. The distinct pT structure indicates a new T superantigen family.

pT is a distinguishing biomarker for Crohn disease state and clinical phenotype. The interplay of environment and microbiota in Crohn disease is a source of antigens in immune activation and microbial products targeting epithelial function. Strong T responses are elicited by microbial superigens via interaction TCRβ elements and in some Tα chains. Novel enteric T superigen, pT, and its full-length product, are encoded by a gene associated with Crohn disease. Selective activation was observed for murine T-V5 subpopulation and pT exhibited T-cell activity. PA5, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa hom of pT, stimulated murine CD+ T proliferation. Colonization by p-expressing microbe, P fluoresens, in IBD hosts, provides a superigen stimulus to Crohn disease pathogenesis.
Researchers have found that the gene Nanog, a key regulator of embryonic stem cell pluripotency, exhibits distinct patterns of expression within stem cell populations. This heterogeneity is influenced by allelic control of the Nanog gene, where different versions of the gene are present in the same cell. A mathematical model was developed to understand how this regulation affects the distribution of Nanog in stem cells. The model showed that allelic expression leads to three distinct states of Nanog, but when combined with gene noise, the distribution becomes bimodal. Initially, uniform populations of stem cells give rise to the same Nan heterogeneity within 10 cell cycles. Depletion of Nanog is slower than accumulation, indicating Nan state-dependent dynamics. Allelic regulation also affects the use of stem cell lines with reporter genes knocked in single locus, showing divergence in profiles depending on half-lives of insertion. In stem populations with restricted Nan expression, allelic facilitates maintenance of self-renew cells with sufficient Nan to prevent loss of pluripotency. The study highlights the role of allelic control of Nanog in stem population heterogeneity and warrants further investigation in cell specification and reprogramming.
Researchers have quantified the amount of unused proteins in E. coli bacteria and found that nearly half of the proteins are not used in certain environments. They used a model to calculate the cost of unused proteins and found that it explains 95% of the variation in growth rates across 16 different environments. Reducing unused proteins increased growth in adaptive experiments. Unused proteins are involved in nutrient and stress preparation, providing benefits in varying environments. The study shows that unused proteins are a large source of costs that provide benefits against environmental change. 

A genome-scale model and proteomics data were used to quantify protein allocation across 16 environments. Unused proteins vary greatly across environments. The cost and regulators of unused proteins were characterized. Unused proteins are a source of large costs that provide benefits against environmental change. 

Unused proteins in microbes reduce growth, but their magnitude and variability is unknown due to environment-specific proteome challenge. A model of E. coli was used to quantify unused and utilized proteins. Unused proteins are catalytically active but in excess, operating at maximum capacity. The model formalized function and synthesis of proteins necessary for growth, referred to as the proteome.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes in three ethnic groups in Southeast Asia: Chinese, Malays, and Indians. The study included 3,955 cases and 1,945 controls, 2,034 cases, and 1,240 controls, and 2,146 cases and 1,169 controls, respectively. The study aimed to assess the transferability of previous findings from European populations to these ethnic groups, which make up half of the world's population. Of the previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 diabetes, CDK1 and HXIDE/K11 showed the strongest association in a meta-analysis of all three groups. However, the direction of effect was consistent for many other SNPs in this study and those in European populations. Examination of CD1 and HX11 loci showed evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation to type 2 diabetes. The study also detected variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations for these loci previously identified. These factors, combined with limited power, may contribute to failure to detect associations in diverse populations. The study highlights the importance of surveying diverse ethnic groups to fine-map causal variants and search for population-specific variants. 

The study is the first genome-wide association study in Malays, the largest group in Southeast Asia with over 300 million people. Meta-analysis showed strong associations at CD1 and H11 loci consistently in type 2 studies globally. Signals at CD1 were calibrated, with effect sizes in Chinese and Indian populations similar or larger than European studies with comparable allele frequencies. Genome-wide association allows unbiased survey of the entire genome for novel loci causally responsible for type 2 onset. Conditional analysis was performed at CD and H11 in two ways: including genotypes as covariates to explore additional SNPs in region and genotypes lead emerged in European studies to assess differences in linkage disequilibrium.
Researchers studied the process of cell division in the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, a type of yeast. They found that a protein called Aurora kinase I1 (I1) plays a crucial role in the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during cell division. I1 is essential for the cell's survival and helps maintain the structure of microtubules, which are important for cell division. Without I, microtub stability is compromised, leading to delayed kinetore clustering and nuclear migration. A computer model predicted that cytoplasmic microtules and dynein promote nuclear division in C neoans. Adding more parameters to the model, researchers found that cortical generated by cytoplasmic I and dyin regulate kinore clustering and migration. In vivo, altering I or dyin levels delayed nuclear migration. The study suggests that timely breakdown of the envelope by I allows its entry into the nucleus, regulating division in C neoans. I is essential for viability and orchestrates pre-anaphase movement from mother to daughter cell in C neoans. It plays a role in maintaining microt stability for timely kinore clustering and migration. A computer study predicts dyin and I activity regulate kinore clustering, a prerequisite for migration. I spatiotemporally regulates cytoplasmic microt and distribution of I and dyin. Without I, cortical bias and microt lengths are impaired, leading to kinore clustering and migration defects. The study estimated fidelity of chromosome segregation in I-depleted cells due to altered migration and kinore clustering. By regulating I activity, creates a force for proper migration to daughter followed division in Cans.
Researchers studied a rare and aggressive form of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) to understand how genetic mutations contribute to its development. They focused on a patient with a specific mutation in the RET gene, a known to be a cancer driver, and a second mutation in the same gene that was initially thought to be harmless because it didn't change the amino acid sequence. Next-generation sequencing revealed the two mutations were together in the same copy of the gene. Expression analysis showed higher levels of the RET protein in this patient's tumor compared to others with similar mutations. Experiments showed the harmless mutation increased the efficiency of the gene's splicing, leading to more of the active protein. This is a new mechanism by which harmless mutations can contribute to cancer.
Researchers have developed a new bioinformatics system to remove contaminants and low-complex genomic sequences from draft genomes of eukotic pathogens. This is crucial for accurate diagnosis of infections using metagen sequencing, which captures all DNA or RNA from pathogens in a sample. Contamination in reference genomes can lead to false identification of wrong pathogens. The new system identifies human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences in a comprehensive database of sequenced eukotic pathogen genomes and removes low-complex genomic sequences, another source of false positives. A "clean" eotic pathogen database was created for use with bioinformatics analysis tools, showing better sensitivity and reduced false positives compared to original genomes. The method was tested on a large set of eotic pathogen genomes, yielding a cleaned and filtered database for NGS diagnostics with decreased false and negative rates.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity and population structure of Trypanosoma brucei in Uganda to understand the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region. They genotyped 269 isolates from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the presence of the SRA gene that confers human infectivity to T. bodesense. The results showed three distinct genetic clusters: cluster 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These clusters are not sorted by subspecies (T. b. bruce vs. T. bodesense) or date of collection. There is evidence of genetic admixture among clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and ongoing gene flow between them. The expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. bodesense. The emergence of human infect strains from non-infect T. bruce strains of different backgrounds and the importance of cattle as reservoir shape the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.
Researchers investigated the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXIP) in the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock. They found that mice lacking TXIP (Tx−/−) were more susceptible to endotoxic shock due to increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The absence of TXIP led to excessive NO production, which is a major factor in endotoxic shock. The study suggests a link between TXIP and the NFκB/iOS pathways, which regulate disease states associated with sepsis. Additionally, TXIP regulates the activation of the NLR3 inflamome through S-nrosylation of NLR3, affecting IL-1 secretion and sensitivity to lethal endotoxin shock. The data indicate that LPS-induced iOS activation is mediated by the NFκ pathway in the absence of TXIP. The enhancement of NO and iOS in Tx−/− macrophages suggests TXIP may be involved in NO-mediated NLR3 inhibition. The results show that TXIP plays a role as a negative modulator of NO and iOS expression during L-induced endotoxic.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZTF-8 that plays a crucial role in repairing damaged DNA in the reproductive cells of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. DNA damage in these cells can lead to genetic mutations and cancer. ZTF-8 helps fix breaks in DNA that occur during cell division and meiosis, a process that creates reproductive cells. Without ZTF-8, cells are more sensitive to radiation and chemicals that damage DNA. They also have trouble dividing and activating a checkpoint that prevents damaged cells from dividing. ZTF-8 works with a complex called the 9-1 to fix DNA damage. This complex is also found in humans. A human version of ZTF8, called RHINO, fixes problems in worms that lack Z-8. Z-8 is found in the nucleus and moves to different parts of the cell when DNA is damaged. It interacts with other proteins that fix DNA damage. Without Z-8, cells have trouble repairing DNA breaks and have more genetic errors. They also have trouble activating a checkpoint that prevents damaged cells from dividing. Z-8 helps fix breaks in DNA that occur during cell division and meiosis. It works with the 9-1 complex to fix DNA damage. This complex is also found in humans. A human version of Z8, RH, fixes problems in worms that lack Z-8. Z- is found in the nucleus and moves to different parts of the cell when DNA is damaged. It interacts with proteins that fix damage.
Researchers used single-cell transcriptomics to study how neural progenitor cells differentiate into motor neurons in the developing neural tube. They found that motor neuron progenitors differentiate faster than other types of progenitors. The study revealed a key role for the protein Olig in this process, which represses the Notch signaling pathway's effectors Hes and H5. O2 specifically represses H5 by binding to a conserved element in the H5 locus, restricting its expression in motor progenitors. This tight coupling between patterning and differentiation networks shows O2 acts as a developmental pacemaker, coordinating motor neuron generation's spatial and temporal pattern.

The study found that Notch signaling controls the rate of motor neuron production by modulating O2 expression. Notch inhibition increased expression of neurogenic markers and neuronal genes, suggesting it restrains O2 expression in motor progenitors. Notch's effectors H1 and H5 decreased as cells transitioned from low to high O2 expression. Inhibiting Not signaling upregulated O2, indicating distinct O2 dynamics drive motor cells to motor neurons. Observations raise what upregulates O2 before motor formation. Notch controls neurogenesis rate and inhibiting Not in neural progenitors triggers differentiation. O2 binds and represses H5, interrupting the oscillator, allowing N2 to reach max and differentiation to commence. By inserting into Not-regulated differentiation, O2 shuts Not activity, ensuring motor development in a spatial and temporal manner.
Researchers used a non-human primate model to study the role of T cells in protecting against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. They first infected rhesus macaques with a seasonal H1 influenza isolate, which triggered cellular and antibody responses but no neutralizing antibodies against the pandemic virus. Four months later, they challenged the "primed" animals and naive controls with the pandemic virus. In the naive animals, T cells with an activated phenotype appeared in the blood and lung 5-7 days post-infection, while in the "prim" animals, cells were recruited to the lung as early as 2 days post-infection and peaked in blood and lung 4-7 days. Interferon-gamma and intracellular cytokine staining showed the virus-specific response peaked and reached higher in "prim" animals. This response involved both CD4 and CD8 T cells. The "prim" animals cleared the pandemic virus from the upper and lower respiratory tract earlier than naive animals, before the appearance of neutralizing antibodies. The results suggest that cross-reactive T responses can mediate early clearance of antigenically novel virus in primates. Vaccines inducing such cells may protect against severe disease caused by emerging influenza viruses.
Researchers have developed a new method to quickly and accurately detect the bacteria Coxiella burnetii, which causes Q fever, a widespread disease transmitted by animals. The new method, called Loop-Med Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), is simple and does not require special equipment. It targets a specific gene in the bacteria, htp, and can detect as few as one copy per reaction. The researchers tested the method on 24 human and 126 animal samples, including goats, cattle, horses, marmots, and deer, and compared it to real-time PCR. The results showed the LAMP detected 33.3% of febrile patients and 7.9% animals, while real PCR detected 8.3% and 0.8 respectively. The LAMP is a potential tool for diagnosing fever in humans and animals, especially in rural areas of China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection.

The new method was compared to real-time PCR, which requires a high-precision cycler, and nested or semi-nested PCR, which increases sensitivity but time and contamination. The LAMP is based on the hAB gene of C. burnii and was designed using software. The sensitivity was evaluated using reference plasmids and specificity with 26 Ricketiae and 18 common pathogens. The LAMP showed 100 specificity and no cross-reaction among tested bacteria. The positive rate of unknown febr patients was 33.3% for LAMP and 8.3 for real PCR, and animals 7.9 for L and 0.8 for PCR.

The LAMP was used to confirm Q in the Li area, Xin Province, China. It is a potential tool for diagnosing fever in humans and animals, especially in rural areas, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without equipment or complicated protocol.
Researchers have discovered a new class of regulatory elements called ES-specific enhancers (ESs) in hematopoietic cells that are prone to DNA methylation changes in cancer. These enhancers are involved in controlling the expression of genes in undifferentiated cells, similar to those found in cancer. Methylation of ESs is associated with gene activity in cancer, with methylated ESs being hypermethylated in cancer cells and unmated ES being hypethyl in cancer. Constitutive hematopoietic enhancers do not show this trend, suggesting selective reactivation of ESs in cancer. Analysis of unmated ES downstream the VFA gene revealed a regulatory circuit affecting VFA transcript levels in cancer patients. The study suggests that these enhancers provide a framework for reactivation of genes in cancer. DNA methylation is linked to enhancer states and gene expression in cancer, and ESs are prone to methylation alterations in cancer. Methylation of ES correlates with VFA expression in cancer, unlike other enhancers. Genes proximal to hypethylated ESs are expressed in ES but downregulated in hematiet cells and upregulated in cancer. Many of these genes participate in developmental pathways. DNA methylation of ES affects its activity as a transcription enhancer in leukemia, supporting its role in reactivating genes in cancer.
Researchers investigated how dividing a population into smaller groups, or demes, can affect the time it takes to cross a "fitness valley" or "plateau" in a complex landscape. A fitness landscape is like this has many peaks and valleys, making it hard for a population to adapt. They looked at a simple model where demes are connected by migration, but don't change size or have different environments. They found that subdivision can speed up crossing a valley or plateau if the fastest dem crosses it first. This happens when demes are in a "sequential regime", meaning they don't mix too much. They used Markov chain theory to find conditions for optimal speedup and verified with simulations. Subdivision can accelerate crossing valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters, not just the optimal one. The study also looked at varying the degree of subdivision and trade-off between speed and range. Results hold for weak beneficial mutations too. They extended to a population connected by one or several islands and found subdivision alone can speed up crossing valleys and plateaus. This sheds light on conditions for this to happen.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypt, the primary mosquito vector for viruses such as deng, Zika, chikunya, and yellow fever. They found that the metabolic environment within the midut plays a crucial role in virus replication and dissemination. Since these viruses are enveloped, replication and assembly occur on cellular membranes through manipulation of host metabolism, interfering with this environment is detrimental to viral replication. The study used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze metabolic perturbations following deng virus infection in the midut, the primary site of infection and replication. They identified metabolites that exhibited a dynamic profile across early, mid, and late infection points, with a marked increase in lipid content, glycerophospholids, sphingolids, and acyls coinciding with viral replication. Elevated glycerolip levels suggested diversion of resources from energy to synthetic pathways, while acylcarnines indicated disruptions in mitochondrial function and energy production. A hub in the sphingip pathway, dihydroceramide to ceramide ratio, was critical for the virus cycle. The study also reconstructed the sphip pathway in Aedes aegi, highlighting biochemical points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by mosquitoes.
Researchers have developed a simplified model of the action potential in rabbit heart cells, called the "parsimon" model, to better understand the underlying mechanisms of fatal heart arrhythmias. Current models of the action potential are complex and varied, leading to different predictions, so a simpler model is needed to reproduce observable phenomena with few parameters. The new model combines a Hodgkin-Hux formulation of sodium current with a phenomenological repolarization model, similar to the rectifying potassium current. It was calibrated using data from rabbit cells under physiological conditions, including current-voltage relationships, rapid recovery, and steady-state inactivation. The model reproduced important phenomena such as alternans at 250 beats per minute, reentrant waves on the heart surface, and spiral wave breakup. Variants of the model showed the minimal requirements for alternans and wave up, the kinetics of sodium inactivation and non-rectification of potassium. The model's simplicity and physiological parameters make it ideal for generating mechanistic insight and a building block for more detailed models.
Researchers have studied the process of genome assembly in the ciliate Parameium, a single-celled organism that undergoes sexual reproduction. During this process, thousands of short, non-coding sequences called Internal Eliminated Sequences (IES) are precisely excised from the genome. These sequences are flanked by two nucleotides (TA) and are introduced by developmentally programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs), which depend on a domesticated transase called PiggyMac. However, the steps involved in final assembly of somatic genes remained unknown. The study found that Ligase IV and Xr4, components of non-homous endjoining (NHE) pathway, are required for repair of IES sites and circularization of excised IES. Transcription of LIG and XR4 is induced during sexual cycle and Ligp-GFP protein accumulates in somatic nucleus during I excision. RNA-mediated silencing of either gene results in persistence of free DNA ends, apparently protected from resection. At nucleotide level, removal of 5-terminal nucleotide occurs in L4-silenced cells, while addition to 3 ends of breaks is blocked, with final step indicative of coupling between NHE polymerase and ligase activities. Data indicate I excision is "cut-and-close" mechanism involving introduction of double-strand cleavage at both ends of I, followed by DSB repair via precise joining. This broadens current view on cellular HE pathway cooperating with domestic transases for emergence of new mechanisms in genome dynamics.
Researchers studied the cause of death in patients with heart failure due to Chagas disease, comparing it with non-Ch cardiopathy. They analyzed data from the REMHE trial, grouping patients by etiology (Ch vs non-Ch) and mode of death. The primary outcome was all-cause and heart failure mortality. 342 patients were analyzed, 185 (54.1%) died. Death occurred in 56.4% Chagas and 53.7% non-Ch patients. The incidence of allcause mortality and heart failure was higher in Ch patients compared to non. No difference in incidence of sudden mortality between groups. In Cox model, Ch etiology (HR 2.76, CI 1.34-5.69, p=0.006), LVED (HR 1.07, CI 1.04-1.10, p<0.001), creatinine (HR 0.98, CI 0.97-0.99, p=0.006) and amiodarone (HR 3.05, CI 1.47-6.34, p=0.003) were associated with heart mortality. LVED (HR 1.04, CI 1.01-1.07, p=0.005) and beta-blocker (HR 0.52, CI 0.34-0.94, p=0.014) with sudden mortality. In Chagas disease, heart failure is main cause of death.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which plant cells defend against geminiviruses, a type of plant virus. The mechanism involves a protein called NIK, which interacts with a ribosomal protein called rp10. NIK phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) rp10, redirecting it to the nucleus where it can act against the virus. When NIK is active, rp10 accumulates in the nucleus, but when NIK is inactive, rp10 stays in the cytoplasm. A mutant rp10 that can't be phosphorylated by NIK also stays in the cytoplasm. Without rp10, plants are more susceptible to gemivirus infection. The virus interferes with NIK's ability to send rp10 to the nucleus as a countermeasure. NIK doesn't activate RNA silencing or hypersensitive response, but inhibits plant growth. The virus studied gemivirus overcomes this defense in Arabidopsis, but NIK may restrict other viruses.
Researchers studied the role of an enzyme called alternative oxidase (AOX) in the fungus Paracoccoides brasiliensis, a pathogen that causes disease in humans. The fungus adapts to survive inside the host by resisting oxidative stress from immune cells. They created a strain with reduced AO expression and tested its interaction with immune cells and in a mouse model. Results showed that AO is important for the fungus to resist oxidative stress and be virulent. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the fungus with AO increased expression had higher viability than without AO. In a mouse infection model, the fungus with reduced AO had lower burden and increased survival rate. The study suggests AO helps the fungus to resist oxidative stress from immune cells and is important for its virulence.
Researchers investigated how memories are stored in the brain's hippocampus, specifically in the CA3 region, which is thought to support episodic memory. They tested whether memories are stored as attractors, or stable patterns of neural activity, by morphing one context into another and observing CA3 cell responses. Contrary to expectations, population activity transitioned gradually, not abruptly, suggesting no attractors. However, individual cells showed both gradual and abrupt transitions, and hysteresis, a signature of attract dynamics. To reconcile this, a neural network model of CA3 with attractors for position and context was developed. Results showed memories in overlapping ensembles within a spatial map led to transitions at different points, smooth curves from population, and heterogeneous responses on single units. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt transitions on both population and unit levels, as observed in remapping between independent maps. Strong feedback led to hysteretic effect diminishing with memory overlap. This suggests context-dependent memory can be supported by local attractors in CA3. Similar mechanisms may be found in other brain regions.
Entamoeba histoly, a microerobic enteric protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. Troozoites of E. histoly are exposed to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection. Since E. hist lacks key components of eukaryotic anti-oxidative systems, alternative strategies have been postulated to operate. This study investigated metabolic responses of E. hist to H2 and paraquat oxidative stress by measuring metabolites by capillary electrophores and time-of-flight spectrometry. Oxidative stress drastically modulated metabolites in glycol, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide amino metabolism. Stress inhibited glycol as inactivated several enzymes, redirecting flux to glycer production, chitin bios, and nonoxidative pentose pathway. Glycol intermediates accumulated upstream pyruv, reducing nucleos triosphates. A functional gly biosynthetic pathway in E hist was demonstrated by glyol 3-phosphate and glyol production upon stress. This pathway proposed as anti-oxidative system in E hist.
IKAR is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its expression pattern is necessary for proper hematopoies. It collaborates with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (Nu) complex to repress and activate genes. However, it's unclear how IKAR supports activation while associated with the HD-containing Nu complex. IKAR also binds the positive transcription elongation factor (PTEb) at promoters. Researchers found that Nu and Pb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited by IKAR to specific genes. The level of IKAR influences recruitment of the Nu-Pb complex to gene regions and facilitates elongation by transferring phosphatase 1 (PPα), an IKAR-binding and Pb activator, to CD9. An IKAR mutant unable to bind PPα cannot sustain expression and normal differentiation of hematietic progenitors. Knockdown of the Nu subunit reveals occupancy of Nu at transcribed regions favors relief of II promoter pausing and promotes elongation.

 IKAR can be a licensing factor for Nu-Pb complex recruitment to chromatin and variation of IK thresholds during hematies influences Nu-Pb association IK and regulates elongation. Data show interaction of IK with Nu-P complex depends on IK levels. Low IK suffice Mi/Nu recruitment to promoters but higher IK required Nu-Pb and PPα chrom, CD9-Pb activation and elongation. IK-PP interaction is required normal hematiet differentiation of primary cells. IK is DNA subunit of newly characterized Nu-P multifunctional complex containing chrom remodeling (Nu) and elongation (Pb) activities. IK important CD9 and interaction and recruitment actively transcribed genes hematiet cells. IK interacts PP and dephosphorylated by this.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary history and geographic origins of rabies virus (RV) outbreaks in Trinidad, a Caribbean island with periodic outbreaks in livestock. They analyzed RV sequences from 1997-2010 and used a phylogeographic approach to determine if outbreaks were due to in-situ evolution or importation from the South American mainland. Results showed that Trinidadian RV clustered with vampire bat-related sequences and fell into two lineages, I and II. Lineage I included sequences from 1997-200, mostly from the northeast, closely related to RV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela. Lineage II comprised southwest sequences, clustering into IIa and IIb, related to Brazil and Uruguay. Phyloge analyses supported three RV introductions from the mainland for each lineage, with subsequent in-situ evolution and expansion. Data indicate co-circulation of lineages I and II in 200. The study suggests vampire bats as the origin of Trinidadian RV, and further research is needed to investigate RV dynamics and bat ecology, particularly between mainland and Trinidad.
Researchers have created a computational model to understand how genes control the development of distinct areas in the mammalian brain's cerebral cortex. The cortex is divided into many areas, each with specific functions, and their emergence during development depends on gene expression patterns. Five genes, Fgf, Em2, Pax, Coupfi, and Sp, play a crucial role in specifying area identity along the anterior-posterior axis. However, the interactions between these genes that lead to their spatial patterns are not well understood. The model simulated all possible interactions between the five genes to determine which combinations occur in networks that reproduce observed patterns. The model treated expression as Boolean, reflecting qualitative data available. Only networks that included certain interactions and combinations, such as auto-regulation and inductive loops, were able to reproduce patterns. Analysis showed that repressive interactions are more likely than inductive ones, but mutually repressive loops are not necessary for correct functioning. The model reveals principles of the gene network regulating area development and makes predictions for future experiments.
Researchers used a new technology called ChIP-Seq to study how a protein called B1 helps control gene expression in cells. B1 is part of a group of proteins called Polycomb (Pc) that regulate development by adding marks to histone proteins. Histone is a type of protein that DNA wraps around DNA. The study found that B1 helps add a mark called H2 to histone, which is linked to gene expression. They looked at how B1-dependent H2 is distributed across the genome in mouse cells called MEF. Results show that H2 is mostly found near the start of genes, especially those with a mark called H3me3. Genes with H2 have lower expression than those without it. When B1 is removed, genes with H2 have higher expression. H2 is not only found at H3me3 regions, but also at high-density CpG promoters. This suggests DNA methylation may be linked to H2 at these regions. This study reveals how B1-dependent H2 and its role in gene expression.
Pregnancy-induced non-coding RNA (PINC) plays a crucial role in regulating mammary epithelial differentiation during pregnancy. INC is highly expressed in alve cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and persists in cells that remain after involution. These cells are thought to function as alve progenitors, differentiating into milk-producing cells in subsequent pregnancies. However, the role of INC in maintaining this progenitor population was unknown. Research shows INC is enriched in luminal and alve progenitors, increasing throughout pregnancy and declining in early lactation when alve cells differentiate. INC levels decrease when mammary epithelial cells are induced to produce milk. Overexpression of INC blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown enhances differentiation. INC interacts with retinoblast-associated protein 46 (b46) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) members. Targets of INC are differentially expressed following modulation of INC levels. Data suggest INC inhibits terminal differentiation of alve cells during pregnancy, preventing milk production until parturition. The PR2 complex, including INC and b46, may confer epigenetic modifications maintaining mammary epithelial cells in alve fate in the involuted gland.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called PML, also known as TRIM19, in fighting off HIV and other retroviruses. P is mainly found in the nucleus, where it forms structures called PML bodies that recruit other proteins. When HIV and other retroviruses infect cells, they trigger P to move to the cytoplasm. This happens as early as 30 minutes post-infection, with a peak at 2 hours. P localization is blocked by reverse transcription inhibitors and not seen with unrelated viruses, suggesting it's triggered by retroviral reverse transcription. P interferes with an early step of retroviral infection, as P knockdown increases reverse transcription efficiency. P does not directly inhibit retrovir but acts through a partner protein called Dax. In the presence of P, cytoplasmic Dax is near HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse transcription. Dax also inhibits exogenous and endogenous retroviruses, making it a broad inhibitor of reverse transcription. These findings reveal a new antiviral function for P and PML body protein Dax.
Researchers have developed a new method for aligning multiple protein structures, called Matt, which allows for flexibility in the alignment process. Unlike previous methods, Matt temporarily allows small translations and rotations of fragments to bring them closer together, even if they wouldn't fit under rigid transformations. This is done in intermediate steps before restoring geometric consistency in the final alignment. Matt was tested on two benchmark datasets, Homstr and Smark, and performed competitively with other programs on Homstr but outperformed others on Smark, which has more distant homologous proteins. Matt excelled in aligning alpha-helices and beta-strands, important for structural library construction. It also distinguished between homologous and non-homologous proteins using a p-value based on common core and RMSD. The authors suggest Matt's success comes from modeling different conformations and backbone distortions in distantly related proteins.
Researchers studied how cells exit mitosis, a process of cell division, is regulated by enzymes called phosphatases and kinases. Phosphatases remove phosphate groups from proteins, while kinases add them. In mitosis, a kinase called Cdk is activated and a phosphatase called PP2/B is inactivated. PP/B is regulated by another phosphatase called En/AR19, which is also regulated by phosphorylation. The study used a combination of mathematical models and experiments to monitor phosphorylation of PP, En/AR and Cdk during mitosis. They found that PP is required for dephosphorylation of Cdk at a specific site En/AR deosphorylation is mediated by a phosphatase called F1. Surprisingly, inhibiting or depleting F or PP did not block deosphory of most Cdk substrates during mitosis. The study suggests a hierarchy of phosphatases controlling PP, En/AR and Cdk deosphory during mitosis.
Researchers studied how the HIV-1 virus evades the immune system's neutralizing antibodies (Nab) during the early stages of infection. Neutralizing antibodies are proteins that can limit the virus's ability to replicate and prevent new infections. They found that the virus can escape from these antibodies in two individuals with subtype C HIV-1 infection, even when they have high levels of antibodies. To understand how this escape, they created a series of envelope protein chimeras and mutants from resistant variants at different time points. In one subject, escape was driven by changes in the VV region of the gp120 protein, while in the other, escape was driven by changes in V2. The findings suggest that a single pathway is not enough for the virus to escape and that multiple strategies, including glycosylation, epitope alteration, and conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.
Researchers studied the genomes of 13 individuals from the plant species Capsella grandiflora to understand how positive and negative selection vary across the genome. They found that positive selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most non-coding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs. However, they also found strong signals of selection in noncoding conserved regions across the Brassicaceae family. Additionally, they saw reductions in neutral diversity around substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Using expression data from leaf tissue, they showed that highly expressed genes experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive to lowly expressed genes. Overall, they observed positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions, but results suggest both are rarer in plants than in animals.

The study used population genomics to quantify positive and negative selection inside and outside coding and highly and lowly expressed genes in Capsella grandl. The species has a large population size and low structure, making it suitable for studying genome-wide selection. They focused on conserved noncoding sequences (CNS), which show cross-species conservation and are candidates for functional noncoding under selection. They identified CNS in nine Brassaceae genomes and found both positive and negative in coding, 5' and 3 UTRs, and noncoding regions of the grandl genome, but a large nonDNA may evolve neutrally. They also found stronger selection in highly expressed genes compared to low genes, suggesting differences in selection drive evolution rates.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms resting B lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, which can lead to malignancies. Researchers found that EB-encoded protein EB2 drives the formation of new binding sites for two master regulators of B-cell fate, RBPκ and E1. Unlike previous studies, which suggested these factors are bound to specific gene promoters, EB2 induces new binding for RBPκ and E1, many of which are close to each other in the cellular and viral genome. These new sites are co-occupied by EB2-E1-RBPκ and correlate with transcription activation of genes important for B-lymphoblast function. Depleting EB2 leads to rapid change in RBPκ and E1 binding. Biochemical and RNA studies show cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. EB2 facilitates combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription and gene programming necessary for Blymphob growth and survival.

EBV type III promotes B-cell developmental program, increasing RBPκ sites. EB-encoded coactivator EB2 reprograms chromosome patterns of master transcription factors RBPκ and E1. EB2 localizes with E1 and Rκ at enhancer regions in EB positive lymphoid cell lines. E1 and Rκ are regulatory factors in lymph development, but their cooperativity not established. EB2 not alters chromosome site selection of specific DNA factors. EB different gene programs depend on cell or tumor, epigenetic factors. EB encodes cofactors, including EB2, remodel and host gene to confer proliferation and immortalization to resting Bells.2 binds sequence factors like Rκ and PU.2 is coactivator expressed in early EB proliferation of naïve Bells, but extinguished later B development.2 interacts with sequence Rκ at promoters and enhancers of2-regulated genes.
Aedes aegypt mosquitoes, the primary vector of four deng virus (DENV) serotypes, exhibit genetic differences in their ability to transmit the virus across populations in Mexico. Research has shown that the intersection of the Neovolcan axis (N) with the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz acts as a barrier to gene flow among Ae.egyti populations north and south of N. This barrier also affects their vector competence (VC) for deng serotype 2 (DENV2), with mosquitoes north of N having an average VC of 0.55 and south of N an average of 0.20. Most of this variation is due to midgut infection barriers, with 21.5% of Ae.egti north of N failing to develop midut infections and 30.3% of those infected failing to develop disseminated, compared to 45.2% failing to develop midut and 62.8% failing to disseminate south of N. Barriers to gene flow in vector populations may impact epidemiologically relevant traits such as competence. Further studies are needed to determine why N is a barrier to flow and whether differences in competence north and south N are epidemiologically significant.

Aeegti collected for genetic studies were also phenotyped for VC for DENV, revealing variation in competence in Mexico. Southern Verac Coastal Aeegti differed significantly, with Merida, Chum, and Canc the most competent and Nuevoared and Houston least. The goal is to determine if VC correlates with d incidence, identifying biomarkers for targeting control efforts. Aeegti south of N exhibited low VC, with some cities like Molo having zero seroprevalence. Human trafficking and commerce may be the principal barrier, but further investigation is needed. N is associated with different phenotypes, with low competence south of N unusual.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Dna protein in the replication cycle of Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria. Dna cycles between two forms, ATP-bound and ADP-bound, and is thought to control the frequency of initiation, or start, of replication. To test this, they created cells with a surplus of ATP-Dna, the active form, to see if initiation would occur earlier. However, cells with more than a 50% increase in ATP-Dna showed no change in timing of replication. This suggests that while Dna drives the process, its accumulation does not control the timing. Other factors must be involved in response to the cell's environment. The researchers also looked at the role of Dna-dependent Dna inactivation (DA) and the Dna-binding protein Dia. Loss of DA affected the cycle during slow growth and made cells sensitive to Dia protein. This indicates compromised machinery performs less robustly. The study proposes that E. coli has a robust cycle driven by Dna levels, initiation occurs with sufficient ATP-Dna, and timing is governed by signals from the cell's environment.
Researchers have developed a new approach called partial Granger causality to study interactions in the frequency domain of oscillatory activity, which plays a crucial role in various biological processes from cellular to organismal levels. This method can reveal patterns in multivariate data with exogenous and latent variables in the frequency domain. It was tested with toy models and applied to experimental datasets, including gene array data of HeLa cell cycle, in vivo-electrode array (MEA) field potentials from sheep's inferotemporal cortex, and in vivo potentials from macaque monkey's right hemisphere.

The study aimed to show that ad hoc definitions of causality like PDC in frequency can be misleading, contradicting time domain Grangerality and frequency Granger. Due to HeLa microarray data's one-hour sampling rate, dynamical activity at minute scale couldn't be assessed. LFPs were collected during monkey's GO-NOO visual task, showing beta (14-30 Hz) oscillatory activity in sensorotor cortex during prestimulus. Pairwise Granger showed connectivity in Figure 5, but partial Granger in time (Figure 4C) and frequency (Figure 4E) revealed complete relationship.

A toy model with exogenous and latent variables was used to illustrate frequency decomposition of partialanger. Five time series were defined by equations εi(t), zero-mean uncorrelated with variances, ai exogenous input, and biε(t-1)ci(t-2 latent influence. The partialanger definition depends on conditional variance, a well-understood notation. Dealing with exogenous and latent is central in statistics, extensive literature exists.
Researchers have developed new methods for determining ancestry in individuals with mixed ancestry, such as those of Latin American descent. This is important for medical and genetic research, including finding disease-causing genes, recombination rates, and mapping the human genome. Previous methods were designed for genotyping and didn't use all the data from sequencing. New methods use continent-specific variants to improve accuracy. They combine data from sequenced individuals with public data, like the 1000 Genomes, to improve variant calling. Simulations show this approach is as accurate as computationally intensive methods, but faster. The method recovers ancestry as well as the 100 Genomes consensus in real individuals. It also works at low sequencing coverage. The approach is extended to sub-continental variants and can determine sub-ancestry on short chromosomal segments. 

The new method uses continent-specific variants, found only in certain groups, to infer ancestry. Data from 100 Genomes shows these variants are common across the genome, allowing fast and accurate inference. A study of 15,000 African Americans and another of 30,000 for recombination used this method. Sequencing catalogs more variants than genotyping, many being continent-specific. The concept is extended to sub-population variants and can infer ancestry from two ancestries from the same continent. As sequencing costs decrease and more samples are sequenced, accuracy and runtime become critical for ancestry inference. The method iteratively re-estimates variants using inferred ancestry in samples. First, it estimates using reference haplotype panels, then local ancestry, and re-estimates using confidently called segments.
Researchers have found that almost all genes in mammals exhibit daily oscillations in their expression levels, a phenomenon previously thought to be limited to a small percentage of genes in the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues. By applying digital signal processing algorithms to gene expression data, they identified circadian oscillations in nearly 100% of expressed genes. This suggests that daily fluctuations in gene expression are a natural feature of nearly all biological pathways, affecting the entire system as a whole. However, not all oscillating genes are directly linked to the circadian molecular clock, and changes in expression due to mutations or environmental factors like light or feeding should be considered in the context of oscillation amplitude and phase.

The researchers used a new approach to analyze gene expression data, combining statistical tests for periodicity with digital signal processing. This allowed them to identify circadian oscillations in a larger number of genes compared to previous methods, which only considered one gene at a time and lacked statistical power to detect circadian component. The method involves converting gene profiles into a continuous stream to reduce noise and enhance signal, making it possible to identify patterns with confidence.

The study used data from murine liver and found that circadian genes show no significant variation in amplitude among tissues, and perturbations in oscillating systems depend on circadian time and wave properties of biological pathways.
Researchers used whole-genome resequencing to study recombination in a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers. They identified 325 crossover events at a resolution of 1.4 kb, with 86% occurring within 10 kb. Crossover rates were higher in males (3.56/Mb) than females (2.28/M) and increased towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossovers were non-randomly distributed, with hotspots in genic regions, highest in promoters and CpG islands. They also found 267 non-crosso events, associated with crossover locations, and a bias towards 'G' over 'A' alleles, suggesting GC-bi conversion. This approach can be applied to other species, providing a detailed recombination landscape.
Researchers have studied the unique properties of repeat-proteins, which are made up of repeated amino acid sequences that fold into elongated structures. They found that the folding of these proteins can be analyzed as a one-dimensional problem due to their symmetries in sequence and three-dimensional structure. A new model was developed to describe the energy landscape of repeat-prote based on the interactions between folding elements, treated as variables. The overall stability and cooperativity of the protein can be derived from this description. The one-dimensional nature of the model leads to simple relations for experimental observables, such as folding energy and denaturation, which don't apply to globular proteins. Parameters for the coarse-grained description of foldon variables were extracted from detailed simulations on funneled landscapes. A case study of tetratricptide (PR) repeat proteins was presented, relating results to experimentally observed transitions. Single point mutations were shown to affect folding behavior, suggesting natural proteins are poised at particular ratios of inter and intra-element energetics for structural transitions in physi conditions, related to biological functions.
Researchers have investigated the role of the stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer linked to viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. They found that CHOP is overexpressed in human and mouse models of HCC, and that mice lacking CH are resistant to liver cancer and fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. Gene profiling showed that CH deletion reduces inflammatory signaling in the liver. The study suggests CH contributes to HCC by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation, making it a common factor in the development of H in various liver diseases. CH is associated with liver injury and upstream of fibrosis, and mice lacking CH are protected from fib and tumorigenesis, indicating a stepwise progression from CH expression to tumors. Understanding how CH promotes oncogenesis has implications for other cancers beyond H, and reveals a link between H and stimuli that predispose to it.
Researchers conducted a systematic review of studies on the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethopica in Ethiopia. They found 24 records of 506 treatment episodes, with antimonials, pentam, and cryotherapy being the most commonly used treatments. However, the quality of the studies was poor, with only two small, old randomized trials and two non-randomized studies on cryotherapy, antimonials, and pentam. The cure rates for cryotherapy were 60-80% and 69-85 for antimonials. Pentam was effective against complicated cases and non-responsive to antimonials, but all studies had methodological limitations. Data on milteine, paromycin, and liposomal amphotin were scarce, with few studies on diffuse cutaneous leishiasis (DCL). Antimonials with paromycin or pentam may be effective for D, but not evaluated. The evidence for treating CL due Lethopica is limited, with antimonials being the most available treatment in Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety should be defined. Alternative treatments like miline or paromycin should be explored. High-quality trials are needed to evaluate options in parallel.
Scientists have successfully recreated a circadian clock in a laboratory setting using three purified proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. This artificial clock displays the same properties as natural circadian rhythms, including a 24-hour cycle and temperature compensation. To understand how this clock works, researchers studied interactions between the proteins using electron microscopy and gel electrophoresis. They found that the proteins form different complexes at different stages of the cycle, and used this data to create a model that accurately predicts the clock's behavior. The model shows that the proteins exchange among themselves, which helps maintain the clock's rhythm. To test this, researchers applied temperature pulses to the clock and found it can be reset. This study provides a detailed understanding of the circadian clock at a molecular level never seen before.
Researchers investigated the relationship between trial-to-trial variability in brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual detection task using electrocorticography (EG). They found an inverted-U shaped relationship between trial-trial brain activity and behavioral output, where larger variability was associated with better performance. This was observed in both post-stimulus-evoked and pre-stimulus brain activity, suggesting anticipatory dynamics. The study supports the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and attractor network theories, which propose the brain settles into a confined state under performance and proximity to the target is associated with better performance. Variability can be decoupled from trial-averaged activity and correlated with behavior, predicting an inverted relationship between trial-trial activity and performance. The findings are consistent with previous studies showing variability can be modulated independently from trial-aver activity and behaviorally relevant information can be encoded in variability not activity. The study suggests two sources of brain variability: deterministic and stochastic, with the latter imposing an inverted relationship between trialial activity and performance.
Researchers studied the mating-type loci (MAT) in 24 species of Trichporales, a group of fungi closely related to the pathogenic Cryptococcus. They found that the MAT loci are fused into a single gene in each mating type, similar to Cryptoccus, but with different HD and P allele combinations. This suggests that the fusion of HD and P loci occurred independently in Trichporales and Cryptoccus, supporting the idea of convergent evolution towards fused MAT regions. Unlike other fungi, the gene content and order within the MAT loc are highly conserved in Trichporales, and there is no suppression of recombination from MAT to adjacent chromosomal regions. This indicates different mechanisms for evolution of linked MAT loci in these groups. The study provides insights into the evolution of genomic regions involved in mating and mating determination in fungi. Fungi are excellent models to study the evolution of mating-type genes, which are located in MAT loci. The ancestral state of basidiomycetes is tetrapolar, with two unlinked MAT loci controlling mating at the haploid stage. However, some basomycetes have bipolar systems through linkage of HD and P loci or loss of P locus function.
Chagas disease, a major vector-borne disease in Latin America, is still a significant threat due to nonomiciliated vectors, despite efforts to control domiciliated ones. A mathematical model was developed to predict the abundance of nonomic vectors in houses, using data from the Yucan Peninsula, Mexico. The model accurately predicted field data with and without insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was effective at 50mg/m2 yearly for two months during immigration season, reducing >80% abundance. However, larger doses or more frequent spraying decreased effectiveness. Insect screens reduced abundance proportionally to immigration rate. Insecticide spraying requires yearly application and understanding of immigration patterns, but screens offer a sustainable alternative for integrated control of vectororne diseases.
Feather patterning in avian skin relies on a coordinated interaction between fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, along with mesenchymal cell movement, in a reaction-diffusionaxis system. This system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration through a positive feedback loop centered on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation, compressing the epidermis to intensify F20 expression. The wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of ectodysplasin (E), which initiates F20 expression. The E wave spreads across mesenchym cell density, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchym cells to begin a feather bud. In flighted birds, the EDA/Ectodplasin receptor (EDAR) pathway activates this process in a quasi-1 dimensional manner, imposing highly ordered formation.

The periodic patterning system relies on epithelial FGF to attract mesenchym cells to aggregate, explaining the absence of F20 in scaleless mutant failure of feather primord formation. High-density dependence for feather development likely rests on rapid mesenchal condensation and stabilisation of F20 than distinct cell phenotypes. Skin of chicken, duck, ostrich, and emu embryos have differences in feather arrangements. F20 was elevated in contracted tissue, supporting aggregation activation of F production. Other genes (AX2, BMP,4, E, ED) were not altered. Results point to operation of reaction-diffaxis system in patterning.

Initiation of feather formation begins with dermal mesenchal condensation beneath epidermal plac. Structures are identifiable by cell packing and gene expression. Combined, the primord grows into filament, branches, and produces feather.
Researchers conducted a systematic review of studies on the presence and persistence of Ebola and Marburg viruses in patients and survivors. The review aimed to determine which body fluids are infectious and pose a risk to humans. They analyzed 683 articles and found 33 eligible studies that met the criteria. Most body types had insufficient data to draw conclusions, and prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Fluids taken 16 days after onset were usually negative. RT-PCR tests detected filirus RNA more often than tissue culture. Filirus was found in most body types of fluid, but not every sample from every confirmed patient. Apart from semen, non-blood RT-PCR samples were likely negative and possibly low risk. Contact with blood and blood-stained fluids remains major transmission risk due to high viral loads in blood.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model, called the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model, to describe how neurons in the brain respond to electrical signals. Unlike traditional models, this model takes into account how the past electrical activity of the neuron affects its current response. This is done by using a fractional derivative, a mathematical concept that looks at the weighted average of past values. The model shows that by changing the weight of past values, the neuron's response can adapt to signals in different ways, such as speeding up or slowing down. The researchers tested the model on real neurons in a lab and found it matched their behavior. The model also showed how neurons respond to noise and oscillating signals. The model's behavior is different from traditional models, which don't account for past activity, and shows how the brain's internal dynamics affect how it responds to signals. The model can be used to understand how neurons work and how the brain processes information.
Researchers have identified six superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms in the fungus Paroccoides, which helps it defend against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host cells. To counteract these radicals, Parocoid expresses different antioxidant enzymes, including SODs. The study analyzed gene expression of SOD in Paroid isolates from different phylogenetic lineages (S1, 2, 3, and Pb01) using quantitative RT-PCR. They found increased expression of PbS1 and Pb3 during transition, exposure to oxidative agents and interaction with phagoc cells, suggesting these proteins help combat superoxide radicals during host-pathogen interaction. Using Pb1 and Pb3 knockdown strains, researchers showed these genes are involved in fungus response to host cells, particularly oxidative stress, in a mouse infection model. Protein analysis and knockdown strains suggest Pb3 is linked to extracellular activity while Pb1 is related intracellular. Data suggests Parocid responds to endogenous radicals and counteracts oxidative burst by inducing S isoforms.
Researchers investigated the relationship between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and chaperone binding in cells. IDPs are sensitive to proteolysis in vitro but show no enhanced degradation in vivo, leading to the hypothesis that they may be associated with chaper for protection. Analysis of high-throughput interaction data showed that predicted disorder by the IUP algorithm negatively correlates with chaper binding in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metaz species. This means IDPs tend to avoid chaper binding. The effect may be due to the presence of ordered domains, as observed with Pfam domains. Chaper binding to disordered proteins is often accompanied by binding to other proteins, suggesting ID use chaper for assembly with partners rather than folding. In all three taxonomic groups, non-chone proteins have twice as much disorder as chone-binding proteins. Disorder does not distinguish between proteins with or without glob domains, which are potential chone sites. Selecting chone-binding proteins with at least one glob domain showed that ID that bind chone are likely to bind other proteins. There is overlap between chone and nonone proteins, so the study compared disorder of those that only bind chone and those that bind both chone and other proteins. Results showed a difference in disorder between the two groups.
Researchers studied the role of two transcription factors, Salm and Salr, in the development of the fruit fly wing. These proteins are regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway and are necessary for cell survival and growth in the central region of the wing, as well as vein patterning in the lateral regions. To understand how they work, the researchers looked for genes directly controlled by Salm and Sal, and analyzed their functions. They compared gene expression in discs with and without Salm/Sal using microarray experiments and in situ hybridization. This revealed a complex landscape regulated by Sp proteins in the wing, including genes turned off and on by Salm/Sr. Loss-of-function analysis of these genes showed some are required for growth and patterning. The study opens a new way to understand the genetic structure of the wing, linking Dpp to epithelial tissue development.
Researchers have identified a new regulators of centri duplication in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Centrioles are essential for cell division and their number is tightly controlled to prevent cancer and birth defects. A protein called ZYG-1 is required for centri duplication, but how its levels are regulated was unclear. Two proteins, G-1 and G-2, and their regulators I-2 and SDS-22, were found to control Z-1 levels. Reducing G-1 activity restored centri duplication in a Z- mutant and increased Z- levels. Data suggest G- regulates Z- post-translationally. Inhibiting G- in a mutant restored centri, but in wild-type led to centri overproduction. This pathway limits centri number per cell cycle.
Researchers investigated visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in a protected area in southeastern Brazil, where the disease was first detected in 2009 in a dog living in an upscale condominium. Since then, cases were restricted to dogs in two contiguous condominiums within the area. A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate Leishmania infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies using molecular and serological techniques. Canine seroprevalence was 1.5% in 2013 and 1.2% in 2015. Six species, confirmed or suspected vectors or transmitters of Leish, were identified, including Lutzia longipal, the main vector in Brazil. Two specimens were captured in the area. Infection by L. L. infant was recorded in an opossum and Pomy monticola. Infection by L. L. infant and Leish subgenus Viia was detected in white-eared opossum, a known VL reservoir. Geographical coordinates of infected animals were plotted on a map, showing proximity to human residences, including dogs positive for VL, and forest areas. The area has an active VL focus. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease foci in similar scenarios, e.g. wild areas undergoing modifications, is evident. Different epidemiological profiles of VL must be included in prevention and control measures considering each area's particularities.
Epstein-Barr virus (EB)-encoded microRNA miR-B9 promotes tumor metastasis by targeting E-cadherin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MicroRNAs (miRN) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression and play critical roles in cellular processes. EB, an oncogenic virus, is associated with nasaryngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly metastatic tumor common in Asia. Previous studies found viral proteins promote NPC migration and invasiveness, but not all tissues express these oncoproteins, suggesting other mechanisms contribute to tumor behavior. A study revealed EB miR9 expressed high in EB-positive NPC tissues. This study investigated miR9 effect in EB-negative and EB-positive NPC cells using gain and loss-function approaches. mi9 promotes migration and invas in cultured cells, and enhanced metastatic ability in vivo. Analysis revealed mi9 targets Eadher, a protein preserving cell junctions and epithelial phenotype. Biochemical and functional assays confirmed mi9 inhibits Eher to induce mesenchymal phenotype and promote NPC migration. Results indicate mi9 a promastatic viralRNA and high levels mi9 in EB-positive cells contribute to tumor aggressiveness.

The abundance of mi9 and downmodulation cellular mi200 members in EB tumors drive epithelial cells to mesenchal with enhanced motility and metastatic behavior. mi9 and mi200 share same sequence critical for interaction. Studies shown mi200 significantly downmodulated in NPC. This study demonstrated EB-encoded miR9 highly in NPC and mi9 directly Eadher to mesenchal and migratory NPC cells. A sequencing revealed mi9 most abundantly expressed EB in tumors. Taq-based PCR confirmed majority NPC mi9 higher than abundant oncogenic mi21. Depletion mi9 increased luciferase activities, indicating suppression mi9 activities 50-70 with treatment lentiviral-mi9 expressing NPC. Ectopic mi9 physiological promotes migration capability EB-negative cells and confirmed mi9 promatory viral. Unlike LMP and L2, transcripts consistently detected high NPC, findings indicate mi significant contributor migr and invasive EB-infected cells.
Researchers have developed a new software tool called gashimi for visualizing splicing events in RNA-seq data. This tool is a command-line program that can create sash plots for individual samples or groups of experiments. Unlike other programs, gash is annotation-independent and can handle large genomic regions by scaling down segments between splice sites. It is available on GitHub and implemented in Python, generating R code for plotting. Aash plots were initially part of the MISO software, which compares splicing from RNA-seq data. Current implementations include a standalone utility for MISO-indexed splicing and IGV's built-in viewer. Visualizing splicing is challenging because events occur between distant sites, up to hundreds of kilobases apart. Gash aggregates samples and shrinks intron lengths to enhance visualization. The sash representation is a standard for splicing, but current implementations have limitations, such as needing specialized formats and supporting few samples. Gash solves these issues, eliminating formats and supporting hundreds of samples.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict and align cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across species, which are crucial for gene regulation. Current methods struggle with aligning non-coding sequences and existing models don't account for CRMs' unique properties. The new model captures evolution of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and background sequences, including gains and losses of TFBS, a key in regulatory evolution. A computational framework uses this model to align and predict CRMs, improving over existing methods. The approach is similar to statistical alignment but uses conserved sites to improve alignment and deals with uncertainties of site annotations and sequence in a probabilistic framework. Simulated and real data show the method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The model was applied to Drosophila melanogaster genome-wide binding data, revealing intriguing results: TF-bound sequences are conserved even if neighboring genes aren't expressed and distal sites are more conserved than proximal. The method is implemented as software, EMMA, for broad biological use.
Researchers studied the role of the piRNA pathway in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, in maintaining genome stability and telomere protection. Telomeres are protective caps on chromosome ends that prevent DNA damage. The piRNA pathway silences transposons, mobile genetic elements that can harm the genome, but its role in development was unclear. Mutations in pi pathway genes arm, aub, ago3, and rhi led to fragmented zygotic genome during early embryonic divisions. a and arm also disrupted telom resolution during meiosis and cleavage divisions, while lig-IV mutations suppressed fusions. However, lig-IV mutations increased fragmentation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed a and arm mutations disrupted telom binding of HOAP, a telom protection component, and reduced 19-22nt telom-specific piRNA expression. rhi and ago mutations did not block HO binding or piRNA production. These findings revealed separate functions for the pi pathway: a, arm, r, and ago silenced transpos and maintained genome integrity, while a and arm assembled telom protection complex.
Researchers have identified a new Ebola virus responsible for a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Uganda. The virus, called Bundibugyo ebolavirus, is closely related to another Ebola virus, Côte d'Ivoireb, found in West Africa, despite being from a different region. This discovery is significant because it may affect how we design tests to detect Ebola in humans and animals, and develop treatments and vaccines. The new virus was found in 29 suspect blood samples using standard tests and a new DNA sequencing method. The outbreak in Bundibyo District, Western Uganda, started in November 2007, with 7 cases reported. The Ministry of Health was notified on November 28, 2007. The new virus is different from known Ebola viruses, which may lead to different symptoms and severity. Current vaccines for Ebola include Zaire and Sudan viruses, but it's unclear if they will protect against Bundugyo. Studies are needed to determine if vaccines need to be updated. The new virus also affects how we screen for treatments and test their effectiveness. The Bundugyo outbreak resulted in 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths by December 2007, with a fatality rate of 36%. This is lower than the 80-90% for Zaire and 50-55% for Sudan viruses. Further studies are needed to compare the viruses' severity in non-human primates. New tests were sent to Uganda to quickly identify cases and control the outbreak, which ended in December 2007.
Researchers studied the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a group of 648 patients over 4.78 years. They used the Global Deteration Scale (GDS) and Functional Staging (FAST) to track the disease's seven stages from normal to severe dementia. Each stage has a published average duration, but the variation was unknown. The study found that the standard deviations for stages 4-6 were similar to their means, indicating large variations in progression among patients. This suggests that AD is a heterogeneous disease with different subgroups of patients declining at different rates. The study's findings are consistent with previous reports of variability in AD's progression, which can range from months to decades. The reasons for this variability are still unclear, but may be due to multiple factors. The study's extensive 23-year dataset and representation of patients at stages 4-7 of AD provide new insights into the disease's progression.
Researchers have extended a model of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus to include realistic spatially driven input patterns from grid cells in the entorinal cortex. They compared three adaptation strategies: conventional plasticity, turnover, and additive neurogenesis. Additive neurogenesis, where the network starts with fewer units and grows over time, outperformed the others. A more biologically plausible rule that incorporates cell death and plasticity of new granule cells performed better than any individual strategy. This rule can be tailored for short or long-term memory. The model was tested over an animal's lifetime under different rearing conditions, showing distinct profiles that could be experimentally tested. Place cells emerged in a realistic manner due to sparsification by the dentate gyrus layer. 

The model is based on rodent literature and provides a starting point for comparative analysis as more data becomes available. Additive neurogenesis allows the network to adapt in a way not possible with conventional plasticity or turnover. A multidimensional Gaussian distributions modeled input patterns at the entorinal layer. A sophisticated neuro rule that incorporates death and plasticity of new granule cells solved the problem and is superior. If death occurs randomly, the network has similar performance when decoding memories from earlier environments, suitable for long-term memory.
African trypanosomes, a type of parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and animals, have enzymes called peroxides that protect their cells from damage. These enzymes, called Px, detoxify lipid hydroperox, a type of molecule that can harm cells. Without these enzymes, the parasite's cells die quickly. Researchers studied two types of Px, one in the cell's liquid (cytosol) and one in the mitochondria. They found that the cytos Px protects the lysosome, a part of the cell that breaks down waste, from damage. Without cytos Px, the lysosome breaks down and the cell dies. The researchers also found that the parasite gets iron from its host's transferrin, a protein that carries iron. Without iron, the lysosome breaks down and the cell dies. The study shows that the lysosome, not the mitochondria, is the main site of damage in African trypanosomes. The cytos Px enzymes protect the lysosome from iron damage. This is linked to how the parasite gets iron from its host.
Researchers have studied the role of a protein called PMEL in melanocytes, cells that produce the pigment melanin in skin, hair, and eyes. PMEL is a conserved across vertebrates and mutations in several species are linked to reduced melanin levels in skin and hair. However, it was unclear if these mutations were gain or loss-of-function, and no complete loss-of-function had been reported in mammals. A mouse line was created where the PM gene was inactivated (P−/−). The mice were viable, fertile, and showed no developmental defects. Melanosomes in P−/− melanocytes were spherical, unlike the elongated shape in wild-type. This was seen in skin and eye melanocytes. Inactivating PM had a mild effect on coat color in four genetic backgrounds, with the strongest effect in mice with the brown/Tp mutation. This is similar to the silver mutation in mice, suggesting other described alleles in vertebrates are dominant-negative. Despite mild effect on pigmentation, P− led to reduced melanin in hair, showing PM's role in maintaining epidermal pigmentation.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental methods for deng vector control. Nineteen studies were included, with sixteen contributing to the meta-analysis. The methods evaluated were: container covers with and without insecticides, waste management and clean-up, and elimination of breeding sites. Quality was highest for container covers with insecticides, followed by waste management without direct collection and elimination of places. Both review and meta showed a weak effect on larval populations, with no differences between individual results. For meta, container without insect (BI: -7.9, DOE-5) and waste with garbage (BI: -8.83, DOE-6.2) achieved strongest reductions for BI, while P results were opposite with covers (P: -0.83, 0.09) and elimination (P: -0.95, -0.83). Each method showed effectiveness in reducing Aedes larval and pupal densities. However, high-quality studies are needed to strengthen evidence. A previous studies concluded environmental management was effective, and community-based interventions reduced deng risk. This study aimed to review and meta environmental methods. Searches were finished in 2017, but no further studies altered results. All methods showed effectiveness in reducing Aedes densities, partly due to study design issues and linking control and transmission.
Researchers have identified small molecules that can selectively stall protein synthesis by the ribosome, a key to developing new treatments for diseases. These compounds, like PF-06303, inhibit PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, reducing LDL in preclinical models. However, their impact on cell physiology and ribosome control pathways is unknown. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was used to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of PF-03. The most potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness in presence of PF03 were the ubiquitin binding protein ASC2 and helicase ASC3, which bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of the compound. Surprisingly, translation control proteins Pelota and H1 sensitize cells to PF03 treatment. Genetic experiments showed ASC3 acts with ASC2 and downstream of H1. These results connect ribosome control pathways and provide insights into selectivity of compounds that stall translation, aiding development of next-generation compounds to treat diseases.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) causes widespread destruction of cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) to evade the immune system and block host gene expression. The virus uses a protein called SO to induce this effect, but its mechanism was unknown. The study found that SO stimulates RNA turnover through a unique process called aberrant polyadenylation, where the addition of extra adenine nucleotides to the end of RNA. Cells expressing SO show longer poly A tails and faster RNA turnover. Inhibiting poly A tail formation blocks SO activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly A binding proteins are necessary for SO function, with the latter relocating to the nucleus when SO is present. This is a new mechanism of host shutdown and a model to study poly A tail-stimulated RNA turnover in mammalian cells.

The study links polyadenylation to RNA surveillance and turnover, as yeast mutants defective in RNA processing accumulate hyperadenylated transcripts. Analogous pathways may exist in higher eukaryotes, with polyadenylated precursors detected in mammalian cells. KSH SO-induced shutoff is linked to polyadenylation, a first example of enhanced turnover coupled to hyperylation in metazoans. The ribonuc responsible for mRNA destruction is unknown, but SO may alter RNA processing to make them targets of quality control machinery. Polyaden plays a role in SO-mediated turnover, as SO has no intrinsic ribonuclease activity and no homology to known ribonucleases.

Expression of SO from herpes simplex virus has DNase activity but no role in shutoff and no effect on reporter mobility. This modification correlates with RNA activity of SO responsible for shutoff. Polyadenylation alters message size, a way to regulate expression on individual and global scale.
Researchers studied the role of type III interferon (IFλ) in the immune response to bacterial infections in the lungs. They found that IFλ is produced in response to Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and is essential for clearing the bacteria from the lungs. Mice lacking the IFλ receptor, IL-28, had reduced bacterial clearance and increased lung damage. IFλ inhibits the microRNA mi-21, leading to increased expression of PDC4, a protein that promotes inflammation. In mice lacking P4, bacterial clearance and lung damage were improved. The study suggests that IFλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting mi-21 regulation of PDC in bacterial infections. IFλ and P4 are key elements in the immune response to airway pathogens, but have different effects in inducing immunity. The expression of IL-28 is more abundant on epithelial cells than immune cells, which may contribute to specific cytokine responses to pathogens. The study shows that inhibiting IL-28 signaling reduces lung inflammation and improves bacterial clearance.
Researchers at the National Center for African Trypanosomiasis in the Democratic Republic of Congo studied mortality trends and risk factors in 781 patients with advanced stage-2 sleeping sickness between 1989 and 2012. The study found that 17.2% of patients died in the standard melarsol treatment group, 12.1% in the short melarsol group, 5.4 in the eflornine group, 9.1 in the NECT regimen, and 36% in the group given efline due to clinical status. After adjusting for treatment, the odds of death were higher for patients with severely impaired clinical status, high protach, parasites in cerebrospinal fluid, and cyach. Multivariate analysis showed clinical status and protach as predictors of death in some groups. The study's clinical assessment algorithm may serve as a basis for standardized tools in managing sleeping sickness and epidemiological reports.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the effects of isolation on social behavior in fruit flies, specifically Drosophila melanogaster. They created a system to track and analyze the behavior of many flies at once, and used it to examine how isolation affects their social interactions. The team found that isolation quickly changes the way flies interact with each other and their own behavior. They also looked at the genetic changes in the flies after isolation and found that many genes related to metabolism were affected. The flies had more lipids, a type of fat, after isolation. The study shows that isolation has a strong impact on social behavior, genes, and physiology in flies. This method can be used to study social behavior in other animals, including humans. 

The researchers used a new system to track and classify the behavior of many flies and analyze their social network. They found that isolation changes the way flies interact with each other and their own behavior. The team also looked at genetic changes in the flies after isolation and found that many genes related to metabolism were affected. The flies had more lipids, a type of fat, after isolation. The study shows that isolation has a strong impact on social behavior, genes, and physiology in flies. This method can be used to study social behavior in other animals, including humans. 

The team used a new system to track and classify the behavior of many flies and analyze their network. They found that isolation changes the way flies interact with each other and their behavior. The team looked at genetic changes in the flies after isolation and found many genes related to metabolism were affected. The flies had more lipids, a type of fat after. The study shows isolation has a strong impact on social behavior, genes, and physiology in flies. This can be used to study social in other animals, including humans.
Researchers conducted a pilot study in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines, including a modality for age-based weight estimation. The study took place in two hospitals that lacked scales, necessitating weight estimation. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period with 10-day post-discharge follow-up. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc. A total of 841 patients were enrolled (325 pre-intervention, 516 intervention). During the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at both hospitals (p < 0.001) with risk ratios (RRs) of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. However, when IV fluids were prescribed, the volume adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the antibiotic azithromycin increased (p < 0.001; p= 0.035) with RR of 6.9 and 1.6, while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased; zinc adherence increased. The study found that a smartphone tool can improve guideline adherence.
Scientists have long struggled to predict how host-parasite systems will respond to climate change due to the complexity of their interactions. A key factors such as host survival and parasite virulence may have different temperature dependencies that need to be included in disease models. Researchers used experimental data from Daphnia magna and a microidian parasite to develop a mechanistic model of within parasite dynamics. The model accounted for host mortality, parasite growth, and infection cost at different temperatures with fewer parameters than traditional models. The study shows that linking metabolic theory with a host-parite framework can predict parasite population responses at the within-host level.

The researchers analyzed data on host and parasite across a temperature range using a model to capture thermal dependencies of aging and virulence, growth, and abundance. They fitted a model to experimental data on Dnia and its parasite to examine temperature effects on traits, interactions, and dynamics. Over nine temperatures, they measured lifespan of exposed and unexposed and parasite abundance at death. Accurate predictions of climate change on host-parite and disease require models that integrate thermal dependencies of host and parasite traits. Development, survival, and movement can be described by formula from metabolic theory. These inform classical host-parite models to estimate temperature effects on prevalence and severity.

The study demonstrates the power of linking metabolic thermal relationships for host and parasite in mechanistic models to understand temperature impacts on disease. The framework is simple and general, providing a valuable approach to predict outcomes and consequences of infections under climate change.
Researchers have identified a network of three types of inhibitory neurons, called interneurons, that play a crucial role in controlling the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) in the brain. These interneurons, expressing parvalbum (PV), somostatin (SOM), and vaso intestinal peptide (VIP), work together to shape how information is processed in the brain. The study suggests that PV and SOM interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, while mutual inhibition between SOM and VIP interneurons translates inputs into changes in somatic dendritic inhibition of PCs. A computational model shows that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. The SOM-VIP motif allows the circuit to switch between two processing modes, either integrating or cancelling top inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs. SOM-expressing neurons mainly target apical dendrites of PCs and inhibit other interneurons, while VIP-express mainly connects to dendrite-targeting SOM neurons, providing a disinhibitory circuit for distal dendrites of PCs.
Researchers have found that interactions between microbes in the microbiome can create false associations between specific microbes and host phenotypes, making it difficult to determine which microbes are directly linked to a disease. They developed a method, called Direct Association Analysis, to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. The method corrected inflated p-values in association tests and showed only a small subset of associations are directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate, and brain-gut axis as factors in inflammatory disease. The study suggests that realistic interactions produce many spurious associations between microbiome and phenotypes, which can be removed by a procedure based on maximum entropy models from statistical physics. Microbiome association studies have been carried out for various disorders, including diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and autism. However, non-causal relationships give rise to spurious associations in synthetic and real microbiome data. The study used parameters from a large case-control study on Crohn's disease and found traditional methods lost power to identify the link between phenotype and microbiota. The number of detections increased for real data, suggesting many reported associations between microbi and IBD could be indirect. The researchers estimated the contribution of indirect associations and isolated direct, showing interactions are strong enough to generate changes in abundance of microbes not linked to host.
Researchers compared two types of Wolbachia infection models in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes to block the spread of dengue and West Nile viruses. Wolia is a bacterium that infects mosquitoes and can affect how they transmit diseases. The study looked at two types of Wolia infection: stable and transient. Stable Wolia is when Wolia is permanently in the mosquito, while transient is when Wolia is only in the mosquito for a short time. The researchers tested how Wolia affects the replication and transmission of deng and West Nile viruses in mosquitoes. They found that Wolia blocked the viruses in both types of infection, but the effect was stronger in mosquitoes with stable Wolia. They also found no evidence that Wolia made the viruses spread faster in mosquitoes. This suggests that Wolia can be a safe and effective way to stop the spread of these viruses.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, cilia are microtub-based organelles that mediate signal transduction and are organized into structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the basal body, the transition zone (TZ), and the cilia shaft. In vertebrates, the protein Invers localizes to a portion of the cilia adjacent to the TZ, a region termed the Invers compartment (Inv). The mechanisms that establish and maintain the Inv are unknown. In C. elegans, the cilia of amphid and phasm sensory cilia are subdivided into regions by different microtub ultrastructure: a proximal doublet region adjacent to the TZ and distal singlet region. Researchers explored the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the C eleg ciliary double region and Inv. They found that Inv is conserved and distinct from the double region. The genes n-2, the C eleg Invers hom, and double region ar-13, lp-11, and unc-119 are redundantly required for cili. Inv and double region can be sorted into modules n-2p-11 and ar-13-119, which are antagonized by hd-6 deacetyl. The genes modulate the sizes of N-2 Inv and A-13 double region. Glutlation, a tub-trans modification, is not required for ciliary of Inv and double components; rather, glut is modulated by-2, -13, and-119. The ciliary and localization of N-, A-, and UNC does not require TZ double region and Inv-associated genes N- requires its calcium EF domain for targeting Inv.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Scribble plays a crucial role in the development and regeneration of myelin, the fatty insulation that surrounds nerve fibers in the central nervous system. Myelin is formed by oligodendrocytes, specialized cells that undergo significant shape changes to create the myelin sheath. Scribble is present throughout oligodendrocy development and is upregulated in mature oligodrocytes, where it is found in both developing and mature myelin sheaths. When Scri expression is knocked down in cultured oligodrocy, myelination is disrupted, and when Scri is conditionally eliminated in myelinating glia of mice, myelination in the CNS is disrupted during development and after demyelination. Scri also regulates myelin thickness by suppressing the ERK/MAPK pathway and localizes to non-compact myelin at the node of Ranvier, where it is required for axo-glial adhesion. These findings demonstrate Scri's essential role in evolutionarily conserved intracellular polarity in myelination and remyelination.
Researchers have identified a new virulence factor, Listerin S, associated with a subset of Listeria monocytogen, a bacterium responsible for listeriosis outbreaks. Listerin S is a bacterioc-like hemolytic and cytotoxic protein that contributes to the pathogen's virulence. It is part of a family of modified virulence peptides (MVPs) produced by several Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulin. The Lister S cluster is found in a subset of lineage I strains, which cause most listeriosis outbreaks. Expression of Lister S results in hemolysis and cytotoxicity, contributing to the pathogen's virulence in murine and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil studies. The study reveals the genetic basis for enhanced virulence in a proportion of lineage L monocytogen.
Researchers studied the role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma, a type of granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. Myetoma is characterized by the formation of macroscopic structures called grains, surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The study aimed to determine if IL-17 and MP-9 levels in myet lesions were related to disease severity and independent of causative agent. Biopsies from 100 patients with myet were analyzed for IL-17 and MP-9 expression using immunohistochemistry. Results showed IL-17 mainly in zones I and II, and less in III, while MP-9 mainly in II and III, and least in I. MP-9 was higher in Actinadura and Streptomyces biops compared to Madure myet biops. MP-9 levels were directly proportional to IL-17 (p=0.001). Only association between MP-9 and patients' characteristics was disease duration (p<0.001). No correlation between IL-17 and patients' characteristics.

IL-17 and MP-9 were present in myet granoma, but their functions unknown. Further studies needed to determine roles in granuloma formation and myet immunogenesis. Results indicate IL-17 more in larger lesions and longer disease duration, and positive correlation between IL-17 and MP-9 levels. Immunohistochemistry showed IL- and MP-9 presence, but not formation time. Future studies to determine IL- and MP functions in myet granoma.
Researchers studied how a type of protein called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) interact with other molecules. IDPs are proteins that don't have a fixed shape and can change their structure when they bind to a target. Some IDPs stay disordered even when bound, a phenomenon called "fuzziness". The study focused on the transcription activation domain of the Ewing Sarcoma oncoprotein (E), an ID with many features of fuzziness. They hypothesized that E-target binding involves interactions between E's aromatic side chains and target's basic residues. Experiments with E variants of E supported the hypothesis. A coarse-grained E model and analytical model captured the trends. E-target binding is driven by balance between E conformation entropy and E-target cationπ contacts. This versatile recognition mode offers a framework for promiscuous target by polyent IDPs.
Researchers studied the functions of two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. This bacterium has a unique feature of having two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, unlike other bacteria. Previous work showed that Lon-1 is upregulated by blood exposure in vitro, while Lon-2 is not. The study aimed to clarify the roles of these proteases in B. burgorfer. Phylogenetic analysis revealed Lon-1 and Lon- cluster separately due to differences in substrate binding domains. Recombinant Lon-1 showed ATP-dependent chaperone-protease properties but did not complement E. coli mutant, while Lon-2 corrected Lon-mut phenotypes. The study concludes that B. burgor Lon-1 and-2 have distinct roles. Lon-2 functions like canonical Lon in cellular homeostasis, while Lon-1, induced by blood, may be important for host adaptation from arthropod to warm-blood host.
Researchers investigated the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in preventing HIV-1 infection. AD is a process where antibodies help cells engulf and internalize foreign particles. They tested the ability of HIV-specific antibodies to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-infected cells by phagocytes. Using a green-fluorescent protein-expressing HIV clone, they found minimal or no AD of virions with any antibodies. However, after coating virions with a specific protein, gp41, antibodies efficiently mediated phagytosis. A few hundred gp molecules were needed for successful phagytosis, similar to the number on influenza virus. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed a clear association between virus aggregation and AD. In contrast, vir-decorated cells were targets for AD orgocytosis in presence of HIV antibodies. Findings indicate AD of vir may not prevent infection due to paucity of trimers and inability of vir-bound antibody to cross FRs on phocytes. However, AD orocyt could clear infected cells on verge of infection.
Hookworm infection is a widespread in many countries around the world, but its global economic and health impact is not well understood. To determine how much time, money, and resources to invest in controlling the disease, researchers created a model to estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm in every country, region, and globally in 2016. From a societal perspective, globally, hookworm resulted in 2,126,280 Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) using 200 disability estimates and 4,087,803 DALs using 201 estimates (excluding cognitive outcomes). Including cognitive impairment did not increase DALs worldwide. Productivity losses varied depending on anemia and calculation method, from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, and from $2.5 to $43.9 billion using minimum wage. Hook is classified as a neglected disease, but its burden exceeded estimates of diseases with more attention, such as rotavirus. Countries transitioning to higher income, like Brazil and China, still face significant hook burden.

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 reported 3,230,800 DALs annually due to hook among all ages in 21 regions. This included disability weights for hook outcomes (wasting and abdominal problems) and anemia, but not cognitive. Large countries transitioning to higher income, like Brazil and China, still face considerable hook burden. Assuming median anemia, 200 estimates and NI, hook infections resulted in productivity losses $11.1 billion (95%:5.5-18.5) using Method 1, $87.9 (95:1.7-302.3) Method 2, and $23.1 (11-38.4) Method 3. Using minimum wage, global burden was $3.

The number of hook infections with health outcomes (heavy infection and anemia) and DALs for each region in 201 (excluding cognitive) using 200 estimates varied with anemia given. There is variation in countries due to productivity proxy (NI vs. wage), estimates (200 vs 201), and 201 estimates. China's 35,917,360 hook infections result $6.7 in losses NI, $1 using wage.
Researchers studied how oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia, affects the developing brain in vertebrates, such as zebraf fish. They found that hypox disrupts the pathfinding of brain neurons, leading to errors in axons failing to cross the midline. This is similar to what happens in in invertebrates, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, where hypia causes axon path errors in certain neurons and motorneurons. The researchers identified the hypia-inducible transcription factor (h1) pathway as the cause of the defects and showed that blocking its activation prevents the errors. They found that ephrin2, a protein, is a target of the h pathway and that mediates the errors. Knocking down eph2 rescued the defects and showed that the receptor eph4 is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons. Magnesium, used to improve outcomes in preterm births, protects against errors by preventing upregulation of eph2. The study shows that conserved genetic pathways regulate changes in the CNS in response to hypia and supports a neuroprotective role for magnesium.
Researchers studied pulmonary abnormalities in mice with paracidiomycosis, a fungal disease caused by Paracidi brasiliensis, using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathology. Fifty mice were infected with the fungus and 50 were not. HRCT scans were done every four weeks to track lung damage and density. Three types of lesions were found: nodular, diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tum. Lesions were mainly around the hilus and affected the left lung. At four weeks, 80% of infected mice had peri-bronial consolidations with increased lung density compared to controls. After eight and 12 weeks, consolidation spread to middle regions. Histology showed consolidation as confl granulomatous reaction and nodules as compact granomas. At 16 weeks, confl granomas formed pseudooral masses obstructing bronchi. Focal fibrosis was seen around granomas, but only by histology. This study shows HRCT is useful for evaluating and quantifying damage in experimental paridiomycosis. The design reduces animal sacrifice and allows monitoring treatment efficacy with a more rational approach to human lung disease.
Researchers have developed a new test to detect infection with Leishmania donovirus, a parasite causing visceral leishmaniasis in endemic areas. The test, called Interferon-gamma Release Assay (QuFERON), measures the body's immune response to the parasite. It uses five different Leish antigens: H2, H2-PS2, H-Le12, crude antigen, and soluble Leish antigen (SL). The test was evaluated on blood samples from 13 active VL patients, 15 cured patients, 11 non-endemic controls, and 19 healthy controls. The test using SL antigen had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 100. The results suggest that the whole-blood SL-based QuFER assay can measure the immune response to Leish infection. A surprising finding was that active VL patients produced interferon-gamma when stimulated with Leish antigen, contradicting previous findings of non-proliferative response in peripheral mononuclear cells.
Researchers have found that a toxin called CNFY plays a key role in making the bacteria Yersinia pseudotuberculosis persistent in the body. This bacterium causes gastrointestinal infections that can lead to relapsing enteritis and autoimmune disorders. To establish a persistent infection, the bacteria must navigate through the intestinal lining and colonize the underlying lymphatic tissues, but how they evade the immune response is not well understood. The study shows that CNFY toxin enhances the transfer of anti-inflammatory effectors, leading to tissue destruction and alteration of the microbiota and bacterial suppression. However, suppressing CNFY function increases interferon-mediated responses, non-inflammatory activities and tolerogenesis. This leads to a preprogramming of the pathogen's transcription towards persistence, giving the bacteria an advantage against host responses and establishing a commensal lifestyle.

The study demonstrates that removing a single virulence factor, CNFY, is sufficient to dampen inflammation and evade host defense, favoring Yers persistence. The mechanisms are unclear, but the impact suggests a set of immune responses, such as IL-6 levels, modulators, bactericidal activities, and anti-inflammatory factors, contributing to the process. The CNFY process is a double-edged sword. The toxin constitutively activates Rho GTPases deidation and Y translocation into host, enhancing inflammation and damage. Suppressing CN function shifts the balance towards immune suppression, promoting asymptomatic infection. Several enteric pathogens, including Yersiae, persist in the intestinal and lymphatic tissues, promoting arthritis and ileitis.
Researchers have identified a new gene, DES1, in the fungus Magnaporthe oryza, that helps the fungus evade the plant's defense system. To do this, DES1 breaks down a type of molecule called reactive oxygen species (ROS) that the plant produces to fight off the fungus. Without DES1, the fungus can't colonize the plant and causes a strong defense response in the plant. The researchers found that DES1 is responsible for breaking down ROS in the plant cells, which helps the fungus avoid the plant's defense. When DES1 is missing, the fungus can't grow well and the plant's defense is triggered. The researchers also found that DES1 is related to an enzyme called peroxidase, which breaks down ROS. When they treated the fungus with a chemical that stops ROS production, the plant's defense is reduced and the fungus grows normally. This suggests DES1 is a new gene that helps the fungus evade plant defense by breaking down ROS.
Researchers in Ghana evaluated the accuracy of a mathematical model used to predict the prevalence of schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection, in the country. They compared the model's predictions to actual infection rates found in 79 schools surveyed in 2010. The study found that using the model alone, 21 schools with high infection rates would have been undertreated and 20% would have been treated unnecessarily. This would have meant 28% of children were undertreated and 12% received treatment without need. The researchers suggest the model should not be used as a one-time tool, but rather an iterative process that incorporates actual data to refine predictions. This would help control programs make better decisions.

The model was based on data from 2008, but the researchers used new data from 201 to test its accuracy. Schistosoma haematium, the most common schistome infection in Ghana, was the focus. The study aimed to understand how to best use predictive maps to guide treatment decisions. The World Health Organization does not recommend treating at district level, but Ghana did so. The study found using the model alone was not accurate enough to guide the national program. Each school in endemic areas should be assessed, not just districts. The model should be a tool to help, not replace actual assessments.
Researchers have discovered that a mixture of prostaglandins, a type of hormone, guides sperm through the reproductive tract of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, to reach the egg for fertilization. They found that the worm's oocytes, or egg cells, synthesize prostagland from fatty acid precursors in yolk protein complexes. Using genetics and mass spectrometry, they identified prostland pathways and showed that omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are converted into over 10 structurally related prostland, which collectively promote sperm guidance. Disrupting omega-3 fatty acid synthesis triggers compensatory upregulation of prostland from omega-6 fatty acids. The worm's prostland synthesis involves different mechanisms than mammalian cyclooxygen pathways, yet PG2 stereomers are still synthesized. A conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme regulates prostland synthesis, similar to its human homolog in Biet's Crystine dystrophy. The study supports model that multiple cyclooxygen-independent prostland function together promote sperm motility for fertilization.
Researchers have developed a new method to design biotherapeutic proteins that are less likely to trigger an immune response while maintaining their function. This approach, called Pareto optimization, balances two goals: reducing the number of immune-activating parts (epitopes) and preserving the protein's function. Analysis shows that there is no single best design, but a range of options that trade off between these two factors. The team created 18 such designs and tested them experimentally, finding a correlation between predicted and actual performance. This study is the first systematic evaluation of the trade-off between reduced immunogenicity and function in biotherapeutics. The method can quickly assess and design proteins with varying levels of immunogenicity and function, potentially speeding up and reducing the risk of deimmunization efforts. 

The team used a computational tool that integrates epitope prediction and in silico analysis of functional consequences of deimmizing mutations. This enabled global design and deimmization on a faster scale. Predictions matched experimental results, showing that deleting more epitopes led to increased loss of function. The study outlines a design-based approach to functional deimmization of biotherapeutic candidates. Next-generation deimm tools combine immunoinform epitope prediction with in silico analysis of functional consequences of deimm mutations, allowing global design and deimm on a compressed scale.
Researchers studied how temperature affects the process of meiosis in Arabidopsis thalian, a type of plant. Meiosis is a fundamental process in sexual reproduction that involves the exchange of DNA between chromosomes to ensure proper segregation. The frequency and distribution of these exchanges, called crossovers (CO), are regulated by internal and external factors, but more is known about the internal mechanisms than the external. The study found that elevated temperature increases meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis and used genetic analysis to show that the extra crossovers come from the Type I pathway, which is sensitive to interference. This pathway is different from Type II, which is not sensitive to interference. The study also found that temperature-induced crossovers are not caused by an increase in DNA breaks and the hyper-recombination phenotype is specific to heat stress, not a general stress response. The findings provide insight into how environmental cues modulate meiotic recombination and may have practical applications.
Researchers have developed a novel computational approach to navigate the vast and rapidly evolving landscape of biomedical literature, particularly in molecular medicine. The system, called Hanalyzer, combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. It extracts information from external resources, structured or unstructured data, and tracks provenance. Reasoning enriches the results by noting genes annotated to the same term or database, and combines sources into a network representing relationships between genes, calculating a reliability score. Reporting combines the network with congruent constructed from data and visualizes in a tool for knowledge-based analysis.

Hanalyzer was demonstrated on a large gene array dataset relevant to craniofacial development, identifying roles of four previously uncharacterized genes. Each hypothesis was validated by further work. A plugin, Coscape, allows tracing provenance links and accessing sources (Figure 2). This identified explanations by inferences not in individual sources. To present relevant knowledge, sub-networks are selected and presented in a comprehensible way, visualizing with fidials or generating sub-networks including them. A more effective method is creating a quantitative network from data and combining in various ways. Here, a network was constructed from expression experiment results.

Biomedical knowledge is expanding exponentially, with over 10 million PubMed indexed in 20 years, 4.8% annual growth. Combining knowledge with data highlights supported linkages, facilitating explanation, or unsupported linkages generating hypotheses. Both can be together, demonstrated.
Helminth parasites, such as Fasciola hepatica, secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be internalized by host cells, modulating the host's immune response. While the cargo of EVs has been characterized in many parasites, little is known about the surface-exposed molecules that participate in ligand-receptor interactions with the cell to initiate vesicle docking and internalization. Researchers used a membrane-impermeable biotin reagent to capture proteins on the outer surface of two EV populations (15 and 120 EV) released by adult F. hepatica, describing 380 proteins including virulence factors, membrane proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis/trafficking. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis showed the 120 EV have endosomal origin and may be released via the protonephial excretory system, while larger 15 EV are from gastrodermal epithelial cells lining the gut. A lectin microarray strategy profiled the surface oligosaccharides of intact fluorically labelled EVs as displayed to the host. Lectin profiles of 15 and 120 EV subpopulations are identical but distinct from parasite tegument, dominated by high mannose sugars. EVs were resistant to exo and endoglycosases, but glycosidase PNG remodelled surface oligosacides and blocked uptake by macrophages. Pre-treatment with antibodies from infected hosts or purified against EV surface proteins (DM-containing, CD63 and myferlin) significantly enhanced internalization.
Researchers have identified a protein called Arabidopsis CDF2 that plays a crucial role in regulating microRNA (miRNA) production in plants. miRNAs are small molecules that help control gene expression and are essential for plant development. CDF2 interacts with an enzyme called Dicer 1 that cuts miRNA precursors into mature miRNAs. C2 binds to the promoters of some miRNA genes, acting as an activator or repressor to control their expression. It also binds to miRNA precursors and affects their processing by Dicer 1. Genetically, C2 works in the same pathway as mi156 and mi172 to control flowering. C2 regulates a group of miRNAs at both transcription and post-transcription levels to maintain proper levels and control plant development.

 Studies found C2 regulates miRNA biogenesis at both transcription and post-trans levels to control flowering. By regulating transcription and processing of miRNA precursors, C2 precisely controls a population of miRNAs for proper plant development. C2 also regulates components involved in miRNA biogenesis, affecting biogenesis. A feedback network among components in mi biogenesis is of interest. C2-regulated miRNAs include156,160,167,172,165/166, and319, contributing to early flowering in c2 mutant. mi156 and172 were studied, widely known miRN. Results suggest C2 regulates biogenesis indirectly by regulating mi processing proteins, in addition to direct transcription and post-regulation of mi precursors. D1 level increased in h1-2 and se-1 mutants, and SE in h1 mutant. mi156 flowers earlier and mi172 later, consistent with c2 early flowering, mi156 decrease and SPL increase, whereas mi172 and AP2 in c2.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GG) plays a crucial role in the communication between oocytes and granulosa cells in the ovary. This communication is essential for the development of follicles, which provide eggs for reproduction. GG is involved in a process called protein geranylation, which helps cells talk to each other. The study found that GG levels increase in oocytes during early follicle development. Depleting GG from oocytes impaired granosa cell growth, primary follicle transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GG blocked a protein called Rho, which helps cells stick together, and another called Rab, which helps send materials from o to granosa cells. GG administration restored defects in GG-depleted mice. The study shows GG-mediated geranylation contributes to o-granosa communication and primary follicle transition, a key step in follicogenesis for female function.
Researchers have created a detailed model of an enzyme called RNA polymerase II, which is crucial for creating messenger RNA from DNA. Despite previous studies, it was unclear how a molecule called NTP (nucleoside triphosphate) reaches the enzyme's active site. Two possible routes, the "main" and "secondary" channels, were considered. To understand this, researchers built a model of RNA polymerase II with a full "transcription bubble" (unpaired and unpaired DNA) using existing data and computer simulations. They found that the secondary channel is the main route for NTP to enter the enzyme, but the main channel is still a possibility. This is because the unpaired DNA part of the transcription bubble overlaps with the main channel, making it hard to study. The researchers used computer simulations to see how NTP moves through both channels and found that the main channel is difficult due to electrostatic repulsion between N and negatively charged DNA. The study suggests the secondary channel is the main route for NTP during RNA synthesis.
Dengue is a significant public health problem in Thailand and Cambodia, particularly among children under 15 years old. Although deng is a reportable in both countries, the reported incidence underestimates the true burden of the disease. Researchers used data from laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases in prospective studies to estimate the magnitude of deng underrecognition and establish more accurate disease estimates. Two cohort studies were conducted among children under 15 in deng field sites over two deng seasons. Age-specific multiplication factors (MF) were calculated by comparing cohort data to national surveillance in the same province and year. In Thailand, 14,627 person-years of cohort data were obtained in two provinces and 14,493 in one province in Cambodia. Annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed deng was 23/1,000 and 25/1,000 in Thailand, and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Calculated MF varied by age and year (0.4-29). Average age-specific MF were applied to country data, indicating in Thailand 229,886 (210,612-331,236) deng cases annually 2003-2007 and 111,178 (80,452,357,135) in Cambodia. Underrecognition of total inpatient deng was 8.7 and 2.6 in Thailand, and 9.1 and 1.4 in Cambodia. In 2007, over 95,000 children in Thailand and 58,000 in Cambodia were estimated hospitalized due to deng. Calculating MF by comparing cohort to surveillance is one approach to assess burden. Data indicate deng reported in many countries underestimates true burden.
Researchers have discovered that natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in promoting early immune responses to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. They found that NK cells help accelerate the development of CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that fights off the virus, by limiting the production of immunosuppressive cytokines. This is achieved by controlling CMV replication early on, which reduces the activation of plasmacyoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and preserves conventional dendritic cells (DC), leading to accelerated CD8 T cell responses. Conversely, administering interferon-alpha (IFN) in animals blocks DCs and delays CD8 cell activation when NK cells control viral replication. The study shows that NK cells' ability to respond early to CMV infection is critical in balancing innate immune responses, reducing immunopathology, and promoting adaptive immunity.
Researchers have studied the regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in Arabidopsis thalian, a plant species. These genes are arranged in arrays of hundreds to thousands of copies, but not all are transcribed under normal conditions. The team found four rRNA variants in Arabid thalian, with one induced and others repressed or unchanged in plants with a disrupted nucleolin protein, At-L. The most represented rRNA variant, inactive in normal plants, is reactivated in At-L mutants. They show that pre-rNAs originate from RNA I transcription and are processed. Disruption of At-L gene leads to loss of DNA methylation without affecting histone marks on r genes. The study reveals a mechanism for r gene regulation, with nucleolin controlling active and repressed r variants.
Researchers have identified a protein from the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) called UL29 that interacts with a cellular complex called NuRD, which is involved in histone modification. This interaction is important for the accumulation of immediate-early RNA, a crucial for viral replication. The study used a method called immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to identify proteins that interact with HD1, a component of Nu, and found multiple CM-coded proteins, including UL29 and UL38. The interaction between UL29 and UL38 and HD1 was confirmed. HD1 is part of the Nu complex, which remodels chromatin and deacetylates histones. UL and UL28 associated with the M2 component of Nu, and RNA knockdown of RBP and CH4, constituents of Nu, inhibited CM immediateearly and viral DNA accumulation. This suggests multiple Nu components are needed for efficient CM replication. The growth of UL28 or UL-deficient viruses could not be rescued by treating cells with a deetylase inhibitor, trichatin A. Transient expression of UL28 enhanced the CM majorearly promoter in a reporter assay, regardless of UL expression. Importantly, induction of the majorearly reporter by UL28 required Nu components, consistent with inhibition of RNA accumulation after knockdown RBP and CH4. The study proposes UL28 modifies Nu to stimulate accumulation of immediateearly RNAs.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in young children and adults. They used a technique called whole-genome-fragment display libraries (GFPDL) to identify the specific parts of the virus that the immune system recognizes, called epitopes. The study found that after infection, the immune system recognizes more parts of the virus attachment protein G, but not the fusion protein F. In young children, the immune system recognizes more parts of the fusion protein, but in adults it recognizes more of the attachment protein. The study also found that the immune response to the fusion protein changes over time, with more recognition of the pre-fusion form than the post-fusion form. In contrast, the immune response to the attachment protein is high in children but decreases in adults. The study suggests that the immune system evolves its response to the virus over time, which could help in developing effective countermeasures, such as vaccines. The findings could lead to better understanding of how to protect against RSV, a major cause of pneumonia in infants.
Emodeide, a veterinary drug used to treat nematode infections in cats and dogs, has been shown to have macrofidal effects on adult Brug mal, a parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis. Researchers studied how emide works on Brug mal and found it potently inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. They discovered that emide targets S-1 channels, a type of potassium channel, and that has different forms due to alternative splicing in the R1 region. The slo-1 isoform found in males is more sensitive to emide than the slo-1 isoform found in females. Knocking down the slo-1 isoform in females increased emide potency. Onchercavolus, another parasite that causes blindness, has two forms of slo-1 in females with different R1 domains. Modeling showed emide binds to the same R1 region in different species of filaria, affected by splicing variations. This study shows emide has potent macroidal effects and splicing in R1 affects potency. Evaluating sex-dependent effects of anthelmint compounds is important to prevent underdosing one gender of nematodes given to patients.
Researchers have identified the antigens from the Loa loa parasite that cause false-positive results in rapid diagnostic tests for lymphatic filariasis. These tests are used to determine where mass drug administration is needed and when it can stop. Loa antigens cross-react with tests for Wuchereria bancrofti, a different parasite, making it hard to eliminate Loa filariasis in areas. To understand this, researchers used an antibody to purify Loa antigens from people with Loa infection. Immunoblot and proteomic analysis found many Loa proteins, including secreted and somatic, that may come from dying adult worms or microfilar. Unlike W bancroft antigen, Loa antigens are only present in a subset of people with Loa. This difference can help differentiate between the two parasites and improve tests.

The Loa antigens are made differently than Wucher bancft's. The likely reason Loa cross-reacts with bancft tests is when Lo worms die and release antigens into the blood. The balance between release and clearance of these antigens makes them detectable in some Loa patients but not bancft-infected people. Samples from Loa patients without bancft infection were negative for Lo antigens. Proteomic analysis matched Loa antigens to the parasite's genome.

Loa cross-reactivity with bancft tests is a problem in Lo-endemic areas, where prevalence is 1% or higher needs mass drug administration. This study aimed to find Loa antigens causing false positives in tests. Unexpectedly, different Lo antigens were found compared to previous studies. Loa antigen is produced by adult worms, while previous studies found Lo antigens in blood and urine. This study focused on antig causing bancft cross-reactivity, so different Loa antigens were found.
Researchers used the nematode C. elegans to identify new genes associated with cilia, specialized structures on the surface of eukaryotic cells. Defects in cilia cause human disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bard-Bied syndrome (BBS), affecting many physiological and developmental processes. They used whole-organ RNA-Seq to discover a signature profile of ciliary transcripts, including known proteins FAM161, CC104, and RP1. From a list of 185 candidates, they found orthologs of MAP, YAP, CC149, and R28 as conserved ciliary components. C. elegans R-28, associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, is a small GTPase expressed in ciliated neurons, where it associates with intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains. Inactive R-28 shows no IFT and diffuse localization, but GTP-bound R-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBS-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Overexpression of predicted or locked GTP variants of R-28 perturbs cilium and sensory morphogenesis. The study presents a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins and unveils R28, a GTP closely related to B protein R4/IFT, as IFT-associated with BBS-dependent cell and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.
Researchers have investigated how the brain represents the outside world using neural responses without direct access to external stimuli. They used hippocampal place cells as a model and found that knowing which groups of cells fire together can reveal a surprising amount of structure in the stimulus space. This enables the brain to construct its own internal representations. The study showed that knowing which groups of hippocal cells fire is enough to extract global features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate representation of physical space, including the animal's position. This is different from previous approaches that required knowing place fields or other neural responses related to position. The researchers found that simple knowledge of groups of hippocal cells can infer topological features of a two-dimensional environment and geometric reconstruction of space, including the animal's position, without needing actual place fields or prior measurements. This challenges the idea that place fields are necessary for reconstructing position from cell activity. The study suggests that coarse features of population spiking activity can provide a great deal of information about the environment.
Researchers studied the role of the NLR3 inflamome and IL-1β in viral fulminant hepatitis, a severe liver disease caused by excessive inflammation. They infected mice with a virus that causes fulmin hepatitis and found high levels of IL-1β in the liver and blood. Mice lacking IL-1 receptor or treated with IL-1 antagonist showed reduced virus replication, disease, and mortality. IL-1 receptor deficiency blocked the production of a protein by macrophages and neutrophils in the liver. The release of reactive oxygen species by macrophages activated the NLR3 inflamome. Mice lacking NADPH oxidase, which controls ROS production, had reduced NLR3 inflam activation and IL-1 secretion, making them resistant to the disease. Mice lacking NLR3 and caspase-1, components of the inflamome, also had reduced IL-1 and less severe disease. The study found that the ROS/NLR3/IL-1 axis is a key pathway that causes severe liver disease during viral infection. This sheds light on developing treatments for fulmin hepatitis and other inflammatory diseases.
Researchers conducted a study in Malawi to investigate the role of hookworm infections in severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. They used a new diagnostic tool, multiplex real-time PCR, to identify and measure the load of two types of hookworm species, Ancyoma duale and Necator american. The study found that 34.1% of severely anemic children and 27.0% non-severely anemic children had hookworm infections, while microscopy detected only 5.6%. The prevalence of A duale and american was 26.1% and 4.9 respectively. Moderate to high A duale infections were associated with severe anemia and iron deficiency, with odds ratios of 2.49 and 9.04 respectively. Iron deficiency was also associated with intensity of Aale infection, with odds of 3.63, 16.98, and 44.91 for low, moderate, and high load. This is the first study to assess hook load and species with anemia and bone iron deficiency. The results show a higher than expected prevalence of Aale and its association with severe anemia and iron in pre-school children in Malawi, highlighting the need for species-specific screening. Multiplex real PCR is a powerful tool to combat anemia and iron deficiency in resource settings.
Researchers have identified a protein called COM-1 that plays a crucial role in the process of meiosis, a type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells. During meiosis, DNA is broken into pieces called double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can be repaired in two ways: homologous recombination (HR) or non-homous joining (NHE). HR is necessary for the formation of interchromosomal crossovers (COs) that allow for proper chromosome segregation. Without COM-1, cells repair DS via error-prone NHE, resulting in lack of CO, chromosomal abnormalities, and near-complete embryonic lethality. Unlike its counterparts in yeast, COM1 is not required for Spo11 removal and initiation of meiotic DS repair, but instead promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting NHE complex. In fact, animals lacking both COM1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation. COM acts parallel to nucleaseEX-1 to promote interolog HR at early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, safeguarding CO formation. Both nucleases are dispensable for RAD51 recruitment at late pachene stage when hom-independent pathways predominate, suggesting redundancy and regulation of DNA resection during meiotic prophase.
Researchers studied the immune response of goats to Burkholderia pseudallei, a bacterium that causes meloidosis, a severe pneumonia and sepsis in Southeast Asia and Australia. They used an aerosol infection model to mimic the disease in goats, which is more similar to human infection than previous mouse models. The study aimed to identify proteins that trigger an immune response, which could lead to new diagnostics and vaccines.

The researchers found that goats developed a strong immune response to the bacterium, with more antibodies increasing over time. They identified several proteins that triggered this response, including GroEL, EF-T, and Dna, which were present in all infected goats. The strongest response was to heat shock protein Gro1, which elicited antibodies in all goats. Most antigens showed peak IgM reactivity at day 14, while IgG reactivity increased as disease progressed.

The study compared goat and human immune responses, finding many common reactive proteins between the two species. The researchers used ELISA, 2D electrophores, and western blots to analyze antibodies in goat serum. They found a diverse and increasing antibody response over disease progression, with IgG and IgM antibodies reacting to multiple antigens.

The study suggests goats are a good model for human meloidosis, with similar immune response to the disease. The findings could lead to new diagnostics and vaccines for meloid.
Cyclin B–cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk) plays a crucial role in initiating mitosis by triggering a positive feedback loop at the end of the G2 phase. However, its activation during mitosis has been poorly understood. Researchers used a novel approach to track the development of cyclin B–C1dk activity in single cells by quantifying dephosphorylation of Cdk and phosphorylation of its target anaphase-promoting/cycome 3. They found that cyclin B–Cdk continues to be activated after centros separation and can be maintained in the cytoplasm even when cyclin B translocates to the nucleus in prophase. This suggests that increasing cyclin B–dk activity after centros separation is essential for mitotic progression. The study reveals distinct thresholds for cyclin B–dk activity controlling successive mitotic events. Cyclin B–dk is activated in late G2 and gradually increases between centros separation and prometaph. Reducing C1 levels affects mitotic progression, with a threshold triggering autocatalyzing further cyclin Bdk activation and entry into mitosis. Cyclin B–dk contributes to centros separation in G and is initially detected on centros before they separate in G or pro.
Researchers studied the immune responses of 21 Kenyan women who were infected with HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D after being exposed to the virus from different partners. The women were infected for a median of 1.07 years before being exposed to the virus again, and their blood samples were taken 2.72 years after the second infection. The study focused on 4 main targets on the HIV-1 envelope: the CD4 binding site, V1/V glycan, N332 site in V3, and gp41 membrane. The results showed that the second infection did not lead to a dominant response to any of these targets in the women's blood. In fact, 20 out of 21 women's responses could not be linked to a single target with high confidence. This suggests that being exposed to multiple types of HIV may lead to a broader and more diverse immune response. The study supports the idea that a vaccine should aim to elicit a variety of antibodies to protect against different parts of the virus.
Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. CMV has been shown to dysregulate the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes) is a key regulator of NPC fate and brain development. Researchers found that CMV downregulates Hes protein levels in infected NPCs. The CM 72Da immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) is involved in H degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting H ubiquination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of H. A component of PML bodies, SpA, is also targeted by IE-mediated ubiquination. The C-terminal region of IE, spanning amino acids 451-475, is required for IE/H interaction and IE-mediated ubiquination but not for IE/SpA interaction. This study reveals a new mechanism linking H downregulation to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by CM infection. It also identifies IE as the first CM-encoded E ubiquitin ligase.
Researchers studied how changes in the binding of transcription factors to DNA affect gene expression in fruit fly embryos from four different species of the Drosophila genus. They compared the binding of four transcription factors involved in early development to gene expression and found that the levels of these factors are more conserved than individual binding events. However, changes in gene expression were not explained by changes in transcription factor binding, suggesting that many binding sites are weak or non-functional and not subject to selection. The study found that highly bound sites, regions bound by multiple factors and near genes are conserved more than other binding sites, indicating that a significant amount of transcription binding is not functional.

The researchers compared divergence of binding to divergence and found that only 3-7% of variance in binding between species is explained by divergence. They sequenced mRNA from embryos at the end of cellularization using high-throughput sequencing and found that mRNA levels are highly correlated between species, decaying with phylogenetic distance. Divergence of mRNA was lower than divergence of TF binding, measured along the Dophila tree. The study identified two sources of binding divergence: alterations of B, HB, GT, and KR motifs drive a portion of binding, and highly bound regions near genes are conserved more than other binding sites.

The researchers matched each gene to the region bound by the highest number of TFs and focused on 4,846 genes annotated in all species and expressed in at least one. They found that mRNA levels are highly correlated between species, decaying with phylogenetic distance, and divergence of mRNA was lower than divergence of TF binding along the Dila tree.
A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centers in Thanjav district, India, where eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis had been completed. The study aimed to assess the impact of MDA and identify potential "hotspots" of transmission. The study covered 70% of the 50,363 population and found a microfilaria (M) prevalence of 0.2% and intensity 0.004 per 60µl blood, and antigenemia (Ag) prevalence 2.3% and 17.3 units. The Ag prevalence ranged from 0.7 to 0.9% in children 2-10 years and 2.7 to 3.0 in adults. Despite M levels <1% and Ag <2 in sentinel sites, "residual" M prevalence ≥1 was found in 7% of children and "transmission" at least one Ag-positive child during M period hotspots were identified. Antigenemic persons were clustered at household and site levels. An Ag prevalence of 1% in children (0.4 community M prevalence) was suggested as a threshold for stopping MDA. The existence of hotspots and clustering indicate the need for surveillance strategies to detect hotspots, evidence-based sampling, and evaluation size for transmission assessment surveys.
A systematic review assessed the effectiveness of temeph, an organophosphate laricide, in controlling deng vectors and deng transmission when used as a single intervention or in combination with other methods. The review included 27 studies, 11 single intervention and 16 combined, and found that temos consistently reduced entom indices when used alone, but not when combined with other interventions. The effectiveness of tem was dependent on factors such as delivery quality, water turnover, type, and environmental conditions like debris, temperature, and sunlight. Timing of deployment and reapplication, application reluctance to drinking water, cost, supplies, time, and labor were limitations. When used as a single intervention, tem was effective in suppressing entom indices, but not when combined with other methods. There is no evidence that tem use reduces deng transmission. The review highlights the effectiveness of tem in controlling Aedes breeding sites, but not when combined with other interventions. No conclusive evidence shows the impact of tem on d transmission.
Researchers have studied how the cohesion complex, a protein that holds sister chromatids together during cell division, is established at the pericentere, the region surrounding the centromere. They found that two complexes, C19 and C3, play distinct roles in this process. The C19 complex ensures cohes is loaded onto the perentere before DNA replication, while C3 is crucial for cohes to hold sister chromatids together after replication. Without C19, cohes is reduced at the perere, leading to problems with chromosome segregation. Without C3, cohes is present but not functional, also causing segregation issues. Cells lacking both C19 and C3 show additive defects. Delaying replication rescues the defect in C19 but not C3. The study suggests C19 loads cohes at the centere before replication, ensuring its incorporation through a process requiring C3. Two C19 proteins, I3 and Ch4, direct cohes to the perere during mitosis and meiosis. Without I and Ch4, cohes at the perere is reduced, affecting sister chromatid cohesion. This pathway is essential for cohes to be in place before replication. C3 ensures the integrity of the replisome and its association with cohes as it traverses the centrom. The study found I and Ch4 localized at the centere, despite influencing cohes in the perere. The C19 complex plays a similar role in perenteric cohesion during mitosis and meiosis. C19 and C3 are conserved, raising questions about whether this mechanism operates in other organisms with perent heterochrom.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a widespread arbovirus that infects an estimated 100 million people annually, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. Dengue fever (DF) and deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are major public health concerns. To understand the underlying mechanisms of deng pathogenesis, researchers analyzed the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult patients at three stages of infection: early fever, defervescence, and convalescence. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, they identified 60 differential metabolites, mainly fatty acids, acylcarnines, phospholids, and amino acids. Perturbed pathways included fatty biosynthesis, β-oxidation, phosphid catabolism, and steroid. These changes suggest a multifactorial host response. Analysis of phosphids and sphingids revealed trends associated with lymphocytes and platelets, which normalized at convalescent stage. These metabolites may be prognostic markers. DENV causes distinct serumome and lipidome changes, with many involved in inflammatory responses. The study reveals anti-inflammatory responses modulate early pro-inflammatory processes, preventing pathologies. This is the first omic approach to host responses, offering physiological insights into DF self-limiting.
Research on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) has increased in recent years, but significant gaps in diagnostic and treatment remain. Analyzing bibliometric data from research is a powerful method to reveal research efforts and partnerships. This study aimed to map NTD research in Germany and its partners to enable informed and transparent evaluation of German contributions. A Scopus database search for articles with German affiliations published between 2002-2012 was conducted for kinoplast and helminth diseases. Open tools were used to clean and analyze data (OpenRefine), geocode (OpenMaps) and create (TableNet) visualize and co-author networks (Gephi). From 26,833 publications worldwide, 1,187 (4.4%) had at least one German affiliation, and 972 were processed for five most published diseases. 4,007 authors and 863 institutions were extracted to construct co-author networks. Most co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries, Brazil. Collaborations with Africa remained scattered. NTD research in Germany was distributed among 220 institutions. Strong performers were identified on individual level using parameters (publications, h-index) and network (between centrality). Network varied between diseases. Share of NTD publications with German affiliations was half of other medical fields. This underlines need to identify and expand Germany's strong research towards NTD. Spatial analysis of collaborations abroad can support decisions to strengthen capacity, particularly low-middle countries less involved than high. Identifying knowledge within researcher complements traditional indicators opportunities for collaboration.
In Haiti, a mass drug administration (MDA) program targeting lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helmin (STH) has been implemented since 2000 by the Ministry of Health and its international partners. By 2012, the program had reached national scale with high epidemiological coverage, allowing treatment for almost all of the country. Key elements of success included community awareness through multi-channel education, voluntary distributors, community trust through training and supervision, directly observed treatment, easy access, and data-driven strategies. High coverage (100% in 2012) and significant reduction in infection (45 communes reached LF threshold) demonstrate effectiveness. Haiti's campaign, with international support, achieved progress toward elimination and a strong foundation for STH control. Strategies, described, establish global best practices for NTD control and address future challenges: maintaining STH control after LF treatment and morbidity management for lymphatic disease.

The likelihood of taking treatment was associated with knowledge, disease understanding, transmission, strategy, risk, and side effects in studies. However, in Haiti, knowledge was low and not associated with MDA participation. In Grand'Anse, with 72% prevalence in 2001, decline was less pronounced, remaining 55. Results show progress addressing STH, but highlight continued support after MDA ceases. A successful campaign was launched in 200 with high rates, progress toward elimination (more rounds in high prevalence, fewer in low). A foundation for STH control was established. Factors determining treatment were (1) knowing MDA and (2) ease of access. Direct observation increased participation in other settings.

Haiti now focuses on morbidity efforts, building on hydro surgery and lymphema support groups.
Researchers studied the role of the master regulator Ctr in controlling the cell cycle of Sinorhizob meli, an alphrote bacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with legume hosts. The cell cycle is crucial for genome replication, segregation, and division in some bacteria, also for morphological and functional differentiation. In symbiosis with legume, S meli undergoes cellular differentiation, resulting in genome amplification, branching, elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. The researchers found that depletion of Ctr causes elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. They also showed that cell cycle regulated proteolytic degradation oftr is essential in S meli, suggesting a mechanism oftr depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Using ChIP-Seq and gene microarray analysis, they found that S meltr regulates similar processes as Ctr, but through different genes. For example, tr does not control expression of F complex to timing cell division, but negatively regulates sept-inhibiting Min system. This study provides insight into how conserved networks evolve to fit diverse lifestyles of bacteria. The model oftr cell regulation in mel will help elucidate how bacterial cycle is modulated by plant during symbiosis.
Francisella tularens is a highly infectious bacterium that causes the zoonotic disease tularemia. To survive and multiply inside host cells, it needs to evade the immune system. Researchers studied a library of mutants of the F. tularens vaccine strain LVS to find a gene responsible for intracellular growth. They found a gene called ggt, which encodes a glutamyl transpeptase, an enzyme that breaks down glutathione (GSH) and glutylcysteine. The ggt mutant had impaired intracellular growth and was less virulent in mice. The study shows that F. tulns uses SH and glutylcystine as cystine sources for intracellular growth. SH is the most abundant cystine in the host cytos. This is the first demonstration of a nutrient system essential for F. tulns intracellular multiplication. F. tulns has adapted to use SH as a cystine source in the host cytos, an example of bacteria-host adaptation.
Researchers studied how two types of Leishmania parasites, Leishmania amazonensis and Leish major, interact inside host cells. These parasites alternate between two forms: flagellated promastigotes in insects and round amastigotes in host cells. Leish amazonensis amastotes occupy large vacuoles with many parasites, while Leish major amastotes are in small, tight vacuoles that divide. To see if these vacoles can fuse, scientists infected mouse cells with non-fluorescent Leish amazon amastotes and 48 hours later added fluorescent Leish majorast or promastigotes. They used time-lapse imaging and found that Le major promastotes fused with pre-existing Leish amazon vacoles. In these chimeric vacoles, majorast remained motile and multiplied but didn't turn into amastotes. In contrast, infected cells with separate vacoles, Leish major promast were destroyed or differentiated into amastotes. The study shows that Leish vacoles, made by majorast or promast, differ in their ability to fuse with Leish amazon vacoles. A species-specific mechanism is required for Le majorast differentiation, which is unknown. This research will help understand interactions between Leish vacoles and mechanisms of recognition and fusion.
Researchers have been working to develop a vaccine that can elicit broad neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against HIV-1, a type of antibody that can block the virus from infecting cells. To achieve this, they investigated the ability of native, membrane-expressed HIV Env trimers to elicit nAbs. In a study, two groups of rabbits were immunized with virus-like particles (VLP) expressing trimers (trimer V) and one group with DNA expressing Env trimer followed by protein (DNA). The results showed that both groups developed potent n titers that neutralized quatern epitopes, exploiting gaps in the glycan shield of the conserved region of JRFL gp120. Specifically, trimer V took advantage of the absence of a glycan residue at position 197, present in 98.7% of Envs. Removing this glycan made 50-67% of clade 2 isolates sensitive to trimer V sera, showing neutralization masked by the glycan. Neutral sera targeted epitopes overlap the CD binding site, suggesting the glycan acts as a "fence" limiting access. Bioinformatics analysis showed features of one trimer V sera similar to monoclonal PG9. The DNA trimer took advantage of absence of gly at 230, proximal to CD site, similar to monoclonal 8, albeit lacking breadth. The study shows strain-specific holes in gly shield can elicit nAbs to native spikes, and cross-neutralization can occur without gly. These findings inform future development of nAb vaccine.
Researchers have investigated the healing process of Buruli ulcers (BU) in patients treated with antibiotics using immunohistochemistry to identify markers that can monitor wound progression. Traditionally, surgery has been the main treatment for BU, but a combination of oral rifampicin and intramus streptomycin has improved outcomes and reduced recurrence rates. However, managing extensive lesions after treatment remains a challenge, particularly in African countries where the disease is most prevalent. The study analyzed tissue specimens from eight patients with BU lesions before and after treatment for the presence of markers associated with connective tissue formation, remodeling, and epidermal activation. Several proteins were found to be suitable for monitoring healing. α-smooth muscle actin positive myofiblasts were not present in untreated lesions but emerged during healing, producing extracellular matrix proteins like pro-collagen and tenascin. After treatment, cells including myoflasts showed an activated phenotype with ribosomal S6 phosphorylation, a marker for translation. Healing wounds also showed dermal remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 in the epidermis. The study identified a set of markers to monitor healing in treated BU lesions by immunohchemistry, which may help understand delays in some patients.
Researchers studied how mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, move along axons, the long extensions of nerve cells, in living mice. They used a special imaging technique to track mitochondria movement in saphous nerves, a type of nerve, in anesthetized mice. The goal was to understand how mitochondria respond to electrical activity in axons, which can be far from the cell body and have high energy needs.

The study found that low-level electrical activity increased mitochondria movement in both forward and backward directions. Higher activity, within a normal range, increased forward movement but not backward. This was due to more mitochondria becoming mobile and moving faster. Capsaicin, a substance, applied to skin innervated by saph nerve, increased mitochondria movement in both types of axons. Additionally, mitochondria in active axons became shorter, suggesting they divided to supply more to the moving population.

Mitochondria did not accumulate at nodes, areas of high activity, but continued moving forward. This suggests sensory axon terminals have high metabolic needs during high activity. Most mitochond are made in the cell body, so increased forward movement may ensure uniform density along axons during high load, supporting increased demand.

The study showed a relationship between activity and mitochondria movement in normal, myelinated and unmyinated mammalian axons in vivo. No difference was found in membrane potential between forward and backward moving mitochond. Increased forward movement with stimulation suggests mitochond may accumulate in distal axons.
Researchers studied a genetic disorder called spondylocarparsal synostosis (SCT), which causes progressive vertebral fusions due to a loss of function in a protein called Filamin B (FLNB). FLNB acts as a scaffold, linking the actin cytoskeleton to signaling systems, but the disease mechanisms are unclear. Using a mouse model without FLNB, they found that intervertebral discs (IVD) undergo rapid degeneration during development due to abnormal cell changes in the annulus fibros (AF). AF cells lose their fibroblast characteristics and become hypertrophic chondrocy, with hallmarks of endochondral ossification, including collagen changes, apoptosis, and ossification. This is due to increased TGFβ and BMP signaling via Smad2/3 and p38, and activation of canonical and non-canonical genes p21 and Ctg. FLNB is involved in attenuating TGF/BMP signaling, influencing AF fate. The study shows IVD disruptions resemble degenerative discs, revealing molecular causes of vertebral fusions and degeneration.

In the absence of FL, Tβ and BMP signaling is increased in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating FL is required for attenuation of T/B signaling. The AF undergoes ectopic differentiation to chrogenic lineage in IVD, leading to abnormalochond ossification. Phenotyp findings resemble aging degeneration, providing a model for degenerative disease. Previous studies interpreted increased T/B within deg discs as repair effort extracellular matrix. Elevated p-Smad and 3 in chrocy before IVD degeneration suggest increased T and BMP as consequence of FL loss initiates cell changes, degeneration and fusions.

Loss of FL in mice produces AF from fibrous to cartilaginous fate, disrupting nucleus, leading degeneration, collapse, and vertebral fusion. This results from upregulation of T canonical and non-canonical pathways. FL interacts with Sm2 and 3, mediators of T and BMP, respectively. FL is expressed in cartilage and cartilagons developing vertebra.
Researchers have discovered a new way in which a virus can evade the immune system. The virus, called Thog virus, targets a protein called TFI, which is important for the immune response. By moving TFI out of the cell's nucleus, the virus reduces the immune system's ability to fight off the infection. However, this doesn't stop all gene expression in the cell. Only certain genes that need TFI to start producing proteins are affected. These genes include those that help fight the virus and cause inflammation.

The immune system is made up of many parts that work together to fight infection. The researchers found a way to target just one part, TFI, without affecting the rest of the cell's functions. This is useful for the virus because it can stop the immune from fighting while keeping the rest of the cell working. This could be a way to treat unwanted inflammation.

The virus targets TFI by using a part of itself, called ML. This stops certain genes that need TFI to start from making proteins from being made. These are genes that help fight the virus and cause inflammation. Other genes that don't need TFI to start can still be made. Genes that need TFI to start are mostly those that help fight the virus and cause inflammation.

Another virus, Thog virus, also targets TFI. But it doesn't stop all gene expression. Instead, it stops genes that help fight the virus from being made. This is different from another virus that also targets TFI, which stops all gene expression.
Parvovirus B19 (B19) infection of human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) causes cell cycle arrest at both late S-phase and G2, containing 4 DNA. The virus induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral replication but is not necessary for G2 arrest. A putative terminal activation domain (TAD) within NS1 is responsible for G arrest. To understand the mechanism of B19 NS-induced G2 arrest, researchers created doxycine-inducible B19-permissive UT/E-S cell lines expressing NS or NSmT2 and examined the function of T2 during G arrest. Results confirm NS T2 plays a role in G arrest Mechanistically, NS activated gene expression through T, responsible for ATR (ataxia-telated and Rad-related) activation. Activated A phosphorylated CDC25 at serine, inactivating cyclin B/CD1 complex without affecting nuclear import. Importantly, ATR-CHK-CDC25-CD1 pathway is activated during B19 infection EPC, and A plays a role in G arrest. 

B19 infection induces DDR essential for replication, but has no effect on G arrest. The mechanism of B NS-induced G arrest is crucial, particularly the role of T2 in cell cycle dysregulation. Previously, B19 NS protein disrupts cycle via T and viral replication is not necessary for arrest. B-infected cells arrest at S and G contain 4 DNA. Results show ATR plays role in G arrest mediated by T, and ATR-CHK-C25-CD1 pathway is activated in G. During B infection, viral replication contributes minimally to BrU incorporation. Expression of NS alone induces G arrest, characterized 4 DNA without BrU.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a range of diseases from mild to life-threatening, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. The virus's non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to induce endothelial hyperperability in mice and human endothelial cells by disrupting the endothelial glycocalyx layer. Researchers investigated the role of inflammatory mediators and endothelial-intrinsic pathways in this process. They found that DENV NS, but not a related West Nile virus NS, triggers vascular leak in the dermis of wild-type mice. In vitro, human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS did not produce inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8), and blocking these cytokines did not affect DENV-induced endothelial hyperability. Further, DENV induced leak in TLR- or TN- receptor-deficient mice at similar to wild-type levels. Blocking DENV-induced leak in vivo using glycocal disruption inhibitors was also effective. These results indicate D NS-induced endothelial vascular leak is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on glycocal components. This suggests potential targets for therapeutics that inhibit glycocal degradation for severe deng treatment.
In budding yeast, the formation of a septin ring at the site of bud emergence is crucial for proper cytokinesis, spindle positioning, and the spindle position (SPO) checkpoint. The PO checkpoint delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis if the anaphase spindle does not align with the division axis. Researchers found that two ubiquitin ligases, Dma1 and D2, control septin dynamics and PO by promoting the recruitment of Elm1 kinase to the bud. Cells lacking Dma and D2 showed reduced Elm levels at the bud and Elm-dependent Kin4 activation. Artificially recruiting Elm to the bud restored normal septin ring, spindle positioning, and PO in Dma D2 cells. This indicates that septin dynamics and PO function are linked and the integrity of the bud is crucial for PO signalling.
Humans have adapted to live in a wide range of environments, and natural selection has likely played a key role in their ability to survive and thrive in extreme climates. Researchers scanned the human genome for signs of selection by looking at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strongly linked to climate across 61 populations worldwide. They found a higher number of SNPs that affect gene function compared to those that don't in SNPs that are strongly linked to climate. Some of the strongest signals match those found in genetic studies of diseases, including pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. The researchers also found strong signals in genes related to UV radiation, infection, and cancer. This suggests that climate has shaped the distribution of human variation.

The study looked for evidence of selection in response to climate variation. Climate affects the spread of diseases, so many signals match SNPs associated with immune response in genetic studies. This suggests the analysis detects pressures due to climate or mediated by climate. The study found selection at individual SNPs identified in genetic studies, sets of genes in cardiovascular and immune diseases, and sets of response to chemical and genetic changes. Common themes are genes and variants in pigmentation, UV, immune, autoimmune, and cancer.

A subset of SN with strong signals for climate were also associated with traits in genetic studies. Some are implicated in pigmentation and autoimmune. The study used allele data to test adaptations to climate at the genome level and identified loci that underlie adaptations. Several genome scans have been conducted in humans, but only two used environment to detect selection on a scale. The strongest signals for climate in subsets show patterns in specific regions. Despite fewer populations, a significant enrichment of functional SN with climate compared to non-functional in all subsets was found.
Researchers have studied the genetic condition known as short QT syndrome (SQTS), which is characterized by a shortened QT interval in the heart's electrical cycle and increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms and sudden death. They focused on the SQ1 variant linked to a mutation in the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) channel, encoded by the KCNH2 gene. Using computer models, they simulated the effects of this mutation on the heart's electrical activity and found that it increased the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. In single-cell models, the mutation shortened the time it took for the heart cells to repolarize and reduced the differences in electrical activity across the heart muscle. However, in a more complex model of the heart tissue, the mutation increased the risk of abnormal rhythms due to uneven distribution of electrical activity. The study found that the mutation facilitated the formation and maintenance of abnormal electrical waves in the heart, making it more susceptible to arrhythmias. This is the first study to show the link between the mutation and increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms in SQ1.
Researchers have developed a new model using deep networks to study the collective behavior of zebraf, a type of small fish. The model is both predictive and insightful, meaning it can accurately describe the motion of individual fish in a group and the interactions between them. The model uses two parts: a pair-interaction network, which describes the interaction of one fish with its neighbors, and an aggregation network which combines these interactions. The pair network takes 6 inputs and produces 128 outputs, while the aggregation network combines these to a single number. The model was tested on simulated and real data of 60-100 zebraf and found that interactions can be repulsive, attractive, or aligning, but only when moving slowly. At high speeds, interactions are alignment or repulsion at close distances. The model also found that each fish decides where to move by averaging information from neighbors, with more weight given to those close, in collision, or moving in front or laterally. The number of interacting individuals is dynamic, typically 8-22, with 1-10 most important. This suggests each fish selects information from the collective.
Researchers have developed a new method to measure the impact of HIV drug resistance mutations on the virus's ability to spread from person to person. This is important because drug-resistant HIV is a major threat to long-term success of antiretroviral treatment. About 10% of new HIV patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV-1. The study used data from the Swiss HIV cohort and drug resistance database to model the spread of resistant and sensitive strains. They found that one mutation in the protease gene made the virus more infectious, while six mutations in the reverse transcriptase made it less infectious. The other mutations had no significant effect on the virus's ability to spread. This method can help assess the risk of drug resistance in areas with limited resources.
Researchers have found that a protein complex called Elong, which includes histone acetylase Sin3/El3, plays a crucial role in modifying transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to regulate translation efficiency. In yeast cells lacking Elong subunits, transcription is defective. However, Elong also mediates the modification of some tRNAs, modulating translation efficiency. The study shows that fission yeast Sin/3El3 is important for oxidative stress survival. The transcription program governed by Sty1-Atf1-P1 pathway is affected in mutant cells, but not severely. Cells lacking Sin3/3 cannot modify uridine wobble nucleotide of tRNAs and other tRNA activities such as Ctu-C2 are essential for normal tolerance to H2O. A plasm overexpressing tRNALUU complements stress-related phenotypes of Sin3El3 mutant. Main H2O-dependent genes, including transcription factors At1 and P1, are highly expressed mRNAs with biased lysine codons. These mRNAs are poorly translated in stress cells lacking Sin3 or C2, whereas mutated At1 with AAG codons is efficiently translated in all backgrounds. The study shows that lack of functional Elong results in stress due to tRNA modification and translation inefficiency of stress-induced mRN.
Researchers have discovered a new function of the HIV protein Nef, which makes the virus less sensitive to certain antibodies that target the membrane-proxternal region of the Env protein gp41. This region is crucial for the virus to infect cells and cause AIDS. The study found that Nef makes the virus 50 times less sensitive to two potent antibodies, 2F and 4, that target this region. In contrast, it had no effect on other antibodies that target different parts of Env. This effect was seen in various HIV-1 and SIV isolates, including viruses that infect different types of cells. Analysis of N mutants showed that this activity requires Nef to be attached to the membrane, but is separate from other functions like increasing infectivity and downregulating CD4. Glycosyl-G, a protein from a different virus, substituted for Nef and had the same effect, indicating this is conserved in viruses without N. The study suggests N alters Env recognition in the virus membrane, making it harder for antibodies to bind. N and Glyyl-G decreased efficiency of virus capture by 2 and 4, but not other antibodies. This new function of N has implications for HIV immunity and AIDS progression.
Researchers studied the genetic changes that occur in a snail hosts when infected with the liver fluke parasite Opisthorchis vivini, which causes cholangiocarcinoma in the Mekong region of Thailand. The snail, Bythia siam gomphos, is the intermediate host of the parasite. The study used high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to compare gene expression in infected and uninfected snails. They found 7,655 differentially expressed genes associated with 43 biological pathways, including immune response to parasites. Genes encoding proteases were downregulated in infected snails, while heat shock proteins and actins were upregulated. The study lays groundwork for understanding how the parasite colonizes the snail host. The dataset is a resource for studying susceptibility and resistance mechanisms of the snail to the parasite.
Researchers investigated the role of complement receptor 1 (CR1, also known as CD35) in the susceptibility to leprosy, a public health issue in Brazil. They studied CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR levels in a case-control study with 213 lepro patients (47% multibillary) and 297 controls. The most common haplotype harboring rs926*T in intron 21 and rs700*T in exon 26 presented twice higher susceptibility to lepro (OR=2.43, p=0.017). Paibillary patients with these variants had lower CR levels, reducing anti-inflammatory response (p=0.040 and p=0.046). The most haplotype increased susceptibility to multib clinical form (OR=3.04, p=0.01) and presented intronic rs343*G allele, associated higher gene expression (p=0.043), probably increasing parasite internalization. There was an inverse correlation between CR and mannose-binding lectin (initiator of lectin pathway, recognized by CR) (R=-0.52, p=0.007). The study suggests a regulatory role for CR1 polymorph on mRNA and CR levels, haplotype effects increasing lepro, probably enhancing phagocytosis and inflammation.
Researchers have used a comprehensive approach combining metabolomics and genomics to investigate how genetic variations affect biological processes at the molecular level. They analyzed data from over 3,300 individuals and found significant differences in serum metabolite concentrations between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites. The study also identified genetic differences in the CPS1 locus, a gene related to carbonyl-phosphate synthase, for glycine. The results show that metabolite profiles of males and females are distinct, and specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes contribute to these differences. This study highlights the importance of considering sex-specific effects in research design and interpretation. 

The researchers assessed the effect of sex on serum metabolites in a large cohort and investigated sex-specific genetic determination of metabotypes. Their findings provide insights into the sex-specific architecture of the human metabolome and potential mechanisms explaining differences in disease susceptibility and progression between males and females. A meta-analysis revealed 113 metabolites with significant sex effects. The study also examined correlations between metabolites and how sex effects propagate through the metabolic network. To identify genetically determined metabotypes, researchers used a subset of participants and replicated in independent cohorts. Genome-wide association analysis adjusted for age and BMI showed significant sex effects in 102 metabolites, including amino acids, acylcarnines, phosphatidolines, and sphingomyins.
Researchers have been using genome-scale metabolic networks to model the relationship between a cell's genetic makeup (genotype) and its function (phenotype) through simulations. However, the large solution space of possible metabolic states makes optimization necessary to predict the active state under specific conditions. The objective function used in optimization is linked to the biological model's underlying hypothesis, making it a crucial parameter for successful modeling. Current methods use a combination of fluxes to formulate the objective, but show sensitivity to stoichiometry representation of the network, leading to different results with numerically equivalent but biochemically representations. This makes interpretation subjective and ambiguous. A new method, Minimization of Metabolites (MiBl), decouples stoichiometry from objective formulation by using metabolite turnovers instead of flux. Simulations demonstrate stoichi representation independence for unambiguously linking results with biological interpretation. For example, Mi allowed expanding metabolic modeling of genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the distribution of plague, a highly virulent and re-emerging disease, and the genetic structure of the black rat population, Rattus rattus, the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. They conducted a comparative study of seroprevalence and genetic (microsatellite markers) in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology, covering 150-200 km within the Madagas plague focus. The results showed that serreval levels in rat populations mimicked those reported for humans, and populations displayed more genetic structure with increasing relief. However, the relationship between serval data and genetic differed between areas, suggesting plague distribution not solely related to rat dispersal. Genetic estimates suggested plague epizotics had weak impact on population sizes. In highlands Madagascar, plague cannot be accounted for solely by dispersal of reservoir. Human activities may be involved in spreading disease in rat and human populations.
Researchers investigated the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 (Sm6) family, a group of proteins on the parasite's surface that helps it stay inside the host for a long time. They found 11 members of this family, including 3 new ones, and confirmed that one of the previously known proteins, Sm29, has a unique structure. These proteins are likely attached to the parasite's surface. To see if they trigger an immune response in humans, the researchers looked at IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies in a group of infected Ugandan men before and after treatment with praziquel. Before treatment, 7.4% and 25.3% of the group had IgG against Sm6A and SmB, respectively, higher than 2.7% against another surface antigen SmAL. After treatment, IgG against SmA and SmB dropped, while Ig against SmAL rose. This study expands the number of Sm6 proteins and shows that SmA and SmB trigger an immune response in infected communities.
Researchers have created a computer simulation to study how cells in the fruit fly retina develop their shape during tissue formation. They found that a protein called cadherin, which helps cells stick together, plays a crucial role in determining the details of their shape. The simulation can explain data from normal and mutant cells that lack or have too much of this protein. The model shows that cadher's timing and how it changes in cell connections between cells are important for shape. It also suggests that cadher is moved from inactive to active areas, changing how strongly cells stick together.

The study confirms that cell adhesion is key in sorting and shaping tissues, as seen in previous research. The simulation specifically looks at the fly retina, where cadher's role goes beyond just sorting and affects geometry. The model reproduces shapes of normal and mutant cells and highlights cadher dynamics, showing its importance in adhesion and timing.

The model includes features like cadher recycling, expression, and cell contact changes without extra parameters. To understand how cadher controls shape, consider its distribution and dynamics. The researchers applied this to their model and tested with data from mutants with altered cadher levels. Cells in the retina have two adhesion molecules: E-cadher and N-cadher. All have Ead, but only cone cells have N. Cadher is in a band on the cell membrane where cells stick, the adherens junction.

The simulation shows that cadher's distribution and dynamics control geometry.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the role of a protein called MT-MT-M in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by cancer cells. MT-M is a potent protease that helps cancer cells invade by breaking down the ECM. Previous studies suggested that a continuous supply of MT-M is necessary for this process, but the rate of MT-M turnover and its contribution to ECM degradation were unclear. The researchers used a technique called FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) to study MT-M on single invadopodia, membrane protrusions where MT localizes. They found rapid recovery of MT-M, approximated by double-exponential plots with time constants 26 and 259 seconds. This recovery depended on vesicle transport, not lateral diffusion. A computational model was built based on these kinetics and reproduced the FRAP results. Inhibiting vesicle transport blocked ECM degradation in experiments and simulations. The degree of reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of reduction in MT-M turnover. The study established the role of rapid MT-M turnover in ECM degradation and suggested synergy between proteolytic activity and MT-M turnover. A computational tool was developed to design intervention strategies for cancer invasion.
Researchers studied how the spread of drug-resistant HIV-1 within an infected individual by analyzing viral sequences from four macaques with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) containing HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The macques were treated with inhibitors, and viral DNA and RNA were isolated from blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at four time points. Single-genome sequencing revealed a dynamic process where the virus rapidly acquires resistance across compartments through multiple mutations. The blood and lymph nodes were compartmentalized, while the blood and lymph were more different from mucosal tissues. This suggests that blood sampling may not capture viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially the gut, where RNA turnover was faster and DNA retained wild-type viruses. The study's findings of compartmentalization across tissues may explain previous conflicting results in HIV-1 compartmentalization studies.
Researchers have investigated the role of feedback in tissue morphogenesis, the process by which tissues grow and develop shape. They used mathematical modeling to show that a specific type of feedback, where both positive and negative signals act on stem and progenitor cells, leads to unique behaviors such as bistable growth, ultrasensitivity to external cues, growth, and self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. These behaviors arise not through cell cycle regulation, but through control of stem and progenitor self-renewal. The patterns that emerge are a result of interactions between diffusible factors with opposing effects, but morphogenesis is not due to Turing instabilities.

The study found that feedback of stem and progenitor selfnew can lead to bistability and ultras, with switching between high and low or zero growth states. A necessary condition for this behavior is the presence of both positive and negative feedback. Several in vivo phenomena, such as growth bistability, ultras, and feedback-regulated morph, support this view.

The researchers showed that simultaneous positive and negative regulation of renewal by diffus signals leads to emergence of spatial dynamic behaviors, manifesting as localized growth differences. They mathematically defined conditions for phenomena like bistability, ultras, and selforganization to arise in such systems, and how they drive formation of induced or spontaneous bulges and fingers. These are basic building blocks of many morphogenesis. Although patterns arise from opposing diff factors, they are not Turing patterns.

Tissue morph often occurs quickly, relative to cell lifespan, final models may represent lineage dynamics during morph, even in selfnew tissues. The study explored effects of feedback in final systems.
Researchers conducted the largest genome-wide study to date on myopia, a common eye disorder characterized by nearsightedness, in 45,771 Europeans. They analyzed data on age of onset and identified 22 significant associations, 10 of which were novel, and replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 participants who developed myopia before age 10. These associations explain 2.9% of variance in myopia onset and suggest multiple mechanisms behind its development. One gene, PRSS, linked to abnormally small eyes, and another, LAMA, part of extracellular matrix, were found. Two genes, RGR and RDH, involved in regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, and two, ZIC and SP1, in growth of retinal ganglion cells, were also identified. Five genes involved neuronal development and signaling were found. The study points to complex interactions between extracellular remodeling, neuronal, and visual signals from retina in myopia development in humans.
Researchers studied the role of feedback in the swimming dynamics of lampreys, a type of eel-like fish, to understand how it affects their movement and energy use. The lamprey has a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that controls movement and adjusts to sensory inputs from the environment. Feedback is crucial for responding to unexpected changes, but also active during steady swimming and influences the pattern. The study investigated different forms of body-based feedback and their effects on swimming energy and movement. The CP was modeled as a chain of oscillators, with pairs representing left and right body segments, activating muscles to move the lamprey through a simulated fluid. The body's curvature serves as input to the oscillators, closing the loop. Two forms of feedback were considered, consistent with experimental results on lamprey sensory receptors. Directional feedback excites or inhibits oscillators on the same side, opposite on the other side. It doesn't affect frequency but changes muscle duration. Magnitude feedback provides a symmetric effect on both sides, increasing frequency and reducing energy when gain is high. Both types have similar curvature magnitude. Results show that same curvature-based feedback with different forms can cause distinct swimming differences.
Researchers studied how the spread of HIV in different populations and found that the first strain to colonize a population has an advantage over new strains. This slows down the spread of new strains and diversification of the epidemic. They developed a model to simulate HIV epidemics on contact networks and tested scenarios with varying prevalence levels. The second strain spreads slower than the first, even with equal transmission efficiency, and needs a 25% advantage to become dominant in decades. Inhibition is weaker if introduced during the first strain's growth phase. Interference mechanisms like superinfection, hub depletion, and peak infectiousness contribute to the effect. The first strain has a strong advantage in competition, explaining the virus's global geography and influencing the pandemic's evolution. 

A model showed that the most transmissible strain drives out less efficient ones, and epidemics expand as original strains are replaced by "fitter" lineages. The pace of this process needs to be characterized. A model of sexually transmitted HIV epidemics allowed monitoring competition of strains with varying transmission rates. Without conditions, the highest transmission strain in a population drives others extinct, a principle from simple to complex models. The model was based on heterosexual epidemics in Africa, adaptable to other routes and concentrated epidemics. Mechanisms can slow invasion, but the pandemic shifts between lineages occur. The expansion of HIV-1 at expense of D in Eastern Africa is an example, and data from Uganda estimated the required advantage for expansion. A stochastic model tracked HIV spread on a dynamic network of heterosexual contacts. The network consisted of males, females, and sex workers. HIV is transmitted over a limited subset of contacts, far from "free" mixing. To detect network effects, an individual simulation tracked contacts and transmission along links.
Researchers have studied how muscle cells organize their internal structure and function at different scales, from the smallest units called sarcomeres to the entire muscle bundle. To understand this complex process, they looked at how cells interact with their surroundings, specifically the space outside of the cell. They hypothesized that conditions in this space help organize the cell's internal framework, called the cytoskeleton, to form sareres. A model was created to see how the cytoskeleton of rat heart muscle cells organizes with cues from the outside space. Results showed that the cytoskeleton forms through two processes: actin fibers, myofibrils, and focal adhesions, and myofils aligning and bundling. This suggests a hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the contractile cytoskeleton, and a feedback loop from outside conditions polarizes the contractile cytos.

A model was made to mimic the assembly of sareres, where proteins assemble along actin fibers. Other models of cykeleton assembly have been reported, but this one is compared to others. Myofils mature with force, suggesting cell contractility plays a role in polarizing the network. This has been seen in non-muscle cells where cytos architecture becomes polarized with traction forces. A model was created to show how myil patterning is sensitive to outside space, to understand assembly and organization of the contract apparatus in heart cells.

Muscle cells depend on outside cues to organize myils and function. As cells mature, myils change from irregular to organized bundles. This suggests cells use outside cues to efficiently organize myils and contraction. A hierarchy of mechanisms may be responsible for myil organization. A model was used to determine which feature, fiber-force or parallel fibers, is dominant in myil architecture.
Researchers investigated the potential of Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacterium being trialed as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission, to invade and spread in wild mosquito populations. To do so, it requires high maternal transmission rates, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, and low fitness costs in the host. However, differences in climate, field protocols, urbanization, and human density amongst deployment sites have limited comparison of Wolia's invasive potential. The study examined the phenotypic effects of Wolia strain in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes with Brazilian background to characterize its invasive potential. Results showed strong cytoplasm incompatibility, high maternal transmission rates, and no detrimental effects on host fecundity or fertility. To understand urban landscape effects on mosquito survival, mark-release experiments were performed using Wolia-infected Brazilian mosquitoes in Rio de Janeiro areas where Wolia will be deployed. Mosquito populations were characterized in relation to socio-demographic conditions at sites and future release areas. Mathematical models were constructed using laboratory and field data to describe urban conditions' influence on Wolia frequency reaching 100% following release. Predicted successful invasion at five sites, but conditions vary greatly between sites, influenced by local mosquito population size. Laboratory and field data showed Melia strain Wolia possesses characteristics to spread in urban-demographic environments in Rio Janeiro, including Eliminate Program sites.
Researchers have identified a protein called JMJ703 that removes a type of epigenetic modification called histone lysine methylation from histone H3 (H3) in rice plants. This modification, known as H3me, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and plant development. The study found that JMJ is a histone demethylase that specifically removes all three forms of H3me: mono-, di-, and tri-methylated. Without J, rice plants have stunted growth and elongation, possibly due to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes. The researchers analyzed the structure of JMJ's catalytic core and found similarities with mammalian and yeast proteins that demethylate H3 and H3, but also unique features that interact with cofactors and methylated H3 peptide. Key residues are conserved in other H4 demethylases, suggesting specificity for H4 demylation. J is essential for plant cell division and stem elongation, and demethylates all three forms of Hme in vivo and in vitro. Demethylation implies J is important for gene expression in rice. Phenotype caused by T-DNA insertion and RNAi and increased CK genes suggest J regulates growth hormone metabolism in rice, distinct from J14 that functions in floral transition, DNA methylation, and silencing in Arabidopsis.
Researchers have studied the structure of the HIV-1 capsid, a protein involved in the virus's life cycle from reverse transcription to integration, and found that it interacts with multiple host and pharmacologic ligands. However, previous studies have focused on individual capsid monomers, and the mechanism of how these ligands influence infection was unclear. The team discovered that a multi-unit interface within hexamers, a form of the capsid, mediates binding to cellular cofactors NUP and CPS6 and antiviral compounds PF and BI-2. Each ligand anchors to a phenylalanine-glyine motif in the N-terminal domain of one monomer, with BI-2 also interacting across the N-terminal: C-terminal interface of a second monomer. Dissociation of hexamer into monomers prevents high affinity with CPS6 and PF, and abolishes NUP binding. The interface is conformationally dynamic, but NUP or CPS6 binding is accommodated by one conformation. N and CPS6 have overlapping sites, but unique interactions when mutated, perturb cofactor dependency.
Researchers have improved the assembly of the genome of the mosquito Aedes aegypt, which transmits diseases such as dengue fever and chikunya viruses. The mosquito has a large genome with many repetitive sequences, making it difficult to assemble. The previous assembly had 4,758 scaffolds, few of which were assigned to chromosomes. To map genes affecting disease transmission, researchers scored many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in offspring from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypt and generated a genetic map. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the genome, where sequences from different chromosomes were on the same scaffold. Once corrected, 60% of the genome was assigned to chromosomes and scaffolds ordered along chromosomes. Large regions of suppressed recombination were found around centromeres, extending up to 47% of chromosome. A gene making Ae.egi resistant to the parasite Brugia mal was mapped, and a list of candidate genes affecting the trait was generated.
Aedes aegypt, a mosquito vector of deng and yellow fever viruses, is a key target for control programs in tropical countries. Most surveillance relies on traditional larval surveys, but new devices are available. A multicenter study compared four traps (BG-Sent, Adul, MosquiAP, and ovit) with larval surveys in five cities with varying climates. Traps were used in 1km areas, simultaneously with larval surveys. Positivity and density indices were calculated and regressed against meteorological variables to characterize seasonal patterns. The House index was low in most cities, with median 0, while traps produced indices, indicating greater sensitivity to Ae. aegyti presence. Indices plateaued at high densities, but agreed on seasonality in all cities. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature, not precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variation. All traps outperformed the House in measuring seasonal variation and should be considered complements or alternatives to lar surveys. Choice depends on cost and ease-of-use.

A two-year study compared larval and four traps in a routine Ae. aegti surveillance program. Traps were valuable and could be combined with control strategies to improve response to deng and other diseases. Household surveys and trap systems are not interchangeable. Traps' properties (sensitivity, specificity) should be invariant and consistent under low and high abundances. Five cities with distinct climates were monitored by different traps. Temporal consist of entom indices were compared. Sensitivity to density is important for trap surveillance. CG was the best scenario to test, with strong seasonal variation. Ovaps, Adtraps and Sentels detected large variations, consistently. Household surveys identify breeding sites for control, while traps monitor infestation and impact. Together, they optimize surveillance and prevention. Future studies should assess cost-benefit of integrated strategies.
Researchers have studied the protein APOBECG3, a potent inhibitor of retroviruses and transposable elements, to understand how it restricts HIV-1. APOECG3 contains two cytidine deaminase domains, one of which is known to mediate cytidine deamination. By analyzing the structure of a related protein, APOEC2, they identified residues in APOG that could mediate oligomerization. Using yeast two-hybrid, coimmunprecipitation, and crosslinking assays, they found tyrosine and tryptan in the enzymatically inactive N-terminal domain mediate APOG oligomer and its packaging into HIV-1 virions. Oligomerization is also shown to be RNA-dependent. Modeling APO onto the A2 structure indicates a positive charge accumulation in a putative dimer interface. Substituting arginine at positions 24, 30, and 136 in this pocket reduced virus, virion, and oligomer. Consistent with RNA's central role, oligomer-deficient APO associated less with cellular molecules. They propose that RNA occupies the charged pocket, promoting oligomer, packaging, and antiviral function.
Researchers have identified the genetic variations that contribute to a significant trait in fruit flies, Drosoph melanogaster. This trait, called bric-br, affects cuticular pigmentation, or the color and texture of the fly's outer layer. The team used the fly's high genetic variation and low linkage disequilibrium to pinpoint the specific variations responsible for the trait. They found that multiple polymorphisms, or variations in the DNA sequence, in three regions near the bric gene contribute to its effect. These regions include a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and a Polycomb response element, which regulate gene expression. The researchers confirmed that these variations affect transcription, or the process of turning genes on and off, at the bric locus. This study shows that a single quantitative trait locus, or QTL, can be influenced by multiple mechanisms and that variations in nearby functional elements can significantly impact gene activity and phenotype. The findings have implications for understanding genetics and genomics in both basic and medical research. 

The team sequenced the 148 kilobase region of the bric br gene in 94 inbred lines of D. melanogaster. They found that multiple polymorphisms in a single regulatory element of the ebony gene contribute to pigmentation differences between populations. Other studies have shown that multiple polymorph contribute to protein function. This suggests that accumulation of mutations at a locus may be a common mechanism for micro and macroevolutionary change. The br locus is composed of two duplicated genes, bab1 and bab, involved in patterning the abdomen, legs, and ovaries. Bab expression in the pupal epidermis is responsible for sex-specific pigmentation and changes in regulation have played a role in the diversification of D melanaster color patterns. This is in contrast to cases where large Qs are due to single or regulatory mutations with major effects. Detailed analysis of a gene responsible for 100 of a difference between D melan and D simul revealed contributions from independent regions.
Streptococcus pneumonia (pneumococcus) is a persistent cause of invasive and mucosal disease in humans, despite widespread use of antibiotics and vaccines. Its resilience is due to its ability to adapt through uptake and incorporation of new genetic material from surrounding microbial community. A tightly regulated quorum sensing system, triggered by extracellular accumulation of competence peptide (CSP), controls DNA uptake and recombination. This study shows CSP stimulates production of diverse bacteriocins through increased production and secretion of bacteriophage BlC (BlC) and requires functional competence system. A conserved motif in promoter of operon encoding BlC and its transporter mediates upregulation by CSP. Accumulation of BlC results in activation of Bl locus. Using biofilm organisms as model for competition and genetic exchange on mucosal surface, DNA exchange is enhanced by bacterin secretion, suggesting co-stimulation of bacterins with competence provides adaptive advantage. Bl and regulatory pathways are believed to have diverged in remote pneumoccus ancestor, yet maintained connection promotes competition and adaptation by targeting wide array of competitors while providing incorporation DNA.
Researchers have studied how the poliovirus, a virus that causes polio, infects cells and takes over the cell's translation machinery to replicate. They focused on two proteins, PC2 and SR20, which work together to recruit ribosomes to the viral RNA for translation. The study found that SR20 moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells and partially co-localizes with PC2 in the cytoplasm. They also showed that SR20 is associated with PC2 bound to polirus RNA, indicating this interaction occurs on the viral RNA. A mutated version of SR20 lacking a recognition motif was created and expressed in cells, resulting in a 100-fold decrease in virus yield compared to wild-type SR20. This suggests SR20 interacts with PC2 on viral RNA to recruit ribosomes for translation. The study supports a model where PC2, bound to viral RNA, interacts with SR20 to recruit the translation complex to viral RNA. The localization of SR20 changes during infection allows it to be available for viral translation. The study suggests a role for SR in linking splicing and translation in eukaryotic cells and provides evidence for SR in cap-dependent and cap-independent translation of certain RNAs.
Researchers used a genetic screen to identify genes involved in the development of neural crest (NC), a group of cells that gives rise to various cell types, including nerve cells and skin cells. They used a mouse model with a mutation in the Sox10 gene, which is important for NC development, and exposed it to a chemical that causes random mutations. Out of 71 lines analyzed, four mutations were found that altered NC patterning. One mutation, called m1, was studied further and found to be a new version of the ErbB3 gene, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase. The mutation changed a single amino acid in the protein, but did not affect its expression. However, it impaired the protein's ability to signal, leading to defects similar to those seen in Erb3 null mice. Biochemical analysis showed the protein was on the cell surface but had reduced ligand-induced phosphorylation. This highlights the importance of the mutated residue for Erb3 function.
Researchers conducted a study in a Ugandan community to understand factors influencing Schistosoma mansoni infection, a parasitic worm causing intestinal disease. They investigated how age, sex, ethnicity, and IgE (a type of immune response) affect reinfection after anti-parasite treatment. To control for environmental and behavioral differences, they used individual cercarial exposure scores and statistical methods. They found ethnic and sex variations in reinfection due to cercarial exposure, not biological differences in susceptibility. Age-related reinfection not explained by exposure, but linked to IgE and IgG responses to a specific antigen. This study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in complex settings to understand population ecology and draw robust conclusions.

The study used data from a multi-disciplinary reinfection study in a Ugandan fishing community to investigate S. mansoni reinfection. To account for complex, ethnically-influenced exposure patterns, they used individual cercarial exposure scores to adjust for variations. This is supported by epidemiological studies on exposure and rein in schosmic communities, identifying individuals resistant or predisposed to infection. Genetic studies also identified genes associated with susceptibility or immunity. Small studies on risk factors for Schos infection are limited by lack of cerc exposure data, but using proxy markers like distance to infect water may not be accurate. This study derives exposure indices to reflect exposure accurately. Age profiles were typical of schos-endemic communities: infection greatest in children, lower in adults. Exposure scores investigated roles of age and sex in susceptibility, and whether Alur ethnic group is more susceptible. Schosome Ig or Ig4 responses account for remaining susceptibility variation.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and the actual worm burden of Clonorchis sinensis in humans. A total of 60 residents, 50 egg-positive and 10-negative, in Sanche-gun, Korea, participated in the study from 2006-2009. They were diagnosed by egg positivity in feces using the Kato-K method. After administration of prazantel, they were purged with cathartics the next day, and adult worms were collected from feces. EP ranged from 0 to 65,544. Adult C. sin were collected from 17-positive, and number ranged from 1 to 114 each. A correlation between EP and numbers was demonstrated (r= 0.681, P<0.001). Recovery rates were 9.7% in EP 1-1,000 and 73.7% in EP over 1,000. No worms detected from egg-negative. Maximum count per worm per day estimated 3,770 in subject EP 2,664 and collected. Numbers correlated with egg in Cloniasis. Estimated 110 worms in body with EP around 3,000 and productivity per day around 4,000.
Researchers have developed a new approach to combat the growing problem of antifungal drug resistance by identifying genetic interactions that can be targeted to prevent resistance. They used a yeast model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to screen for genes that interact with a gene responsible for fluconazole resistance in the human pathogen Candida glata. Eighteen synthetically lethal interactions were found, one of which was a histone acetylase called G5. Deleting or inhibiting G5 made Candida cells expressing the fluazole resistant allele inviable and prevented the emergence of resistant isolates. The study shows that targeting synthetically lethal interactions can be a new way to treat drug-resistant infections. Candida strains with fluazole resistance mutations are more virulent and may adapt to antifungals, making them more disease-causing. The researchers used a combination of genome-wide screens and mutant construction to identify synthetically lethal partners of the fluazole resistant allele in Candida. Chemical inhibition of G5 prevented growth of yeast and Candida strains with the fluazole resistant allele. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that identifying synthetically lethal interactions that confer antifungal drug resistance can identify pathways to prevent the emergence of resistance.
Researchers have studied how the poliovirus (PV) multiplies within cells, focusing on the role of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP) in the process. PIP is a type of molecule found in cell membranes that changes during PV infection. The study used two PV mutants, EG and GG, which have problems processing the P3 protein, delaying genome replication and assembly. PIP changes were observed as early as 30 minutes post-infection, even in the presence of a replication inhibitor. Membrane tubules formed throughout the cytoplasm, and vesicular clusters appeared in the perinuclear region at 3 hours post-infection. The delays in replication for EG and GG were similar to PIP remodeling, suggesting PIP is a marker for the genome replication organel. GG failed to convert tubules to vesicles, resulting in nearly 5-log reduction in virus production. The study suggests PV induces distinct membrous structures for replication (tubules) and assembly (vesicles). The pace, spatiemporal dynamics, and efficiency of replication-to-assembly conversion may be set by P3 processing rate and capacity to yield 3 and 3 proteins.
Researchers used a multi-step strategy to find new compounds that can kill the parasite causing Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America. They searched a large database of available compounds and selected 23 to test for activity against the parasite's enzyme cruzain. 12 compounds showed strong binding to cruzain, with values in the low micromolar range, acting through a competitive mechanism. The binding mode of one of these compounds was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Cruzain is a target for new chemotherapy for Chagas and is similar to a mammalian enzyme cathepsin, which is linked to cancer. The researchers tested cruzain inhibitors against catheps and found similar values, raising the possibility of using them for cancer treatment. To find the most effective compounds, they tested them against infected cells. Two showed trypanidal activity. One compound, Neimed42, was used to study the relationship between structure and activity. The 2-acamidothiophene-3box group was found essential for both enzyme and parasite inhibition. The compound Ne42 had a low value of 10.6±0.1 µM against the parasite form of the Tulah lac strain, better than the current drug benznidazole. A smaller version of Ne42, Ne176, was identified as a non-peptide, nonvalent cruzain inhibitor with potential for optimization.
Researchers have developed a new DNA-based vaccine against yellow fever (YF) virus, which is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical areas worldwide. The current attenuated YF vaccine generates long-lasting antibodies and T-cell responses, but can have rare fatal side effects. The new vaccine consists of two DNA formulations encoding the full-length envelope protein (pFE) or full-length protein fused to lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 (LFE), aiming to divert antigen presentation through major histocompatibility complex compartments. The formulations were tested in C57/6 and BAL/c mice, corresponding to C57/6 and BAL/c strains, respectively. Both induced strong T-cell responses against all epitopes generated by YF17 vaccine, with LFE performing best. Additionally, LFE stimulated high anti-Y neutralizing antibodies comparable to 17 vaccine levels. Importantly, LFE provided 100% protection against intracereally challenged mice. These results indicate LFE is an excellent candidate for further studies.
Researchers have identified a new role for the nucleoid protein SlmA in the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholera. SlmA is a transcription activator of the chb operon, which encodes genes for chitin utilization. Chitin is essential for Vibrio cholera's persistence and horizontal gene transfer in the marine environment. The sensor kinase ChiS regulates the ch operon, but the mechanism of Chi activation was unclear. An unbiased transposon screen revealed SlmA as a regulator of chb. SlmA is a member of the TetR family, typically transcriptional repressors. In vitro, SlmA binds to the ch oper promoter, and in vivo, this interaction is required for transcription and chitin utilization. Mutations show DNA-binding, not nucleoidation, is critical for activation. This study reveals a novel role for SlmA in Vibrio cholera, in addition to its established cell division function.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework for solving complex problems that arise in modeling biological systems. These problems are challenging because they involve highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations, as well as many experimental data points and parameters. The framework uses cutting-edge tools that are efficient, robust, and easy to use. It employs a time-discretization approach that avoids repetitive model simulations, enables algebraic computation of derivatives, and uses efficient solvers that exploit linear techniques.

The framework was tested on a human gut microbiome model with 156 parameters, 144 equations, and 1,704 data points. It solved the problem in under 3 minutes, while an off-the-shelf solution took over 7 hours. Large instances showed the framework's scalability, solving problems with 2,352 parameters, 2,304 equations, and 20,352 points in under 15 minutes. The framework is flexible and can be applied to various biological models, enabling tasks such as uncertainty quantification, observability analysis, model selection, and outlier handling.

Dynamic modeling is crucial for understanding biological systems like microbial communities, gene networks, and pathways. A key task in modeling is validating against data using parameter estimation. This is challenging due to solving optimization problems with differential equations. The new framework combines modern tools to create scalable, robust, easy-to-use, and flexible solutions. It was demonstrated on microbial models, enabling higher tasks like observability analysis and uncertainty quantification.

The framework's efficiency enables modeling complex systems from biomolecular to high-dimensional communities. It can construct high-fidelity models of whole-cells or microbiomes. Challenges arise from dimensionality, nonlinearity, stiffness, incomplete states, many parameters, and large data. Research has been reported on solving differential problems in biology.
Researchers used a high-throughput gene expression system called nCounter to study the inflammatory response in mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV) in the Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model. The goal was to understand how the virus spreads and how the body reacts to it. The system analyzed 179 inflammation-related genes in multiple tissues over nine days after infection. Protein levels of some cytokine/chemokine genes were also measured using a multiplex detection system. Results showed that Ccl and Ilb were differently expressed in all tested tissues except kidney. Stratification of infected versus non-infected tissues allowed differentiation of systemic response from tissue-specific responses. Significant decrease in C1 was found in non-infected spleen, while Il was upregulated, Il was downregulated in non-inf lung, and M2 were downregulated in non-liver. In-inf livers, Stat, T2, chemines Ccl, C, C, C, C, cytok, Il, Il, and Il were upregulated. In non-brain, C and C were upregulated. Gene and protein kinetics for C, C, C, C, and C correlated with virus presence. The study demonstrated the utility of nCounter for rapid identification of gene changes in mice with NV infection.
An outbreak of rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique in 2014, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human and animal bites in the two cities. From April to July 2014, 14 cases of human rabies were detected in Maputo (n=10), Matola (n=3), and neighboring Boane (n=1), all with a history of recent dog bites. Only one of the 14 rabid dogs was immunized. A total of 819 animal bites were registered, with 64.6% (529) from Maputo City, with dogs responsible for 97.8% (801) of bites, but only 27% (126) were immunized. Factors associated with human rabies were age <15 (p=0.05), bite by stray dog (p=0.002), deep wound (p=0.02), bite to the head (p=0.001), by unimmun dog (p=0.01), no soap and water (p=0.001), and no post-exposure prophylaxis (p=0.01). Control measures for rabies are poor in Maputo and Matola, with cases strongly associated with stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular post-exposure measures. The study aimed to determine clinical and epidemiological features of human rab cases, risk for developing rab, and animal bites in Map and Matola, contributing to formulating recommendations for rab control in Mozambique. This is the first investigation of rab outbreak and epidemi profile bites in Mozambique, where procedures are irregular, resulting in frequent rabies cases.
Researchers have identified a new gene, SCN9, as a potential cause of febrile seizures (FS) in a large family with significant linkage to chromosome 2q. The gene encodes the Nav1.7 subunit of the sodium channel. In 21 affected family members, a mutation was found in a highly conserved amino acid, p.N641, in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II, absent in ethnically matched control chromosomes. To confirm the mutation's role in seizure susceptibility, the mutation was introduced into the murine Sc9 ortholog using targeted homologous recombination. Compared to wild-type mice, homozygous Sc9/N mice exhibited reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures and increased kindling rates. These data support SCN9 as disease-causing in this family. To confirm SCN's role in FS, a collection of 92 unrelated patients were analyzed and additional conserved Nav.7 missense variants were found in 5%. One child with FS later developed Drav syndrome, severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, and SCN was sequenced, identifying a heterozygous frameshift. Analysis of 109 Drav patients yielded 9% with Nav.7 missense variants, all in conserved amino acids. Six Drav patients with SCN miss variants had either miss or site SCN mutations or no SCN mutations. This study provides evidence for SCN's role in human epileps, both as cause and partner SCN mutations.
Researchers have long sought to understand how complex tissue shapes arise through growth, particularly when growth occurs preferentially along certain orientations, raising the question of how these orientations are specified. Two possibilities exist: orientations are specified through stresses in the tissue (axiality system) or independently through molecular signalling (polarity system). The axial system has been explored through computational modelling, while the polarity system is less understood. This study develops a polarity-based framework, called Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT), treating tissue as a continuous material with regionally expressed factors under genetic control interacting and propagating polarity established by signals anchored in tissue organisers under genetic control. Growth rates parallel or perpendicular to polarity are specified through a regulatory network. Resulting growth depends on specified patterns within tissue constraints, leading to features like curvature not directly specified by networks. Growth feeds back influencing spatial orientations and tissue, allowing complex shapes from simple rules. Asymmetries emerge through polarity interactions. The PT framework is applied to a growing Snapdragon, illustrating hypotheses testable by simulation. Combinatorial interactions between orientations and growth, key in polarity systems, have generated observed shapes.
Researchers investigated how multiple CD8 T cell responses during early HIV infection affect the emergence of mutations that help the virus evade the immune system. These responses put pressure on different parts of the virus's genome, leading to mutations that are beneficial for the virus. Some studies found that as these mutations emerge, they become less common over time, a pattern known as the "escape rate decrease" (ER). This pattern can occur due to different mechanisms, including interference between mutations in large populations with high mutation rates. In this study, the researchers looked at how interference between concurrent mutations affects escape rates in multiple parts of the virus and if it's a source of ER. They developed a model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination, and found that interference between equally beneficial mutations can generate ER. The number of locations and recombination rates affect ER, which can be explained by the decline of escape rates over time. The observed ER pattern in infected individuals is consistent with both interference-free and interference effects. Interference should be considered when analyzing HIV mutations, as current methods can't account for competition between mutations.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effectiveness of chemotherapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) patients. The model takes into account various factors such as cancer cell growth, heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. It uses data from two points in time, before and during treatment, to estimate the effect of the tumor environment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. The model was tested on 13 patients with NSCL who received cisplatin with gemcitab, vinlb, or docax in neoadjuvant context. The input values were guided by literature on cancer proliferation kinetics and patient-specific uncertainties were compensated with latin hyper sampling. The model estimated the cell killing ability of various chemotherapies, which could be used for personalized predictions based on patient molecular profiles.
Researchers studied how bacteria in biofilms develop resistance to antibiotics. Biofilms are communities of bacteria that stick to surfaces and are hard to kill with antibiotics. They found that some biofilms are more resistant to the antibiotic ofloxacin because they are starved of nutrients. This means they don't have enough amino acids and carbon to grow. The researchers used a technique called random mutagenesis to find mutants that were more resistant toloxacin. They found that these mutants were more resistant because they were starved of amino acids. They also found that the SOS response, a stress response to DNA damage, was key to this resistance. The SOS response helps bacteria survive when they are starved of nutrients. The researchers also found that the SOS response was necessary for resistance tolox when bacteria were starved of amino and carbon. However, it was not necessary when they were starved of leucine, another amino acid. Biofilms get more resistant tolox as they age, and this is also due to the SOS response. The study shows that SOS in starved biofilms is a key to their resistance toloxacin.
Researchers have identified a key regulator that helps Plasium falcumeroites invade human red blood cells. The regulator, called cAMP, triggers the release of proteins on the parasite's surface that allow it to attach to and enter the cell. The team found that when the parasite is exposed to the low potassium levels found in blood, it activates an enzyme that raises c levels and activates a protein that controls the release of these proteins. They also discovered that c regulates the parasite's calcium levels, which is essential for the release of these proteins. This discovery provides new targets to stop the parasite's growth and prevent malaria.

The study focused on the parasite's invasion of red blood cells, which causes all symptoms of malaria. The parasite multi-step process involves specific interactions between cell receptors and parasite proteins on the parasite's surface. Proteins on the parasite's apical organelles, called micronemes, are crucial for invasion. The team used pharmacological inhibitors to explore the role of a specific enzyme, Pfβ, and other players in signaling pathways that control micron secretion. They found that low potassium in blood activates Pfβ, raising c levels and activating a protein that regulates micron secretion.

The parasite has alternative mechanisms to trigger release micron release, as seen in parasites without a specific protein. Other proteins in the Pf family may also mediate calcium and micron release, but this is unknown. The study provides new targets to stop the parasite's growth and prevent malaria.
Strongyloides stercis, a soil-transmitted threadworm, is one of the most neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). A review of 20 years of studies on its global prevalence in populations and risk groups was conducted. A literature search of PubMed articles from 1989 to 2011 was performed, including those with information on infection prevalence. A Bayesian analysis was done to get country-specific estimates and compare odds in risk groups, accounting for diagnostic sensitivities. 354 studies from 78 countries were included, 62.4% community-based, 34.2% hospital, and 11% refugee/immigrant. World maps with data are provided. Many African, Asian, and South American poor countries lack S.ercis information. Meta-analysis showed association with HIV/alcoholism and Sercis (OR 2.17, CI 1.18-4.01, OR 6.69 CI 1.47-3.8). High prevalence in selected countries and regions. Sercis prominent in risk groups. Information lacking in many countries, but shows Serc must not be neglected. Further socio-economic and ecological assessments and global health integration are needed.

The study aimed to get country-wide Sercis risk and assess association with risk groups. High rates in South Asia, refugees, and immigrants reported. In developed countries, strongyias an issue for immigrants, tourists, and military returning from endemic areas. This has implications for medical services and screening before immunosuppressive treatment. Serc rates are patchy, incidence non-existent. Strongloides stercis a soil-trans nematode, one of most helth NTDs, world-wide, excluding north and south. Estimates are often guesses. Data needed for countries, socio-cultural settings. Large surveys and sensitive methods would narrow gap.
Researchers have long known that stochastic noise, or random fluctuations, plays a crucial role in circadian rhythms, influencing how groups of cells synchronize with external cues and generating internal rhythms. However, few studies have investigated how perturbations affect stochastic noise, mainly due to the difficulty in measuring it directly. This study shows that the rate of population-level bioluminescence can serve as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise, applicable to high-throughput circadian screens. Using fibroblast data, researchers found that higher single-cell noise results in faster population damping. They also demonstrated that damping can be changed by small molecule modulators in a dose-dependent manner, and explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model. The method was applied to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing stochastic altered independently of period and phase. The study suggests the unperturbed clock is optimized for robust rhythms, with few perturbations capable of increasing amplitude and lowering noise. This highlights the importance of considering circadian perturbations on stochastic, particularly in developing small-molecule circadian therapeutics.
Researchers have identified a protein called FZ as a promising target for developing new antibiotics to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. FZ is essential for bacterial cell division, and a small molecule called PC723 has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against Staphylococcus aureus. However, its mechanism of action and effect on other bacterial species is unclear. To understand how PC723 binds to FZ, the researchers used a method called Pocket to analyze the 3D structure of the binding site and molecular dynamics simulations. They found that species and nucleotide state significantly impact the site's properties, with different environments for non-Staphlococcus bacteria. PC723 prefers to bind Stylococcus FZ in the nucleotide state, and simulations suggest polymerization enhances binding. These results show that the binding pocket can vary across species, genetic variations, and polymer states, informing the development of FZ inhibitors.
Researchers have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in complex with the binding domain of lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF), a protein that lentiviruses rely on for efficient replication. The structure reveals key interactions between the two proteins, including a constellation of acidic residues on IN and positively charged on LEDGF. These contacts are crucial for stimulating lentiviral DNA integration in vitro and during early HIV-1 replication. The findings also enabled the creation of a mutant HIV-1 integrase that only functions with a modified LEDGF. The study provides a basis for understanding the high-affinity interaction between lentiviral IN and LED and paves the way for developing LED-targeting technologies for gene therapy.
Researchers studied how cancer cells in different organs change over time and how these changes affect tumor growth. They found that cancer cells inherit traits from their original cells that determine how they behave and grow. Genetic and epigenetic changes can alter these traits, making some cells more fit and growing faster. The study used a computer model to track cancer stem cells, which can start and sustain tumors, and looked at traits like migration, death, division, and telomere length. They found that cell proliferation, or growth, is the strongest factor in tumor growth. More growth leads to more non-stem cells that compete with stem cells, while less growth allows stem cells to divide more. The stem cell population becomes diverse, with some dormant and aggressive. A single tumor sample only shows a small part of total phenotypes. 

The study looked at traits like migration, death, death, division, and telomere length. Proliferation and death modulate growth, while migration and division speed up growth. Increased death counters stem confinement and promotes expansion. This supports previous findings that death slows stem and promotes growth. Evolution leads to uneven cell distribution with varying aggressiveness. Some areas are dominated by old, while new clones are small but fit. The interplay of dynamics requires investigating combinations that yield aggressive clones. While fast growth can be pushed to slow or dormancy by mutations. Proliferation is the strongest modulator of growth.
Researchers studied the emergence of novel infectious diseases that jump from animals to humans, such as influenza A (H1N1). They used mathematical models to explore how adaptation plays a key role in establishing human-to-human transmission. The study focused on spatial heterogeneity within the human population, or how people are connected to each other. They found that for typical connections between communities, spatial heterogeneity has a weak effect on outbreak size and emergence risk. For example, a village connected to a city by 10 commuters a day is effectively part of the city for emergence and outbreak distribution. Data showed most communities are at least this interconnected. For plausible ranges, effects of heterogeneity are dominated by pathogen biology. The study suggests only remote communities are subject to epidemiological isolation. Other factors like human patterns and host heterogeneity also shape risk and speed of emergence. The study focused on spatial host population structure, which has received little attention in adapting pathogens. They modeled communities with varying connections, like a village and city. The biology of the pathogen determines emergence and outbreak size based on average reproductive number. A threshold exists where heterogeneity doesn't matter. Previous research showed heterogeneity in structured models depends on connectivity allowing spread between communities. This approach provides new insights without specifying infectious hosts migrating. The study calculated epidemiological parameters of a disease adapting to humans, exploring host structure and validating with simulations of village-city models.
Researchers studied the migration patterns of the influenza A virus in wild birds in North America over a 34-year period. They analyzed 287 sequenced avian influenza virus samples from migratory birds in Alberta, Canada and Delaware, USA. The goal was to understand how the virus spreads between different bird populations and how it affects humans and livestock. 

The study found that birds in Alberta, which is a key stopover point for four migratory flyways, has most of the genetic diversity of the American influenza virus. This is because birds in this area mix and spread the virus, creating new genetic variations. The Delaware, where thousands of birds stop to feed, is a hotspot for the virus, but does not contribute much to the virus diversity. 

The researchers also found that the virus can spread between bird populations over long distances, not just within flyways. This is important for predicting and preparing for pandemics and protecting livestock. The study used a new method to analyze large-scale patterns of viral movement between bird populations. It identified 20 areas in North America where viruses were collected from wild birds to see if populations were structured by flyways and gene flow. 

The results show that long-term persistence of the virus in wild birds is independent of flyways. This means the virus can spread between populations over time, not just within a short period. The study used 30 years of data to understand dynamics and patterns of the virus in natural hosts.
Researchers have developed a new monoclonal antibody, MAb S/1391, that targets a specific site on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza A viruses. This antibody is unique because it can neutralize multiple subtypes of the virus, including H1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 13. In experiments showed that MAb S/1 blocked the virus's ability to attach to cells, which is a key step in the infection process. The antibody was tested on mice and provided protection against different subtypes of the virus. This suggests that MAb/1 binds to a common site on the HA protein that is shared among various subtypes. The study supports the idea that cross-reactive antibodies can play a role in protecting against influenza infection and highlights the potential of using cross-reactive antibodies as a treatment.
Researchers conducted a three-year study to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin in controlling Strongyloides steralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population. The study involved 259 adults living in a remote community in northern Australia, where the infection prevalence was initially 35.3%. Participants were treated with iverectin and followed up at six months and three years later. The results showed a significant decrease in infection prevalence, from 35.3% to 5.8%, indicating ivermect's effectiveness. Using a lower ELISA threshold for diagnosis was also validated in this setting. However, a small group of individuals remained positive despite treatment. After three years, the infection rate fell to 1.4%, confirming the treatment's success. The study suggests that controlling Strongloides steral infection in Aboriginal adults can be achieved through case-finding and treatment, following current guidelines. The communities in northern Australia have high infection rates, up to 40%.ivermect is the accepted treatment, but there's debate on widespread testing and elimination. The study took place in three communities in Western Australia's Kimberley region, isolated from medical services. Prior to the study, systematic testing and treatment didn't occur. Diagnosis relied on serology due to logistical issues with parasitological methods. ELISA testing was done at a reference lab using a commercial kit. The study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a "find and treat" approach. No data on symptoms or health improvements were collected.
Researchers studied how different strains of prion, a misfolded protein that causes prion diseases, interact with each other. They hypothesized that long-incubation strains, which take a long time to develop, can block short-incation strains, which develop quickly. However, they found that co-infecting animals with combinations of long-incation strains did not show evidence of interference. To rule out the possibility that this was due to failure to infect the same cells, they used protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain (PMCA) assay, which showed that both strains amplified independently. This suggests that lack of interference is not due to failure to target same cells, but an inherent property of strains. Longation strains had relatively high levels of Pr, a precursor to prion, compared to shortation strains. Mechanistically, they hypothesize that abundance of Pr is limiting, resulting in pr strains with low conversion efficiency to amplify independently. This changes understanding of prion interactions has implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of pr strains from mixture.
Researchers have proposed a comprehensive model to compare the roles of ordered and disordered proteins in alloster regulation. It was previously thought that intrinsic disorder is favorable for alloster coupling. However, the new model reveals that the MWC pathway (order transition) has a higher probability than the E pathway (disorder) in alloster. This suggests a complicated role of disordered regions in regulatory proteins. An analytic formula for alloster coupling is also obtained, showing that stable or unstable states are unfavorable for alloster. This is helpful for designing alloster drugs.

 The Ensemble Allost Model (EAM) previously explained why disordered proteins are prevalent in alloster regulation, but lacked the order transition. The Monodors Model (MWC) considers both order and disorder transitions. The comprehensive model shows order-disorder transition is less competitive than order transition in alloster, especially strong alloster. The prevalence of disordered proteins in alloster is more complicated than thought. The new view of alloster is based on protein structure, where ligand stabilizes specific states and shifts conformation. The EAM model uses this view to explain disordered alloster. Disordered proteins are prevalent in alloster due to their advantage, not only alloster capacity. Combining data and bioinformatics would compare ordered and dis importance in alloster. It is unclear if disordered are more or less in alloster than ordered.
Researchers have investigated the role of β-caten in prostate development and cancer. Prostate cancer is a leading cause of death in men worldwide, but few genetic changes that drive cancer initiation and progression are known. β-caten is important in many processes and has been linked to cancer in various tissues, including prostate. However, studies on human cancer samples are unclear on its role. The team used genetic studies in embryos and adults to understand βaten's role in normal and cancerous prostate. They found that epithelial βaten is required for embryonic prostate growth but not in adult. During development, βaten controls number of progenitors in epithelial buds and regulates genes, including c-Myc and Nk3.1. Deletion of βaten in a model of castration-resistant cancer showed it is not needed for progression. Experiments showed βaten promotes squamous epith formation during development, even without androgens. βaten with Pten loss drove invasive carcinoma. These studies show βaten is essential for prostate and high levels drive squamous differentiation. They also show βaten can promote cancer in a relevant model. This provides new information on cancer pathways to lethal prostate in humans.
Researchers conducted a study to understand how to obtain informed consent for a biomedical study in a low-income setting, specifically in southern Ethiopia, where podoiosis (non-filar elephantiasis) is prevalent. They used a rapid assessment method validated in The Gambia to explore factors affecting information and communication during the consent process. The study involved focus groups and in-depth interviews with podoiosis patients, non-patients, community workers, NGO staff, and leaders. Results showed that using everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and presenting information techniques impacted comprehension. Approaching podo patients via trusted individuals and preceding community sensitization were optimal communication methods. Poverty, lack of treatment facilities, and trust in the NGO were barriers to obtaining genuine consent. Researchers should evaluate consent processes to provide information in a comprehensible manner and support decision-making on a study-by-study basis.

The study found that podoiosis is believed to be genetic in the community, using terms like "passed from parents and grandparents" and "blood" to express disease occurrence. Most participants didn't favor written consent sheets and forms. Fieldworkers thought monetary compensation might induce patients to participate due to poverty, stressing "true voluntiness" should be part of the process. Researchers should approach patients through local intermediaries like MPA fieldworkers, as they are respected. Local gatherings and group discussions are common for receiving information, not individual one-on-one. Important ethical guidelines like research purpose, researchers, affiliations, sample use, confidentiality, and findings were considered in the consent process.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the dynamics of T cell proliferation in the immune system, specifically in the thymus and spleen of mice. They used single-cell flow cytometry to analyze the incorporation of a thymidine analogue during pulse-chase-pulse experiments in vivo and DNA content. The model simulates the evolution of single cell behavior through Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to estimate proliferation rates and cell cycle durations in subpopulations. The model is simple, flexible, and validated with other pulse-chase experiments. Results show that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, with specific signatures depending on genetic origins, cell stages in thym and sple, and age. The model infers proliferation rates and cycle durations from EdU data, revealing cell heterogeneity and signatures. 

The model allows estimation of proliferation and intermitotic time with parameters and confidence intervals for G1 and G2 cycle durations. It compares the effect of age and genetics on lymphocyte dynamics from early thym to maturation sple. Fitting data was done by simulating progression through cell cycle and labelling parameters. Parameters were constrained by biological hypotheses. Proliferation rates were compared for thym and sple, abstracting phenotypic heterogeneity in young and old B6, F mice. This study assesses proliferation and quantifies subpopulations T cells along differentiation thym to sple, and aging. It shows genetic and age drive proliferation and cycle durations according T stage and lineage. FVB mice have lower rates than C57/6 in thym and sple.
Researchers have identified a new type of genetic mutation in the mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, that can cause disease in humans. These mutations occur in the tRNA genes, which carry instructions for making proteins. Some of these mutations are rare, but interesting because they can cause different levels of disease in people with the same mutation. To understand this, scientists created a similar mutation in mice, a 373G>A in the mt-T gene. This mimics a human mutation, 429T>C in the same gene. Both cause abnormal folding of the tRNA, preventing isoleucine attachment. Cells with this mutation produce more ROS, leading to compensatory increase in biogenesis. This can explain why some people with mutation don't show disease symptoms. This mechanism is different from mutations in protein-coding genes, where biogenesis would be detrimental. The study shows ROS-mediated biogenesis is involved in tRNA mutations in humans.
Researchers studied how the regulation of the active X chromosome in human cells with three sets of chromosomes (triploid) compared to normal cells with two sets (diploid). They used gene expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in triploid cells. The average X:autosome ratio was lower in triploid cells with one active X and higher in triploid with two active X's. This suggests that X-linked expression is not strictly regulated by autosomal factors, but rather by epigenetic mechanisms that sense the number of active X and autosomal sets. In triploid cells with two active X's, X-linked expression is doubled. However, in trip cells with one active X, expression is adjusted upward by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the X:autosome ratio. This mechanism may act on a subset of genes whose dosage is critical to autosomal expression. The study found a range of X-linked expression in relation to ploidy, with a subset of genes having levels proportional to autosomal sets. In triploid cells with two X's, expression is consistent with doubling of X-linked genes. In trip with one X, expression is increased, suggesting epetic adjustment to the X:aut ratio. Genes with copies on both X and those that escape inactivation were investigated in triploid cells. Expression per copy does not differ between triploid and diploid, indicating adjustment of X but not autos in trip cultures.
A widely used measure of evolutionary pressure on proteins is the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites, known as dN/d. This measure was originally developed for distantly diverged sequences, where differences represent substitutions that have fixed along lineages. However, it is often applied to sequences from a single population, where differences represent segregating polymorphisms. Researchers studied the expected d/d ratio for samples from a single population and found it is relatively insensitive to selection. The hallmark of positive selection, d/d>1, is violated within a population. The relationship between selection and d/d does not follow a monotonic function, making it impossible to infer pressures from d. This has implications for interpreting d measurements among population-genetic samples.

 The relationship between selection and d/d is different for samples from a population compared to divergent lineages. Standard tests for selection based on d are sensitive to the assumption of divergent line. In cases, differences do not represent events along line but polymorphisms in a population. Understanding the relationship between pressures and d for single samples is important. The genetics of d was analyzed. Simulations confirmed the analysis of d. The relationship between selection and d is described when comparing divergent line. However, within a population, the relationship is different. Negative selection produces a relatively insensitive d ratio, while divergent line produce an extreme value. This has implications for inferring selection based on d among conspecific samples. Even independently evolving populations, the power of d to detect selection is low when most sites evolve purifying.
Scientists have long sought to understand how natural selection influences genetic variation within and between species. Studies have shown that genetic differences within species are reduced at sites under selection, but its effect on differences between species is unclear. Researchers investigated whether selection affects divergence between closely and distantly related species. They found that divergence between closely related species, such as humans and primates, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively with recombination rate. Divergence between distantly related species, such as humans and rodents, is also negatively correlated with functional and positively with background selection. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors. Models suggest that selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of variance in divergence, generating the observed correlations. The study reveals that selection can indirectly affect divergence between both closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. While direct purifying selection may drive some patterns, it would require more of the genome to be under selection than believed. The findings have implications for understanding genomes and interpreting genetic variation.
Researchers have discovered that the CK2 kinase plays a crucial role in regulating the stability and activity of the CLOCK (CLK) protein in the Drosila circadian oscillator. CLK is a key component of the transcriptional feedback loop that governs the circadian rhythms in Dila. The study found that CK phosphorylates and stabilizes CLK, reducing its activity. This contrasts with CK1, which promotes CLK degradation. The researchers also found that downregulating CK activity decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases PER and TIM transcription, indicating that CK inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. The study suggests that CK and CK1 have counteracting effects on CLK stability and transcriptional activity. This is the first time a kinase has been identified to play a role in CLK degradation and hyperphosphorylation in Dila. The findings indicate that CK might be a key player in regulating CLK stability and activity in the circadian cycle. The circadian oscillations of gene expression, physiology, and behavior are found in a wide range of organisms and are governed by temporally regulated loops. In the Dila circadian oscillator, CLK and CY activate the expression of PER and TIM genes at the end of the day. Due to the regulation of CLK, the protein represents the rhythmic component of the circadian activ inila.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, interacts with its invertebrate host Rhodnius prolixus midgut. Researchers investigated whether cruzain, a cystine peptase, plays a role in this interaction. They treated T cruz epastigotes with anti-cruain antibodies and cystine peid inhibitors and measured adhesion to R. prolix midut. All treatments, except CA-OM, decreased adhesion. Cystatin reduced adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. T cruz isolates with low active cruzain levels adhered less than D28 and CLner. Transgenic epastotes overexpressing endogenous cruzain inhibitor chag had reduced adhesion 73% compared to wild-type. Adhesion was restored by adding exogenous cruzain. In vivo experiments, low chag parasites had lower adhesion than wild-type after insect passage. Expression of cruzain increased in ch parasites.

Cruzain is a potent cystine pease involved in T cruz life cycle and host-parasite relationships. Little is known about its role in parasite-insect interaction. This study shows cruzain contributes to T cruz interaction with insect. Cystine peases are targets for antiparas drugs, and cruzain has been investigated for Chagas chemotherapy. However, its role in parasite-insect interaction was unknown. Researchers used cystine peid inhibitors and anti-cruz antibodies to measure adhesion to R. prolix midut. All treatments, except CA-OM, decreased adhesion. Catin reduced ad in a dose-dependent manner. T isolates with low cruz levels adhered less than D28 and CL. Transgenic epotes overexpressing chag, a cruzain inhibitor, had 73% lower adhesion than wild-type. Adhesion was restored by adding cruzain. In vivo, ch parasites had lower adhesion than wild after insect passage. Cruz expression increased in ch parasites.
Researchers have identified 20 genes in the nematode worm Caenorhabitis elegans that can suppress a mutant form of a protein called cytoplasm dyin, which is essential for cell division. Cytoplasm dyin is a motor protein that moves along microtubules and helps separate chromosomes during cell division. It also helps move vesicles and organelles around the cell. The researchers used a genetic screen to find genes that can reduce the effect of the mutant cytoplasm dyin. They found 20 genes that can suppress the mutant, but not others that are not related to cytoplasm dy. Many of these genes are not essential for the worm's survival, but when reduced, they can suppress the mutant cytopl dy. Some of these genes, including two light chains of cytopl dy, go to the same places in the cell as the heavy chain of cytopl dy. Reducing one of these light chains can also suppress the mutant cytopl dy. The researchers also found 29 genes that can suppress not only cytopl but other essential processes. They conclude that non-essential genes can contribute to cytopl function during cell division.
Researchers studied the process of programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) in the ciliate Paramecium tetra, a unicellular eukaryotic organism. During somatic differentiation, the germline nucleus is transmitted to the progeny, but the somatic nucleus, essential for gene expression, is destroyed and a new somatic differentiates from a copy of the gerline nucleus. In Paramecium tetra, the development of the somatic nucleus involves massive GR, including the elimination of at least 45,000 gerline sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES). I excision proceeds through a cut-and-close mechanism: domestic transposase PigMac is essential for DNAavage and DSB at excision involves Ligase IV, a component of nonhomolog endjoining (NHE) pathway. To understand how DNAavage and DSB are coordinated during P, researchers focused on Ku, the actor of HE-mediated repair. Two Ku70 and Ku80 paralogs are encoded in the genome of P. tetra: Ku70 and Ku80 are produced during sexual processes and localize in developing somatic nucleus. RNA interference showed that development-specific Ku/Ku80 heterodimer is essential for recovery of functional somatic nucleus. Strikingly, PigMac-dependent DNAavage is abolished IES in cells depleted Ku80, resulting IES retention in somatic genome. PigMac and Ku70/Ku80 co-pur as complex overproduced in heterolog system. Researchers conclude that Ku has integrated Parame DNA factory, enabling coupling between D introduction and repair during P.
Researchers studied the early stages of prion disease in mice to understand how it affects the brain before symptoms appear. They focused on hippocampal CA1 neurons, which are crucial for memory and learning. They used a technique to isolate these neurons from infected mice and analyzed their gene expression at different stages of the disease. They found that gene expression in these neurons is dynamic, with distinct phases of activity. A cluster of genes is altered before symptoms appear, then returns to normal or changes during disease. This cluster includes genes related to N-methyl-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor and neuroprotective pathways. Genes involved in neuron and dendrite development also change, leading to decline in synaptic proteins. MicroRNAs like mi-132, mi-124, mi-16, mi-26, mi-29, and mi-140 follow similar patterns. This study is the first to describe preclinical response of hippocal neurons to prion. Findings suggest prion stimulates a response, mediated by NMD receptor, promoting survival and remodelling, but terminated before symptoms appear. This points to a critical juncture in disease.
Researchers have developed a computer model to simulate the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that form in the liver in response to infection with the parasite Leishmania donov. The model, called a Petri net, accurately recreated the progression of the disease in mice and predicted changes in the types of cells within the granomas over time. By using the model, the researchers found that infected macrophages in the center of the granoma produce a protein called IL-10, which plays a key role in controlling the parasite load. The model did not account for effects of IL-10 outside the granoma, such as on T cell differentiation in other tissues. Data from mice and human studies suggest that granulomatous inflammation is a sign of protective immunity against the parasite. T cells are key to fighting the parasite, and removing them in the model led to high parasite load and non-healing infection.
Researchers have viewed the transcriptional machinery of a gene as a computational device with transcription factors as inputs and expression levels as output. They asked what kinds of computations are possible and found that simple kinetic models of transcription regulation can approximate arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as equality and inequality. This contrasts with studies that emphasize digital notions of computation in biological networks. The accuracy and precision of these approximations depend on different parameters and are tunable. Networks of "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complex computations by designing a network that detects significant elevations in a time-vary signal. Approximating analytic functions can be achieved by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. This is important for interpreting naturally occurring networks and designing synthetic ones. 

Theoretical analysis and simulations show that "arithmetic" genes can be combined to compute sophisticated functions. An example is an eight-gene network that tracks the mean and standard deviation of a time-vary signal and detects when the signal is significantly elevated. A model of a gene regulated by a single transcription factor with multiple binding sites on the promoter is also considered. Simple models demonstrate arithmetic computations at transcriptional regulation. Other functions like exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions can be computed by combinations of arithmetic. However, this would be energetically wasteful and require many genes. A more efficient approach is approximating directly using complicated machinery.
Researchers have sequenced the genomes of the Chikungunya virus (CHV) from a recent outbreak in Northeast Brazil and found that two different genotypes, Asian/Caribbean and ECSA, are circulating in the region. This is the first time these genotypes have been found to coexist in the same area. The study also found evidence of simultaneous infection with both genotypes in six clinical samples, suggesting coinfection may be more common than previously thought in endemic areas. Chikunya virus is an RNA virus from the Togaviridae family transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever, Chikunya fever, which can lead to severe outcomes. It arrived in Brazil in 2014 through two introductions, Asian/Car in the North and ECS in the Northeast. Both genotypes established urban cycles in large human populations, causing outbreaks in the Americas. The study used an in-house Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol to detect multiple CHV genotypes from clinical samples. The results show both genotypes expanded their range, reaching cocirculation in Northeast Brazil.
Bacteria acquire new DNA from their environment through a process called horizontal gene transfer, which increases their genetic diversity and helps them colonize new niches, including the human host. However, it's unclear how this new DNA interacts with the bacterial cell's regulatory networks. The protein H-NS modulates both horizontally acquired and core genes, silencing expression in response to stimuli like osmolarity and temperature. Researchers found that HNS discriminates and modulates horizontally acquired and core DNA differently. For example, the plasmid R27-encoded HNS protein silences horizontally acquired genes without interfering with core regulation. In contrast, chromosomal H requires a helper protein, Hha, to silence horizontally acquired DNA, while core genes are modulated by HNS homomers. The presence of H-like proteins is unique to Enterobacteraceae and conjugative plids encoding HNS variants have only been found in this family. This system allows bacteria to selectively silence horizontally acquired DNA, potentially giving them an advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
Researchers compared the gene expression of Leishmania parasites in different species and hosts to understand how they cause disease. They found that most genes are the same across species, but a few are different. They used microarrays to see which genes are expressed in the parasite's disease-causing stage and found that only a few are regulated at the RNA level. In the first study of L. brazili, about 9% of genes are regulated during its life cycle, similar to other Leish species. Comparing parasite gene profiles between species shows that Leish undergo little regulation, but some genes are regulated differently in hosts. They also found that host's immune system doesn't affect parasite's gene expression, even in immunocompromised mice. This suggests Leish are adapted for intracellular survival and don't change gene expression much. The study focused on amigote gene expression, comparing RNA profiles between three Leish species to find differences relevant to infective stages. Oligonucle arrays were designed for 10% of the genome, targeting conserved and different genes between species, and hybridized with host-derived amig RNA from lesions, spleens, and macrophages. About 9% of probed genes were regulated during L. This lack of modulation suggests Leish are adapted to intracellular survival, regardless of host state.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool, called LPhimer, to detect the liver fluke parasite Amphimer in human stool samples. This parasite causes a disease called amphias, which is common in tropical Ecuador and affects both humans and animals. Current diagnosis relies on finding parasite eggs in stool, but this method is not sensitive and can be confused with other parasites. No molecular or immunological methods exist. Limer targets a specific DNA sequence of the parasite and was optimized using DNA from worms recovered from animals. The limit of detection is 1 pg of DNA. Field testing with 44 human samples from endemic areas showed 25 were positive by microscopy, but Limer detected all. The sensitivity and specificity of Limer were 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively. This is the first specific and sensitive assay for detecting Amphimer in stool. It has potential for field diagnosis and surveillance in amphias-endemic areas. Further studies will assess its applicability.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called Ykt in the process of autophagy in fruit flies. Autagy is a process where cells recycle and remove damaged or unnecessary components. Ykt forms a complex with two other proteins, Sy17 and Snap, to help fuse autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolys. Without Y, autophagosomes accumulate and can't fuse with lysosomes, leading to cell damage. The study found Y localizes to lysosomes and autagosomes and forms a complex with Sy17 and Snap, but can be outcompeted by another protein, V7. Overexpressing V7 rescues the defect caused by Y loss. A mutant form of Y with an amino acid change retains autagy function and normal viability, unlike other mutants. Y and V7 are required for autag-lys fusion and are mutually exclusive in the Sy17-Snap complex, suggesting V7 is involved in fusion and Y acts as a non-conventional SNARE.
Researchers have studied how the bacterium Haemophilus influenza (NTH) resists the effects of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the human body to fight infection. AMPs are a key part of the body's first line of defense against bacterial infections. TH is a common inhabitant of the nasal passages, but can cause infections in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. A key to TH's ability to cause disease is its resistance to AMPs. A protein called Sap helps TH resist AMP, but how it does so was unknown. The researchers found that Sap binds to AMP and is needed for TH to be virulent in the body. They showed that Sap counteracts AMP lethality during TH infection by delivering them to the inner membrane for transport into the cytoplasm. AMPs were found in the cytoplasm of normal TH, but not in bacteria lacking Sap. This shows Sap imports AMP, a new way for bacteria to avoid host defense peptides.

TH is a common nasal inhabitant, but causes infections like conjunctivitis, sinusitis, and lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. When it becomes a pathogen, it must get nutrients and defend against AMPs produced by the body in response to infection. Altered AMP levels affect its ability to colonize the host. Researchers showed AMPs control TH colonization of the nasal surface in a model of TH disease. They neutralized AMP via antibody to see their role in TH colonization.

AMPs are cationic, amphipathic molecules that target bacterial membranes and cause cell death. TH must defend against AMP to become pathogen. The researchers found Sap delivers AMP to the inner membrane for transport into the cytopl, where they are degraded. This is a new way for bacteria to avoid host defense.
Researchers studied how the protein MarA, a key regulator of antibiotic resistance in E. coli, coordinates its downstream targets. They found that its short half-life affects both the rate and maximum coordination of gene expression. By modifying Mar's half-life, either by knocking out the enzyme that breaks it down or protecting it from degradation, they observed changes in how genes are regulated. 

MarA has a short half-life of 1-3 minutes due to an enzyme called Lon. It controls 60 genes involved in antibiotic resistance, including pumps and stress response proteins. Its short half-life is rare in bacteria, but may be useful. To understand its purpose, the researchers focused on Mar in E. coli. coli. They used CRISPR to change Mar's dynamics, increasing its half-life, which improved coordination between genes. However, the rate of coordination was different from wild-type Mar. 

Degradation may allow for a responsive and agile network. Alternatively, it may help few cells generate diversity after antibiotic challenge.
Researchers previously found that mice lacking the enzyme MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MK-2) are more susceptible to infection with the parasite Leishmania mexicana due to increased Arginase-1 levels and reduced NO activity in macrophages and a diminished TH1 response. However, in a new study, MK-2 deficient mice infected with Leishmania major showed a similar healing response to wild-type mice in terms of lesion size and parasite numbers. Analysis of immune responses revealed a reduced TH1 response in MK- mice with lower parasite-specific IgG levels, lower frequency of IF-γ and TN-α producing CD4 and CD8 T cells and lower stimulated spleen IFγ production compared to wild-type. Despite this, MK- mice also had reduced levels of induced spleen and lymph node IL-4 and parasite-specific IgG, indicating a general cell hypo-responsiveness. The TH1/TH balance was unchanged in MK mice compared to wild-type. Although MK- macrophages were more permissive to L growth than wild-type macrophages, LPS/IF-γ was equally effective at controlling parasite in MK and wild-type macroages. The absence of a TH/TH switch in MK mice resulted in no change in disease phenotype.
Researchers have studied the development of the ductal network in the pancreas, a branched organ that doesn't follow typical branching patterns like other glands. They found that the network changes over time to become more efficient for delivering digestive products to the duodenum. Using computer modeling, they broke down the process into simple rules that may apply to other glands. The early stage is explained by random connections forming small ducts, while the later stage is due to pruning based on fluid flow. Despite individual differences in pancreas branches between mice, the network is stereotypic at each stage and changes as it matures. The researchers condensed their findings into principles and tested them using computer simulations. They found the network has stereic traits at each stage and can be quantified by standard measures. The early stage from E10.5 to E12.5 is explained by random duct formation, while the later stage from E12.5 to 18.5 is due to pruning based on fluid flow. The study reveals new features of pancreatic development and may apply to other glands that secrete fluid, such as the salivary gland. The proposed rules differ from other branching models, like the lung or mammary gland.
Researchers have mapped the structural and dynamic features of kines motor proteins, which drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformation changes that mediate movement along microtubules. They analyzed 114 experimental structures and results from accelerated molecular simulations, finding three distinct conformation clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5-inhibitor-bound. These differ in the orientation of key elements, notably microtub binding α-α5 loop, subdomain and α2-β-4β-β-7 motor tip. Group membership doesn't correlate with nucleotide state, but with distinct necker orientations. Simulations of ATP, AD, and Eg5 indicate all states sample majorlogically observed conformations, with differences in distal site coupling. Neck, loop, and α-5 sub display motions in ATP bound, absent in AD. Dissection shows communication network between active site, microub interface, and necker loop, loop 13. Mutations G325, G326 in loop reduce flexibility and disrupt couplings. Results indicate ATP, AD conformations are intrinsically accessible, regardless of nucleotide, supporting a model where necker docking tightens microub and nucleotide regions. Simulations highlight critical conformation changes and alloster coupling between dist sites.
Researchers have developed a new approach to accurately interpret bioluminescent data from the Lux system, a gene reporter used to measure gene expression. The Lux system is fast, sensitive, and non-destructive, allowing for high-frequency measurements, and has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells, whole biosensors, and live animals without euthanasia. However, interpreting biolumines data is limited because biolumcence is different from gene expression due to nonlinear and molecular dynamics of the Lux system. The new approach uses a mathematical model of Lux activity, including LuxAB, LuxC, and Fre, with improved mechanisms for reactions and protein synthesis and turn-over. The model is calibrated with data from Photorhabdus lumcens, the source of modern Lux reporters, and literature data for LuxC. Importantly, it shows evidence for previously unreported inhibition of the Lux reaction. Simulations show biolumcent profiles can differ from gene expression, with peaks of light output similar to some experimental data. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian scheme, promoter activity can be inferred from biolumcence. Examples show a decrease in biolum would be interpreted as promoter off, and increase as longer gene expression. This approach benefits all Lux users.
Researchers have determined the structure of Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) in complex with a capsid binder G3, which is a potential inhibitor of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsievirus A16, the main causes of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. The study clarifies the role of key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. Based on this model, in silico docking was performed to investigate interactions with two next-generation capsid binders NLD and AL, which show potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis was performed using available information to gain insight into structural features required for capsid binders to interact and those confer broad-spectrum enterirus activity.

The researchers used in silico protocol to dock two designed capsid binders into CVA structure, demonstrating similar binding mode. Structural in silico results analyzed in context antiv activity against a range enterir, showing potency and broad-spectrum antiv activity. Inhibitors were tested against panel enterir (Table 2). Structural comparisons (Fig 9) used meta-analysis correlated features with antiv activity. Results reinforce NLD as candidate for HF drug.

The study found hydrophobic pocket in enterirus capsid VP1, required for infection, can be targeted by molecule with higher affinity as antiv agent. The structure of CVA with capsid binder 3 (4-pyridyl-2-imazolidone G3) was determined, and energy of interaction calculated using in sil method. Good antiv activity observed for three caps binders, highest for PV1 with Leu residue at bottom, reducing energy compared PV2 and PV3 with Phe. The hydrophobic pocket in VP1 remains target for novel inhibitors early enterirus infection.
Researchers have identified the cells and receptor responsible for removing the Necrot serpin from the hemolymph of Drosophila melanogaster. Necrot is a serpin that regulates the immune response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections by inhibiting a proteolytic cascades. After infection, a proteolytic cascade is activated through the Toll receptor, leading to the synthesis of antibiotic peptides in the fat body and export to the hemolymph. Necrot is synthesized in the fat body, but its site of degradation was unclear. Using a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation, researchers found that Necrot is removed from the hemolymph by two types of cells: giant cells and pericardial macrophages. Necrot uptake increases rapidly after 30 minutes and peaks at 6-8 hours. The researchers found that Nec is processed through multivesicular bodies and delivered to lysosomes, where it co-localizes with ubiquitin-binding protein HRS. They also found that Nec does not co-localize with Rab11, indicating it is not re-exported from macrophages. Mutations blocking late endosome/lysosome fusion cause accumulation of Nec-positive endosomes, even without infection. Knocking down the Drosila ortholog of the mammalian LDL receptor, Lp1, identified it as an enhancer of the immune uptake of Nec from hemolymph. A chromosomal deletion of L1 blocks the uptake of Nec.
In sea urchins, two opposing signals, Nodal and BMP, play a crucial roles in establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry. Nodal signaling prevents the formation of the rudiment on the right side, but the opposing pathway to Nodal during LR establishment was unclear. Researchers found that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in small micromeres. By perturbing BMP activities, they demonstrated that BMP signaling is required for the expression of left-sided genes and formation of left-sided structures. On the other hand, Nodal on the right inhibits BMP signaling and controls asymmetric apoptosis of small miceres. The study shows that BMP is a positive signal for left-sided development in seaurchs, suggesting that opposing Nodal and BMP roles in LR asymmetry are conserved in deuteromes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is tightly linked to the host cell cycle. Infected cells in the G0/G phase support immediate early (IE) gene expression and proceed to the G1 phase, where they arrest. In contrast, S phase cells can be infected but block IE expression, and this inhibition is relieved when cells divide and re-enter G1. During latent infection, IE expression is also inhibited, and reactivation requires overcoming this block. Researchers investigated which viral and cellular activities maintain this block and whether mechanisms are linked. They found that the S phase block can be overcome by genotoxic stress and DNA replication inhibitors, pointing to checkpoint-dependent pathways controlling IE repression. Checkpoint rescue requires p53, and absence mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in a p53-dependent manner. Requirement for cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 downstream p53 suggests a role in IE repression S/G and S cells. CD inhibition alleviates repression independently p53. Importantly, CD also overcomes block during quiescent, latent infection NT2 cells. Timely CD activity secures cycle specificity HCM gene program and prevents establishment latent state.
Researchers studied how the immune system fights HIV in people who naturally control the virus without treatment. These individuals, called elite controllers, have strong HIV-specific T cells that prevent the virus from replicating. However, how these cells develop is not well understood. Dendritic cells, a type of immune cell, can recognize HIV and trigger T cells to fight it, but HIV often evades this recognition. The study found that in elite controllers, dendritic cells rapidly produce interferons, proteins that help fight viruses, and upregulate genes to combat them. This innate response is linked to reduced HIV replication and increased reverse transcription. Blocking this response with drugs or silencing a sensor gene reduced it. Importantly, enhanced innate recognition in dendritic cells from controllers led to stronger HIV-specific T cell responses. This suggests innate interferon production in dendritic cells is crucial for effective T cell immunity against HIV and may aid in prevention or treatment.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes that control fat storage in fruit fly larvae by measuring their buoyancy. They used this method to find 66 genes that increase fat levels, including a gene called Sir2. Sir2 regulates fat storage and metabolism by deactivating key proteins. However, its role in humans is unclear because it functions differently in various tissues. They found that knocking down Sir2 in larvae increases fat, and that it restricts fat accumulation in individual cells in a cell-autonomous manner. Changes in metabolic enzymes in Sir mutants point to a shift from burning to storing fat. Surprisingly, Sir is upregulated under starvation, but mutants survive better under amino acid starvation as long as sugars are provided. This suggests a Sir pathway that activates catabolysis to amino acid starvation regardless of sugar content. The study implicates Sir as a key in switching from ingested to stored energy source.
Researchers studied the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes, closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, to understand how the mitotic spindle behaves during asymmetric cell division. This process is essential for generating cellular diversity in animals, where the cleavage plane is perpendicular to the mitotic spindle, and the spindle dictates the size of the daughter cells. Although some properties of spindle positioning are conserved between distantly related species and cell types, little is known about the evolutionary mechanisms underlying this event. The team recorded the embryonic division of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabis and 15 non-Caenorhabis species, creating a collection of subcellular phenotypes to study the evolution of cellular processes across species. They analyzed this collection to study asymmetric spindle positioning and found large intra and inter-species variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and spindle movement parameters, including oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these parameters changed during evolution with no direction in the species phylogeny, except spindle transverse oscillations, which were an innovation at the base of Caenorhabis genus. These changes were unrelated to evolutionary variations in embryo size. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently, contrasting with expectations based on C elegans studies and revealing unrecognized changes in spindle mechanics.
Researchers studied how two closely related bacteria, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escheria coli, respond to acid stress. They found that both have the same protein, Omp, but it's regulated differently in each species. In Salmonella Tyimium, Omp levels increase in acid, but not in Escheria. This is due to differences in the promoter region of the O gene and the Esia O orthologue can be made acid-inducible by introducing sequences from Salmonella. The O regulon in Salmonella overlaps with Esia at 15 genes, including virulence genes Esia does not have. O binds to its targets more when DNA is relaxed, which occurs in Salmon as a result of acid stress and is required for virulence expression. The targets do not share a strong sequence consensus, suggesting O's ability to recruit genes arises from its specificity for relaxed DNA allowing cooperation with topology to modulate response to stress.

The study replaced the promoter of Esia with Salmon's and found it expressed at pH 4.5, showing it acquired Salmon's pattern. However, the entire Salmon regul did not respond to acid in Es. The mechanism was investigated by looking at the promoter and Env genes, which constitute the bicistronic operon. Transcription is driven by the upstream promoter and an acid-indible site has been identified in Salmon. Following acid shock, O is positively autoregulated through Env. Species differences in the promoter, Env structure, or function might account for the expression in Salmon and Es during stress. The sequences were compared at pH 4.5 and 7 using 5' RACE.
Researchers have identified a new protein, called N, secreted by the bacterium Chlamydia trachatis, that enters the host cell's nucleus and modifies histones. Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around, controlling gene expression. N has a SET domain, a feature of histone methyltransferases, enzymes that add methyl groups to histones. Studies showed N is secreted through a type III secretion system, a mechanism used by some bacteria to deliver proteins to host cells. In the nucleus, N associates with chromatin, the complex of DNA and histones. Experiments in mammalian cells confirmed N is a histone methyltransfer, modifying histones H2, H3, and H4, and itself. Automethylation, adding a methyl group to itself, enhances N's activity. Without automylation, N's ability to modify histones is reduced. This is the first time a bacterial protein has been found to target mammalian histones directly.
A new study of 35,000 people from 21 different populations has found a link between inbreeding and lower height. Inbreeding is when two parents are related, such as cousins, and their children are more likely to be shorter than those of unrelated parents. The study found that children of cousins are up to 3 cm shorter than those of unrelated parents. This effect remained even after accounting for socio-economic status, which can affect height. However, the effect size of inbreeding on height varied among populations. This may be due to different levels of inbreeding in each population and chance of rare genetic variants being passed on. The study suggests many rare genetic variants contribute to height. This research focused on height, but the method can be used for other heritable traits.
Researchers have identified a distinct type of immune cell in the blood called monocytes (MO) that is associated with fighting off malaria parasites in people with uncomplicated Plasium falciparum malaria. Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that can change their behavior in response to inflammation. The researchers studied MO in people with malaria and those who have been exposed to malaria but do not have the disease. They used a technique called flow cytometry to analyze the cells and a test their ability to fight parasites in a lab setting. At the start of the study, most people with malaria had high levels of a certain types of MO called CD16 and CCR2CXCR1. Two groups of patients were identified based on the level of CCR and CXCR on a specific subset of MO. One group had high levels and the other low. The group with high levels had lower levels of parasites in their blood than the group with low levels. This suggests that MO with high levels of CCR and CXCR can fight off parasites. The study found that MO with CCR, CXCR, CD56, TN-α and IF-γ are associated with lower parasite levels and strong ability to fight parasites. Historically, MO have been seen as cells that clear parasites without antibodies. The study found differences in MO subsets in malaria patients and healthy controls. Patients with high MO had lower parasite levels than those with low.
A study of 34 HIV-uninfected Ugandan men found that Schistosoma mansoni infection was associated with an increase in HIV-susceptible CD4 T cell subsets in the blood, but not the foreskin. Men with S. mansoni infection had higher levels of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells in their blood compared to those without the infection. Th17 cells in the blood of S mansoni-infected men also produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, these immune changes were not observed in the foreskin tissue. The study suggests that S mansoni infection may increase HIV susceptibility through the common mucosal immune system, but this effect is limited to the blood, not the foreskin, which is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men.
Researchers have found that depleting Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacteria living inside filarial nematodes, leads to extensive apoptosis, or cell death, in the nemat's reproductive cells, embryos, and somatic cells, and microfilar. This occurs even in cells that were not infected with Wolia before treatment. The study used whole mount confocal microscopy to observe the effects of Wolia depletion on nemat cellular structure. Apoptosis occurs soon after Wolia depletion in B. malayi and is sustained for at least 21 months in O. volulus. Observations show apoptosis in adult germl cells, embryos, and somatic microilar cells following Wolia depletion. Activation of cell death protein-3 was confirmed in treated females, microilar, and L larvae. In contrast, only a few cells in early embryos possess Wolia, while majority undergo apoptosis. Similarly, only third intrauterine microilar are Wolia-infected, apoptosis occurs entire organism upon Wolia depletion. Data demonstrate Wolia effects on apoptosis are non-autonomous. Wolia may influence apoptosis through indirect mechanisms, such as metabolite provisioning, compromised by hypermal cytoskeletal defects. Nemat processes sensitive to Wolia depletion, embryogenesis and larval development, have high metabolic demands. Observations provide cellular mechanism for anti-filar effects following Wolia depletion. Apoptosis pattern correlates with outcomes in antibiotic therapy laboratory models and human trials doxycine.
Researchers studied how the malaria-causing parasite Plasium falcum requires a nutrient called pantoate to grow and multiply. They found that the parasite converts pantoate into a molecule called coenzyme A (CoA) using an enzyme called panto kinase (Pan). Some anti-malarial pantoate analogs, such as panto and CJ-801, kill the parasite by targeting CoA production. However, the exact mechanism of action was unknown. The researchers created parasite lines resistant to these analogs by exposing them to high doses of panto or CJ-801. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in a Pan gene called PfPan1 in all resistant lines. These mutations altered Pan activity, causing a fitness cost, suggesting Pan1 is essential for normal growth. The mutants showed different sensitivity to other anti-mial pate analogs, with one being hypersensitive. The study suggests different pate classes have different mechanisms: some inhibit Co production while others inhibit using enzymes.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with the PR interval, a measure of atrial and atrioventricular conduction time, in African Americans. They analyzed data from four cohorts of 6,247 individuals and used a microarray to genotype 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. A strong signal was observed in the SCN5A gene, which encodes a cardiac sodium channel, with a genome-wide association p-value of 2.5x10^-8 in two cohorts and a meta-analysis. This variant explained 2% of PR variability in African Americans, with a 5.1 millisecond increase per minor allele. The same variant was associated with PR in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size and less variability. Further analysis identified genome-wide associations in SCN5, ME1, and TBX, highly correlated with variants in European and Asian studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration in one cohort, but not others. The study demonstrates relevance of common variants in African at loci previously associated with PR in European and Asian samples and identifies a signal more strongly associated with PR in Africans than Europeans.
Researchers have identified a small GTP-binding protein called ARL8 that plays a crucial role in the replication of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), a type of virus that infects plants. Like other positive-strand RNA viruses, To replicates its genetic material in complexes formed on cellular membranes. A previous studies showed that a seven-transmembrane protein TOM is necessary for efficient To multiplication. This study found that ARL, along with TOM, is co-pur with a tagged To180 replication protein from solubilized membranes of To-infected tobacco cells. When solilized membranes of To-infected cells expressed tagged ARL, TOM and To180 replication proteins were co-pur and the fraction showed RNA-dependent polymerase activity transcribing To RNA. In contrast, uninf cells TOM co-p with tagged ARL less efficiently, suggesting a complex of To replication proteins, TOM, and ARL form on membranes in infected cells. In Arabidopsis, ARL has four members. Simultaneous mutations in two A8 genes completely inhibited To multiplication. In vitro To RNA-replication system, lack of TOM or A8 inhibited production of replicative RNA, indicating TOM and A8 required for negative-strand synthesis. When To130 protein coexpressed with TOM and A8 in yeast, 5-capping activity detected in membrane. This was undetect or weak when130 expressed alone or with TOM or A8. Results suggest TOM and A8 are components of To replication and crucial in process activation of synthesizing and capping functions.
Researchers studied the role of inhibitory neurons in the locust's olfactory system to understand how they shape the firing patterns of principal neurons. Two types of inhibitory motifs emerged: feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibition. In the locust, a subset of lateral interneurons (LHNs) provided feed-forward inhibition to Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain sparse firing, crucial for olfactory learning and memory. However, a single inhibitory cell, the GABAergic neuron (GN), was found to be the main source of inhibition in the mushroom body, mediated by a feedback loop including KCs and GN. To clarify the differences between FF and FB inhibition, a model of the locust olfactory system was used. Both inhibitory motifs maintained KC responses and provided optimal odor discrimination, but only FB created a response consistent with in vivo data. This suggests that GN is potentially the primary source of inhibition to KCs. Understanding how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic activity could reveal unknown inhibitory structures in biological networks.
Researchers have developed a new laboratory test to diagnose rabies, a viral disease that affects animals and humans. The test, called dual real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), can detect all types of lyssavirus, a group of viruses that includes rabies. This method combines two techniques: a probe-based RT-qPCR to detect rabies virus (RV) and another using dye to detect other lyaviruses. The test was evaluated with many animal and human samples, including saliva, skin, and brain tissue. It correctly identified 41 out of 76 human cases of rabies and was 91.5% sensitive for skin and 54% for saliva samples. The test was also used in two reference laboratories in Cambodia and Morocco. This new test is a useful tool for diagnosing rabies in animals and humans and a promising for lyavirus surveillance.
An outbreak of tset-transmitted trypanosomias resulted in over 50% losses of domestic pigs in the Eastern Region of Ghana in 2007. To control the disease, a trial was conducted from May to October 2007 to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito nets in controlling tse. Two villages were selected: one as control with 14 pigs and one experimental with 24 pigs protected by insecticide-treated fences. The 100 high, 150-denier fences with 100mg/m deltamethrin and UV were attached to poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring with geo-referenced traps showed a 90% reduction in the protected village within two months and 95% in subsequent months. Tset in the control village remained unchanged, displaying seasonal variations. Fifty pigs from each village were ear-tagged and given curative treatment after blood samples taken. Initial trypan prevalence was 76% in protected and 72 in control, decreasing to 16 in protected and 84 in control after three months. Six months later, 8 protected pigs were infected compared to 60 in control.

Insecticide-treated nets likely kill not only tse but also other biting flies, benefiting villagers and livestock. Maintaining livestock in areas previously unsuitable due to tse tryosomiasis is now viable. Trypan prevalence was reduced in protected pigs, remaining higher in control. Changes in husbandry, such as resource scarcity and productivity, also occurred. However, tse and other vectors can enter pens, transmit African trypanosomias (AT). Protection with IT significantly reduced vector-borne diseases shown in Kenya. Our results show IT reduced tse numbers, trypan prevalence. P. palis was caught, predominant in Eastern Ghana, sometimes endophagic, attacking pupils. Pigs are essential income in rural areas, but A threat jeopardizes productive husbandry.
A recent survey of 441 biomedical articles published between 2000-2014 found low levels of reproducibility and transparency. Only one study provided a full protocol and none made raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare (n=4) and only 16 had data included in a systematic review or meta-analysis. Most studies did not mention funding or conflicts of interest. Between 2000-201, the percentage of articles with no funding statement decreased (94.4% to 34.6%) and those reporting conflicts (0% to 15.4%) or no conflicts (5.6 to 50%) increased. Articles in clinical medicine journals were more likely to lack funding information and have private funding. When limited to empirical articles, clinical journals were more likely to not mention funding (59% vs 26.3%) and less likely have a PubMed reference (16 vs 27.5%). The study provides baseline data for future progress in reproducibility.
Researchers have studied how the bacteria Yersinia pestis causes primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal disease with a 100% mortality rate. They found that the disease progresses in two phases: an initial inflammatory phase where the bacteria grow without triggering an immune response, followed by a pro-inflammatory phase with massive neutrophil influx, inflammation, and tissue destruction. To understand this, they used a tool to track proteins delivered by the bacteria's type III secretion system and found that it targets alveolar macrophages early on, then switches to neutrophils. They also showed that neutil influx fails to control bacterial growth and causes severe inflammation in the pro-inflammatory phase. 

The bacteria's type III system injects proteins into host cells, essential for its virulence and has anti-inflammatory effects on mammalian cells. However, the targeted cells during pneumonic plague were unknown. The study used fully virulent Y. alolar macrophages and neutils as targets and found that depleting 92% of alolar macroages had little effect on bacterial burden, suggesting macroages are not involved in limiting Yinia survival. The bacteria creates a protective environment in lungs early, deactivating immune responses. They hypothesized it targets immune cells early via type secretion. Evaluating macro and neutil dynamics provides insight into progression to pro-inflammatory disease. This study is the first to identify host cells and population in lung during pneumonic. Previous literature highlights interactions between Y pest and macroages, but shows Y primarily targets macro and neutils early.
Researchers in Brazil conducted a study to evaluate the accuracy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using soluble recombinant antigens to detect asymptomatic Leishmaniasis infection. They collected blood samples from 136 participants, 97 of whom were positive and 39 negative for the parasite, and followed them for two years. None of the asymptomatic individuals developed the disease. The researchers compared ELISA results to molecular techniques, such as PCR and hybridization, which confirmed the presence of Leishmania in all kalaazar patients and 86% of the cohort. Kala patients showed high reactivity in ELISA, while asymptomatic individuals showed low reactivity. The recombinant antigen r39 had higher specificity but lower sensitivity than Leish amazon and infant antigens. There was low agreement among the antigens used. Serological tests were inaccurate for diagnosing asymptomatic infections compared to molecular methods, which could lead to misclassification in studies. Studies using serological assays to estimate prevalence or identify risk factors may have compromised results.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze the expression of retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells using Illumina and Affymetrix gene microarray data. This approach allowed them to identify histone deacetylase Hd1 as a component of the retrotranson silencing machinery in these cells and determine retrotranson targets of Hd1 in these cells. They also found that retrotransons are targets of other silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and RingB/E-containing polycomb repressive complexes in mouse embryonic cells. The study suggests that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retroons in embryonic cells and that different copies of the same retroon can be differentially sensitive to silencing. The researchers also found that certain retroon elements are targeted by silencing machineries.

The study identified new retroons for polycomb repressive complexes and histone deetylase Hd1 in mouse cells. Although the range of repetitive elements analyzed by microarray is not as wide as RNA-seq, one and two thirds of all retroons in the mouse genome are represented by probes on micro platforms analyzed. The researchers used repeatannotation of micro data to investigate established mechanisms of retroon silencing and found a complex interplay between DNA methylation and histone regulating expression of repetitive elements in the genome. They showed that genome-wide silencing of repetitive can be monitored by extracting information from micro gene data, revealing interplay between mechanisms controlling retroon expression in mouse cells and cells, and differences in behavior of different copies individual retroons.

Using this approach, researchers identified retroons silenced by methylation and hist modifications in embryonic cells and histone deetylase Hd1 as regulator of retroons in mouse cells. They also identified Hd1 as component of retroon silencing machinery in cells. This methodology is likely to generate insights into retro regulation in mammals and identify components of defense mechanisms protecting genome from retroposition.
Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY) plays a crucial role in regulating flowering time by controlling the expression of the Flowering Locus T (FT) gene. CRY-interacting bHL1 (C1) interacts with CRY in response to blue light to activate FT transcription. In vitro, C1 binds to the canonical-box (ACGT) with higher affinity than non-canonical-box (NT) DNA sequences. However, in vivo, C1 binds the chromatin region of FT, which contains non-canonical sequences. This study shows CRY also interacts with at least C5 in response to blue, but not darkness or other wavelengths. Genetic analysis demonstrates C1, C2 C4, and C5 redundantly activate FT and are positive regulators of C2-mediated flowering. Importantly, C1 and other C proteins form heterodimers, with some having higher affinity to non-canonical-box in vitro assays. This explains why C1 binds canonical-box with higher affinity in vitro, yet associated with non-canonical at FT promoter vivo. Consistent with C similar roles in C2-mediated blue signaling, C expression is regulated by light. The study shows C redundantly regulate C2-dependent and different C form heterodimers interact non-can DNA vivo.
An economic analysis of the impact of overseas and domestic treatment options for intestinal infections among US-bound refugees from Asia was conducted. Intestinal parasites such as hookworm, Trichuris, Ascaris, and Strongloides are rare in the US and may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, leading to serious consequences. The study evaluated the costs and benefits of overseas presumptive treatment vs domestic screening/treatment vs no program. A Markov model estimated the cost and health impacts of four interventions on a cohort of 27,700 US-bound Asian refugees: 1) No program, 2) US domestic screening and treatment, 3) overseas albendazole and ivermect presumptive, and 4) overseas albazole domestic for Stronglo. The "No" option was the least expensive ($165,923) and least effective (145 cases, 4 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths over 60 years). The overseas albazole and iverect option ($418,824) was less expensive than domestic screening ($3,832,572) or overseas albazole domestic for Stronglo ($2,182,483). Overseas presum treatment for US-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and as effective as domestic programs. The addition of iverect to alb reduces prevalence of Stronglo and probability of fatal disseminated.
Researchers have discovered a new species of microsporidian parasite, Nematida displere, that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and displays a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. Nemat displere can invade and replicate in multiple tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C elegans, with most replication occurring in the muscle and epider. This distinguishes it from closely related microidian pathogens Nematii and N sp.1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. The Nemat displere genome is the earliest diverging species of the Nematida genus, with over 10% of its proteins belonging to a species-specific family of R-domain proteins of unknown function that may mediate host interactions. The study provides a whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different niches.
Researchers have discovered that the Cockayne syndrome B (CS) protein plays a crucial role in repairing DNA damage caused by transcription, a process called transcription-coupled DNA repair. Mutations in the CS gene lead to Cockayne syndrome, a disease characterized by premature aging, sensitivity to sunlight, and developmental issues. CS is part of a family of proteins that use ATP to reorganize chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes. However, how CS reorganizes chromatin and if this activity is used in repair was unknown. This study found that CS repositions nucleosomes, the building blocks of chromatin, in an ATP-dependent manner and that is enhanced by N1-like histone chaperone, a new partner of CS. By analyzing CS domains and derivatives, researchers showed that chromatin reorganization by CS and N1-like chaper is necessary for efficient transcription-cou DNA repair. They also found that chrom reorganization and protein recruitment by CS are separate activities. This collaboration between CS and N1-like chaper adds to understanding of how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaper regulate chrom structure. The study reveals that histone chaper can work with ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers to increase efficiency of nucleosome repositioning. It remains to be seen if CS and N1 chaper cooperate in nucleosome assembly/disassembly during normal and transcription-c DNA repair.
Researchers have created a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome by studying DNA methylation patterns in five human cell types. They found clusters of CpG sites with high inter-individual variation, called Variably Methyl Regions (VM), which occur at enhancers and 3' untranslated regions. Most VM have high heritability, but a subset show low herit and form co-regulated networks specific to each cell type. These networks are enriched for transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. For example, in T cells, a network of 95 co-regulated VMs is involved in T-cell activation, while in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-reg VMs controls growth, and in neurons, a network of 18 VMs is involved in synaptic signaling. The researchers also showed that some VM networks are responsive to environment, with methylation levels changing in response to growth conditions. These environmentally-responsive VMs are enriched for imprinted loci, suggesting they are sensitive to environmental conditions. The study provides a map of epigenetic variation, showing both genetic and environmental factors contribute to this variation.
Researchers have developed a new rapid test for diagnosing dengue, called the Panbio Dengue Early, which detects the virus's non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen. This protein is present in the early stages of infection, typically within 1-9 days after symptoms appear. The test was evaluated in two studies in Vietnam and Malaysia with 198 and 263 laboratory-confirmed samples. The test's sensitivity and specificity were 69.2% and 96% respectively in Vietnam, and 68.9 and 96.7% in Malaysia. When combined with a commercial IgM/Ig rapid test, the sensitivity increased to 93%. The study shows that using NS antigen detection with antibody tests can significantly improve deng diagnosis and extend the detection window to early stages. 

The Panbio Deng Early test is sensitive and specific for NS. When combined with Ig/Ig rapid, sensitivity for acute deng increased with an extended detection window. This translated to good performance in a clinical setting with sensitivity and specificity comparable to other NS rapid tests in the same region. Optimal sensitivity for acute deng was achieved with NS testing and Ig and Ig detection, increasing sensitivity compared to individual markers.
Researchers have developed a new computational method called Transat to predict the conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-kn, and alternative configurations. Traditional RNA prediction methods assume a unique functional structure and don't account for features required for folding in vivo. To understand how RNA structures form in vivo, a reliable and sophisticated method is needed. Currently, few experimentally validated structures exist, and computational methods make simplifying assumptions. Transat detects conserved helices of high statistical significance and predicts features of known structures, including pseudo-kotted and alternative configurations. It also identifies unstructured subsequences bound by molecules and provides evidence for new helices that define folding pathways, supporting that homologous sequences fold similarly. Unlike existing methods, Trans works in a comparative way, highlighting conserved features and not requiring cellular environment knowledge. 

The co-transcription folding differs from re-folding in terms of time and structure, and computational methods take kinetics into account. However, experimental methods await testing in vivo to study RNA folding. Trans is a conceptually new approach for studying folding in vivo, not surprising given errors in early stages are magnified as folding progresses. Precise knowledge of transcription site is crucial, and existing methods evaluated on small data. Trans predicts novel helices of statistical significance, corresponding to conserved features of co-transcription folding, supporting homolog sequences fold similarly.
Plants have a complex network that helps them fight off harmful microbes. This network must work well even when some of its parts are damaged by pathogens. The network's ability to do this is called "buffering". Buffering relies on interactions within the network, but studying these interactions is hard using genetics alone. Researchers used a strategy to break down and rebuild the plant's immune network to understand how it responds to a specific threat, flagellin-22 (fl22). They found many interactions among sub-networks, or "sectors", in the fl22 response. Some of these interactions are buffering. The study shows how jasmon (JA), ethylene (ET), phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD), and salicylate (SA) signaling control the response to fl22. These mechanisms can't be detected by looking at one gene at a time. Like pathogen attacks, disabling one part of the network can be buffered by the rest. The plant's immune network is made of four sub-networks: salicylate, jasmon, ethylene, and phyalex-deficient 4. These sub-networks, or "sectors", are key to plant immunity because they respond to fl22 and are resilient to pathogen attacks. Researchers used a systems approach to understand the plant's immune network. They found that looking at sectors and transcription together helps understand the network's regulation. This approach is useful for complex networks like the plant's immune system, which is resilient to disruptions. Plants without adaptive immunity, a buffered network helps against pathogen attacks, which disable immune proteins. Buffering hides the network's components: when one part is disabled, the network compensates for the loss.
In the fruit fly Drosoph, the nervous system develops from a single-layered neuroepithelial sheets through a process called patterning, which subdivides the uniform epithelia into domains to increase neuronal diversity in a controlled spatial and temporal manner. The embryonic neuroepith patterning of the optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primord, consisting of two photoreceptor (PR) types: primary and secondary, as well as the opticlobe primord, which develops into prominent ganglia during larval and pupal stages. Researchers have identified a genetic network that regulates the balance between lar eye and optic precursors, as well as primary and secondary precursors. The proneural factor Aton (A) specifies lar eye precursors, while the nuclear receptor Tailless (T) is crucial for opticobe specification. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of A and T to coordinate precursor specification in a timely manner. The spatial placement of the boundary between A and T controls the number of primary and secondary precursors. Notch signaling also controls a cell fate decision, acting in a cascade of transcription interactions to define PR identity.
Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD1) is a widely expressed antimicrobial peptide that has distinct activities in its oxidized and reduced forms. Researchers explored its mechanisms of action and found that the reduced form creates a net-like structure around bacteria, trapping them, while the oxidized form does not. This mechanism is independent of bacterial killing and can prevent migration of resistant pathogens. The reduced form is stable in human duodenal secretions with high levels of proteases, unlike other antimicrobial peptides. Cysteins are necessary for net formation. This redox-dependent action differs from other defensins like human-defin 6. The reduced form provides additional protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular structures, preventing invasion. Understanding endogenous peptides' modes of action can lead to new antimicrobial strategies.
Researchers have found that a protein called OCRL is essential for a process called endocytosis in the zebraf pronephric tub, a model of the mammalian kidney tubule. Endocyt is the process by which cells take in substances from outside the body fluids. In Lowe syndrome and Dent disease, caused by OCRL mutations, patients have low levels of protein in their urine. The study shows that OCRL deficiency causes endoc defect in zraf pronephric tub, with reduced levels of a receptor called megal and accumulation in endytic compartments. Early endytic compartments and vacuolar endosomes are also reduced in sub-apical proneph cells. Cell polarity in proneph tub is unaffected in mutant embryos. OCRL-deficient embryos have mild ciliogenesis, but this does not explain endoc defect. Catalytic activity of OCRL is required for tubular endocyt and endoc defect can be rescued by suppression of PIPK. Results indicate OCRL is required for endytic in vivo and support hypothesis that endytic defects cause renalulopathy in Lowe and Dent disease. PIPK is a potential target for Lowe and Dent disease treatment.
Researchers conducted a study in the Kilbero Valley in Tanzania to investigate the transmission of Rift Valley Fever (RV) in livestock during non-outbreak periods. They found that 11.3% of cattle and sheep tested positive for RV antibodies, with a higher prevalence in animals born after the 2007 outbreak and those present during the outbreak. The study also found that animals living over 15km from the floodplain were more likely to have antibodies than those living less than 5km away. No association was found between seropositivity and species, breed, herd composition, or grazing practices. The study indicates post-outbreak transmission of RV in the area, with a linear increase in seroprevalence in post-epid cohorts suggesting constant exposure and active transmission before the survey.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, has a contractile vacuole complex (CVC) to regulate its osmolarity, despite being an obligate intracellular pathogen. Researchers used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to study the role of VC in trafficking glycosphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane of the parasite and host. They found that T. cruzi Rab11 (GFP-TR11) localized to the VC, while a dominant negative mutant (DN) tagged with GFP (FPTRDN) localized to the cytosol, and epimastotes expressing this mutant were less responsive to hyposotic and hypermotic stress. Mutants were still able to differentiate into metacylic forms and infect cells. GPI-anch transialase (TTS), mucins of 60-200K family, and trypastigote surface antigen (TSA II) co-localized with FPTR to VC during intramastigotes to trypastigotes. Muc of gp/50 family co-localized VC during metacgenesis. Parasites expressing FPTRDN prevented TS, but not other proteins, from reaching plasma, and were less infective compared to wild type. Incubation mutants with exogenous recombinant active, but inactive TS, and sialic acid, before infecting cells, partially rescued infectivity trypastigotes. Results reveal roles TR in osmoregulation and trafficking transialase to plasma, transialase in infection, and novel GPIanch protein secretion mechanism.
Researchers conducted a phase III clinical trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of a shortened rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen using a purified chick-embryo rabies vaccine (PCV) administered intradermally for 4 times in 1 week, versus the standard 2-site intradermal regimen. The study included 443 participants aged 1 year and older, who were randomly assigned to receive PCV with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HR) at the first visit. The primary objective was to assess the percentage of participants with rabies neutralizing antibody (RV) concentrations 0.5 IU/mL at day 49. The results showed that the 4-site/1 regimen was noninferior to the 2-site regimen, with a difference of 1% in the percentage of participants with adequate RV concentrations. By day 14, all participants achieved adequate RV concentrations. At day 49, RV concentrations were lower in those with HR administration compared to those without. Both regimens had similar safety profiles, with no vaccination-related serious events. The study suggests the 4/1 regimen could be an alternative to current recommendations, offering improved efficiency and compliance.
Researchers have studied the brain's ability to detect and respond to important events, focusing on the salience network (SN), which includes the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex. They used high-resolution MRI data from the Human Connectome Project and graph theory to investigate the dynamic organization of the SN. The study found that the SN is highly flexible and interacts with other brain networks, such as the frontoparietal, cingulateopular, and ventral dorsal attention networks. It also has the most varied interactions in the brain and is a central hub for cross-network interactions. The SN's connectivity is distinct from other control systems and its flexibility predicts individual differences in cognitive abilities. These results were confirmed in a second dataset, showing the findings are robust. The study provides new insights into the SN's dynamic architecture and how it facilitates interactions with multiple systems to support various cognitive processes in the brain.
Researchers have identified a protein called VP4 from the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) that plays a crucial role in the release of the virus from host cells. SV40 is a non-enveloped virus, meaning it does not have a lipid envelope, and is released from the cell through a process that is not well understood. The virus assembles in the nucleus and must be released without a host cell membrane. The study found that VP4 is expressed at late in the viral cycle, around the time of cell lysis, and investigated its role in release. They expressed and purified VP as a fusion protein from bacteria and found it efficiently binds and disrupts membranes. The hydrophobic domain of VP is essential for binding and disruption. It prefers membranes with lipid composition similar to plasma and not nuclear membranes. Phosphatylethanol, a lipid found in bacterial membranes, inhibits VP's activity. Disruption of membranes by VP forms pores of ∼3 nm in diameter in mammalian cells, including SV host cells. These results suggest VP acts as a viropin, perforating membranes to trigger viral release.
Researchers have developed a DNA vaccine that protects against deng, a serious disease spread in tropical and subtropical areas, by using a protein called NS1. The vaccine, called pcANS, was tested in mice and shown to be effective against the virus. To understand how it works, the researchers looked at the immune response it triggered in the mice. They found that the vaccine induced both antibodies and T cells that fight the virus. The antibodies alone provided some protection, but the combination of both was needed for full protection. The T cells, specifically CD4, played a crucial role in the protection, as removing them from the mice eliminated the vaccine's effect. Experiments showed that transferring CD cells from vaccinated mice to others, along with antibodies, gave the same protection as the vaccine itself. This suggests that the vaccine's protection relies on cooperation between CD4 cells and antibodies. The study provides new insights into how the immune system fights deng and may lead to a vaccine development.
Researchers have studied how the cell-to-cell communication system in Gram-positive bacteria, specifically in Streptococcus, which relies on extracellular peptides to trigger responses. They focused on the RNPP family of proteins, which regulate important processes like sporulation, conjugation, and virulence, and are considered targets for new antibacterial agents. The study elucidated the structure-function of ComR, a new member of the RNPP family, which controls natural transformation in Streoc. Com is activated by binding to its pheromone X, the mature form of the ComS-inducing peptide. The crystal analysis of Com from Streptoccus thermus combined with mutational and in vivo assays proposed a molecular mechanism of Com regulation. X-binding releases the sequestered HTH domain and allows Com dimerization to DNA binding. This mechanism is conserved and specific to Com orthologs, showing Com is not an R protein but a new member of RNPP. Identifying X and Com residues for activation is crucial for designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges in Streoc.
Researchers have identified the first ligands that activate the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel EL, a type of neurotransmitter receptor found in animals. These ligands, including the neurotransmitter GABA, bind to a conserved site on the protein and cause the channel to open, allowing ions to pass through. The channel's properties are similar to those of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a well-studied neurotransmitter receptor. The researchers used electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography to study the channel's behavior and structure. They found that the ligands cause the channel to desitize, or slow down, over time. The channel is selective for cations, or positively charged ions, and impermeable to anions, or negatively charged ions. This makes EL an attractive model to study the mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this family of receptors. The researchers used a library of molecules to find the ligands, located one in a crystal structure, and characterized the channel's properties.
Researchers have identified a key factor that contributes to the development of asthma in individuals with a history of eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD). They found that mice with skin-barrier defects develop AD-like inflammation and are susceptible to asthma. A protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSL) expressed by skin cells is the driver of bronial hyperresponsiveness. Mice with keratin-specific deletion of RBP, which have high levels of TSL, develop a severe asthm phenotype when exposed to allergens. Eliminating TSL signaling blocks the atopic march, showing high TSL levels sensitize the lung to inflammation. Mice with high TSL without skin pathology also develop asthma. Importantly, epidermal T is sufficient to trigger the atopic, sensitizing lung inhaled allergens without epicutaneous sensitization. The study suggests treating skin-bar defects and inhibiting TSL may prevent asthma in AD patients.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze multiple types of biological data, including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, to better understand the organization of the genome of a microbe called Thermotoga marima. This microbe lives in extremely hot environments and is very different from other bacteria. The analysis showed that its genome has many genes per unit (3.3), few non-coding RNAs (12), and few units with multiple start sites (3.7%). Promoters and ribosome sites are highly conserved compared to other bacteria. Transcription regulation is limited by lack of space between genes for most units. Many genes are expressed regardless of growth state and a strong link between mRNA and protein is observed. These features are thought to be due to its extreme heat-loving lifestyle and may provide insights into life on Earth's evolution.

The study used a combination of data and bioinformatics tools to improve gene annotation, transcription units, non-coding RNAs, promoters, and ribosome sites in the genome. This method can be applied to other microbes. For Thermoga marima, distinctive characteristics were found and their causes discussed. Genome-scale analysis showed conserved promoter architecture for transcription initiation. The approach enables experimental annotation of bacterial features including protein-coding genes, functional RNAs, nonoding RNAs, units, promoters, ribosome sites, and regulatory sites. Thermoga marima's genome was analyzed to improve annotation, median distance for coding sequences 100 from start and minimum 30 upstream of start. Ribosome binding energies across organisms were calculated using a dictionary. Optimal temperatures for non-thermophilic bacteria were collected and protein annotation for each bacterium from NCBI.

Translational evidence supports high expression of Thermoga marima in proteomic data. Each condition, evidence for 74% of annotated proteins was found. Also, mRNA and protein abundances are tightly linked (r=0.63, p<2.2×10-16-test). This correlation is stronger and significant than other bacteria.
Researchers investigated how visual perception is influenced by contextual information in the brain. They showed that observers are more likely to perceive a target, such as a bar, when the context is weak rather than strong. This is because the context can "fill in" the target, making it seem more likely to be present. However, when the context is high-contrast, it suppresses the perception of the target, making it seem less likely to be present. A Bayesian model of visual inference explains these findings, suggesting that context influences perception in two ways: by biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present based on grouping principles and by biasing their internal model of likely contrasts caused by a bar. This implies that areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for visual inferences. The study used simple visual stimuli to investigate how context affects perception of visual inputs, specifically the presence or absence of a bar at a location with low or zero contrast, in the context of other bars. The filling bias is stronger when contextual bars have weaker contrasts and the target is seen as likely to group with context as a line. A Bayesian model accounts for these findings, which differ from previous facilitation of input sensitivities, by assessing whether target or noise is cause of luminance at target location in image. The study reveals how bias depends on contextual contrast and shows no facilitation or suppression of contrast in visual inference. The model's parameters reflect brain's internal model of world and encoding.
Researchers have found that the presence of "defectors" in a population can sometimes lead to the survival of cooperation. Defectors are individuals that consume a common good without contributing to its production, which can lead to the depletion of the good and collapse of cooperation. However, in a structured population with small size, defectors can create conditions that rescue cooperation. This is because small size increases variability in cooperator frequency across locations, allowing cooperators to outgrow defectors globally despite defectors outgrowing cooperators in each location.

The study used an individual-based model to demonstrate three mechanisms by which defectors can lead to conditions that rescue cooperation. First, during def-induced population collapse, defectors go extinct before cooperators by chance, allowing cooperators to grow. Second, empty locations created by def-induced extinction favor cooperation as they allow cooperator but not def migrants to grow. This leads to the counterintuitive result that initial defectors allow better survival of cooperation compared to when def are absent. Third, resource limitation induced by def selects for mutants adapted to limitation, which can further favor cooperation.

In a structured population, small sizes caused by def provide a "built-in" mechanism for persistence of cooperation. Defectors increase heterogeneity in population dynamics, reducing simultaneous extinction of all populations. Selection for mutants adapted to limitation introduces another bottleneck, facilitating survival when def are present. Rapid growth of cooperators in def-free locations rescues cooperation, not observed in deterministic models predicting synchronous extinction.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, poses a significant challenge to the mucosal barrier, particularly in patients with altered epithelial barriers. Research has shown that P. aerugin interacts with polarized epithelium, adhering almost exclusively at multicellular junctions, where it attaches to extruded apoptotic or apoptotic cells. This dead tropism is independent of cell type, as P. aerugin also binds necrotic cells. The bacteria are internalized through efferosis, a process where epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells intracellularly, along with apoptotic debris, P. aerugin inhabits an eocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features and is killed. The study proposes elimination of P. aerugin through eosis as a host defense mechanism. In healthy individuals, apoptotic cells are quickly removed, but in contexts favoring dead cells, P aerugin colonization is possible. The study highlights epithelial ability to eliminate P aerugin through eosis, suggesting it as part of a defense.
During embryonic development in Drosophila, the gonad is formed from two types of cells: Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and Somatic Gonadal Precursor (SG) cells. PGs form at the posterior of the blastoderm stage and are carried inside the embryo during gastrulation. To reach SGs, PGs must traverse the midgut and migrate through the meserm. A combination of repulsive and attractive signals from SGs guide migration. The hedgehog (hh) pathway, specifically the shifted (sh) gene, plays a crucial role in directing PG migration. sh encodes a secreted protein that facilitates long-distance transmission of H through the proteogly matrix after released from basolateral membranes of H-expressing cells in the wing disc. sh is expressed in the gonadal meserm, and loss and gain-of-function experiments show it is required for PG migration. The hmg-dependent isopoid biosynthetic pathway generates the PG attractant by SGs and other tissues when hmg is ectically expressed. Production of this attract depends on sh and another hh gene, g1. Ectopic expression of hmg in the nervous system promotes release of H from cells into the mesermal layer, where H contacts migrating PGs. Potentiation of H by hmg depends on cholesterol modification.
Researchers have been trying to develop an effective HIV vaccine for years, but understanding how the immune system fights the virus is key to success. One way the immune system fights HIV is through CD8 T-cells, a type of immune cell that kills infected cells. Long-term non-progressors, people with HIV, have strong CD8 T-cells that eliminate infected cells, while progressors do not. This study looked at CD8-cells in people vaccinated with a weakened adenovirus type 5 HIV vaccine and compared to those with HIV and long-term non-progressors. The vaccine recipients had CD8-cells that killed infected cells, but not as well as long-progressors. However, those with certain HLA class I alleles, B27, B57, or B58, associated with controlling HIV, had stronger CD8-cells. This suggests these alleles may lead to better outcomes in both infection and immunization due to more efficient CD8-cell priming.
Researchers have found that the ability to share intentions, or work together towards a common goal, played a crucial role in the evolution of humans' unique cognitive abilities. They modeled the co-evolution of intentional behavior and culture, showing that rapid technological advancements go hand-in-hand with the ability to participate in joint behavior. Without opportunities for significant technological improvement, the ability to work together is selected against. This provides a mechanism for the emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a reason for species diversity in prevalence of such behavior.

The development of modern human cognition is thought to have been catalyzed by collaborative behavior among early humans compared to great apes. This is known as the shared intention hypothesis or Vygotskian intelligence. Emergence of intentions at time of technological advance is consistent with tool manufacture evolving around 300,000 years ago with language, which facilitates joint behavior. This aligns with the cultural hypothesis that learned culture affects evolution of traits.

The paper formally models the evolution of joint behavior, although previous work makes steps in this direction. Sharing intentions affects strategies chosen, not how they are chosen, and the latter depends on circumstances. The emergence of joint behavior is open, but environment with coordination problems is conducive. Individuals with ability to share intentions adjust strategy with neighbors for mutual benefit. The results show effects of joint behavior on technological convergence. The model links technology adoption to evolution of collaboration.
Researchers have identified two microRNAs, miR-34 and mi-449, that play a crucial role in male fertility by regulating sperm production. These microRNAs are highly expressed in post-meiotic germ cells, which are essential for sperm development. In humans, low levels of these microRNAs in sperm have been linked to reduced fertility. In a study, mice lacking mi-34 and mi-449 had low sperm count and abnormal motility, characteristics of oligoasthenatozoospermia, a common cause of male infertility. The loss of these microRN did not block spermatogenesis but impaired transitions, resulting in low sperm count and abnormal motility. Histological analysis showed thinning of seminiferous tubules and aberrant sperm morphology in mice lacking mi-34 and mi-449. Sperm were immotile and had abnormal morphology. The study shows mi-34 and mi-449 are essential for spermatogenesis, regulating meiosis and later stages of sperm development. The microRN fine-tune gene expression in pachene cells, which is critical for spermatogenesis. Deregulation of mi-34 and mi-449 leads to oligasthenatoospermia, a major cause of male infertility in humans.
Escherichia coli Nle 191 (Ec) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the determinants of its probiotic properties remain elusive. Ec produces two siderophore-microins (Mcc) responsible for antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteraceae. Ec also synthesizes genotoxin colactin, a virulence factor and putative pro-cinogenic compound. Researchers aimed to decouple antagonistic activity of Ec from genotoxicity. They found that p-encoded ClP, peptase that activates colact, is required for antagonistic activity of Ec. Analysis of ClP mutants revealed activity linked to transmembrane helices of ClP, not periplasm peptase domain, indicating transmembrane domain involved in M biosynthesis or secretion. Amino acid substitution in ClP inactivates genotoxic but maintains antagon activity. In vivo salmonelis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to wild strain, while ClP deletion neither protected nor outcompeted pathogen. ClP-dependent antibacterial effect observed in vitro with E coli strains carrying truncated M gene and p island. This interplay between colact, salochelin, and siderore biosynthetic pathways suggests genomic islands co-selected role in evolution Ec from phyroup 2.
Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that causes meningitis and kills hundreds of thousands annually, relies on glycans for survival and virulence. Glycans are made in the secretory pathway, but precursors are made in the cytos. Nucle sugar transporters solve this problem by exchanging nucleotides for nucleosides. The major virulence factor of C. neoans is its polysacchar capsule, which is also shed to impede the host response. Xylose, a monosacide absent in yeast, is a capsule component. We found two transporters, U1 and U2, specific for xylose donor UDPxy, with distinct localization and kinetic. Both also transport galactose UDPgalactose. U1 and U2 are necessary for xy incorporation into capsule and disease in mice, but not viability in infection. These findings provide a starting point for deciphering specificity of transporters, a pathway for therapy, and understanding glycobiology.

The donors enter the lum via nucleotide transporters, exchanging sugars for nucleides. These mediate a step in glycan synthesis and are required for cryptoccal viability and pathogenicity. We focused on glycan synthesis in C. neoans due to its biology and role in disease. Elucidating UDP-X transport expanded understanding of glycan synthesis, sequence, localization, and transporters as a family. We identified first UDP-X/UDP transporters and set stage for studies of mutant to elucidate cryptococcal pathogenesis and response.

Cryptoc glypholipids range from mannose modification to complex with galact and xylose. The cryptoc wall consists of glucans, chitin, chitos, and mannrote, many with GPI anchors. Glycans play structural and regulatory roles in survival and path. The major virulence of C. neo, polyschar, acts as a barrier against host and immune modulator when shed. Consists of glucuronoxomann and glucuronomangal. Glyans are critical for development, growth, and viability across life.
Researchers have created a global database to track and control neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which have been neglected for many years. The database, called the Global Neglected Tropical Diseases (GNT) database, provides access to location-specific data on Ds, allowing researchers and disease managers to target interventions and monitor progress. The database started with schistosiasis in Africa and now includes other diseases like soil-transmitted helminias and leishmaniasis. It has over 12,000 location-specific schos surveys from 35 African countries and is available online at http://www.gd.org. The database allows for disease modeling, control, surveillance, and monitoring, and statistical analysis of disease distribution in space and time. A focus on schosias in Africa, the researchers demonstrate that a global NT database is feasible and should be expanded.

The database was created by searching peer-reviewed journals and grey literature, and contacting health ministries and research institutions in schias-endemic countries for location-specific data. The data was extracted, geferenced, and stored in a MySQL database with a web interface for free access and management. The goal is to expand the database to include other NTDs like ascasis, hookworm, trichias, lymphatic filiasis, onchercis, and trach. The database currently covers Western, Eastern, and Southern African countries, with Northern countries in progress. It also includes information on soil-trans helminias from Latin and Asian countries. The researchers searched electronic databases like PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and African Online using specific terms to retrieve relevant publications on schos prevalence in Africa.
Researchers investigated whether chronic helminth infections exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) infection in cotton rats, a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomoides sigmodis and a model for human tuberculosis. They hypothesized that chronic helmin infections would suppress Th1 immunity, necessary for controlling MT, and worsen the disease course. However, the study found that chronic filarial infection did not increase MT burden or lung granuloma size in co-infected animals compared to MT-only infected animals. Immunological responses, histological, and mycobacterial cultures showed equivalent or reduced mycobacterial loads in coinfected animals. This suggests that filarial eradication programs may not facilitate MT control, but worm-derived therapies may be developed for autoimmune diseases without increasing infection risk.
Researchers have identified a protein called pp23, a member of the DEG/ENa family of ion channels, which plays a crucial role in the sensory system that controls courtship behavior in fruit flies. They found that pp23 is expressed in a specific type of sensory neurons called chemosensory bristles, which are different from those related to feeding. Disrupting pp23 or blocking its activity in these neurons did not affect feeding responses, but delayed and reduced male courtship behavior. Mutations in pp23 also changed how males respond to a female-specific pheromone, 7,11-D-heptadiene. This suggests that pp23 and its cells are important in the sensory system that determines sexual behavior in flies. The study indicates that DE/ENC channels contribute to functions related to sex behaviors and a new function for this family of channels. It is possible that pp23-expressing cells play a role in interactions between species, independent of sex.
Researchers studied the relationship between mitochondrial tRNA import and codon usage in the unicellular green alga Chlamdomonas. They found a correlation between codon usage and the amount of imported tRNAs, leading to the hypothesis that tRNA import might adapt to the mitochondrial genome. To test this, they modified the Chlamdomonas mitochondrial genome by changing cod usage. This resulted in reduced translation levels and respiratory complex activities, linked to limited tRNA pool in mitochondria. The study suggests tRNA import is not dynamic, but rather a co-evolved process between import mechanism and translation machinery. The fine-tuning between tRNA import and cod usage in Chdomonas appears to be a co-evolutionary process, not a dynamic adaptation of cytosolic tRNA into mitochondria. Future research should focus on tRNA machinery and import stages. The study shows tRNA import cannot rapidly adapt in Chdomonas and cod bias affects translation efficiency. The mitochondrial DNA information does not regulate tRNA import. Steady-state tRNA levels correlate with cod usage, suggesting imported tRN are defined by mitochondrial DNA for optimal translation. The Chdom mitochondrial genome can be manipulated, allowing cod usage modification.
Diabetes is a growing problem worldwide, affecting nearly 30 million people in the United States, or 10% of the population. Another 84 million are prediabetic, and up to 70% of them may develop type 2 diabetes. Current methods for measuring glucose regulation in diabetes and prediabetes rely on single-point measurements or average measures, neglecting glucose dynamics. Researchers used continuous glucose monitoring (CG) to evaluate how often individuals experience post-meal glucose elevations, types, and patterns, and how they vary between individuals given the same nutrient. They found that physiology underlying glucose regulation is highly variable between individuals. An analytical framework was developed to group individuals according to specific glycemic responses called "glucotypes" revealing heterogeneity within traditional categories. Importantly, individuals considered normoglyemic by standard measures exhibit high variability with CG, glucose reaching predabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of time, respectively. Glucose regulation, as measured by CG, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than thought and affects individuals considered normly by standard measures. Patterns of glyc responses reflect variable physiology. Interindividual variability in responses to meals highlights glucose regulation's personal nature. Through phenotyping, a model was built for identifying mechanisms of glucose regulation and a tool for visualizing user-uploaded profiles and classifying patterns into glucotypes.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called EDR1 plays a crucial role in regulating plant defense responses and cell death in plants. EDR interacts with two other proteins, MK4 and MK5, which are part of a signaling pathway that helps plants respond to threats. This interaction is important for fine-tuning plant immunity, or the ability to fight off infections. Without EDR, the pathway is overactive, leading to increased defense and cell death in plants. The study found that EDR physically interacts with MK4 and MK5, and this interaction is necessary for its function. EDR also reduces the levels of these proteins, which helps keep the pathway in check. Experiments showed that removing MK4 and MK5 makes plants more susceptible to disease, while overexpressing them makes them more resistant. This suggests that EDR's interaction with MK4 and MK is key to plant immunity.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework to predict the spread of infectious diseases, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, using Gaussian processes. This framework can help policymakers make informed decisions to control and prevent the spread of diseases. The framework combines spatial and temporal data to make accurate predictions. It outperformed two standard machine learning algorithms, random forests and boosted trees, in temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal predictions. 

The framework uses Gaussian processes to capture complex dependencies and make reliable predictions. It combines spatial and temporal data into a larger matrix to train a regression model. The model can predict cases in different scenarios: temporal, spatial, and spatiemporal. The researchers tested the framework on Turkey's data of Crimean-Congoagic fever, a disease with a 5-40% fatality rate in Africa, Balkans, Middle East, and Asia. The framework showed potential to contribute to public health policy.

The framework uses Gaussian processes to identify nonlinear dependencies and make predictions. It combines spatial and temporal data into a matrix to train a regression model. The model can predict cases in three scenarios: temporal, spatial, and spatiemp. The researchers tested the framework on Turkey's data of Crime-Congo fever, a disease with a 5-40 fatality rate in Africa, Balk, Middle, and Asia. The framework showed potential to contribute to health policy.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the impact of seasonal and socioeconomic factors on the transmission of Rift Valley Fever (RV) in Africa and the Middle East. RV is a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes significant human deaths and economic losses due to outbreaks among livestock. The model shows that in Northeast Africa, human activities such as the Eid al-Adha festival and climate factors like rainfall and hydrological variations contribute to the disease transmission and spread. Outbreaks may occur when livestock are brought into areas at risk for the festival and mosquitoes are abundant. These factors affect the severity of outbreaks. The model simulates disease dynamics over short and long periods, particularly during the festival time. It also investigates the impact of festival and seasonal factors on disease outbreaks, such as number of livestock imported, transportation speed, and death from sacrifices. When the festival starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive outbreaks increases, especially in the location of the ceremony. The model does not consider humans directly, but human activities like livestock import and transportation affect disease patterns. Temporal superposition of factors can be predicted in advance. Implementing vaccination and other interventions can change outbreak patterns. The model can be extended to consider disease in hosts and vectors, and import of RVV during latency. Due to lack of data, mosquito baseline values are unknown. The study aims to evaluate seasonal and festival impacts on RVF and dispersal. An outbreak in 2010 was attributed to camels in Mauritania and heavy rainfall.
Researchers studied the occurrence of human anthrax in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010. They analyzed data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human cases during the Soviet and post-Sov governance periods. The study found a significant increase in anthrax cases from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline after the introduction of livestock vaccination in 1996. The distribution of cases shifted from the west to the east over the 20-year period after the Soviet Union's dissolution. Despite a decrease in incidence, continued control measures are needed to prevent the disease. The study highlights the need for an integrated "One Health" approach that considers the changing geographic distribution of the disease.

The study found two patterns: an increase in anthrax during Soviet governance through the mid-1990s, followed by a decline in cases after vaccination and a shift in disease distribution eastward. There was a geographic shift in reporting that required dynamic strategies. The study aimed to analyze and describe human anthrax in Azerbaijan to identify spatial and temporal changes in the disease. It aimed to understand the occurrence, identify areas to control, and aid management.

Incidence of cutaneous anthrax was concentrated in the west and south early, then shifted east towards Baku in the mid-1990s. It remained in eastern and northern Azerbaijan during vaccination. In 1996, a series of outbreaks led to over 400 animal and 70 human cases, prompting a comprehensive vaccination program. Anthrax has re-emerged in the Caucasus, raising concerns over potential spread.

The study found spatial and temporal changes in anth in Azerbaijan over 27 years, consistent with previous research on zoonotic diseases after the Soviet dissolution.
Researchers have studied how polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) interact with the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel, a protein that controls potassium ion flow across cell membranes. PUFAs can make the channel open by changing its sensitivity to voltage, which may help treat epilepsy through a ketogenic diet. While PUFs have been shown to influence the channel's mechanism by interacting with its voltage-sensing domain, the exact interactions are unclear. Using computer simulations, the researchers found a possible PUA binding site on the open channel at the protein-lip interface near the extracellular parts of the S3 and S helices of the voltage-s domain. The fatty tail of the PUA interacts with the protein's hydrophobic core, while the head interacts with charged residues on the S and S helices. Comparing with saturated fatty acids, the study found PUF tails are more flexible, which may explain their specific action on the channel. PUFs are essential in cell membranes and neurons and have been shown to shift the Shaker channel's voltage dependence. The channel's structure consists of six transmembrane helices, with the first four making the voltage domain and the last two the ion-conducting pore. PUFs have been studied on various voltageated channels, but their mechanism unclear. The PUA molecule has a carboxyl head and lipic tail with double bonds. Direct PUA interactions have been observed on other channels, often through indirect lipid effects. PUF have been shown to modulate Shaker by partitioning into the bilayer and interacting with the voltage domain's S and S helices.
Researchers have developed a new pipeline to screen for anti-parasitic agents targeting Cryptosporidium parv's inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). This parasite causes significant disease in children in developing countries and can lead to life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. Current drugs are not effective in treating severe cases. The pipeline uses a genetically engineered Toxoplas gondii parasite as a model for C. parv infection. This allows for target validation and a large window not possible in C. par assays. A fluorescence-based host proliferation and C. par growth assays were also developed for high-throughput analysis. The pipeline was used to evaluate C. parIMPDH inhibitors and identified 1,2,3-triazole ethers with excellent selectivity in T. gondi and anti-cryptporid activity. 

A pipeline was created to evaluate anti-cryptid activity in tissue models. T. gond was engineered to mirror C. par purine pathway and depend on C parIMH for survival. This provides rapid assessment and target specificity. A host growth assay was devised using H-8 expressing yellow protein. A high-content assay measured C parum proliferation. Assays probed structure-activity for CpPD inhibitors. The main challenge is lack of suitable models to assess candidates. A pipeline was developed to evaluate antip activity. T. gii parasite mirrors C parine pathways and depends on C parH. A T. gii reporter was constructed that mirrors C par metabolism. T. gii lacks salvage xine and guanine via HGP like C par. par. CpH was introduced under T. g promoter. T. gii does not negate testing C directly but is indispensable to narrow candidates. Two candidates were identified: A103 and A110. These are 100x more potent than paromycin, the standard.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic factors influencing tooth development in infancy. They analyzed data from 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Birth Cohort and 1,518 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The study identified five genetic loci associated with tooth eruption time and number at one year of age. These loci included genes linked to tooth and organ development, such as KCNJ, HOXB, RADL, IGF1, HMGA, and MSRB. Four of the identified genes are also implicated in cancer development. A variant in the HO gene was associated with orthodontic treatment by age 31.

The study found that genes at these loci have roles in organogenesis, growth, and developmental processes, and cancer. Mutations in three genes lead to altered organ development, including teeth, jaws, palates, ears, fingers, toes, teeth, hair, sweat, salivary glands, and intestines. The study suggests genetic determinants of early tooth eruption may associate with dental occlusion later in life. The research provides insight into the genetic architecture of primary dentition and has implications for studying developmental and organogenic processes.
Researchers created two new mouse models, TsY and MsY, to study the effects of trisomy and monomy of the Hspa-App region on chromosome 21, which causes Down syndrome. This region is the most common human aneuploidy and leads to intellectual disability, locomotor deficits, and altered muscle tone. The study found that trisomy and monomy of this region alter locomotion, muscle strength, and balance. Gene expression in skeletal muscles showed changes in metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Genes were downregulated in TsY mice and upregulated in MsY. Shift in muscle metabolism correlated with change in mitochondrial proliferation without altering function. However, reactive oxygen species production from complex I decreased in MsY mice, while membrane permeability of TsY mitochondria increased. The Hspa-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles due to change in Gab, N1, and A5. Results indicate copy variation in this region impacts locomotor by altering muscle function.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model of the GIRK1 channel, a type of potassium channel that regulates heartbeat and neuronal excitability, to understand how its basal and evoked activities are controlled. They found that the extent of activation by neurotransmitter activation is inversely related to basal activity. The model accurately recapitulates basal and evoked currents in Xenopus oocytes, HEK cells, and hippocampal neurons, and predicts dose-dependent activation of GIR1 by coexpressed Gγ and accounts for the inverse basal-evoked correlation. The model indicates that 3-4 Gγ dimers are available for each GIR1 channel, while Gα decreases from 2 to less than 1 per channel as GIR1 density increases. The persistent Gγ/channel ratio suggests a strong association of GIR1 with Gγ, consistent with recruitment to the surface of Gγ but not α by GIR1. The analysis suggests a stoichiometry of 4γ but 2α per GIR1 channel. The unequal association of GIR1 with protein subunits and cooperative gating by Gγ underlie the pattern of basal and agon-evoked activities, allowing GIR1 to act as a bidirectional detector of Gγ and α.
Researchers have developed a new model, called PredTA, to predict where a type of protein called TALE (transcription activator-like effector) binds to DNA in plant cells. TALEs are secreted by a type of bacteria called Xanthomonas and help the bacteria infect plants by turning on specific genes. TALEs have a unique structure with repeating parts that bind to DNA. The new model, PredTA, takes into account recent findings that TALEs can bind to DNA in different ways, such as with varying lengths and orientations. It also considers how different parts of the repeating structure interact with each other. The model was trained on a large amount of data and tested on RNA-seq data from Xanthas infecting rice. It performed better than previous methods and predicted new potential targets. However, some TALEs were not predicted by any tool, called orphan TALEs. The researchers think this might be due to incomplete gene annotations and suggest looking at the whole genome for target boxes. They found known targets from whole-genome scans can be found with genome-wide scans and RNA-seq data. This can detect new targets not in existing annotations. The model was tested on five Xanthas species and host plants with known virulence and found known targets ranked high in PredTA predictions. It predicted new targets, some of which are promising for further study. RNA-seq data supports these are activated by TALE in plants, but their role in infection needs investigation.
Researchers have identified 24,189 possible non-synonymous amino acid changes in human mitochondrial DNA, but only a small subset has been functionally evaluated, while the majority's pathogenicity was assessed in-sil by software. These tools proved incongruent, so a new machine-learning algorithm, APOEE, was designed to estimate harmfulness of mitochondrial non-syn genome. APOEE outperforms existing methods in predicting pathogenicity. The algorithm was built on 864 known variants, randomly drawn with replacement, and tested on unseen variants. Performance metrics were calculated and compared to individual predictors (Table 1). Amino acid frequencies and mean Z-scores were computed for all 24,189 non-syn changes and made available as a file. Variants were grouped for training and testing, used to build and verify AEE. Predictions from other tools were fed into AEE (Pathogenic Prediction through logistic Model). AEE's logic is based on Logistic Tree Model, chosen for transparency, reproducibility, and easy-to-understand results. It uses three milestones: third-party features related to 13 mitochondrial proteins, multi-alignments, and amino conservation; reasoning on curated, non-overlapping sets; decision tree learning for investigable rules. Assessing pathogenicity is challenging in-vitro, inivo, and uniable due to paucity of facilities, especially in mitochondrial DNA, smaller than nuclear.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection, the most common mosquito-transmitted viral infection, causes a range of diseases from self-limiting deng fever to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever syndrome. Thrombocytopenia, a major observed in both mild and severe deng disease, is correlated with deng severity progression. Previous studies showed DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), secreted into patients' blood, stimulates immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and causes endothelial leakage. This study demonstrates DENV, but not Zika virus culture supernatant, induces P-selectin expression and phosphatylser (PS) in human platelets, abolished when NS is depleted from D supernant. Recombinant NS from four D serotypes induces similar effects, blocked by anti-NS F(ab)2, anti-TL4 antibody, TLR antagonist (Rhobacteroid lipopolyscharide, LPS), and TLR inhibitor (AK242), but not polymyxin (LPS inhibitor). Activation by DNS promotes adenos diphosphate (ADP)-induced plate aggregation and adhesion to endothelial and phagocyt by macrophages. D-induced thromocytia and hemorrhage are attenuated in TLR knockout and wild-type mice when NS is depleted from D supernant.
Researchers analyzed the complex systems that control blood pressure and blood volume in the body. They focused on three key players: arginine vasopressin (AV), atrial natriuretic peptide (AN), and renin-angiotin-aldosterone (RA) systems. These systems work together to regulate blood pressure and volume through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. The researchers found that the AV-AN-RA system has two mechanisms that do the same job: one for pressure and one for volume. Both are negative feedback loops that can be stable or unstable. They also looked at a part of the system that includes AN and AV stimulation of smooth muscle cells, which is a negative loop with multiple feedback. This loop can be unstable if all feedback is delayed. The study shows how the body's long-term control of blood pressure and volume works through dynamic interactions between these systems. A model was built to show how these systems work together. It's a closed system with no start or end, showing how AV, AN, and RA interact through effects on smooth muscle, blood, and pressure. The analysis found that the body's long-term control of blood is made up of loops with a single point. The AV-AN-RA system was analyzed to show its loop and function. It can be split into two systems: one for pressure and one for volume. A part of this system was looked at, including AN and AV stimulation of smooth muscle, and how they interact. This system is a loop with negative feedback and can be unstable if feedback is delayed.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism that regulates thrombus growth, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They studied protein transport through fibrin, a component of thrombus, using experiments and simulations. Permeability and diffusivity were key factors in protein transport through fibrin network. In vivo studies in mice showed thrombi covered by fibrin, a "fibrin cap". Simulations, accounting for fibr's permeable structure, showed thrombin washed through fibr network, limiting platelet exposure to thrombin on throm surface. Fibr cap also restricted platelet approach to throm core, preventing activation and growth. Fibr cap prevents small thrombi from developing into life-threatening events in 60% of body vessels.

The study examined protein advection and diffusion to describe thrombin transport through fibrin. Computational and experimental analysis showed fibr network limits throm growth. Permeability and diffusivity determined protein transport through fibr network. Hemostatic activators, like thrombin, activate platelets and fibrin polymerization. Observations of fibr-covered throm and measurements led to a hemodynamic model studying fibr's effect on thrombin transport. Findings showed fibr cap and plate-rich clots don't block relevant molecules, but permeability affects protein transport. Results complement studies on throm development, emphasizing spatial factor distribution and activity in thrombogenesis.

Experiments on diffusion and fluidation with hemodynamic model revealed permeability and diffusivity affect protein transport inside throm. Fibr networks with physiologic fibrogen concentrations (0.5-4mg/mL) don't form diffusion barrier, restricting thrombin.
Researchers investigated how invariant natural killer T (iKT) cells control the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis. iKT cells are activated during infection, but their role in limiting bacterial growth was unclear. The study found that iKT activation, measured by CD25 upregulation and IFγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18 produced by infected macrophages. However, iKT control of M growth was CD1-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFγ. This showed that conventional activation markers did not correlate with iKT effector function during M infection. iKT control of M replication was also independent of TN and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. By separating cytokine-driven activation and CD1-restricted effector function, researchers discovered a novel iKT antimicrobial mediator: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMF). iKT produced GMF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1-dependent manner during M infection, and GMF was necessary and sufficient to control M growth. GMF is a new iKT antimicrobial effector function and may play a role in cell immunity against M.
Researchers studied how the fungus Candida albicans, a common inhabitant of the human gut, regulates its population size during colonization. They found that the EF1 gene, which encodes a transcription factor, is highly expressed during growth in the intestinal tract. Surprisingly, a mutant lacking EF1 colonized the intestinal tract more than wild-type organisms, while overexpressing EF1 reduced colonization in the intestinal and oral cavity of immunodeficient mice. When injected into the bloodstream, both strains caused lethal infections, but mutants attenuated in virulence showed normal colonization levels. Expression of several genes depends on EF1 in lab, but not in the intestinal tract. Results show EF1 regulates colonizing fungi, favoring commensalism over candidiasis. Different genes are required in different niches and pathways regulating expression differ from lab growth. 

EF1 is important for determining C. alb population size during colonization. Expression may affect interactions between C and intestinal cells, altering adherence or immune signaling. Reducing EF1 may reduce C infection, favoring commal over candidias. Despite importance in intestinal, EF did not affect virulence in disseminated or lab conditions. High EF1 attenuated colonization, deletion enhanced, showing EF1 regulates colonization level in murine tract. In oral, EF1 expression was low compared to intestinal. The organism has no environmental reservoir, so intestinal colonization is crucial for survival, and it has genes regulating this niche. EF1 was highly expressed in intestinal, but paradoxically associated with lower colonization.
Immunization with irradiated malaria sporozoites is the most effective way to protect against liver stages of malaria, but the reasons behind its success are not well understood. Researchers found that CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell, need to see the parasite antigen for a long time to develop a strong response. They used a vaccine candidate antigen, the circumsporozo protein, and found that it persists in the body for 8 weeks after immunization. This is surprising since irradiated sporites can't replicate and don't develop beyond early stages. The antigen was detected in lymphoid organs and depends on the presence of CD11+ cells. Prolong antigen presentation enhanced CD8 T response in several ways. Firstly, reducing time primed CD8 cells were exposed to antigen in vivo reduced final memory population size. Secondly, fully developed cells in immunized mice but not in naïve animals. Finally, persisting antigen primed naïve cells, including thymic emigrants, to become effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in liver. These data show that optimal CD8 immunity against malaria liver stages depends on prolonged sporite antigen presentation.
Researchers have developed a new way to deliver a drug called polymyxin B to treat leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania amazonensis. The current treatments often require hospitalization and have side effects, and the parasite can become resistant to the drugs. The new method uses nanoparticles, tiny particles made of a polymer, to carry the drug. These nanoparticles, called PBCp, were made and tested to see if they could deliver the drug to infected cells and kill the parasite. The Pp had a size of 261.5 nanometers and were stable for 45 days. The drug was released slowly from the nanoparticles, which is good for a prolonged effect. In lab tests, the drug alone did not kill the parasite, but the nanoparticles with the drug did. The nanoparticles also had antibacterial properties, killing E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella. This is the first time a drug delivery system has shown both lemanial and antibacterial properties. The antibacterial feature can help prevent secondary infections that can occur with cutaneous leishiasis, which can cause disfiguring or disabling lesions.
A study in Brazil investigated the factors associated with death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Belo Horizont. The analysis was based on data from the Report Disease Information System-SAN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) from 2002-2009. The study found that weakness, Leishmaniasis-HIV co-infection, and age 60 or older were associated with a higher risk of death from VL in the first period. In the second period, bleeding, other infections, jaundice, and age 60 or older were also associated with increased risk of death. A prognostic score was developed using the variables from the latest SIN version of the study. The score's performance was evaluated with sensitivity 71.4%, specificity 73.7%, positive predictive values 28.9% and 94.5, and area under the operating curve 75.6. The study's findings agree with the Brazilian Ministry of Health that age, jaice, bleeding, and co-morbidities, including infections, are associated with death from VL. Leishiasis-H co-infection can worsen the condition in co-infected patients. The study highlights the importance of understanding factors associated with death from VL to improve patient management and lower mortality.
Researchers studied the regulatory receptor-like kinase B1 (RLK) BAK in plants, which plays a crucial role in hormone responses, immunity, and cell death. They found that a new version of BAK, called BAK-5, has different effects on signaling pathways. BAK-5 affects innate immunity mediated by FLS and EFR, but not hormone signaling or cell control. Unlike the kinase BRI, FLS and E have low activity and cannot phosphorylate BAK in vitro. BAK-5's kinase activity is necessary for its interaction with F and E in plants. The study shows that B-5 suppresses F and E-dependent signaling due to its kinase activity, not its interaction with the ligand receptor. The results demonstrate phosphorylation-dependent control of plant growth, immunity, and death by BAK, revealing differences in mechanisms of ligand-binding and non-kinase RK regulation. BAK's interaction with F and E is not due to phosphorylation, unlike BRI's requirement for kinase activity. BAK dictates downstream signaling specificity, as B-5 blocks F and E-mediated PTI signaling but barely affects BRI-mediated BR signaling. The importance of BAK in immunity is shown by the targeting of the B-FL2 interaction by a bacterial effector to block PT signaling. B's function in death and immunity is independent of its role in signaling. The study reveals differences in transphosphorylation between BAK and BRI or E in vitro and the need for kinase activity in planta.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how cancer cells respond to treatment using a combination of time-lapse cell microscopy and flow cytometry data. They created a computational model that shows how cells go through the cell cycle and subsequent generations after treatment. The model includes modules that describe the main pathways causing arrest, repair, and death in each phase. This approach allows for different types of modules to be applied in each phase and tested at a level justified by data. The method was tested with human ovarian cancer cells exposed to X-rays at various doses. A model was built that combined data from different platforms and doses, providing a complete in-silico rendering of the process after X-ray exposure. The model shows the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2 checkpoint activities in generations, reconciling known effects of ionizing radiation and providing new insights.

 The model considers the response to treatment in each cell phase and generation, not just the cycle. It simulates cycling by perturbing untreated cells with modules that can be applied to any phase. The method combines time-l live microscopy and flow cytometry data to render the process at the population level. Previous models were based on single-cycle, where cells re-entered the same cycle and mixed generations, and used data alone or with simplified descriptions. The new model gives a dynamic 72-hour rendering of cells through phases and generations for each dose. It enables studying mechanisms at the population level, accounting for inter-cell variability.
Researchers have found that a genetic mutation in the Pd2 gene, which is involved in the production of coenzyme Q, leads to kidney disease in mice. Coenzyme Q is a crucial for energy production in cells and its deficiency has been linked to various human diseases. The study used mice with a specific mutation in the P2 gene, called Pd2kd, and found that they developed kidney disease due to a defect in coenzyme production. The mice had lower levels of coenzyme 9 and co10 in their kidneys compared to normal mice. The disease started in kidney cells called podocytes, which filter waste from the blood. In contrast, mice with the same mutation in liver cells did not develop disease despite having low coenzyme levels. This suggests that kidney cells are more sensitive to co deficiency. The study also found that inflammation is not the cause of disease, but rather a response to damaged cells. Further research will investigate how co deficiency affects other tissues, such as the brain and muscles, which are affected in human disease. Coenzyme deficiency has been linked to mutations in several genes, including PD1, PD2, and CO2, and ETF, which transfer electrons to co. Nephrotic syndrome seen in humans with PD2 and CO2 mutations.
Researchers have discovered that certain developmental cell lineages in organisms, such as protostomes and deuterost, are resilient to cell death and division failures, which can be caused by environmental or genetic disturbances. This robustness is a key characteristic of life, but its underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins were unclear. The study found that the cellular composition of these organisms is only modestly affected by cell deaths due to several features of the lineages, including their shallowness, topology, early appearance of cells, and non-clonality of cell types. Simulations demonstrated that this robustness arose as an adaptation to random cell deaths during development. This reveals general principles of determinative developmental lineages and a new concept of phenotypic robustness, with implications for development and evolution. 

Phenotypic robustness is a crucial for life, but its mechanisms and origins are not well understood. The study showed that determinative developmental lineages are resistant to necrosis and cell program failure, representing environmental or genetic disturbances. Analysis of three lineages provides testable hypotheses on organizing principles of lineages and opens door to characterizing properties of complex line, an area with theoretical and applied values in evolution, development, and carcinogenesis. Findings reveal a new mechanism of phenotypic robust and its origin, different from previously studied mechanisms acting at subcell or cellular levels, lineage manifests at supracellular and unique to multicellular organisms. The study also explains contribution of ontogenesis to phenotyp robust, important for species with determinative development.
Researchers have developed an open-source, high-throughput platform called EmbryoPhomics to study the development of aquatic embryos. This platform consists of an Open Video Microscope (OpenIM) that captures high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under controlled conditions, and a Python package called Embryo Vision (EmbCV) that analyzes the videos to extract data on morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during embryonic development. The platform was tested on two species, the pond snail Radix bica and the marine amphipod Orchestia gammellus, to assess their responses to environmental changes in temperature and salinity. The results showed that EmbryoPhomics can capture and process data on functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest life stages of development, which is crucial for studying development and phenomics. The platform can analyze large numbers of embryos in various experimental conditions, from short to long-term exposures, and is versatile for different experimental designs. EmbryoCV extracted data from 95% of the acquired images, producing high-dimensional data on morphological, physiological, and behavioral responses. The platform can visualize short-term changes in physiology and behavior, such as heart rate and movement. Embryoomics can generate data on whole-organism responses at a scale and quality required for studying embryonic development, comparing to molecular technologies. The results showed high concordance between manual and EmbCV measures of spatial and temporal characteristics.
Malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium species, undergo significant changes in metabolism as they transition between their life stages in mosquitoes and human hosts. In the mosquito stage, they rely heavily on glycolytic metabolism, but in the blood stage, they switch to a dependence on tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism. Researchers used stable isotope labeling, metabolomics, and genetics to study Plasium berghei carbon metabolism and its impact on survival in blood and mosquito stages. They found that glutamine serves as a key input for T metabolism in both stages and is crucial for gametogenesis. Glutamine catabolism and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are also essential for ookin tooc transition in the mosquito. These findings provide new insights into Plmod metabolism and suggest potential targets for transmission-blocking strategies. They also highlight differences between Plmod species not anticipated by genomics or transcriptomics, emphasizing the importance of integrating metabolomics with other platforms for drug discovery.
Researchers have identified a common motif in biological signaling pathways that allows cells to distinguish between different types of signals, such as pulsatile and sustained signals. This motif, called an incoherent forward loop (ILF), consists of an input that activates an output and an inhibitor of the output. With specific parameters, this motif can adapt to a sustained input, making it insensitive to it. The researchers used modeling to examine another property of IFLs, their ability to process oscillatory signals. They found that the system's ability to translate pulsatile dynamics is limited by two constraints: the kinetics of the IFL components and a match between network and signal characteristics. The IFL can process oscillatory signals with increased amplitude or kinetic rates, but requires a match between network and signal characteristics for optimal counting. This mechanism is found in natural networks and has implications for designing synthetic circuits to process oscillatory signals. IFLs are found downstream of divergent signals in amoeba and mammalian cell differentiation, despite differences in dynamics. The researchers established constraints of input and network parameters for counting to occur. With proper parameters, IFL responds to transient but not sustained signals due to adaptation to sustained. The model can be used to identify natural decoding systems and understand network perturbations.
Researchers have developed improved methods for growing, purifying, and storing Orientia tsutsamushi, a bacterium that causes scrub typhus, a serious illness in Southeast Asia. This bacterium is difficult to study because it can only grow in mammalian cells and requires specific conditions. The team used mouse embryonic fibroblast cells to grow the bacterium and measured its growth with a specific PCR assay. They found conditions that improved viability and growth, and created a standardized method for purifying and storing the bacterium. This will help researchers studying O. tsutsam and other obligate intracellular pathogens like Ricketts and Chlamydia families. The bacter is a leading cause of CNS infections in Laos and miscarriage and poor neonatal rates in pregnancy. It's a member of the Ricketiaceae family but differs from Ricketia in genome, morphology, and phenotyp properties. The study aimed to develop an experimental toolkit for O. tsam research. A simplified assay was used to compare growth across conditions, useful for comparing antibiotic sensitivity of isolates. Growth was quantified by extracting DNA and measuring genome copy number with a specific primer/probe. This is a concern because culture can't be used for diagnosis and reduces isolates for research. The study improved methods for quantification, propagation, purification, and storage of O. tsam.
Researchers investigated the safety and effectiveness of the antiparasitic drug praziquel (PQ) in treating schistosomiasis in children aged 1-5 years. Currently, children in this age group are excluded from schistosom control programs due to lack of P data on Q's safety in this age. The study involved 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 who received P tablets and their caregivers reported side effects within 24 hours of treatment. Efficacy was determined 6 weeks later through schosom counts in urine. Compared to 6-10 year olds, pre-treatment S haobium infection in 1-5 olds was 14.6 eggs/10 ml and prevalence 21%. 3.8% of children reported side effects, including stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation. P treatment reduced schos levels in 1-5 olds by 99% and cured 92%, comparable to 6-10 olds 96 and 67%. P is safe and effective in 1-5 olds as in 6-10 olds, the drug of choice for schos control.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide screen in fruit flies (Drosophila) to identify genes that suppress cancer caused by mutations in the Ras protein, which is involved in about 30% of human cancers. They found multiple evolutionarily conserved pathways that control tumor growth and found human orthologs of these genes were downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, revealing new markers for cancer prognosis. Of the top 100 candidate suppressor genes, 80 were validated in secondary fly assays, including known and new genes that cooperate with Ras-driven cancer. Low expression of these genes correlated with poor prognosis and KRAS mutation in pancreatic cancer. The top hit, Tetrasin family member T29b, regulates EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrains tumor growth and invasion. The study uncovered novel conserved epithelial cancer genes and confirmed T29b as a key regulator of EGFR/Ras-induced tumor growth and invasion.
Researchers have identified a gene, wtf13, in the fungus Schizosaccharomyces pombe, that acts as a meiotic driver. Meiotic drivers are genes that increase their own transmission into offspring, but impose a cost on the rest of the genome. Wtf13 kills spores that don't inherit it by producing a poison and antidote. Another gene, wtf-2, arose in the lab and only makes the antidote. Wtf-2 doesn't prevent all spore destruction, but rescues those that inherit it, giving it a transmission advantage while dampening w13's drive. This is a new way for meiotic suppressors to work and sheds light on how drive systems evolve.

Four wtf genes were previously found to be meiotic drivers in different S. pombe isolates. They kill spores that don't inherit them, with most being w+. One, w4, causes drive by poison and antidote. The new study shows w13 is also a poison-antote driver and w-2 encodes a protein that suppresses w13 by mimicking its antidote. This suggests an ancestral w gene was both poison and antidote, and duplicates were selected for their ability to drive and protect.
Researchers have developed an algorithm that can predict gene expression levels in individuals based on their genetic information. The algorithm uses data from a group of individuals to predict gene expression in a new individual with similar genetic information. The predictions are accurate even when the training and test groups come from different populations. This means the algorithm can work across different populations. However, the number of genes that can be predicted is limited due to ignoring factors like environment and sequence variation. The algorithm's strength lies in its ability to identify which genes can be predicted ahead of time. An extension of the algorithm incorporates different types of genomic information to weigh the importance of genetic variations. Assigning more weight to variations near genes and regions with high GC content improves predictions. Genes that can be predicted have higher expression and more variability across individuals. This provides insight into characteristics of genes that can be predicted by genetic variation. The algorithm can predict genes even when training and test groups are from different populations. This suggests that some genetic variation is shared across populations and hard to identify within one population. Gene expression variation plays a role in disease susceptibility and phenotypes. Some variation is linked to genetic differences among individuals. The goal is to predict expression based on genetic variation. Two algorithms were developed that use multiple SNPs near the gene and a combination that incorporates genomic annotations. A subset of genes are better predicted with information from other populations, suggesting shared variation across populations.
Researchers investigated the competition between two strains of Plasmodium chaudi, a parasite that causes malaria, in mice. They used a mathematical model to test if the suppression of a less virulent strain by a virulent strain was due to differences in how the immune system cleared the parasite or infected red blood cells. The study found that the rate at which the parasite was lost from the blood was the key factor that differed between the two strains. This rate was the same in single infections but different in mixed infections. The difference was largest in immune-competent mice and smallest in immuno-deficient mice, explaining why suppression was alleviated in immuno-def mice. Suppression occurred early in infection, before peak parasitemia. The study suggests the innate immune system clearing parasites is the main cause of competition between strains, but not the only one. In mixed infections, the interaction between the parasite and immune system changes the strength of parasite clearance. This interaction is unknown, but refining the model with more data may reveal it.
Researchers have proposed a new model, called Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIR), to explain how DNA errors during replication can lead to the formation of interstitial inverted duplications, a type of genetic variation where a segment of DNA is repeated in reverse order. This model suggests that replication errors at existing short, interrupted inverted repeats in the genome create an extrachromosomal, autonomously replicating intermediate, which then integrates into the genome without losing distal chromosomal sequences. To test this, scientists used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that the proposed replication error, where leading and lagging strands are ligated to create a closed fork, can occur in vitro at short, interrupted repeats. This results in a hairpin-linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted dimer plasmid, which integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted duplication. This model can also explain the generation of human, de novo inverted amplicons with a 2:1 mixture of sequences from homologues of a single parent, a feature not explained by other models. Tests of IR support this mechanism and suggest avenues for further research on origins of interstitial inverted CNVs in human health and evolution.
Researchers have studied how the influenza virus affects the way cells in which proteins are made in the body. They found that when cells are infected with the virus, they can start making proteins at different places in the genetic code than usual. This can lead to the creation of new proteins that the immune system may recognize as foreign. The study looked at how often this happens in human cells infected with the flu virus and found that some proteins are made in this way. One of these proteins is a version of the neuraminidase enzyme, which helps the virus attach to cells, but is shorter than usual. This shorter version is still active and found on the surface of infected cells. The researchers also found that some proteins made by the immune system in response to the virus are more likely to be made in this way. The study mapped out how proteins are made in cells infected with the flu and showed how the virus has evolved to avoid this way of making proteins in human cells. This is the first study to look at how proteins are made in cells infected with the flu and found new proteins that are made in this way.
Enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHE), cause severe diarrhea and kidney disease in humans through contaminated food, water, and animal contact. HE has no effective treatment or prevention. HE and other enteric pathogens use a type III secretion system (TSS) to inject virulence proteins into host cells. This study found that E. coli O157:H nH and nH2 genes encode TSS effectors that bind to human ribosomal protein 3 (R3), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-enhancer of B (NF) transcription complexes. nH and n2 localized with R3 in cytoplasm, not nuclei. The N-terminal of n and n2 required binding to N-terminus R3. n and n are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr kinases, but binding R3 independent activity. n reduced R3 abundance without altering p or p65 NF- or phosphorylation inhibitory NF chaper I. n repressed transcription R3/NF-dependent reporter, but not R-independent. In contrast, n stimulated R3 and AP-dependent. A region of n (40-45) responsible for inhibitory n toward R3. Deleting n from E. O:H produced hypervulent phenotype in gnotic pig model Shiga toxin E infection. This suggests n disrupts host immune responses by binding cofactor host transcription complexes.
Researchers have developed a new way to model how proteins bind to DNA, called feature models (FMs). This approach is different from the current method, position scoring matrix (PM), which assumes that each spot on the DNA is independent. However, in many cases, this is not true. FMs use features, which can span multiple spots on the DNA, to represent how proteins bind. The team created a mathematical formula and algorithm to learn these features from data. They also made a tool to find new FMs that are more common in certain DNA sequences than others. The new method was tested on synthetic data and a large dataset of protein-DNA interactions. The results showed that FMs are better than PMs in explaining how proteins bind to DNA. The team applied the method to high-throughput data from mice and humans and found features that are present in mouse and human proteins, and that FMs explain binding better than PMs. The new method and tool are available online.
Researchers studied the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system in humans and chimpanzees, focusing on the adrenergic α2 receptor (AD2) gene, which inhibits the "fight-or-flight" response. Knocking out this gene in mice resulted in physiological and behavioral changes associated with this response. The gene showed evidence of positive selection during chicken domestication. The study found lower expression of AD2 in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. Using three-dimensional chromatin structure, they identified a regulatory region with accelerated in humans and chimpanze. Active histone marks were present in rhes macaque but not human and chimpanzee, while repressive marks were enriched in human brain samples. This region contained neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS) motifs, each with polymorphism. Genotyping analysis showed both polymorphic sites reached fixation in humans and chimpanze but not bonob, while the ancestral allele was present in macaque. CRISPR/Cas editing and reporter assays showed derived nucleotides repressed AD2, likely by increasing NRS binding. Signatures of recent selection for lower AD2 expression in humans were also detected.
Researchers have studied the evolution of the C4 photosynthesis pathway, a complex trait that allows plants to increase productivity by 50% in tropical and subtropical areas. This trait has evolved independently in at least 60 times in monocots and dicots. To understand how different lineages of C plants use the same genetic networks to maintain C photosynthesis, scientists developed a new framework to compare gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. They compared two species, Cleomeandra and Zea, whose common ancestor diverged 140 million years ago, and found 3,335 conserved genes in leaf and photosynthesis development. Genes encoding the C cycle were recruited into networks related to photosynthesis. Despite independent origins, both species use homolog transcription factors to induce C photosynthesis and maintain specific genes for the pathway. A molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthesis is shared by angiosperms from the common ancestor of monocots and dicots. Deep comparisons reveal insight into convergence of complex phenotypes and parallel evolution of transactors underpinning C photosynthesis. Exploiting natural variation can identify regulators, and shared transcription factors in C lineages are targets for engineering C into C crops like rice.
Researchers studied a healthcare worker infected with the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone who was hospitalized in Italy to understand how the virus behaves in the body. They collected samples from the patient's upper and lower respiratory tract and plasma over time to see if the virus was still present after it was cleared from the blood. The results showed that the virus RNA, a sign of the virus, was still present in the lower respiratory tract even after it was gone from the blood. This suggests the virus might be replicating in the lungs. The study aimed to improve understanding how Ebola spreads from person to person and develop ways to stop it. Further research is needed to understand what this means for the patient and how to stop the spread. 

The researchers compared levels of Ebola virus RNA in the patient's respiratory and blood samples over time. They found the virus RNA decreased in blood, but not in respiratory samples. This could be because the virus is stable in the respiratory tract or replicating. The presence of both positive and negative RNA in respiratory samples until day 9 and 10 supports replication in the tract, not just stability. The virus was detected in respiratory but not blood from day 5, while still in respiratory, suggests replication in lungs. A previous study showed Ebola replicates in human airways, with virus in lung tissues and macrophages.
Researchers studied the Machupo virus (MAC), a New Worldnavirus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, and its relative Jun virus (JUN), which causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever. They created a recombinant, chimeric virus (rMAC/Cd1-G) that expresses the glycoprotein from the Candid1 (Cd1) strain of JUN and found it to be completely attenuated in a murine model and protected animals from lethal challenge with MAC. However, a single mutation in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the glycoprotein, equivalent to the attenuating mutation in Cd1, was not sufficient to fully attenuate JUN. To investigate the role of different domains of Cd1 glycoprotein in attenuation, they created several rMACs expressing the ectomain of Cd1 glyprotein alone (MC1), with the TMD substitution (MC2), or the T of Cd1 (3). All rMAC exhibited similar growth in cultured cells. In mice, MC1 showed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMAC. MC was detected in brains and spleens of MC-infected mice and associated with inflammation. On the other hand, all survived MC2 and MC3 infection without detectable virus in organs while producing neutralizing antibodies against Cd1. The study suggests the indispensable role of each glycoprotein domain in full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMAC/C1-G.
Researchers studied a protein called centromere histone 3 (CH3) that helps separate chromosomes during cell division in plants. To understand how CH3 works, they created mutant versions of the protein with single amino acid changes in its structure. Some of these mutant plants looked normal and fertile when self-poll, but produced abnormal offspring when crossed with normal plants. This is called postzygotic incompatibility and uniparent inheritance. The researchers found that a single mutation in the CH3 structure can cause this problem, similar to what happens when CH from different species are combined. They also found that a single mutation can create a haploid inducer, which is a plant that produces offspring with only one set of chromosomes. This is useful for identifying haploid inducers in crop species. They tested this by finding a mutation in CH3 in a plant and found it produced haploids when crossed with normal plants.
Researchers have explored the role of alternative splicing in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiac precursors. They modified the H9 hESC line to select for pluripotent cells with neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors with puromycin resistance. By analyzing microarray data from undifferentiated hES and cardiac precursors, they identified spliceforms with cardiac-restricted or common/neural expression patterns. These events corresponded to pathways of cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle control, as well as genes with ser/threon kinase and helicase activity. A new program, AltAnalyze, predicted changes in protein and microRNA site architecture that affect function and expression, including isoforms opposing cell arrest in hES and promoting cardiac development in prec. Genome-wide predictions combined with functional annotations suggest mechanisms influencing commitment and maintenance at the level of specific isoforms and microregulation.
Researchers have identified a potential target for developing new treatments against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a bacterium that causes tuberculosis, by studying its trehalose biosynthesis pathway. Trehalose is a sugar molecule essential for the bacterium's growth and survival. Two enzymes, T6-phosphate synthase A and T-phosphatase B, produce trehal from ADP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate. To test the potential of Tphatase B as a target, scientists created a mutant of M. tuberculosis that can turn off the Tphat B gene. They found that Tph B is essential for the bacterium's growth in a lab and in mice, but not in chronic infections in mice. This suggests that the bacterium changes its trehal metabolism during infection. Blocking Tph resulted in the buildup of its substrate, T, which is toxic to the bacterium, leading to cell death. Blocking T production in a mutant without Tphase made Tph non-essential. The buildup of T led to the upregulation of over 800 genes, possibly due to increased RNA stability and toxin neutralization. Surprisingly, buildup of another toxic molecule, maltose-phosphate, had minimal effect. A search for genes that interact with Tase identified potential targets for combination therapies to prevent resistance to Tase inhibitors.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, affects 11-18 million people worldwide. Current treatments have poor efficacy and safety profiles. Research has identified trypanosoma cruzi proline racemase (TPR) as a potential target for improved therapy. Conformation changes associated with substrate binding to TPR expose residues that trigger a host immune response, contributing to parasite persistence and immune evasion. Characterizing TPR conformation states requires long-time motions inaccessible by standard simulations. We used accelerated dynamics to extend simulation time and capture large motions. Conservation and fragment analyses identified conformation epitopes near transient binding pockets. Newly open TPR conformations revealed by this study, along with closed-open conversion mechanism, advance understanding of TPR function. This work is a step toward rationalizing the molecular basis of TPR's mitogenic response and providing insights for structure-based drug discovery.

A crystal structure of TPR with pyr-carboxylic acid was used to build our model. Initial apo TPR coordinates were obtained by removing inhibitors. Residues like Arg and Lys were protonated, acidic like Asp and Glu deprotonated. This provides evidence that TPR is a promising target for therapies to combat Chagas. Crystallography and mutagenesis indicate ligand conformation changes in TPR modulate exposure of critical residues. Two TPR structures are available. Accelerated dynamics extended simulation time, combined with sequence and fragment analysis, indicate mitogenic properties of TPR are associated with conserved conformation epitopes around unidentified pockets. We show a model of open TPR through state-of-the-art simulation, indicating mitogenic properties may be associated with conformation epitopes around newly identified pockets.
Researchers have developed a new method to turn genes on and off at will in mice, called the inducible knockout (iKO) system. This system uses two genetically modified mice lines: one with a gene turned off and the other with a gene that can be turned on by treating with doxycycline. The gene can be inserted into a specific location in the genome using a technique called recombinase-mediated insertion. This method is efficient, cost-effective, and can be used for many genes. As a test, the system was used to turn on and off the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, which affects cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis. Results showed reversible switching of AE expression, cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression. The iKO system is a versatile and can be used with other techniques for various applications.

The iKO system is a binary approach based on Tet-dependent technology. It complements existing methods, such as tamoxifen-dependent CreERT, but is reversible and efficient throughout the body. The design allows for streamlined production of both KO and TRE mice, making it possible to generate iKOs for many genes in a cost-effective manner. The KO and TRE lines can be engineered independently and combined, making a range of applications possible. Two genetically modified strains are created: one with a Tet-dependent transactivator inserted into the gene, inactivating it, and the other with gene that can be turned on by doxycine. The system was tested by generating Apo iKO mice by creating Apo KO and Ap TRE lines and breeding them together, modeling human conditions like hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.
Researchers studied the genetic response of the placenta to infection by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. They infected mice with two different strains of the parasite, K and V, and analyzed the genetic changes in the placenta. The study found that the placenta responded differently to each strain, with some genes up-regulated and others down-regulated. The "Innate Immune Response" and "Response Interferon-gamma" pathways were upregulated in V infection, but not in K. Metabolic processes and macromolecular transport were downregulated in infected placentas. The V strain had a stronger tropism to the placenta, with parasite DNA and RNA detected. The study suggests a strong immune response, parasite-dependent to the detriment of cellular metabolism, which may prevent congenital transmission.
Sindbis virus (SINV) polyarthritis, also known as Ockbo disease in Sweden and Pog disease in Finland, has been recognized in northern Europe for about 50 years. This mosquito-borne virus is mainly found in tropical and subtropical countries, but in Europe it causes recurring outbreaks. A seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks has been reported, but only based on human cases. To find a more objective signal, mosquito and SINV prevalence in vectors from an endemic area in Sweden were studied. Mosquitoes from the Riveräl floodplains were collected in 2000, 2001, and 2003 and assayed for virus on cell culture. Obtained isolates were sequenced and nucleotide sequences analyzed. Only SINV was found in 2001, 4 in 200, and 15 in 200, with increased rates in both enzoot and bridge vectors in 200. Maximum likelihood infection rates were 1.0/1000 in enz Cx torrentipiens and 0.62/100 in bridge Aedes in 200, compared to 0.9/100 and 0/100 in 1 and 0/100 and 0.32 in 3. Sequence analysis showed all isolates belonged to SINV I (S-I). Genetic analysis revealed four S-I clades in Riveräl floodplains over years. Increased S-I in vectors constitutes a valuable marker for scrutinizing hypothesized S-I outbreaks and mechanisms.
Researchers studied how the locust's sense of smell works, specifically how the brain processes information from the antennae to the mushroom body, a region linked to memory. They found that only a few neurons in the mushroom body responded to a specific smells, while different smells triggered different neurons. To understand this, they created a model to see if changes in connections between brain cells could control which neurons respond to familiar smells. The model showed that changes in connections between the antennal lobe and mushroom body efficiently filtered out strong signals and condensed them into a sparse representation in the mushroom. This led to specific, reliable, and long-lasting smell representations, suggesting changes in connections play a role in processing information. 

The study focused on Kenyon cells in the mushroom body, which receive information from antennal lobe neurons. These cells are crucial for smell processing and memory. Recordings in locusts showed individual Kenyon cells responded to specific smells, but not all responded to the same smell. The model explored if changes in connections between antennal lobe and Kenyon cells could tune responses to familiar smells. Results showed changes in connections efficiently filtered and condensed signals, leading to specific, reliable, and long-lasting smell representations. This is consistent with previous findings that changes between Kenyon cells and mushroom neurons are critical in smell memory.
Researchers conducted the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene (ST) study to identify genes associated with the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). They analyzed transcription profiles of liver, muscle, fat, and atherosclerotic and unaffected arterial tissues from 278 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The analysis resulted in 60 clusters of genes, with two of which were associated with the extent of stenosis in atherosclerotic arterial and visceral fat. These clusters were validated by analyzing carotid atheros expression profiles. One cluster related to carot stenosis and 27 genes to coronary stenosis were confirmed. Genes in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TE) pathway were overrepresented in all clusters, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A). The A-module was found to be enriched with CAD risk by 1.8-fold. Transcription-factor LIM binding 2 (L2) was identified as a potential regulator of A, supported by subnetwork analysis and expression of 13 TE genes in L2-deficient arterial. The A-module appears to be important for atherosclerosis and L2 merits attention in CAD research.
Researchers have studied the molecular mechanisms behind the circadian clock in cyanobacteria, specifically the Synechoccus. They found that the Kai protein, a central to the circadian clock, is involved in both activating and repressing its own transcription. Over 24 hours, Kai goes through different phospho-states during the day. It was unclear which phospho-state of Kai promotes or opposes transcription activation. A new model, TT/PT, was created to analyze combinations of positive and negative transcription regulation. Only one two-loop mechanism out of 32 tested could reproduce existing observations, including effects of knocking out or overexpressing Kai genes. Phosphorylated KaiC activates and unphosphorylated Kai suppresses Kai transcription. The model suggests the ratio of positive and negative components of Kai expression is key to how two-loop models respond to removal or overexpression of genes. This model could help reveal how the circadian pathways allow Kai to control rhythmically regulate genes in the cyanobacterial genome.
Researchers studied HIV-2 infection in people with slow or no disease progression to understand why it is less severe than HIV-1. They found that HIV-2 mainly infects a specific type of immune cell called transitional-memory CD4 T cells, not central-memory CD T cells like HIV-1 does. This is linked to lower expression of a co-receptor called CXCR6 and higher expression of a restriction factor TR5. HIV-2 was not found in monocytes and only in a few central-memory CD T cells, but in many transitional CD cells. This is different from HIV-1, which infects monocytes and central-memory T cells. The study suggests HIV-2 is less adapted to infect central-memory cells and more to transitional cells. This is similar to other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infections. The researchers also found that HIV-2 is poorly adapted to the myeloid compartment, the part of the immune system where monocytes are found. The study provides new insights into why HIV-2 is less severe and how it differs from HIV-1.
Researchers have developed a new model called the Attention Routing Circuit (ARC) that explains how the brain processes selective attention in the visual cortex. This model is different from previous models because it provides a single mechanism that unifies various effects of attention, is based on individual spiking neurons, and matches physiological data, and makes testable predictions. 

The ARC model shows that attention affects how neurons respond to spatial information, but not other features like color or shape. It also suggests that different forms of attention are consequences of a single mechanism for selective attention routing. The model predicts that more neurons in higher areas of the brain will show attention modulation as they switch from default to selective state during demanding tasks. The magnitude of modulation will increase in higher areas. 

The model was tested on macaque studies and matched several forms of attention modulation. It demonstrated that shifts of attention cause shrinking of receptive fields, increased responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features, and that effect on contrast functions is better explained as response-gain than contrast-gain. This model overcomes limitations of past models by providing a unified explanation of attention effects, being implemented in spiking, defining attention modulation across areas, comparing to data, and making predictions.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and debilitating arrhythm that affects millions of people worldwide. While many genes have been linked to AF, most were identified in small studies, and their contribution to the condition is not well understood. Researchers analyzed whole-exome data from 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 without AF from three large studies: Framingham, Atherosclerosis Risk Communities, and NHLBI Exome Sequencing. They looked for genetic variations in 37 suspected AF genes and 99,404 common variants. None were significantly associated with AF after adjusting for testing. A common variant in SYN2 was associated with AF, but its role is unclear. Rare variants in AF genes were not significant. Individuals with AF did not have more common or rare variations in implicated genes. The study suggests that large-effect coding variation is not the main cause of AF. A variant in SYN2 needs further study to determine if it causes AF. To find meaningful genetic variations, large samples or populations with large effects are needed.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 cases of alveolar echoccosis (AE) were diagnosed in Poland, with 83.6% classified as confirmed, 16 as probable, and 22 as possible. The number of cases increased over the two decades. The average age at diagnosis was 47.7 years, with a male to female ratio of 0.86:1. The disease was fatal in 19% of patients, with an average age at death of 54.1 years. Aggregation of AE was found in 4 foci involving 9 patients, and 76 cases were diagnosed in an advanced stage. The liver was the primary location in all cases, with 24.8% showing spread to other organs. 94 patients were treated with albendazole and 73 underwent surgery, including 15 liver transplants. Studies show AE is an emerging disease in Poland, the 4th in Europe with over 120 cases. Results indicate a need for a national screening program in high-risk areas (northern Poland) and public awareness of E. multular and training primary physicians for early detection.
Researchers studied how the zinc-sensing protein Zur in E. coli responds to changes in zinc availability at the molecular level. They solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PnuABC promoter and found that it represses gene expression by binding cooperatively to two dimers around the core of regulated promoters. Cooperativity requires a pair of salt bridges between Arg and Asp that connect independent dimers. Analysis led to the discovery of a new regulon, pliG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-dependent manner. The plG forms complexes with one or two dimers with less cooperativity than other regulon promoters. Comparison of Zur-DNA binding at four regulon promoters shows a 10,000-fold variation in binding constants. The degree of repression in vivo matches this trend, with a 100-fold difference in transcript copy number between wild-type and Δzur strains. This suggests that the number of Fur dimers that bind varies and the thermodynamics of Zur-D interactions correlates with response at different promoters.

The study supports the idea that thermodynamics of protein-DNA interactions control gene regulation. The findings open how zinc and metal occupancy at a subset of sites in the repressor can fine-tune stress expression across promoters. Mutant proteins were expressed, isolated, and evaluated in metal, DNA, and dimer assays. Analysis by ICPMS shows they can be loaded with zinc, but less than wild-type Zur. A test of zinc activity showed E. coli switches off with Zn+ in the sub-molar range, corresponding to one zinc atom per cell. This suggests bacteria are intolerant of free zinc under normal conditions. Previous studies suggest subtle modulation of Zur-D affinities at promoters in response to zinc and implicate zinc sites in Scur. Our results reveal a layer of tuning based on affinities of saturated dimers for various regulons.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a zoonotic disease that affects livestock, causing high morbidity and mortality. In 2008-2009, a RV outbreak occurred in Madagascar, including the Anjoabe district in the highlands. An entomological surveys found no Aedes mosquitoes, the RV virus vector, and low mosquito abundance due to unfavorable climate conditions. No serological or virological signs of infection were found in wild mammals, suggesting no RV virus reservoir. However, three serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed RV circulation. To understand this, a spatial deterministic metapulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed to reproduce local conditions. Three scenarios explained RV circulation: i) RV overwintering due to direct transmission between vemic cows, ii) low vector circulation due to residual population, iii) combination. Multi-inference resulted in low vector-borne transmission and direct between animals. Predictions matched 84% vector-borne, 16% direct. Sensitivity analysis confirmed results. Interactions between agriculture, vector seasonality, and cattle practices are key to RV circulation in Madagascar highlands.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive and aggressive daytime-biting species that poses a significant public health threat in its expanding range. To understand its historical and contemporary movements in the Indo-Pacific region, researchers analyzed 13 microsatellite loci from 911 individuals and mitochondrial COI sequences. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was used to test competing invasion routes of Ae. albict in the Southeast Asian-Australian region. Results show Ae. albict was likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Asia, colonizing the Solomon Islands via Papua New Guinea or Asia, and the recent incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait was seeded from Indonesia. A colonized population in the Torres Islands has undergone rapid genetic changes, possibly due to genetic drift or a secondary invasion from an unknown source. High genetic structure and gene flow exist between geographically distant populations, driven by human dispersal. This study provides a broader distribution of the species' range, revealing more spatial structure than previously shown, and a probable invasion history in the Australasian region using ABC analysis.
A study investigated the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on the quality of life and physical fitness of 572 children aged 7-8 in Mwan Region, North-West Tanzania. The prevalence of S. mansoni infection was 58.7% with an average of 207.3 eggs per gram of feces. Most infections were light, while 16.4% had heavy infections. Girls had higher intensities than boys. 30.1% were anemic with no sex difference. Stunting and wasting were less than 10%. There was no association between S mans prevalence or intensities and anthropometry, anemia, or spleen pathology. However, infected children had lower emotional quality of life scores than uninfected and higher VO2 max. In multivar regression, age, S mans infection, hemoglobin, and VO max were predictors of emotional quality life, while predictors of VO max were physical quality, height, age, and hemoglobin. S mans infection was not retained in regression on VO max. The study suggests S mans infection affects emotional quality of life, not physical fitness.
Researchers studied how Leptira, a zoonosis caused by spirochete, infects rats. They compared three routes of infection: intraperitoneal, mucosal, and subcutaneous. The goal was to understand how Leptira colonizes rats naturally, like it does in the wild. Infection was asymptomatic in all three routes, with similar antibody production. Renal colonization rates were 8/8, 5/8, and 1/8 for intraper, muc, and subcut routes respectively. Mucosal inoculation was more efficient for urinary excretion than subcut, and slower than intraper. This study helps understand Lept infection in rats, unlike previous studies in wild rats. Future studies on natural routes will increase knowledge of rat-rat transmission and infection kinetics.
Researchers have identified a new role for Annexin A2 (AnxA) in regulating the body's response to sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive inflammation, tissue damage, and organ dysfunction. Seps is difficult to treat, and understanding its molecular mechanisms may lead to effective treatments. AnxA is a multi-functional protein that inhibits inflammation by controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling during seps. In seps models, mice lacking AnxA showed increased inflammatory cytokines, neutrophils, and decreased bacterial clearance, and survival. AnxA deficiency also led to increased ROS and IL-17 levels. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed cysteine 9 of AnxA is crucial for regulating ROS levels, which in turn affects IL-17 and inflammation. Depleting IL-17 via CRISPR/C9 strategy reduced inflammation and protected AnxA- mice from seps. The study reveals AnxA's previously unknown function in seps via AnxA-ROS-IL-17 axis, providing insight into seps pathophysiology. AnxA may mitigate se severity by modulating ROS and IL-17 levels. Targeting neutils in seps may be therapeutic. AnxA-induced neutil infiltration contributes to severe and distant injury and mortality in seps mice. IL-17 is regulated by ROS, and reduced after IL-17 knockdown. Increased IL-17 correlates with ROS in An- mice, and IL-17 knockdown inhibits seps inflammation. AnxA, an intracellular protein, is involved in cellular processes, including immunity, endosome function, and inflammation. Overall, AnxA plays a critical role in inhibiting inflammatory response by regulating ROS and IL-17 in seps.
Researchers studied how polyinos-polycidylic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) affect HIV-1 infection in macrophages. These compounds activate Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3 and TLR4, respectively, and have been shown to decrease HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). However, the mechanisms were not fully understood. The study found that poly(I:C) and L-stimulation of MDMs reduced infection by CCR5-using macrophage-tropic HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudyped HIV-1 virions, while TLR2, TLR or T9 agonists only partially reduced infection to varying extent. Suppression of infection did not correlate with effects on CD4 or CCR expression, type interferon induction, or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Integrated viruses were detected in unstimulated TLR and T9-stimulated cells, but not TLR or T4-stim MDM, suggesting alteration of post-entry preintegration events. Microarray and RT-PCR analysis found increased microRNA mi-155 in MDM upon TLR4 but not T7 stimulation, and mi-155 inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly I-stimulated MDM. Ectopic mi-155 expression diminished HIV-1 in primary MDM and cell lines. Poly I-stimulation and ectopic mi-155 resulted in accumulation of late RT products and undetectable or low integrated viruses 2-L circles. Reduced mRNA and protein of HIV-1 factors involved in trafficking and import preintegration (AD10, TN3, N153, LED/p75) were in poly I-stim and mi-trans M, and reporter suggested authentic mi-155 targets.
Plants use daily light and dark cycles to control various physiological processes, including growth. In Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, hypocotyl growth rates are highest at different times of the day depending on external light and internal circadian rhythms. However, the interactions between light, circadian clock, and growth-promoting hormone pathways are not well understood. Researchers analyzed the Arabidopsis seedling transcriptome under multiple growth conditions and mutant backgrounds using DNA microarrays to determine the transcriptional component of rhythmic growth. A group of hormone-associated genes are co-expressed when hypocotyl growth is maximal. This correlates with overrepresentation of a cis-element (CAT) in hormone gene promoters, which confers diurnal and circadian patterns in vivo. Circadian and light mutants show that internal hormone signaling and external darkness are required for wild-type growth. The circadian clock indirectly controls growth by gating hormone levels to proper time. This integration of pathways allows plants to fine-tune hormone responses for seasonal growth.

The circadian clock changes chromatin modifications, suggesting developmental states are reflected in modifications. The gated model provides a framework for the relationship between circadian, light, and hormone-regulated growth. IAA signaling plays a role in IAA growth. A time-day atlas showed photocycles, thermocycles, and circadian control 90% Arabid genes. The implication is that many pathways are coordinated at specific times. A transcription module is associated with growth, regulated by internal and external coincidence. The circadian acts upstream light to gate hormone expression in the evening. Since growth is time-specific, a temporal component of hormone pathways could be part of specificity. The circadian and light interact to coordinate biosynthetic, catabolic, receptor, and genes from multiple hormone pathways.
Researchers have developed a new method to control Chagas disease vectors, such as Rhodnius prolix, by modifying the insect's gut microbiota. They used a technology called RNA interference (RNAi) to deliver molecules to the insect's gut. The goal is to reduce the insect's ability to spread the disease. The researchers used two types of bacteria, Escherichia coli and Rhodoccus rhnii, to deliver RNA to the insect. The RNA targeted two proteins: Rhodni heme-binding protein (RH) and catalase (CAT). These proteins are important for the insect's development and reproduction. The researchers fed the bacteria to nymphs and adult stages of the insect. The results showed that the RNA interference was effective and spread throughout the insect's body. Concentrations of bacteria above 3.35 × 10^7 CFU/mL produced significant knockdown of RH and CAT genes in nymphs and adults. RH expression in the body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal 10 days after. CAT expression was reduced 99% and 96 in ovary and midgut, respectively, five days after. Mortality increased 24-30% in first instars fed RH and CAT. Molting rates reduced 100% in first and 80 in third fed bacteria RH or CAT. Oviposition reduced 43% RH and 84 CAT. Embogenesis arrested 16 RH and 20 of eggs. The researchers also used the natural symbiont, Rhodoccus rhn, to express RH-specific RNA, reducing RH expression by 89 and oviposition.
Fever in pregnancy is a significant risk for both the mother and the fetus. In the 1980s, malaria was the leading cause of death in pregnant women in refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border. However, artemisinin therapy has reduced the incidence of malaria in the population. The causes of fever in pregnancy are not well-documented. Pregnant women attending antenatal care, where screening for malaria is routine, were invited to have a comprehensive clinical and laboratory screening if they had fever. Women were admitted, treated, and followed up until delivery. Convalescent serum was collected on day 21. Outcomes were recorded.

Fever episodes occurred in 5.0% (409/8,117) of women attending anten clinics from January 2004 to May 2006. The main cause was malaria in 55.5% (227/409). A cohort of 203 (49.6%409) had fever investigations and follow-up. Arthrop-borne, malaria, ricketial, and deng, and zoon disease leptospi accounted for nearly half all febr illnesses, 47.3 (96). Coinfection was observed 3.9 (8) of women, mostly malaria and ricket. Pyonephritis 19.7 (40) was also a cause of fever. Once malaria, pyoneph and respiratory are excluded, one-third of remaining febr infections were caused by ricket or leptpi. Scr and murine typhus were associated with poor outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth. One woman died with no laboratory tests.

Malaria remains the leading cause of fever in pregnancy on Thaiurma. Scr and murine typh were important causes of fever with poor outcomes. Pregnant women on Thaiurma without malaria, pyone or respiratory infection should be treated with azithromycin for typh and leptpi.
Researchers investigated the relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans by analyzing over 600,000 genotyped markers in 69 French-Canadian families. They found a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age, driven by chromosome-specific effects, particularly in the middle sections of chromosomal arms and subtelomeric regions. This suggests that recombination's protective effect against non-disjunction becomes less efficient with age, contributing to higher aneuploidy rates in older women. The study proposes a model reconciling findings with associations between maternal age and recombination in trisomies. To further investigate, they genotyped individuals from 68 French-Canadian families and localized recombination events at high resolution, observing a genome-wide decrease in rate with maternal age. Chromosome effects may vary among populations due to genetic differences in regulating recombination machinery, supported by significant decay on nine chromosomes in the French-Canadian cohort and two in Hutter. Maternal age is a major factor in chromosomal anupidy, but little is known about age-related non-disjunction. Recombination initiated during fetal development can still be influenced by age. Not all trisomies are affected equally by maternal age, and mechanisms may not apply to anup conceptions. The study highlights distinct selective constraints on chromosomes influencing recombination over generations.
Researchers have found a new way to boost the immune system's first line of defense, macrophages, to fight off opportunistic infections in people with weakened immune systems. They used a strategy to "train" macrophages in the body to remember a specific pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, and stay protected for at least 70 days without the help from the rest of the immune system. This is different from current vaccines that rely on the second line of defense, the adaptive immune system, which can be weak in people with compromised immune systems. The team found that macroages that were "trained" with interferon-gamma (IF-γ) had a rapid response to the pathogen and stayed in a protective state for weeks. This was due to increased binding of a protein, STAT1, to genes that help fight fungal infections. The study suggests a new way to make vaccines more effective in people with weakened immune systems by inducing a memory-like response in macroages.
Researchers studied how a group of proteins called Polycomb repressive complexes (PCs) regulate gene expression and development in plants. These complexes are crucial for growth and development in both plants and animals, but how they target specific genes is not fully understood. They found that a protein called CURLY LEAF (CL), a key part of PC2, works with other PC members to suppress different developmental programs in plants. Specifically, it represses flower development in seedlings by working with LIKE HETCHROMIN PROTEIN1 (LHP). In contrast, embryo development is repressed by PC core units AtBMI and AtRING with PC enzyme CL or SWINGER (SW). The role of CL corresponds with changes in H3me3 profiles and is associated with binding of transcription factors, including MADS and ABA. Different PC combinations regulate different programs and specificity is modulated by transcription factors.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the "trigger" region of the RNA polymerase II enzyme, a crucial for transcription in yeast cells. This region, called the trigger loop (TL), plays a key role in selecting the right substrates, catalyzing reactions, and moving along the DNA. To understand its function, the researchers created nearly all possible single-residue variations of the TL in yeast RNA polymerase II and studied their effects. They found three classes of mutations linked to defects in transcription or stress, with distinct residue distributions. Disrupting a hydrophobic pocket in TL, thought to destabilize a catalytically inactive state, showed consistent with increased catalysis. Interactions among TL and nearby residues support the role of funnel and bridge helices in TL dynamics. This study combines genetic and structural data for high-resolution dissection of transcription mechanisms and evolution, applicable to other essential yeast proteins.

The study reveals functional contributions of TL residues to its dynamics, catalysis, and sequence constraints. The approach expands existing mutational studies and can be applied to most yeast proteins. The researchers dissected Pol II mechanisms using this framework, assessing TL residues in S. cerevisiae under multiple conditions. Intra-T interactions and TL with nearby domains are critical for function. Genetic and structural studies support a multi-step folding model for catalysis. Many gain-of-function and loss-of-function variants were identified, some with predicted epistatic interactions. The TL's ability to fold into multiple states and convert between them is critical for its functions. Previous studies show TL is delicately balanced, perturbations result in increased or decreased activity and altered dynamics.
Researchers studied how the rabies virus (RV) spreads to the brain after entering the body through a bite or scratch. They wanted to know if the virus can also spread through the bloodstream to the brain. To find out, they infected mice with two types of RV: one from dogs (DOG) and one from silver-haired bats (SB). They gave the virus to mice either under the skin (intramuscularly) or through a vein (intravenously). The mice that got the virus under the skin got sick and died from rabies. But the ones that got it through the vein only got sick if it was from the bat virus. The researchers looked at how the virus spread in the brain and found that the bat virus went straight to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain connected to the pituitary gland. This is a new way the virus can spread to the brain. This has implications for how to prevent rabies, especially from the bat virus.
Researchers studied the evolutionary history of the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus, which has caused significant illness and death in humans since the 1918 pandemic. They analyzed 71 complete genome sequences from 1918 to 2006 and found that segment reassortment, a process where genetic material is exchanged between viruses, played a key role in the virus's evolution. Specifically, they found that an H1 virus from 1947 acquired new genes through reassort, which may explain its sudden change in severity. Similarly, the 195 epidemic may have been caused by reassorted H1 viruses. The study suggests reassort is more important in H1's evolution than thought. Reassort between different species can create pandemic viruses, like H2 and H3 in 1957 and 196. The H1's eight segments generally evolved together, but some reassort events affected specific segments. The researchers analyzed 71 whole-genome sequences from 191 to 200, representing 17 countries and five continents. Few studies have looked at reassort in H1 viruses. H1 is thought to evolve slower than H2, needing less frequent vaccine updates. H1 circulated 191 195, then 197, had significant impact. The study's main question is how H1 became so severe in 191, killing 20 million in the pandemic.
Researchers investigated how nicotine affects the brain's ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key region involved in reward and motivation, to understand its addictive properties. They developed a computational model of the VTA's circuitry and nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors to clarify how nicotine's action. The model showed that αβ2-containing ACh receptors on dopamine or GABA cells can mediate nicotine's effects, consistent with both in vitro and in vivo data. The rate of endogenous acetylcholine input is crucial for the evoked dopamine response, either through direct stimulation or inhibition. Results suggest that low cholinergic input is necessary for direct stimulation, while high cholinergic input is crucial for inhibition to observe dopamine increase. This is due to known activation and desensitization properties of αβ2 ACh receptors. Experimental data support the role of GABA cells in nicotine's action. The model captures in vitro modulation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to DA neurons and in vivo activation of β-containing ACh receptors on DA neurons. The study clarifies mechanisms of nicotine's action in V, suggesting acetylcholine dependence for reinforcement.
Researchers conducted a two-armed, randomized, double-blinded phase II trial in Kabul, Afghanistan to study a novel treatment for cutaneous leishmanias (CL) caused by Leishmania (L) trop infection. The treatment involved high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by moist-wound treatment (MWT) with polyacrylate hydrogel with or without sodium chlorite (DAC-055). The primary outcome was the time for complete lesion epithelialization. Biops were taken before, after wound closure, and 6 months later. The mean time for wound closure was similar in both groups, 59.1 days and 54.2 days. DAC-055 caused faster wound healing in patients with Leish-positive biops, 37.2 days vs 58.3 days. Superfections occurred at the same rate in both groups, 8.8%. Relapses were higher in patients with persistent parasite loads, 10.2% vs 18.5%. DAC-055 showed lemanicidal effect on amastigotes. The EC plus M protocol led to rapid closure and lower relapse rate compared to intraional injections.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosila cells to identify factors that regulate the RAS-MAP signaling pathway. They found 101 validated hits, most of which were previously known to be associated with the pathway. Epist experiments determined the position of individual candidates relative to core components, revealing new factors acting at different steps, including a protein modulating RAF activation. Unexpectedly, most hits worked downstream of ME and influenced MAP expression, mainly through constitutive splicing. Two members of this group were characterized and found to regulate MAP alternative splicing. This study provides a comprehensive view of factors modulating R-MAP signaling in Dila and suggests that pathway output is not solely reliant on classical events like RAF activation, but also on MAP regulation. Core splicing can also impact alternative splicing.

The screen involved three steps: primary RNAi, validation, and secondary screens to establish regulatory position relative to known components. G-loaded R triggers sequential activation of RAF, ME, and MAP; RAF phosphorylates and activates ME, which phosphorylates and activates MAP. Unlike RAF and ME, MAP has various substrates including transcription factors. Two candidates, P1-87 and Sur-8, clustered with known factors in R-RA. Validated hits were submitted to secondary assays to position regulatory with core kinases, identifying new factors at different steps, including upstream of RAF.
Researchers in Thailand studied 498 isolates of the Cryptococcus neoformans and C gatt species to better understand cryptococcosis in the country. They found 386 isolates from clinical and 112 from environmental and veterinary sources. Most isolates were from males, aged 37.97 years, with 88.5% of C neoans and 37.5 of gatt from HIV patients. Molecular analysis showed most isolates were C neoans type V, regardless of source, with 94.8% clinical, 98.8 environmental, and 86.2 veterinary. Types II, IV, I, and II were less common. Multilocus Sequence Type (ML) analysis identified 20 types in Thailand, with some unique to the country. Most gatt isolates were ST7, identical to the virulent Vancouver outbreak strain, indicating a global spread. The study found greater diversity and range of molecular types in Thai isolates than previously reported.
Researchers studied the evolution of a large group of proteins called C2-H2 zinc finger transcription factors (TFs) in 12 species of fruit flies over 45 million years. They found that a significant number of these TFs have variations that affect their ability to bind to DNA. In addition to losing or gaining C2-Z domains, they also found changes in DNA-contacting residues in 44% of shared domains between species. These changes were conserved in 70% of Drosophila TFs and 26% of all annotated TFs, suggesting they are functional. They were rarely found as polymorphisms in a population of D melanogaster flies, indicating rapid fixation. Specificities of these domains changed across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Proteins with conserved C-Z domains were enriched in developmental functions, while varying domains showed no enrichments. The study suggests a subset of dynamic and understudied TFs are a source of variation in Dophila and other metazoa.
Researchers have developed a new PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to identify two types of bacteria that cause typhoid and paratyoid fevers, Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paraty A. These bacteria can be difficult to diagnose, especially in areas where typing sera is not available or culture is not possible. The new test uses a repeated DNA sequence called CRIS (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats) that is specific to each serotype. The researchers tested the test on 188 Typhi and 74 Paraty A strains from different places and times, and 70 other bacteria that can cause similar symptoms. The test was 100% sensitive and specific, meaning it correctly identified all Typhi and Paraty A and not other bacteria. This test can be used in many laboratories with PCR technology to quickly and accurately identify these serotypes. The test was developed for cultured isolates, but can be modified for clinical samples.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the immune response to Leishmania major infection, a protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis. They found that Notch receptors Not1 and Not2 are necessary for the differentiation of IFγ-secre CD+ T helper 1 cells, which are crucial for fighting the infection. Mice with cell-specific deletion of both Not1 and Not2 developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia due to impaired IFγ secretion by CD+ T cells and increased IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines. In contrast, mice with single inactivation of Not1 or Not were resistant to infection and developed a protective Th1 response. The study also showed that Not signaling is required for IFγ secretion by Th cells, independent of CSL/RBP-J, a major effector of Not receptors. Mice with R-J deletion in T cells were able to develop IFγ-secre Th cells, kill parasites and heal lesions.
Researchers investigated whether infection with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni increases susceptibility to HIV infection in rhes macaques. The study found that animals infected with the worm were more likely to become infected with the AIDS virus after exposure, even at lower doses that were not enough to infect uninfected animals. In fact, the dose needed to establish infection was 17 times lower in infected animals compared to controls. Infected animals also had higher levels of the virus in their blood and increased viral replication in immune cells. This is the first direct evidence that schistomiasis increases the risk of new HIV infection. The study suggests that controlling parasitic infections may help reduce the spread of HIV in areas where both are common.
Researchers have created a computer model to study how the brain chemical acetylcholine (ACh) affects brain activity during sleep and wakefulness. ACh is a key regulator of brain excitability and plays a role in sleep. The model shows how changes in brain excitability and structure create three distinct activity patterns: localized, traveling, asynchronous, and synchronous. These patterns match what is seen in the brain during slow wave sleep, REM, and waking states. During slow wave sleep, traveling patterns occur in the brain, while in other states, stationary patterns do. The model is made of neurons with a current regulated by ACh. ACh level can cause changes between patterns. Reducing this current recreates reduction in spike frequency adaptation and shift in response curve seen with ACh. When frequency is low, activity is localized and pinned by network inhomogeneities. When frequency is present, traveling waves arise. Further decrease in A leads to high synchrony within waves. ACh also determines how sensitive activity is to heterogeneity. These patterns may be important as stationary may encode input and traveling could lead to regularization.
Researchers investigated the role of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway in the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a type of cancer linked to an inflammatory environment with reduced microbial diversity. They found that non-synonymous mutations affected the TLR pathway in 14.6% of 171 EAC tumors, with TLR4 being the most frequently mutated gene with 5.8% of tumors. These mutations were associated with more proximal and metastatic disease, suggesting clinical significance. TLR mutants had impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a key component of the immune response. The study also found TLR mutations in other solid tumors exposed to microbiomes, including uterine endrioid carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, colorectal adenocarcin, and stomachocarcin. The findings suggest that TLR genes are recurrently mutated in EAC and T4 mutations may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients.
Researchers investigated the development of taste cells in mice using a combination of in silico and in vivo analyses. They found that taste receptor molecules (TRMs) colocalized in the developing circumvallate papillae (CVP) and used computational analysis to identify a common regulatory network for TRM transcription. Hes was identified as a likely regulatory factor and its function examined in vivo. Expression analyses showed that decreased nuclear H1 correlated with type II taste cell markers. After E18, CVP of H1-/- mutants had 5-fold more TRM-immunactive cells than wild-type littermates. The study suggests H1 plays a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing buds.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling root development. Unlike the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis, the role of ethylene and auxin in monocotyledonous rice is unclear. They found that the activation of OsIL on the expression of Y8RE7 and indole-3-pyric acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using an inhibitor of Y activity, which regulates auxin biosynthesis via conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), they showed eth-inhibited primary root elong is dependent on Y-based auxin biosynthesis. A rice mutant, rein-1, insensitive to ethylene, was identified with YRE7 truncated at its C-terminus. Mutation in Y7 reduced auxin biosynthesis in rice, while overexpression of Y enhanced eth sensitivity in roots. Y catalyzed the conversion of IPA to IAA, truncated at C-terminal of Y resulted in significant reduction of enzymatic activity, indicating Y is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and eth-inhibited elong in early seedlings. Investigations showed eth induced Y expression and promoted aux accumulation in roots. Addition of low IAA rescued eth response in rein-1, demonstrating eth-in elong depends on IPA-dependent biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed Y-mediated auxin function downstream of OsIL, which activated expression of Y7.
A nationwide study in Saudi Arabia has revealed the challenges of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NT) diseases, which are increasing globally. The study, the first of its kind in the country, collected 527 isolates of NT with clinical and demographical data over 24 months. Primary identification was done by probe assays and 16S rRNA, 16-23 ITS, rpo, and h65 gene sequencing. Results showed 75.1% of isolates were pulmonary with 44.7% clinical significance. 34 species, including 17 rare, were identified, with M. simiae 22.6%, M. fortuit 18.1, and M. absus 17.8 predominant. M. riyense, a rare species, was found in 27 cases. Diabetes and previous tuberculosis history were risk factors for NT diseases. The study found rare events like mycobemia, abscess, peritonitis, and ascites caused by M wolii, hatic, duii, and monence respectively. NT disease and pathogen diversity is a challenge in Saudi Arabia, requiring immediate diagnostic and management plans.
Researchers studied how yeast cells prepare for a state of dormancy called quiescence in response to starvation. They found that three kinases, Yak1, Mck, and Rim15, play a crucial role in this process. These kinases help cells accumulate carbohydrates, specifically trehalose and glycogen, which are energy stores that allow cells to survive for a long time. When these kinases are missing, cells can't accumulate these stores and their lifespan is shorter. The researchers also found that levels of reactive oxygen species, which can damage cells, are controlled by Yak, Rim, and Mck kinases. They suggest that these kinases help cells prepare for quies by storing energy and protecting themselves from damage. The study supports the idea that cells reprogram their metabolism to store energy and protect themselves from damage to live longer.
Researchers have found that the influenza A virus's hemagglutinin (HA) protein can be modified with sugar molecules called glycans to compensate for the loss of fitness that occurs when the virus mutates to evade the immune system's antibodies. This process, called antigenic evolution, allows the virus to persist in human populations despite widespread immunity. The study used a method called primer error-correct viral sequencing to reveal this unexpected role of glycosylation. The results show that adding glycans to the HA protein's globular domain can increase the virus's ability to bind to receptors, even if it has mutated to evade antibodies. This finding expands understanding of viral mechanisms that maintain fitness during antigen evolution and highlights the power of high-definition virus sequencing to reveal new adaptive mechanisms. The study suggests that glycosylation can play a role in the virus's ability to combine antigen novelty with fitness and transmissibility. It also shows that glycosylation can increase the fitness of antigen escape variants by restoring optimal receptor interactions, even without antibody pressure. This raises the possibility that both mechanisms contribute to the accumulation of glycans in the globular domain during H1 and H3 virus circulation. The study demonstrates glycos can compensate for fitness costs imposed by escape substitutions on HA, increasing viability and emergence of antibody-escape variants.
Researchers analyzed 13 models of ventricular myocytes to understand why some antiarrhythmic drugs are less effective at slow heart rates and more effective at fast rates. These drugs, called reverse dependent, prolong the cardiac action potential (AP) more at slow rates, increasing arrhythmia risk and reducing suppression at fast rates. The opposite, forward dependence, would solve this problem, but forward dependent drugs are rare. The study found that reverse dependence is not a property of the AP itself, but of ionic perturbations that affect it. By simulating myocytes with varying properties and analyzing results, they predicted rate-dependent changes in 40 parameters, testing AP at slow and fast rates. They identified ionic perturbations that produce forward dependence, such as increased L-type calcium current with indirect changes in delayed rectifier potassium. Inward rectifier potassium and sodium-potassium pump were most likely to produce forward prolongation. Models with minimal AP shape changes have little forward potential, while those with large changes have considerable. This study provides insights into AP duration dependence and a strategy for beneficial antiarrhythmic design.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how genetic variations in people's genes affect their traits and diseases. They used this method, called Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PAS), to look at how thiopurine-methyltransferase (TPM) activity affects patients treated with thiopine drugs. TP is an enzyme that helps break down thiopine, a medication used to treat certain diseases. The study used data from 442 patients at a French hospital between 2010 and 2013. They analyzed ICD-10 codes, which classify diseases, and biological test results, like blood work, to see if there was a link between TP activity and disease. Two methods were used: ICD-10 hierarchy and mapping to existing ICD-9 codes. Biological results were also analyzed to validate the findings. Two diseases, iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes, were associated with high TP activity. This is the first study to use I-10 codes and biological results for P. The method can help identify patients who need personalized treatment.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies on stem cell transplantation in spinal cord injury found that allogenic stem cells improved motor function by 27.2% and sensory function by 26.3% compared to controls. The analysis included 156 publications and 45 different stem cell preparations, with only one using autologous cells. Allogenic cell treatment showed significant improvement in both motor and sensory outcomes, but heterogeneity between experiments was mainly due to stem cell biology. Differentiation, implantation route, and delivery method favored better outcomes. Stem implantation did not improve sensory outcomes in females and was enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. A dose-response relationship supported biological plausibility. Motor outcomes were influenced by experimental design, injury location, and immunosuppression. Reporting bias was higher than in neuroscience but still suboptimal, with motor studies not reporting blinded assessment giving inflated efficacy. The review suggests stem-cell therapies may offer promise, but internal validity and publication bias likely lower efficacy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 154 studies on soil-transmitted helmin (STH) infections, including Ascaris lumbricoid, hookworm, and Trichuris trura, found that reinfection occurs rapidly after treatment. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, Ascaris lumic prevalence reached 26%, 68%, and 94% of pretreatment levels, respectively. Trichis trura reinfection prevalence were 36%, 67, and 82, and hookworm 30, 55, and 57. Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were correlated with pretreatment status. The study suggests frequent anthelmint drug administrations are needed to maximize benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Integrated approaches emphasizing health and sanitation are required to interrupt transmission. The analysis used pooled risk ratios from random-effects models to assess risk of STH reinfection after treatment. 51 studies provided STH rates pre and post-treatment, and 42 reported determinants of predisposition to reinfection.
Researchers have developed a new method called Minimum Enrichment Analysis (MiA) to study nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFL) by analyzing metabolic processes at the molecular level. NAFL is a spectrum of diseases from simple fat buildup in the liver to more severe inflammation. Current methods use predefined maps of metabolic processes, but these can be biased and miss complex interactions. MiA generates minimal networks of reactions that can produce a target metabolite and applies to genome-scale metabolic networks. The team applied MiA to human and mouse data to identify deregulated processes in fatty liver and inflammation. They found key changes in cholesterol and hexadecate synthesis and regulators of hydrogen peroxide synthesis differed between humans and mice. MiA can study metabolism for any disease or organism, making it a flexible tool for research. 

The method, MiA, compares conditions using transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to identify minimal networks of reactions that synthesize a metabolite. Current methods use predefined maps that are limited and differ depending on database, missing complex interactions. MiA formulates metabolic tasks to mimic NAFL phenotypes, such as lipid formation, apoptosis, inflammation, and stress. These include necessary metabolites to form the phenotype. MiA was applied to study deregulated processes and regulatory metabolism is better characterized with available genome-scale networks.
Researchers studied how the brain's sense of smell, or olfaction, identifies a wide variety of odors despite their intensity. They found that "primacy coding," where the earliest responding receptors encode odor identity, provides a compact and efficient representation that the brain can interpret. This representation is independent of odor intensity and useful for tasks like identifying odors. Simulations showed that the number of receptor types in prim coding affects information, but not the size of the receptor repertoire. Interestingly, smaller repertoires can be advantageous for discriminating odors. The model suggests overly sensitive receptors can dominate and make the array useless, allowing prediction of receptor adaptation to environmental changes. Prim coding is more useful than binary coding because its sparsity is independent of odor statistics, unlike alternatives. It provides an efficient representation independent of intensity, helping identify odors in the olfactory cortex. 

A model of neural representations of olfactory stimuli was analyzed, where odors are identified by the strongest responding receptors. Primacy provides a sparse representation independent of intensity. Numerical and statistical analysis showed prim dimension affects information and discriminability. It provides a robust and compact representation over a wide range of odors, independent of intensity, outperforming other schemes. However, performance hinges on tuned sensitivities, suggesting selective pressure to adjust on evolutionary and short timescales. The prim code in the olfactory bulb is more useful than alternatives because statistics are independent of odor. The model predicts useful receptors respond similarly to incoming odors. Experiments show odors are robustly encoded by responding receptors within a time window. The identity can be encoded by a fixed number responding first, primacy. It is unclear how efficient and compares to alternatives. The model predicts lesions have a severe effect on animals with smaller reperto. The analysis suggests prim provides a robust, sparse, concentration-variant, and weakly dependent representation. For it to be useful, it needs to solve olfactory tasks.
Researchers studied a group of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMA) that target the HIV virus. These antibodies, PG9, PG16, PGT, and P152, have shown unusual neutralization profiles with a non-sigmoid slope and a plateau at less than 100% neutralization. The study aimed to determine the extent of non-sigmoid slopes and plateaus at less than 100 for more bnMA. Using a panel of 278 pseudoviruses in a CD4-T cell assay and 117 viruses in the TZ-bl assay, they found that bnMA targeting the spike had neutral profiles with at least one that plateaued at 90%. Across both panels, bnMA targeting the V apex of Env and gp41 were most likely to show neutral curves that plateaued 100. Conversely, bnMA targeting high-mose epitopes were less likely to show this behavior. CD4 binding Abs also showed this behavior infrequently. The phenomenon of incomplete neutralization was observed in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell-grown virus panel from patient swarms. Five bnMA were compared against 18-virus of clones produced in 293 cells and PBs and assayed in TZ-bl. Examples of plateaus 90 were seen with both types of virus with no consistent patterns. Incomplete neutralization and nonigmoid neutral curves are possible for all bnMA against a range of viruses and assayed in cell and primary cells with implications for use in therapy and vaccine design.
Researchers developed a computational model to study how cancer cells use glucose and glutamine to produce energy and biomass. They found that when glutamine levels are high, cells produce more lactate from glutamine instead of glucose, even in the presence of oxygen. This occurs when oxygen is not enough to fully oxidize glucose. The model showed that this pattern is optimal for cell growth and requires a branched TCA cycle and redox reactions. Experiments in a cancer cell line validated the model's predictions. The study suggests that competition between glucose and glutamine may drive cancer growth. Cancer cells often use glucose to produce lactate, but to understand glutamine use, researchers focused on a condition where glucose is redirected to lactate. They simulated 50,000 cell wirings with varying glucose and glutamine uptake while keeping oxygen constant. The model identified conditions that promote metabolic rewiring in cancer cells. A hallmark of cancer is extensive metabolic reorganization, including aerobic glycolysis and glutamine use for biosynthesis. The study used a constraint-based approach to evaluate metabolic wirings for biomass from glucose and glutamine under different conditions.
Researchers investigated the interactions of the prion protein (Pr) and its mammalian paralogs, Doppel (PrPnd) and Shadoo (Spr), in a cell culture model that allows prion replication. They found that the three proteins share a similar environment in neuroblastoma cells and interact with each other. The study also confirmed interactions between Pr and the cell adhesion molecule laminin, Na+/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI), reconciling previous findings. Experiments showed that Pr interactions with PDIs may occur outside the endoplasmic reticulum and play a previously unknown role in PrSc accumulation. A hypothesis suggests that Pr organizes its environment by binding adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin-like domains, recognizing oligann-bearing membrane proteins.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to influenza virus infection in the lungs. They found that a type of immune cell called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) produces a cytokine called interleukin-5 (IL-5) during infection. IL-5 is important for making eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, mature and leave the bone marrow. The study showed that IL-5 is released into the airways during infection and eosinils accumulate in the lungs, especially after the virus is cleared. The source of IL-5 was IL2 cells in the lungs. These cells also produce more IL-5 when they interact with other immune cells called NKT and alveolar macrophages. This interaction leads to more IL-5 production and eosin accumulation in the lungs during recovery from infection.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NT) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of NT disease in Asia are not well-documented. This study retrospectively identified 102 cases of NT infections in an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. Clinical records were accessed to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with NT infection and identify risk factors with death. Multi-locus typing and antimicrobial testing was performed on all organisms. 71% of NT patients were HIV-infected, 90% were adults, 71 were male, and 33 reported intravenous use. 26/92 (28%) with known outcome died, HIV was associated with death (p=0.039). Enteridis Sequence (ST) 11 (43/89) and Typhimium (ST 19,34, 44) (23/89) were most identified serovars. Tyim was more common in HIV-infected (p=0.003). Isolates from HIV-inf patients were more susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamox than HIV-negative (p=0.037). NT is a severe infection in Vietnam with high mortality. In sub-Saharan, HIV was risk for death, majority burden in population HIV-inf adult.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify viral and phage proteins using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Phages are viruses that infect bacteria and play a crucial role in their survival and ability to cause disease. However, most phage genes have unknown functions, making it difficult to understand their impact on microbial communities and human health. The new method uses ANNs to classify protein sequences based on amino acid frequency and isoelectric point, achieving high accuracy in detecting structural proteins. The ANNs were trained on sequences from phages, viruses that infect bacteria, archaea, and eukarya, and validated by electron microscopy. The results show that ANNs can identify proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect by other methods. This tool will aid in disease diagnosis, vaccine development, and understanding of viral impact on the environment. 

The researchers designed a computational method that doesn't rely on sequence similarity to identify viral components, specifically bacteriophages. They trained feed-forward, back-propagation networks classified protein sequences by amino acid composition and isoelectric point. The first goal was achieved with an ensemble of five networks that identified a broad spectrum of phage and viral proteins with 80% accuracy. The second goal was met with two ensembles of 10 networks that were more specific than the structural networks in identifying capsid or tail proteins.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a cancer-causing virus with a large genome that encodes over 85 proteins, including unique and conserved herpesviral proteins. One of these proteins, SH ORF20, is part of the herpesiral UL24 family, but its function and role in the viral life cycle are not well understood. OR20 encodes three uncharacterized isoforms, mainly found in nuclei and nucleoli. Researchers used quantitative purification to mass spectrometry (q-AP-MS) to identify interacting partners of OR20, including ribosomal and interferon-stimulated gene (IS) oligoadylate synthase-like (OL) protein. Both endogenous and transiently transfected OL co-immunprecipitated with OR20, conserved among OR isoforms and OR20 homologs in other herpesviruses. Characterization of OL partners by-APMS showed a similar interactome to OR20. Both OR20 and OL copurified with 40 and 60 ribosomal subunits, associating with polys when coexpressed. OR20 did not affect translation, but enhanced IR-induced expression of endogenous OL in an IR3-dependent, IFN-independent manner. OL has antiviral activity against some viruses, but its role in gammaherpesviruses was unknown. Researchers found OL and OR20 expression increased after reactivation of latently infected HuLT-rSH.219 cells. Intriguingly, OL enhanced KSH infection, but not with OR20 mutant.
A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Lassa fever virus disease (LVD) in children with fever and convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. The study included 913 febrile children aged 1-15 years admitted to a hospital over a year. Of these, 373 (40.9%) had fever, and 108 (29%) presented with convuls. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13.5% (95% CI 1.9-5.7) in febr admissions, 2.8% in children with convuls, and 3.8% without convuls. Only vomiting and bleeding were associated with increased prevalence of LVD. Lassa virus is an important cause of undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas, but not associated with convuls in feile children. Its prevalence and lack of clinical differentiation underscores the importance of high suspicion in diagnosis. Screening feile children with undifferent fever in endemic for L could be a medical and public health measure.
Researchers have identified a new genetic factor that helps plants resist drought, a major cause of crop yield loss worldwide. They studied Arabidopsis, a plant commonly used in research, and found a receptor called KIN2 that responds to a class of chemicals called karri found in smoke. Karri promote seed germination and seedling growth under stress. Mutations in K2 made plants more sensitive to water loss, leading to increased water loss, cell damage, and stomatal opening. They also had reduced anthocyan production and were less sensitive to a hormone ABA in stomatal closure and cotyledon opening. Genome analysis revealed associated genes involved in these changes. ABA and K2 signaling pathways interact in drought response. Comparison with another receptor mutant showed strigolones contribute to drought adaptation, but not cuticle development. The study suggests manipulating K2 and 14 signaling may improve drought resistance. K2 regulates drought through membrane, stomatal, cuticle, and anthyan production. It is activated by karri or an unknown signal, regulating downstream genes in these processes. This contributes to plant adaptation to drought. The study shows K2's role in Arabidopsis survival after water deficit and explains its function, highlighting an unknown signal and K2 pathway in drought resistance.
Researchers have investigated the role of insulin signaling in the growth and development of Schistosoma japonicum, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans. They focused on the insulin receptors (SIR) of S. japonicum, which they had previously cloned and characterized. They found that human insulin binds to a specific part of the IR, called the L subdomain, using a technique called biolayer interferometry. They then used a method called RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce the expression of the IR in adult S. japon in a lab dish and found that this reduced the transcription of other genes involved in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. They also observed a decrease in glucose uptake in the IR-knockdown worms compared to controls. In experiments with mice, they found that a vaccine made from a part of the IR, called SLD, reduced growth, intestinal worm density, and egg production in S. japon. These results suggest that the IR could be a target for a vaccine against schistosomiasis in China and the Philippines.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a leading cause of disability in the Pacific region, affecting over 96% of the 1.7 million population at risk of infection. Current mass drug administration (MDA) has reduced lymphatic filariasis prevalence, but mosquito biology complicates the strategy. In some regions, evidence suggests the goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone. Obligate mosquitoes provide targets for breaking the LF cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector, Aedes aegypti, in the South. Researchers demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in Aegypt strain 'CP' stably infected with endosymbiotic Wolbachia from Aedesalbopictus. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays show CP males are competitive, resulting in population elimination when introduced into wild Aegpt populations. This strategy is feasible and encourages field tests as a supplement to ongoing M efforts.
A study in Tanzania's Uram District estimated the burden of Rhodesian trypanosomiasis (HAT) in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and financial costs. Data from 143 patients admitted to Kali Health Centre in 2004 for HAT treatment were used. Direct and indirect costs incurred by patients and health services were calculated. DALs were estimated using the Global Burden Project's methods and previous H estimates, assuming 45% under-reporting. The estimated DALs for H in Uram District with and without weighting were 215.7 (95% CI 155.3-287.5) and 281.6 (95% CI 209.1-362.6) respectively. When 45% underreporting was included, results were 622.5 (95% CI 155.3-109.9) and 978.9 (95 CI 201.1-187.8). The cost of treating 143 patients was $15,514, with patients paying $3,673 and services $11,841. Indirect non-medical costs for 143 were $9,781. The study shows H imposes a significant burden on rural communities in Tanzania, highlighting the need for location-specific estimates in countries with many infectious diseases concentrated in certain areas.
Researchers studied mice with a genetic mutation in the Ngly gene, which codes for an enzyme that removes sugar molecules from proteins. These mice were born with severe symptoms and died early in development. The study found that deleting another gene, Eng, which also removes sugar from proteins, partially saved the mice from death. This suggests that Ng enzyme's main function is to remove sugar from proteins. The study also found that changing the mice's genetic background to a mix of C57 and ICR strains partially saved the mice from death. However, mice with both Ng and Eng mutations had severe symptoms similar to humans with Ng mutation. Deleting Eng in these mice also reduced symptoms. The study suggests that mice with Ng or Ng/Eng mutations could be used to study human disease and that Ng enzyme could be a target for treatment.
Researchers studied how the gene expression of the hunch (hb) gene in fruit flies (Drosophila) is controlled by a maternal gradient of the Boid (B) protein. They found that gene expression is subject to noise, or variability, which must be constrained for development to be reproducible and coordinated. They identified how noise is controlled by characterizing the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output on promoter structure and transcription dynamics. A model of the hb promoter was created, where the number and strength of B and self-regulatory binding sites can be varied. Parameters were fit to data from wild-type, self-regulatory mutant, and lacZ reporter constructs using different portions of the promoter. Results indicate that wild-type self-regulatory hb noise is dependent on transcription and translation dynamics, not B fluctuations. Constructs lacking self-regulation show that multiple B binding sites in the promoter play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to variation in B binding site number across fly species. This study shows how promoter structure and dynamics reduce noise in hb output, features common in many genes, such as multiple sites, cooperativity, and self-feedback, contributing to understanding of reproducibility and determinacy in early development.
Researchers have studied how selection acted against Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans after hybridization. They developed a new method to estimate the strength and density of selection against Neander alleles in human genomes. The study found that East Asians had more Neander ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. Most selection against Neander was due to weakly deleterious alleles that were neutral in Neander but became harmful in humans. These alleles had a big impact on early human-Neander hybrids. The study suggests population size may play a bigger role in shaping introgression than thought.

The researchers used data on Neander ancestry in modern humans to test their predictions. Their results show how selection shaped Neander contribution to human genomes and shed light on Neander-human hybridization. There is evidence selection against Neander autosomal alleles in anatomically modern humans. This study is one of the first to estimate strength of selection against introgression between populations. The method is based on previous work on selective sweeps and linked variation.

The study found patterns of Neander in humans are consistent with purifying selection against weakly deleterious alleles. They argue that most selection against Neander is due to alleles that were neutral in Neander but became harmful in humans due to larger population size. These alleles had a big effect on Neander introgression in humans. The study suggests population size and neutral dynamics are key to introgression levels across species and genome.
Researchers have studied how the HIV virus controls its own gene expression after it integrates into a host cells. They found that fluctuations in gene expression can lead to either an active or inactive state, contributing to the formation of a latent state. In some cells, gene expression is dynamic, switching between active and inactive modes. This switching may help establish and maintain latency, as viral expression can be delayed before activation. The HIV promoter contains two key elements, Sp1 and NF-κ, that regulate gene expression by recruiting activating and repressing complexes. The team hypothesized that interplay between these factors modulates the stability of active and inactive states and sensitivity to fluctuations in the feedback loop. They used lentivirus variants with mutated Sp and NFκ elements to study their contributions to gene regulation. Results showed that Sp1 stabilizes both states, promoting gene expression and reducing histone acetylation and deacetylation. NFκ sites have distinct roles, with κI serving a stronger activating role than II. SpIII plays a key role in recruiting p300 and Rel to the promoter. Analysis of 362 clonal cell populations revealed mutations in Sp sites yield a 6-fold higher frequency of clonal bifcation compared to the wild-type. Each Sp and NFκ site differentially contribute to regulation, with Sp functionally dampening transcription noise and modulating latency. This may have implications for treating HIV latency.
A recent study compared the accuracy of nine orthology projects and methods, including COG, KOG, Inparan, Ortho, Ensembl, Compara, Homene, Round, EggNO, OMA, and two standard methods, bidirectional best and reciprocal distance. The researchers mapped millions of sequences, handled hundreds of millions of predicted ortholog pairs, and computed tens of thousands of trees. Phylogenetic and functional analysis showed that OMA and Homene performed best at high specificity, while OrthoCL outperformed Ensembl and Inan at lower specificity but higher coverage. EggG provided large coverage for broad functional grouping but was not specific for phylogen or detailed analyses. The study found that Ensembl's complex reconciliation approach was outperformed by pairwise methods in phylogen tests, and bidirectional best-hit outperformed complex algorithms. The study provides guidance for orthology users, introduces methodology for verification, and sets standards for future approaches.
Researchers have developed a new approach to find treatments for schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms, where current treatments are failing due to resistance. They used a computational method called drug repurposing to identify new targets and potential drugs. Schistomias is a major health issue in tropical and subtropical regions with weak incentives for new drug development. The current treatment, praziquel, is 40 years old and mass use is leading to resistance. The team focused on kinases, proteins essential for parasite processes, and identified several as new targets. They mapped the kinome of Schistoma japonicum, and updated kinomes of S mansoni and haematium, and compared to the human kinome to find unique targets. This led to the identification of potential inhibitors, including bosutin, dasatin, and imatinib, and new inhibitors vetan, saratin, tideus, alocib, dinlib, and 22 new targets CHK, CDC, WEE, PAK, ME1. The study also suggested primary and secondary targets for approved drugs, allowing for new therapeutics development against this neglected disease.
Researchers studied how a protein called CREB binds to a partner protein called CBP to control gene expression. CRE is unstructured when not bound, but becomes structured upon binding. They used computer simulations to model the binding process and found that CRE folds into a helix after binding. The transition state of CRE resembles its unbound state, suggesting it becomes structured after committing to bind. This is different from models where CRE is pre-structured before binding. Adding more structure to CRE reduces binding rate, like a "fly-casting" process. Including non-native interactions creates non-specific complexes that speed up binding but don't change mechanism. This study shows how unstructured proteins can help recognize targets. Results match a recent NMR study and help understand binding kinetics. CRE's phosphorylated domain (pID) is unstructured when not bound, suggesting folding and binding happen together. Simulations show binding and folding occur together, but pID folds into helix after binding. The transition state of pID is similar to unbound state. Researchers used a G-type model based on pIDK complex structure and analyzed transition states using Bayesian formula. A recent NMR study suggested pID becomes structured after binding, forming encounter complexes to high-affinity. Here, pID changes upon binding, but concepts apply. Analysis shows structure formed after binding, making pID binding consistent with induced-fit, where ligand changes.
A systematic review analyzed the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean countries (LAC) from 1942 to 2014. The study aimed to assess the region's progress towards the World Health Assembly's 2012 resolution to eliminate schistosomias by 2020. The review included 132 articles with 1242 prevalence and intensity data points, mostly from Brazil (69.7%). Studies published after 2000 showed "hotspots" of high prevalence in Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia. These countries need to update their epidemiological status to re-design national programs and target elimination. Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but need follow-up surveys to verify status. The burden of chronic infection may still exist even in eliminated countries. Methodologies for monitoring and evaluating schosiasis programs varied, making cross-national comparisons difficult. Updating schias status in endemic countries and territories is needed to address public health interventions and verify elimination. Improved reporting and standardization of methodologies are recommended using WHO guidelines. Meeting the elimination goal requires additional epidemiological data by age and sex.
Researchers studied how HIV-1 is transmitted from one person to another through heterosexual contact. They looked at 167 full-length HIV-1 genomes and created 40 infectious clones from 6 pairs of people who transmitted the virus to each other. The goal was to see what makes HIV-1 more likely to be transmitted. They found that the virus selected during transmission, called the "transmitted founder" (TF), didn't have increased ability to infect cells or replicate in the body. It also didn't have more resistance to interferon-alpha (IF-α), a protein that helps fight viruses. The study suggests that HIV-1's ability to adapt to the body's immune system makes it less likely to be transmitted. 

The researchers used a method called single genome amplification to look at genetic changes during transmission. They also made clones of the TF and non-transmitted (NT) variants to see how they compared in the lab. They tested infectivity, resistance to antibodies, replication in cells, and IF-α resistance. Previous studies only looked at individual genes or NT from the other partner. This study looked at full HIV-1 from both partners and their genetic and phenotypic signatures during transmission. HIV-1 from donors wasn't transmitted by viruses with high IF-α resistance. Instead, other factors made them more likely to be transmitted. 

Previous studies found subtype B and C TF were resistant to IF-α compared to chronic viruses from the same person. This suggested HIV-1 selects variants that escape IF-α during transmission. This study looked at TF and NT from linked partners to see what makes HIV-1 transmitted. They found no difference in IFα resistance between TF and NT. Other factors made HIV-1 more likely to be transmitted.
Researchers studied how filarial parasites affect the lymphatic system in the body. They found that even without an immune system, lymphatic dilation occurs in mice infected with filarial parasites. However, severe lymphedema and elephantiasis, a complication of filariasis, requires an intact immune response in humans. To understand how filarial parasites directly affect lymphatics, researchers exposed human lymphatic endothelial cells to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected serum. Live parasites and filarial antigens induced significant proliferation and differentiation of lymphatic cells into tube-like structures in vitro. Serum from patients with chronic filariasis and lymphatic obstruction increased lymphatic cell proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. Differentiation into tube-like structures was associated with increased matrix metalloproteases and TIM inhibitors. Gene expression analysis showed filarial altered genes involved in cellular organization and junction pathways, decreasing transendothelial transport. Filarial parasites induce lymphogenesis and differentiation, providing insight into filariasis pathology.
Researchers have developed a new method to extract and amplify the genetic material from individual bacteria without growing them in a lab. This is important because most bacteria can't be grown in a lab, making it hard to study them. A technique called Multiple Displacement Amplification (DA) can amplify DNA from a single cell, eliminating the need to grow the bacteria. A microfluid device was used to isolate E. coli and amplify DNA in 60-nanol reactions. Results show that smaller reactions reduce nonspecific synthesis from contaminant DNA and primer interactions. The quality of amplification was assessed by PCR and compared to standard 50-μl reactions. Amplification bias was greatly reduced in nanol volumes, providing a more even representation of all sequences. Single-cell amplicons from both microl and nanol volumes provided high-quality data by high-throughput pyrosequencing, demonstrating a straightforward route to sequencing from single cells.

A study compared DA on single genome amplification and found that bias is reduced and specificity increased as volume shrinks from microl to nanol. Single-cell isolation and genome amplification was performed using a microfluid chip with 60-n reactors. Whole genome recovery from single cells helps study ecology and evolution, as most microorganisms can't be obtained pure. DA enables amplification from cells isolated by flow cytometry or dilution. Micromanipulation allowed cells by FISH using 16S rRNA probes, increasing confidence of single in DA reactions. Partial sequencing single amplicons has been demonstrated.
Researchers studied the relationship between viruses from the Orthohant genus and their hosts in the Atlantic Forest, a region in South America. These viruses can cause lethal diseases in humans and are mainly transmitted by Sigmod rodents. The rodents shed different viruses, such as the emerging Arara orthohant, and factors like population variation may influence transmission within and between populations. The researchers tested how landscape structure, particularly agricultural and forest remnants, affects rodent hosts in the Atlantic Forest. They used 283 rodent capture records and geographically weighted models to test predictors. They also assessed correspondence between virus hosts in rodent communities and human vulnerability to infection across the Forest. Results showed virus host proportions were more influenced by landscape diversity than habitat or agricultural type. Small mammal diversity positively influenced pathogenic virus hosts, indicating habitat quality may be more important than competition with native species. Sugarcane plantations increased rodent hosts, while defaunation did not correlate with pathogenic virus proportion. The match between hotspots and human vulnerability was 17%, coldspots 20%. The study found strong land use influences virus hosts across the Forest. Findings suggest surveillance in southern and southeastern regions where high host and vulnerability match. Analyses suggest complex rodent dynamics and disease interactions than hypothesized.
Researchers investigated the role of BCL proteins in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus. They found that the survival of infected cells depends on BCL, a pro-survival B2 protein, due to suppression of the expression of another pro-surival protein M1. Treatment with BCL inhibitors or deficient BCL gene expression induced BAX/BA-dependent apoptosis upon infection with flaviruses. Flivirus attenuated protein synthesis, leading to reduction of short-lived proteins like M1. Inhibition of BXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. The study also examined the role of BXL in death of JEV-infected cells in vivo. Deficiency of BXL and administration of BH mimetic compounds increased survival after J infection and suppressed inflammation. The results suggest BXL plays a crucial role in survival of infected cells with flaviruses and BXL may be a novel antiviral target to suppress Flavidae viruses.
A study estimated the economic impact of rabies in Vietnam from 2005-2014 and found that the total cost was over $719 million. The largest portion, 92%, was due to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) costs. Canine rabies resulted in 36,560 to 45,700 disability-adjusted life years (DALs) and 914 human deaths. The death rate was 0.11 per 100,000 people, lower than in other Asian countries. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75. The study suggests that controlling rabies through vaccination is more effective than relying on P administration. In Vietnam, like other Asian countries, there are large expenditures on P and small investments in vaccination. The majority of rabies costs are associated with P, while dog vaccination costs are minimal. Livestock losses are a small portion of total costs, but may be significant for individual producers. The study found that Vietnam's rabies burden is consistent with other Asian countries, with more money spent on P than prevention through vaccination.
Researchers have studied the Type II Secretion System (TSS), a molecular machine that helps bacteria secrete proteins across their outer membrane. A key component of this system is the secretin, a protein that forms a pore in the outer membrane. They found that there are three types of TSS based on the secretin's structure. By comparing two types, Klebsella and Vibrio, they discovered that a protein called pilot helps assemble and transport secretin into the membrane. The researchers determined the structure of a new pilot protein called Asp from Vibrio cholera, which is similar in function but not structure to other pilots. Asp binds to a specific sequence in Vibrio secretin, enhancing assembly and is found in all Vibrio species and some Escherichia and Shella with Vib-type TSS. 

The study found that Vibrio and Shella bacteria use Asp to assemble TSS, but not previously detected in Vib cholera genome. Cholera pathotypes with Vib-type secretin depend on Asp to assemble TSS. A possible reason for this is that some bacteria acquired a complete secretin-pilot-substrate unit with rest of TSS. An example is EPEC and Sboyii. The structure of Asp shows no similarity to Pul-Out family proteins, but binds to S-domain in Vibrio secretin, distinguishing from Kleiella-type. Genomes with Vib-type secretin have Asp, while those with Klei-type have Pul-Out. Phylogeny of Vibrio secretins matches Asp sequences.
Researchers have identified a protein, Omp37, on the surface of Leptira bacteria that binds to human skin and vascular elastin, a key component of skin and blood vessels. This binding is a crucial step in the bacteria's ability to infect and colonize the host. The study found that Omp37 binds to elastin with high affinity, and also to other proteins such as fibrinogen, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and laminin. The binding to elastin is enhanced by antibodies produced by the host, suggesting that these antibodies may aid the bacteria's attachment to elastin-rich tissues. Omp37 is also recognized by antibodies from patients with leptospi and infected hamsters, indicating an immune response to the protein. The protein is found in pathogenic Leptira but not saprophytic Leira, suggesting it plays a role in disease. The researchers propose that O37 facilitates the bacteria's initial attachment to skin through its strong binding to elastin, a key step in the infection process.
Researchers have identified two antibodies, 4E and 2F, that can neutralize HIV by binding to a specific regions on the virus called the membrane-proximal external (MP) region of gp41. This region is exposed during the early stages of viral entry into a host cells. To understand how these antibodies work, a model was created to calculate the probability of an antibody disabling gp41 before fusion is complete. The model shows that for these antibodies to be effective, the time to disable the region must be shorter than the time it remains in a stable conformation, about 5 minutes or less for 4 and 5. The study also looked at the role of antibody strength in neutralization and found that 2F is more effective than 4. This is because 2 interacts more strongly with the viral membrane than 4. The model was used to determine the factors that allow these antibodies to disable regions and was extended to analyze neutralization data. The extended model shows that the rate of antibody binding, rate of gp41 fusion, and number of gp bridges between virus and cell at the start of pre-fusion determine neutralization. Experiments showed that only a small number of gp bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion, but the model cannot determine the exact number from experiments alone.
Researchers conducted a study in Mali and Senegal to see if mass treatment with ivermectin could eliminate onchercias in areas where the disease is common. They gave ivermect to people in three areas for 15 years, every 6 months to see if infection and transmission levels would go down and if treatment could be stopped. After 5 years, they checked 29,753 people and 49,600 blackflies for onchercia larvae. Infection and transmission levels went down in all three areas. In two areas, onercia was almost gone 3 years after treatment stopped. In the third area where onerc was high before, it went down to low levels 3-5 years after treatment. The study shows that onercias can be eliminated with iverectin in some areas of Africa.
Researchers have studied the protein VP4 of the rhinovirus, a virus that causes the common cold, to understand how it helps the virus enter cells. Rhinirus is part of the picornavirus family, which includes poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus. The study found that VP4, a small protein on the virus, interacts with the cell membrane and helps deliver the viral genome into the cell to start replication. They made a version of VP with a tag and showed it can make holes in liposome membranes, small enough for single-stranded RNA to pass through. Experiments showed VP forms a multi-protein pore, consistent with the size of the viral genome. The effect of VP on membranes was similar to that of the real virus, and was influenced by pH. This study provides a mechanism for how VP helps the virus enter cells and suggests it could be a target for antiviral treatment for the picavirus family.
Francisella tularens (Ft) is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease classified as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers identified three enzymes required for lipid A carbohydrate modifications in Francisella novicida (Fn), a pathogen of mice: mannose (m1), galactamine (m2), and both (m). Mutants lacking galactamine (m2) or galosamine/mannose (m) were attenuated in mice by pulmonary and subcutaneous infection routes. Aerosolization of mutants m2 and mK provided protection against wild-type Fn, while subcut administration of mK provided protection from Fn. Infection of alveolar macrophage line mK induced higher levels of tumor necrosis-α (TN-α) and macrophage inhibitory-2 (M-2) compared to Fn. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from Toll receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR2 knockout mice infected mK produced higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) and M-2 than MM infected Fn. However, production IL-6 and M2 was undetectable in MM from MyD- mice infected either. MyD mice were susceptible to mK infection. Researchers hypothesize that m's ability to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemine production and innate responses mediated by MyD signaling may be responsible for attenuation, leading to induction of immunity by m.

Francisella lipid A is different from classical enteric bacteria in structure and biological activities. Francisella has tetra-acyl chains 16-18 carbons length and phosphate at 4 position removed by L phosphatase. This can be modified by addition galosamine 1-phosphate. Activation of innate system and induction pro-inflammatory via MyD signaling were essential for clearance m and possibly protection. Results suggest carbohydrate modifications play role in virulence and immunity and may aid Francisella vaccine development.
Researchers have studied the role of Era, a protein involved in ribosome assembly, in Staphylococcus aureus. Era is a GTPase that acts as a switch to coordinate ribosome assembly and is conserved across all domains of life. In S. aureus, Era is not essential for growth, but important for 30 ribosomal subunit assembly. Era interacts with 16S rRNA enduclease Y and DEAD-box helicase C, and both are required for rRNA processing and growth at low temperatures. Era and C also interact with ppG synthase Rel, which impacts Era's GTP activity and C's helicase activity. Era is proposed to act as a hub on the ribosome, directing enzymes for rRNA processing and subunit assembly. The stringent response, triggered by ppG, inhibits Era's activity, contributing to slowed growth. The response also impacts Era's interaction with Y and C, affecting rRNA processing.
Researchers investigated the effects of anthrax lethal toxin (LT) on mice and found that the heart is an early target of the toxin. Mice lacking neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were more sensitive to LT, while mice lacking other NOS enzymes were not. The increased sensitivity of NOS- mice was not due to macrophage or cytokine responses, but could be replicated in wild-type mice with pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme. Histological analysis showed LT caused changes in heart morphology of N- mice, with novel inter-fiber spaces and no cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Electron microscopy revealed pathological changes in hearts of both N- and wild-type mice, varying in severity and timing. Biomarkers of cardiac injury were elevated in LT mice rapidly, and cardiac protective therapy did not help. Surprisingly, a nitric oxide scavenger carbox-PT showed some protection. Echocardiography indicated reduced ejection fraction in both N and wild mice, indicating decreased heart function. The study suggests the heart is an early target of LT and a protective role for N against cardiac damage.
Scientists have developed a new method to edit genes in parasitic nematodes, which infect over 1 billion people worldwide and cause neglected diseases. They used a tool called CRISPR-C9 to disrupt a gene in the human-paritic worm Strongyloides steralis, resulting in worms with severe motility defects. This was the first time a gene has been disrupted in a parasitic nematode. The team also used CRPR-C9 to disrupt a gene in another parasitic nemode, Strongloides ratti, a parasite of rats. They showed that CRPR-C9 can be used in different parasitic nematodes, making it possible to study their biology and develop treatments. The method involves delivering CRPR-C9 into adult worms and using their complex life cycle. The team found that CRPR-C9 works best in the first generation of worms, but can be passed to later generations. They also showed that CRPR-C can be used with or without a repair template, resulting in deletions at the target site. This is a major breakthrough for studying parasitic nematodes, which have been hard to study due to lack of genetic tools.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the effects of ribosome drop on translation and ribosome density along mRNA. Ribosome drop occurs when cells are under stress, such as amino acid starvation or high recombinant protein expression, affecting protein expression efficiency. The model shows ribosome premature termination leads to non-intuitive ribosome profiles, with density increasing from 5' to 3' end. Importantly, it predicts rib drop effects on translation are mRNA-specific and quantifies resilience to drop, showing mRNAs with ribosomes are less affected than those without. Among mRN without ribosomes, resilience to drop correlates with elongation rate, fast codons are less affected. Genome-wide analysis in S. cerevisiae reveals mRN coding translation machinery, biased fast codons are resilient to drop. In physiological conditions, mRN regulatory stress proteins are less resilient to drop. The model explains variations in translational efficiency accounting for ribosome behaviors and mRNA density from profiling studies. 

The model predicts mRN sustaining ribosomes for initiation are less affected by drop than those without. It also shows mRN without ribosomes with higher translation rates are more resilient to drop. Ribosome drop increases under stress, such as amino acid starvation. Accounting for drop in translation is crucial for interpreting ribosome data and estimating rates. Ribosome profiling shows drop is significant under physiological, especially under stress. The model reveals drop effects are mRNA-specific, codon composition and configuration affecting loss due to drop. Resilience to drop might change upon stress redistribution of translational resources affecting initiation.
Researchers are studying ways to stop the spread of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, which affect millions of children worldwide. The current strategy is to give medicine to school-age children, but this doesn't always work because adults and the environment can still have the infection. Some think giving medicine to everyone in a community might be a better way to stop the spread. However, it's hard to get everyone to take the medicine. A study called DeW3 is testing this idea. It will give medicine to some communities for three years, then watch for two years to see if the infection comes back. The researchers want to know if they can tell if the spread is stopped earlier than two years. They used a computer model to simulate the study and found that communities with high medicine coverage can stop the spread, but it's hard to tell if it's working after one year. They suggest checking after two years unless medicine coverage is low. If not stopped, the infection can come back to old levels, so it's good to know early if it's working to save time and money. The study also looks at medicine safety and how well it works.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine against cholera, a disease caused by Vibrio cholera bacteria. The vaccine is made from a specific part of the bacteria called O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) and a fragment of tetanus toxin. They tested the vaccine in mice and found it was effective in protecting against cholera. The vaccine worked best when given with an adjuvant, a substance that helps the body's immune system respond. The vaccine also induced memory cells that remember the bacteria, providing long-term protection. This is especially important for young children, who do not respond well to polysacchar antigens alone. Previous studies showed that infection with one type of Vibrio cholera does not protect against another, despite having the same core part of the bacteria. The researchers used a recombinant tetanus toxoid fragment as a carrier, which can be used in other vaccines as well. The cholera O1 Ogawa strain is immunogenic in mice, so they tested if a conjugate vaccine with OSP from this strain would also be immunogenic.
Researchers have discovered that the fungus Candida albicans can inhibit the virulence of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa by suppressing the production of pyelin and pyoverine, which play a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. In a mouse model of gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination, Candida albicans reduced the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting pyelin and pyoverine expression. Deletion of the pyelin and pyine genes in Pseudas aeruginosa attenuated its virulence. Heat-killed Candida albicans had no effect on Pseud aeruginosa, but Candida secreted proteins directly suppressed Pseud pyoverine and pyelin expression and inhibited Pseud virulence in mice. Interestingly, deletion of pyelin and pyine had no effect on Pseud aerugin's ability to colonize the gut but decreased its cytotoxic effect on colonocytes. Oral iron supplementation restored Pseud aerugin virulence in Candida and Pseud aerugin colonized mice. The findings provide insight into how bacterial-fungal interactions can modulate bacterial virulence in the intestine.
Researchers studied how a virus that evades CD8 T cell recognition, a key part of the immune system, affects the outcome of infection. This virus, called EM, is less fit than the normal virus and often reverts back to normal upon transmission to a new host. However, the rate of reversion varies greatly. The study used a sensitive test to measure reversion of SIV and SHIV viruses with small amounts of normal virus in macaques. Infection with a mix of EM and normal virus resulted in rapid growth of normal virus within 7 days. In contrast, infection with smaller amounts of normal virus or pure EM resulted in delayed reversion and lower viral loads. The amount of virus in the inoculum determines the timing of reversion, which predicts the outcome of infection. Delayed reversion suggests opportunities to reduce pathogenicity during early infection.
Researchers studied yeast populations in Evolution Canyon, Israel, and found that some strains are highly resistant to the heavy metal cadmium. They discovered that this resistance is primarily due to a gene called PCA1, which helps remove cadmium from the cell. Analysis showed that changes in the PCA1 promoter, not the coding region, are responsible for the increased activity. Experiments found that three specific nucleotides in the PCA promoter increase its activity, making cells more resistant to cadmium. These nucleotides are also found in other yeast species and are important for cadmium resistance, suggesting they are an ancestral trait. However, they diverged in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations where cadmium is low or absent. This is a rare example of a selective sweep in yeast driven by a trade-off between metal resistance and fitness.
Researchers identified three major oncogenic pathways in gastric cancer (GC) that are linked to patient survival: proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-caten. These pathways are deregulated in more than 70% of gastric cancers. The team used gene expression signatures to map patterns of oncogenic activation in 301 primary gastric cancers. They functionally validated these predictions in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway showed reproducible and significant differences in survival in multiple cohorts, suggesting pathway interactions play a role in disease behavior. Gastric cancers can be taxonomized by oncogenic activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. Predicting pathway by expression allows study of multiple pathways simultaneously in cancers at scale not achievable by other platforms.

The researchers developed an in silico method to map pathway activation levels in tumor profiles and validated pathway classification using breast cancer examples. They applied this method to 11 oncogenic pathways implicated in gastric carcinogenesis, including RAS, p53, BRCA, W/βaten, E, SRC, MYC, NF-κ, histone deacetylation, and stem-cell signatures. The strategy involves four steps: defining pathway signatures, mapping onto gene profiles, validating, and applying to primary GC. Gastric cancer is the second cause of global mortality, with most patients diagnosed with advanced disease. Deregulation of oncogenic pathways such as E, KAS, p, and W/aten signaling occur in GC, indicating molecular heterogeneity.
Researchers used a method called stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) to analyze the Escherichia coli K12 genome and found that sites prone to strand separation under superhelical stress are often located in intergenic regions, particularly near promoters. They investigated whether genes with different functions have characteristic S properties in their upstream regions and found that those involved in transcription regulation have strong S sites. Specifically, genes that respond to environmental stimuli have more destabilized upstream regions than those that don't. If a gene is controlled by a transcription regulator with a destabilized 5' flank, the genes in that pathway often have strong S sites too. This association was seen in 38 of 43 free-living bacteria but only 4 of 18 endosymbion or parasitic bacteria. The study suggests S sites may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes that alter superelicity. The researchers looked at genes in E coli12 that respond to stimuli and found they are more likely to have highly destabil 5' flanks. They grouped genes into categories and found strong S sites are associated with those that function in transcription, including activators, repressors, and two-component systems. This was also seen in other freeiving bacteria but not endosymb or paras.
Researchers have studied the role of high-mob group (HMG) proteins in the fungus Podospora anserina, a type of filamentous ascomycete. HMG proteins are DNA-binding proteins that control gene expression in various processes, including development and metabolism. P anserina has 12 HMG genes, four of which were previously characterized, controlling mating and fruit-body development. The remaining eight uncharacterized HMG genes were analyzed, and seven were found to be involved in the sexual cycle, but not essential for viability. Two HMG genes, PaMG5 and Pa9, stand out. Pa5 is an activator of mating-type genes, while Pa9 is a repressor of specific to stationary phase and hyphal anoses. Transcription analysis of HMG genes in deletion strains showed Pa5 is central to a network regulating mating-type and mating target genes. Genetic analysis revealed this network also controls fertility genes not regulated by mating factors. This study highlights the importance of HMG in sexual reproduction, with 11 of 12 members involved in the cycle. Pa5 and its ortholog Sp11 from Schizoscharomyces pombe are conserved regulators of mating genes, despite diverging 550 million years ago. Two HMG, SO9 and its regulator S, also play a role in sex determination in mammals. The anina and pombe mating genes and regulator form a module analogous to the SRY/SOX module, showing common sex regulation in animals and fungi.
During the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic, there was a lack of data on the persistence of the virus in survivors' body fluids and the risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. To address this, an observational study was conducted in Sierra Leone during the epidemic response. The study aimed to determine the persistence of the virus in survivors' body fluids and assess the risk of transmission. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase assessed the persistence of the virus in the semen of 100 adult men within five months of the initial discussions. The second phase assessed the persistence in multiple body fluids (semenstrual, blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, tears) of 120 men and 120 women. Data from the study informed national and global guidelines in real-time, demonstrating the need for semen testing among virus survivors. The study accelerated the implementation of such programs in virus-affected countries and informed studies on persistence of Zika virus.
Researchers have studied how bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli, sense and respond to chemical gradients in their environment. They used a technique called fluorescence resonance energy transfer to measure how the bacteria's chemotactic pathway responds to different concentrations of chemicals. By analyzing this data, they predicted the types of gradients bacteria typically encounter in their natural habitat. They also used information theory and simulations to understand how the bacteria transmit and process this information, accounting for internal and external noise. The results show that bacteria usually encounter exponential gradients, leading to a log-normal distribution of stimuli and maximum velocity. This is a step towards understanding the complex environments bacteria live in, such as the human intestine.

The study used dose-response curves from FRET measurements and swimming bacteria simulations to show that maximizing information means aligning with the chemical gradient and velocity. This suggests bacteria have evolved to perceive exponential gradients. The Weber-Fech law, which describes perception changes in concentration, doesn't predict gradient distribution, but views it as useful for the cell. The researchers quantified this view of signaling by matching stimulus statistics to cellular responses. The chemotactic system allows bacteria to detect and move towards nutrients or toxins. It's relatively simple with few components and understood at the molecular level, sharing design principles with other sensory systems like Weber law, Weber-Fech, and fold detection. The study connects these laws to information at the molecular level, unlike previous research.
Researchers have long believed that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which produce all blood cells, have an indefinite lifespan due to their ability to self-renew. However, evidence suggests that identical HSCs have different lifespans, and that lifespan is predetermined and intrinsic to the cell. Lifespan is defined as the time a HSC produces all mature blood cells. This raises the question: what controls lifespan of Hs within the same animal, exposed to same environment? A new model based on reliability theory explains diversity of lifans of Hs. Using clonal repulation experiments and computational-mathematic modeling, small-scale molecular failures at H population level were tested. The best fit of data is provided by a model where repulation kinetics of H are largely anti-persistent, mean-reverting processes. Failure rates increase during division events are counteracted by repair processes, leading to a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior. This is due to increased failure rate of selfnew, leading to clonal extinction. The capacity of Hs is self-limit. Lifespan of each H depends on amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in failure kinetics. Short and longer Hs differ in ability to dissipate perturbations. This suggests lifespan is determined by differences in repair capacity.
Researchers have discovered a new way that antibodies help fight off parasitic worms that infect one-third of the world's population. These worms, called helminths, cause chronic infections with no effective vaccines available. Antibodies and a type of immune cell called macrophages play a crucial role in fighting these infections. However, how antibodies target these large parasites was unclear. Scientists found that helth-specific antibodies trap and prevent damage caused by migrating worms in mice. Without these antibodies, worms moved freely and caused tissue damage. Antibodies also made macrophages stick to worms in a lab dish, immobilizing them. Antibodies reprogrammed macroages to express genes that help heal wounds, making worms less mobile. This effect happened without a known signaling pathway called IL-4α. The study shows a new way antibodies activate macroages to fight helths and prevent tissue damage.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the early stages of DNA repair in living cells without interfering with the process. DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are a major threat to genome integrity, and cells repair them through homologous recombination (HR) with an intact copy of the broken locus. The broken DNA mobility has been seen to increase during search for a donor copy. However, observing chromosome dynamics during early steps of HR, mainly resection from DSB that generates recombinogenic strands, requires a system that doesn't interfere with the process and is relative to few kilobases of DNA that undergo processing.

The new method uses oligomerization rather than multiplicity to form visible foci and was applied to cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III, providing real-time analysis of resection in living cells. Monitoring dynamics of chromatin next to DSB revealed transient confinement of damaged chromatin during early steps of re, consistent with keeping DNA ends in contact. Resection in y70 mutant began 10 minutes earlier than wild type, defining period of commitment to homology-dependent repair.

The new method will be widely applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome dynamics and function in normal and pathological contexts. An alternative used to analyze HR is visualization of fluorescent-tagged proteins to resect DNA, but suffer from loss of function due to fused peptide and intervene at later stages. Labelling chromosomal near irreparable Ds with fluorescent arrays enabled tracking migration to nuclear periphery and movement confined within 2 hours of cleavage.
Researchers studied the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in people living in areas where the disease is common. They used computer models to estimate how often people get reinfected with the parasite and when this happens in the course of the disease. The models were based on data from villages in Argentina where many people have mixed infections with different types of the parasite. The results showed that about 3.2% of people get reinfected each year, with most happening in the chronic stage of the disease. In about 20% of the time, the parasite evades the immune system after the first infection. This means people can get reinfected multiple times. Over 5 and 30 years, the risk of getting reinfected is around 14-18% and 60-70%, with most people getting reinf 1-3 times. The low rates are due to weak transmission and not a strong immune response. These findings are important for developing a vaccine and understanding the risk of chronic disease in people living in areas where Chagas is common.
Researchers studied the immune response to deng virus (DENV) infection in a group of Thai school-aged children who experienced either a mild or severe form of the disease. They collected blood samples before infection and stimulated them with DENV in a lab to measure the production of 30 cytokines. The results showed differences in cytokine production based on the type of D used and the severity of illness. Those who developed severe D had higher levels of IL-15 and MCP-1, while those with mild had higher levels of IL-6. Lower levels of IL-12, IL-2, MIP-α, RANT, GM-CSF, and TNα were found in those with severe D. These findings suggest that pre-existing immune responses to D are linked to the outcome of infection. The study supports the idea of both protective and pathologic immune profiles in response to D. This could be useful for evaluating responses to D vaccines.
In the fruit fly wing disc, the Hedgehog (H) protein forms an extracellular gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior-posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. The prevailing view is that H functions as a classical morphogen, but a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and H concentration has not been demonstrated. Researchers found that interpretation of H signaling depends on the history of exposure to H and propose that a single concentration is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Using mathematical modeling, they predict that only two domains can be defined in response to H, suggesting the boundaries of two or more gene patterns cannot be specified by a static H gradient. Computer simulations suggest a "overshoot" of the H gradient, a transient in which H is expanded compared to the H-state. Through examination of H target expression, patterns expand initially and then refine, providing in vivo evidence for the overshoot. The H gene architecture suggests this results from H-dependent upregulation of the receptor Patched (Ptc). Altering the network such that P is no longer upregulated in response to H-signaling, found patterns of expression, distinct in wild-type discs now overlap.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in mice that makes them more sensitive to ethanol and anesthetics. The mutation, called Lightweight (Lwt), disrupts a gene similar to the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. eleg) unc-79 gene. Mice with one copy of the mutation (heterozygotes) are more sensitive to ethanol and anesthetics, while those with two copies (homozygotes) die shortly after birth. Experiments with C. elegans show a similar sensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and related genes unc-80 and nca-1;n-2. Heterozygotes also respond differently to anesthetic isoflurane, similar to C elegans mutant phenotypes. Heterozygotes are more active in new environments and smaller than normal mice. They eat more food but are leaner, and consume more ethanol than normal littermates. This suggests a conserved pathway may influence alcohol behaviors in humans.
Researchers have identified a key immune pathway in the Anopheles gambiae mosquito that helps defend against Plasmodium falcum, the parasite that causes malaria. This pathway, called the Imd, is a conserved signaling pathway that has potent anti-Plmod activity. Silencing the expression of cas, a negative regulator of the I pathway, or overexpressing rel, an I-controlled NFappaB transcription factor, confers a resistant phenotype on A. gambia mosquitoes that involves an array of immune effector genes. However, unexplored features of this mechanism may be essential for implementation of a malaria control strategy. Using RNA interference to singly or dually silence cas and other I pathway components, researchers identified genes participating in anti-Plmod signaling regulated by cas, each a potential target for pathway overactivation. The I pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookin stage, yet has activity against early oocysts and lesser against lateocysts. Cas silencing alone is sufficient to induce a robust anti-P response in the absence of gut microbiota. The I pathway components TEP, APL, and LR1 are integral to infection-dependent defense, shedding light on laboratory versus natural infection models.
Researchers investigated the anti-fibrotic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMs) in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis caused by the fungus Paroccidiococcus brasiliensis. Mice were infected with the fungus and then received either BSCs or the antifungal drug itraconazole (TC) alone or in combination. The results showed that BSC therapy did not have an anti-frot effect and may even exacerbated the condition by promoting collagen expression and tissue remodeling. Histological analysis revealed increased granulomatous inflammation and fibrocy count in BSC-treated mice. Soluble collagen and collagen-3, TGF-β, MMP-8, and MMP-15 genes were also increased in those mice. However, combined BSC/TC therapy reduced TIMP-1 and MMP-13 expression. Human fibroblasts stimulated with lung supernatants from infected and BSC-transplanted mice showed higher collagen expression. The study found that BSC did not reduce fibrosis in infected mice, possibly due to interaction with the fungus or inflammatory environment. Combined therapy showed promising results by reducing TIM-1 and MMP-13.
Researchers studied the seasonal patterns of sand fly species that transmit Leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania infant, in the Mediterranean region. They collected over 99,000 specimens from 2011-2013 in eight countries where the disease was reported. The study aimed to understand how climate change affects sand fly populations and transmission. The results showed that fly activity varies by season and location, with some species appearing as early as April and others in June. Densities peaked in July-August, but some had multiple peaks from May-September. A new pattern was found for one species in Cyprus. Adult flies were active from September-November, with no correlation to temperature. The period of exposure to Leishias in the region was from May-October, with a peak in July-September. No transmission occurred from December-March. Females were active at night, peaking between 11pm-2am. The study found a pattern of behavior in selected sites, proposing them as monitoring areas. The risk of transmission was highest June-October, but not evenly distributed, with earlier and more frequent in southern territories.
Researchers have found that Orientia tsutsamushi, the bacteria that causes scrub typhus, can infect and alter the behavior of monocytes, a type of immune cell in the body. Monocytes play a key role in fighting infection and inflammation. When exposed to tsamushi, monocytes changed the expression of over 4,500 genes, including those involved in type I interferon and M1 polarization. Type I interferon is a protein that helps fight infection, while M1 is a type of monocyte that promotes inflammation. Tsamushi also induced apoptosis, or cell death, in some monocytes. These changes were similar to those seen in monocytes from patients with scrub typhus. The study suggests that tsushi activates monocytes, leading to M1 polarization and type I interferon response, which may be critical in the disease pathogenesis of typhus. This could lead to new tools for diagnosing patients with typhus. The study also found that tsushi upregulated genes involved in polarized immune responses, including IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, GM-CSF, and CCL20. Monocytes infected with live tsushi produced IF-β, while those with heat-killed bacteria did not. Only live tsushi induced type I interferon response in monocytes. Approximately 15% of genes upregulated in response to tsushi were cytokines or chemokines. Tsushi also upregulated genes in type I interferon pathway and apoptosis. These in vitro results were related to expression in patients with typh. The study highlights the role of interferon-mediated monocyte activation in the pathogenesis of typh.
Researchers have found that ants use a specific part of their brain called the mushroom body to remember routes through complex environments. This part of the brain has been studied before, but mostly for simple tasks like recognizing smells. A computer model of this brain circuit, developed for fruit flies, can also help explain how ants learn routes in natural environments. The model can store hundreds of images, making it a strong candidate for the brain's memory capacity. 

The researchers tested this model on ants that live in the desert and found it worked. They used real images from the ants' natural habitat to train the model, and it learned to distinguish between routes and non-routes. The model, originally made for flies, needed only minor changes to work for this more complex task. Ants and other insects like bees have larger mushroom bodies than flies, which may help with this ability.
Plants have an innate immune system to protect themselves from disease, similar to animals, but with unique mechanisms like shedding leaves to replace damaged organs. Researchers studied Arabidopsis thaliana leaves infected with Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterial pathogen, to understand this defense mechanism. They found that Pseudas syae lacking a type III secretion system didn't trigger leaf shedding, suggesting it's a new form of immunity triggered by effectors. Genes HAESA/ESA2, INFRESCIENCE, and NEVERED are required for pathogen-triggered shedding. Plants with mutations in salicylic acid signaling, phytoalexin, and senescence genes failed to shed leaves normally. Bacteria contacting shedding zones trigger a strong response, but signals are also sent from infected tissue to alert the shedding zone. A model proposes that leaves handle minor infections by limiting growth, but shed when out of control, leaves are shed. Salicy acid regulates both pathogen and drought-triggered shedding. 

A system was developed to study Pseudas syae pv tomato DC0 in Arabidopsis to understand defense mechanisms. This builds on a well-studied pathosystem where roset leaves from non-flowering Arabid are infected Pseudasae. The study defines a model for pathogen-triggered shedding in Arabid, explaining genetics. The abission pathway regulates all forms of inducible shedding in Arabid. A previous work showed Arabid leaves can be shed in response to drought. This study shows Arab uses shedding as a defense against bacterial infection. The response is robust and triggered by disease or ET. Disparate pathways regulating defense and shedding are connected, many components necessary for pathogen-trigger shedding. Salicy acid is necessary for full pathogen and drought-trigger shedding.
Researchers studied how starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina detect motion direction. These cells generate larger calcium signals when motion is moving towards their tips than away from them. To understand how they do this, the team measured responses to expanding and contracting circular visual stimuli. They found that fundamental and especially harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli, indicating nonlinearity. This suggests the relationship between harmonic amplitudes and potential is due to voltage-gated channels. Calcium changes in SAC dendrites were monitored using two-photon microscopy, showing the distal dendrite is tonically depolarized relative to the soma due to resting currents and high-voltage-activated Ca+ channels. Compartment modeling suggests dendritic direction selectivity in SACs can be computed by dendrites relying on voltageated channels and a dendritic gradient, providing spatial asymmetry for discrimination.

The team used circular stimuli to evoke distinct somatic and dendritic calcium responses. Dendritic calcium responses were seen in a minority of cells, while electrical responses were present in all. Blocking inhibitory receptors showed that a confined stimulus can produce a response independent of lateral interactions, demonstrating a dend-intrinsic mechanism. Blocking GABA and glycine receptors was required to completely block effects on dendritic signals, indicating GABA and glycine can contribute to dendritic DS. Pharmacological data showed DS persists when GABA receptor connections are blocked, suggesting SACs generate signals by themselves. Optical recordings showed strongest calcium increases in distal dendrites, near synapses. Isolation of sectors is necessary for local processing, provided by SAC morphology and low impedance at the soma.
Researchers studied how different types of pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, infect humans and cause harm. They found that the number of pathogens needed to infect a host, called the infective dose, varies greatly among species. It depends on how pathogens interact with the host cells, either locally or from a distance. Those that act locally require fewer pathogens to infect, but are not more likely to cause harm. Instead, pathogens that act from a distance are more likely to cause harm because they can infect many cells at once. The study analyzed 43 pathogens from various groups and found that locally acting pathogens have lower infect doses, but are not more virulent. Virulence, or harm caused, is actually linked to infect dose and how pathogens enter the body, with skin infections causing more harm than ingested or inhaled ones.
Researchers studied the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, a disease affecting 200 million people in underprivileged regions worldwide. They analyzed the 3' untranslated regions (3-UTR) of transcripts in juvenile and adult worms and found that the miR-277/498 family is significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult stage. They identified a novel miRNA, sm-mi-498, located proximal to smi-277, suggesting a miRNA cluster, and proposed hairpin structures for both miRNAs compatible with the miRNA pathway. Expression of smi-277/498 is upregulated in adults, while their targets are downregulated in adults but not in immature females. sm-498 is expressed in tegument cells near the oesophagus gland and throughout the male body. The study suggests mi-277/498 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation during development and sexual maturation of schistosomes. 

The researchers used a combined approach, including miRNA finder, to identify regulated genes by mi-277 in Schistosomes. The high-quality S. mansoni genome allowed them to query 3-UT regions for miRNA recognition sites conserved across Schist species. Incorporating expression data, they concluded sm-277 and sm-498 are primordial miRNAs driving transcriptional changes in development and maturation. In other schistosomes, mi-277 and mi-498 are 430 bases apart, forming a mi cluster with co-regulated expression. sm-277 has been detected in infected animals and humans, as well as secreted vesicles of schosula.
Researchers have found a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) in horseshoe bats in China since 2005. However, these viruses are different from the SARS virus in some genes and are not thought to be the direct ancestor of SARS. In a 5-year study, researchers found 11 new SARS-Co viruses in a cave in Yunn Province, China. The full genomes of these viruses, along with previous findings, show that S-CoVs in this location are diverse in some genes. Importantly, some viruses similar to SARS in certain parts of the S gene were found in this cave. Additionally, researchers discovered S-Co similar to human S in other parts of the gene. The viruses from this cave are more closely related to S in some genes compared to others. Recombination analysis shows that S-Co in this cave have mixed with each other. Researchers think the ancestor of SARS may have come from mixing of these viruses. Experiments showed three new S-Co with different proteins can use human receptor, showing they are close to S. This study helps understand SARS origin and importance of being prepared for future S-like diseases.
Researchers are examining the effectiveness of the faecal egg reduction test (FECRT) in detecting drug resistance in human hookworms. This test measures egg output before and after treatment to determine drug efficacy. However, a phenomenon called density-dependent fecundity may impact results, where surviving worms increase egg production after treatment. This can lead to underestimation of drug efficacy. The degree of underestimation depends on worms' ability to increase egg output, which varies among individuals due to pre-treatment constraints. Cases with heaviest infections may have greatest potential to increase egg output. Omitting these cases from FEC may reduce underestimation. This highlights the need for new resistance monitoring methods, such as in vitro assays or genotypic changes. 

 Studies on canine hookworms show density-dependent fecundity response to treatment, suggesting similar in humans. Human anthelmics may not meet livestock criteria, indicating suboptimal dosing. Constraints may be removed as worm density decreases. A study examined canine response to drug and human dataset on egg-output levels. Two isolates showed different resistance levels. Density-dependent fecund is widespread in STH, likely applying to humans. FEC data may be distorted by density fecundity, making resistance detection difficult. The faecal count test is currently used to detect resistance, but may be unreliable due to dynamic worm biology.
Epithelial heparan sulfate (HS) plays a crucial role in regulating Sonic Hedgehog (SH) signaling during lung development, a process known as branching morphogenesis. Researchers found that deleting HS synthase1, an enzyme responsible for producing HS, in epithelial cells led to expanded branching tips and reduced branching, along with mesenchymal developmental defects. They also observed increased FGF expression and FGF signaling in mutant lungs, suggesting a non-autonomous mechanism. Reduced SH signaling, which suppresses FGF expression, was also found in mutant lungs. Reactivating SH signaling in mutant lungs rescued tip dilation and attenuated F signaling. Importantly, reduced SH activity was not due to decreased Shh expression or protein stability, but biologically active SH proteins were reduced in mutant epithelium and wild-type mesenchym cells. The study highlights HS as a key player in dictating SH signaling for lung morphogenesis.
Paired-end sequencing is a technique used to detect genome rearrangements and structural variations on a genome-wide scale, particularly for copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions and translocations, which are common in cancer and produce novel genes. Researchers investigated how much sequencing is required to detect rearrangement and localize them precisely using theoretical models and simulations. They derived a formula to calculate the probability of a gene fusion in a genome given paired sequences and applied it to breast cancer samples, finding accurate predictions with a small number of large fragments. The ability to detect genes depends on gene length distribution and sequencing parameters impact breakpoint detection, localization, and gene detection, even with errors. These results will help calibrate future sequencing efforts, especially large-scale cancer studies enabled by next-generation technologies.

Paired sequencing assesses genome organization, focusing on detecting rearrangement breakpoints, where non-adjacent coordinates are fused in cancer. The study extends this to fusion detection in genes. Next-generation sequencing will provide reliable and precise fusion detection, enabling systematic analysis of genomic events leading to cancer and shedding light on cancer's genetic basis. Maximizing fusion detection probability with least sequencing depends on factors: number and length of sequenced clones, fused gene length, and localization errors. Theoretical and empirical formulae elucidate design trade-offs for current and next-generation technologies, making studies more reliable across samples with limited reads. Paired sequencing has errors: experimental, assembly, sequence mis-mapping, and artifacts, leading incorrect predictions or false positives.

Whole-genome paired sequencing surveys all fusion and rearrangements, advantages over transcript or protein profiling.
Chemotaxis, the ability of cells to sense and move towards chemical gradients, is a complex process involving motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. Researchers have proposed that these processes are mediated by separate modules that, which, when combined, recreate the behaviors of chemotactic cells. A mathematical model using reaction-diffusion equations and a mechanical model of the cell's cortex demonstrates how these modules work together. The model includes an excitable network for random migration, a local excitation-inhibition module for direction, and a polarization module linked to the cytoskeleton for persistent movement. Varying the strengths of feedback loops in the model produces behaviors similar to genetically altered cell lines.

The model shows that adaptation is not necessary for chemaxis, as cells without it perform less efficiently in uniform stimuli. However, adaptation allows cells to adjust sensitivity at the midpoint of a gradient. Simulations demonstrate that adaptation is not required for chemaxis. Cells can sense direction and respond to gradients by polarizing and migrating towards attractants, a fundamental property of single and multicellular organisms. Experiments suggest chemaxis involves motility, sensing, and polarization.

The model, LEG-B, captures some features of spontaneous and chemoat-induced events and adds two modules. A viscoelastic model simulates cytoskeleton deformations and movements. Polarized and unpolar cells coexist and can acquire polarity during migration. The model illustrates the complexity of chemactic machinery. Experiments show pathways have redundancy at the biochemical level.
Tudor domain-containing protein 6 (TD6) plays a crucial role in the development of elongated spermatids and male fertility. Research shows that in meiotic prophase spermatocytes, TD6 interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which supports splicing. TD6 also associates with spliceosomal protein Sm in the absence of RNA and arginine methylation. In TD-deficient spermatocytes, PR5 association with Sm and arginine methylation of Sm are reduced. TD deficiency impairs assembly of spliceosomes, leading to 3.5-fold increased levels of U snRNAs in the nucleus. These deficiencies in splice maturation correlate with decreased numbers of SM-positive bodies and Cajal bodies involved in snRNA maturation. Transcript analysis of TD-deficient spermatocytes reveals high numbers of splicing defects, including aberrant intron and exon usage as well as aberrant splice junctions. This study demonstrates a novel function of TD in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase spermatocytes.
Researchers have studied how bacteria colonize a host and play a role in health, serving as a reservoir for transmission to other hosts and emergence of invasive strains, highlighting the importance of understanding acquisition and clearance rates of colonizing populations. Previous studies of colonization dynamics have been based on whether samples represent a single or distinct colonization events. A common approach has been to use whole genome sequencing to determine genetic distance between isolates, assuming a fixed threshold below which isolates are the same. However, this approach often fails to account for within-host population diversity, time intervals between measurements, and uncertainty in estimated rates.

A new Bayesian model provides probabilities whether strains should be considered same, determining clearance and acquisition from genomes over time. The method models within-host population variation using genetic simulation and inference with Approximate Bayesian Computation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. It was validated with simulations and applied to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a clinical study. The model does not rely on a fixed distance threshold, unlike previous approaches, and provides uncertainty estimates for relevant quantities.

The study of colonization is based on inferring whether samples represent same or distinct events, allowing calculation of acquisition and clearance. Whole genome sequencing has provided genetic distance between isolates, used to infer relationship. However, optimal distance and interval define probability of same strain. This data is critical for within dynamics, response, and transmission. A previous models have used hidden Markov states for colonizing, and ABC in population genetics. The new model determines whether genomes should be same, enabling inferences about acquisition and clearance from related genomes.
Plants grow new organs through the activity of stem cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem makes leaves and flowers, while lateral merist make stems in a spiral or whorled pattern through a process called phyllaxis. It's thought that the hormone auxin transport plays a major role in this process. Current ideas say that hormone transporters of the PIN family create auxin maxima at precise positions, which leads to organ initiation. To explain how transporters create flux to regions within the plant, concepts have been proposed. One idea, canalization, suggests transporters amplify and stabilize existing flux, which can be initiated by diffusion. This explains organized auxin flux during vein formation, but for shootical meristem a second hypothesis was proposed where hormone is transported to areas with highest concentrations. This implies two different mechanisms for PIN in membrane, based on sensing and concentration. Patterning requires interaction of hundreds of cells, so it's hard to know if a scenario is plausible. Modeling provides a way to test this type of hypothesis. Using a computer tool, we show flux-based hypothesis can explain auxin at meristem, providing a unifying concept for control in plants. Experiments are needed to distinguish between flux and other hypotheses.

 Auxin is a hormone that plays a role in primord formation. It's transported by carriers at cell membranes. Importers, AUX/LAX, bring auxin in, while exporters, PIN, bring it out. Cells can transport aux from cell to cell, creating flux to maxima and minima. Concentration differences lead to gene expression and growth. At shoot apical meristem, importers and exporters are at the surface. The mechanism of localization is unknown, so it's hard to predict which regime needs a different mechanism. It's reasonable to propose both regimes are states of same sensing. We conclude flux hypothesis is a unifying for auxin throughout plant.
Researchers have developed a new approach to find biomarkers for visceral leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. They used computer tools to analyze the parasite's genome and combined with lab experiments to identify potential biomarkers. The goal is to create better diagnostic tests for early detection and monitoring of the disease. Previous studies showed that IgG, a part of the immune system, is a good indicator of disease status in rapid tests. However, these tests used a crude antigen, which is not specific. Replacing it with specific antigens would make tests more reliable. The team found that L donani protein is recognized by Ig from patients with visceral leishiasis. Using mass spectrometry, they identified the protein and searched for its parts that are accessible to the immune system. They mapped these parts using computer algorithms and tested them in arrays. The most promising candidate was tested in prototype tests with patient and healthy sera. Over 90% of proteins did not meet the criteria and were excluded. The most reactive peptide had 84% sensitivity with visceral leishis sera and 0% with healthy sera. The team used computer searches to reduce lab work, focusing on promising candidates with specific features. By predicting parts in computer, they screened many peptides and found the best one for Ig sensitivity and specificity. This proof of concept can be applied to develop more reliable tests for disease monitoring.
A study of 317 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from six countries, including Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Iran, and others, found that 61.5% of cases had granulomas, with 25.2% being caseating, 4.6 suppurative, and 70.2 tuberculoid without necrosis. Caseating and tuboid granuloma groups differed by geographic location, with more cases in Saudi Arabia, and histologically by distribution of Ridley's pattern, with doubling 3 in caseating and 5 in tuboid. Time to healing was shorter in tuboid vs case group. Parasitic index, species, and other variables did not differ by granuloma type. A notable 18.2% of CL cases had caseating granulomas, suggesting it should be considered in differential diagnosis in endemic regions. Cases with caseating granulomas showed slower healing, no association with species, possibly due to worse immune response or aggressive leishmania strains. Leishmania tropica was predominant in 88% of cases, major in 11.9%, with no MTB/R assay negative.
Researchers have identified a gene that may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes in mice. The gene, called Zfp69, is a zinc finger transcription factor that helps control the expression of other genes. In mice with a version of Zfp that doesn't work properly develop diabetes and obesity. The researchers found that a retrotransposon, a piece of genetic material that can jump from one location to another, disrupted the Zfp gene in mice that don't develop diabetes. In contrast, mice with a working Zfp gene develop diabetes and obesity. The researchers also found that the human version of Zfp, called ZNF642, is increased in fat tissue of people with type 2 diabetes. They conclude that Zfp is likely the cause of diabetes in mice and the retrotranson contributes to genetic differences between strains. Expression of Zfp in fat tissue may play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict how cells in the vertebrate hematopoietic system differentiate into different types. This system has many branching pathways and cell types, making it a challenging to understand. The model combines regulatory and signalling pathways to control cell differentiation. Since most data is qualitative, the researchers used a logical formalism to perform dynamic analysis. To handle the network's size and complexity, they used a reduction approach with a state identification algorithm. They simulated various environments to see how they affect cell differentiation. The model found stable states for Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes, but also hybrid cells with combinations of these markers in environment-dependent. This highlights the nature of these types and their relationships with canonical subtypes. The model can explore new pathways in silico.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict where and how transcription factors bind to the genome during early Drosila development. Transcription factors drive patterns of gene expression by binding to thousands of genomic regions, but the forces that determine where, when, and to what they bind are not well understood. The model uses thermodynamics to evaluate the contribution of biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of embryonic-posterior patterning in Dila melanogaster. Predictions based on DNA and protein affinities alone achieved a correlation of 0.4 with experimental measurements in vivo. Incorporating cooperativity and competition among factors and spatial patterning in the nucleus had little effect on accuracy. A major source of error was predicting events that do not occur in vivo, attributed to reduced chromatin accessibility. Experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility improved predictions to 0.6-0.9 for various factors across target genes. The model was used to quantify the roles of sequence, accessibility, and cooperativity. Results show that in open chromatin, binding can be predicted by sequence of individual factors with minimal interactions. A combination of experimentally determined chrom accessibility and computational models may predict binding of any transcription factor with precision.
In Drosophila, the proteins Daughterless (Da) and Extramacchaetea (Em) are the only members of the basic helix-loop helix (bHL) transcription factor family, which regulate cell proliferation in metazoans. These factors are involved in controlling the G2/M transition and cell proliferation in epithelial cells of the imaginal discs. A genetic analysis shows that Em controls the G2/M transition and proliferation through the transcriptional regulation of the Cdc25 phosphatase, string. Ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced Em or high Da levels rescues proliferative defects in mutant cells. Moreover, Da acts as a transcriptional repressor of string. This defines a mechanism through which Em controls cell proliferation by regulating Da, which transcriptionally represses string. In Drosila, Em is required to downregulate Da, triggering mitosis via transcriptional activation of the conserved cell cycle component C25.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how cells respond to stress by analyzing changes in protein phosphorylation, a key mechanism of cell signaling. Phosphorylation is when a protein is modified by adding a phosphate group, changing its function. The team used a technique called SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell) to study yeast cells with and without certain kinases, enzymes that add phosphates to proteins. They analyzed data from mass spectrometry, a tool that breaks down proteins into small parts, to identify changes in phosphorylation. The method, called pipeline, includes three steps: phosphopeptide analysis, network analysis, and relationship discovery. The team applied it to yeast and found 5 proteins involved in stress response and 9 in filament growth. Four of these proteins were tested and shown to affect growth, validating the method. The pipeline can be used for other studies and suggests proteins to investigate further.
Researchers studied how the regulation of the X chromosome in fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) male germline. They found that the X chromosome does not undergo dosage compensation, which is the equalization of X gene expression in males and females, in most of the male germl. They also found no evidence of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which is the silencing and heterochromization of the X during meiosis in the male or female germl. The team discovered that the expression of genes on the X chromosome is lower than on autosomes, but this difference is established before meiosis and persists in meiotic cells. This cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting a new mechanism limits expression from X during spermatogenesis in Dophila. These findings resolve previous conflicting reports and have implications for genome and speciation in Doph.
Researchers have studied the early stages of Citrobacterium infection in mice, a model for human diarrheal disease caused by Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The pathogenesis of both species depends on forming intimate contact with epithelial cells, called "attachment/effacement" (A) lesions. These lesions must be dynamic and self-renew by re-infecting the rapidly regenerating epithelium. The study found that colonic epithelial A microcolonies are clonal populations, relying on local growth to persist. In wild mice, microies are established within 18 hours of infection, shaping infection geography and severity despite virulent luminal bacteria presence. Mechanistically, resistance to A lesion formation is mediated by TLRMy88/Tr-dependent signaling, induced by virulent C. rodium in a gene-dependent manner. Data show establishment of C. rodium pathogenesis is restricted to a short window determining disease severity.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations, such as species or genes, when only a fraction of each population is sampled. This is a common problem in fields like ecology and epidemiology, where data is often incomplete. The new method uses Bayesian inference to account for the sampling rates and produces unbiased estimates of overlap. It also calculates the uncertainty of these estimates, allowing for better planning of future studies. This approach is different from existing methods, which assume complete data or require abundance information. The researchers tested the method on a scenario with two parasites, each with 60 types, and found it accurately estimated the overlap and uncertainty. The method can be improved by incorporating more data, such as whole-genome information, and applied to other studies like Plasmod spp. multig antigen families.
Researchers have studied how a type of enzyme called eukotic kinase, which plays a crucial role in many cellular functions by adding a phosphate group to targeted proteins. The enzyme's active state is controlled by a core that changes shape between open, intermediate, and closed conformations. However, the interactions that regulate this state were not well understood. Using a specific kinase as a model, the team used biochemical, biophysical, and computational methods to identify a set of conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that work together to control the mechanics. These include a salt bridge between a lysine in the β-strand and glutamate in α-helix, and electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated loop and α-helix and hydrophobic residues in the Regulatory Shell. Contrary to previous thought, the conserved lysine in β-str is not necessary for adding the phosphate, but is essential for the enzyme's active state.

The researchers found that the α-phosphates interact with the conserved lysine in β-strand, forming a salt with glutamate in α-helix. Initially, it was thought the lys was for ATP binding and the salt was for stabilizing lys. Without the bridge and electrostatic interaction, the state can be regulated through the Shell. By enhancing hydrophobicity of the region, they connected the β-sheet and α-helix through hydrophobic interaction. The lys was shown to be a structural sensor that facilitates the state by coordinating the β-region with α-helix.

Mutating the glutamate to alanine broke the salt bridge, destabilizing the state and preventing phosphorylation, autophosphorylation, and catalysis. However, the Shell was partially restored by coexpressing with PDK, introducing interaction between phosphorylated loop and α-helix. The lys is not required for phosphorylation, but essential for state, coordinating β-region with αelix.
American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) from 2000-2006 under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. The World Health Organization recommends post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of recent LF transmission. This study compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-M surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 and a community-based survey of people aged 8. In 2016, a systematic school-based TAS was conducted in 29 elementary schools and a cluster survey in 28 villages on two islands of American. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen (CA) using Alere Filariasis Strip. Those positive were prepared for microscopic examination of microfilar and treatment. The school TAS identified 9 antigen-positive children with an overall CA prevalence of 0.7% and the community survey 102-positive with 6.2%. Adjusted village prevalence ranged 0-47.1%. Prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. The school TAS had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but high specificity and positive value for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community survey identified antigen individuals of all ages and foci of high prevalence. Both confirmed recrudence of LF transmission.
Researchers studied how sex is determined in zebraf fish, a common model organism. They found that sex is not just determined by one gene, but by multiple factors that can vary between strains and are influenced by environment. Germ cells, specifically oocytes, are needed for females to develop. But how oocytes control sex and maintain the female state is unknown. The study looked at two molecules produced by oocytes, Gdf9 and Bmp, and found Bmp plays a role in maintaining female sex in zraf. Females without Bmp develop normally but switch to male during mid-juvenile stage and become fertile. They also showed estrogen production is needed for female development and Bmp's function is linked to regulating estrogen production via granulosa cells in the oocyte.

The study tested if G9 and Bmp have a role in sex determination or female differentiation in zraf. Found Bmp females develop normally but switch to male during juvenile stage and gonad transforms to testis. Results show how oocytes regulate sex maintenance inraf. Hypothesis is o-somatic interaction stabilizes c19a1 expression and estrogen production. Somatic gonad expresses Bmp receptors. c19 functions as a switch for female vs male inraf and medaka, animals without oocytes are male, regardless of genotype, and oocytes are needed in adultraf to maintain sex. Identified genes c19a1 and Bmp for female development and maintenance. These establish a pathway for female development and maintenance inraf conserved in other fish. G9 and B are expressed inraf oocytes early and are candidates for o-derived sex signal.
Hox proteins play a crucial role in controlling the development of the body's anterior-posterior axis in animals by regulating specific sets of genes. Within their broad expression domains, individual Hox proteins control cell diversification and pattern formation, and target gene expression in a highly localized manner, sometimes in a single cell. To achieve this high regulatory specificity, it has been proposed that Hox proteins co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their targets in a context-specific manner in vivo. However, only a few of these factors have been identified. This study analyzes the regulation of the death gene reaper (pr) by the H protein Deformed (D) and suggests that local activation of pr expression in the anterior maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of D with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. It follows that context-dependent combinations of H proteins and other factors on small H response elements (HRE) could be responsible for the spatio-temporal expression of H targets. A large number of transcription factors are likely involved in H regulation in vivo.
Researchers studied the genetic requirements for signaling from an autoactive NB-LRR (nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat) immune receptor in plants. They focused on ADR-L2, an Arabidopsis coiled-coil (CC)-NB protein, which functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in defense responses. ADR-L acts as a "helper" to transduce specific microbial signals from sensor NBRRs. This activity does not require an intact P-loop. The researchers generated an autoactive mutation, A1-LD484, in a small homology motif MHD. Expression of A-L484 leads to dwarf plants with increased resistance and high SA levels. The morphological phenotype requires an intact P, suggesting A484 phenotypes reflect activation of NB protein. They used A484 to define requirements for signaling. Signaling from A484 does not require NAD oxidase and is regulated by E1 and At1. Transcription regulation of A484 is correlated with phenotypic outputs, both SA-dependent and-independent. Requirements for A484 resemble those regulate SA-dependent signal amplification of defense and death observed in absence LSD. Importantly, A484 autoactivation is controlled by E and SA in separable but linked pathways. Data propose a model for SA-dependent regulation, including A2.
Researchers have identified two components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in Arabidopsis, SUVH and ID2, which interact with the protein MOR6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. They found that SUV2 and SUV9 can act together with MOR6 or synergistically with MOR6 to silence genes, and ID2 interacts with MOR6 to silence a subset of MOR6 target loci. Other RDM components, including Pol IV, V, R2, and DRM2, are also required for silencing a subset of MOR6 loci. MOR6 was previously shown to silence genes through heterochrom condensation, and researchers found that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex interacts with MOR6 and SUV9 to mediate silencing. This suggests that RDM components are involved in both methylation and MOR6-mediated heteroch condensation. The study shows that methylation is linked to heteroch condensation and enhances silencing at methylated regions. MOR6 interacts with ID2 and the SW/S complex to mediate the link between methylation and heteroch cond, enhancing silencing at methyl genomic regions. The study also found that MOR functions in silencing loci targeted by RDM components and that silencing in mor6 is not associated with loss of methylation.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp) in modulating phenotypes in vertebrates, using zebraf as a model. Hsp is a molecular chaperone that can buffer genetic variation and protect against developmental malformations. They found that inhibiting H90 did not induce a heat shock response or perturb phenotype in wild-type zraf, but increased the severity of a recessive eye phenotype caused by a p6 mutation, while decreasing the severity of another caused by su mutation. A new spectrum of severe eye malations, including anophthalmia, microphthalm, and nanthalmia, was uncovered with H90 inhibition. Breeding offspring from unaffected parents led to increased malformation frequencies, showing the oligogenic nature of this phenotype. Unlike Drosila, H90 inhibition decreased developmental stability in zraf, indicated by increased asymmetric presentation of anophia, microphthalm, and nanthalm phenotypes. Analysis of p6 mutation suggests a mechanism for buffering by H90. Zraf studies imply that mild perturbation of H90 at developmental stages may underpin variable penetrance and express of anomalies where genotype and environment interact.
Researchers have identified and characterized a common protein modification called N-terminal acetylation in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This modification involves the addition of an acetyl group to the N-terminus of a protein, a process that occurs after the removal of the initiating methion residue. While the enzymes involved in this process have been studied, little is known about the biological function of N-terminal acylation. The researchers analyzed N-terminal peptides from Drosila cells and found over 1,200 mature proteins with N-termini, showing that N acylation occurs with similar frequency in insects as humans. They discovered a rule, called the X PX rule, which determines acylation under all circumstances. This rule can be used to genetically engineer proteins to study the importance of N-terminal acylation. The researchers applied this by expressing mutated proteins in cell lines and flies. They present a strategy to study the relevance of N acylation in cells and organisms. The X rule seems to be valid in lower and higher eukaryotes, suggesting it can be used to study N acylation in all species.
Researchers studied how the enzyme RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) controls the termination of transcription, a crucial for producing abundant tRNA during cell growth and development and cancer. They used a genetic approach to identify mutants with gain and loss of termination phenotypes in the yeast Saccharomyces pombe. 122 mutations were mapped to a 3.9 Å structure of the RN III elongation complex and cluster in the active center helix, loop, and pore, and funnel, indicating involvement of the cleavage domain of the C subunit in termination. Purified RN III from a readthrough mutant showed increased elongation rate, supporting a kinetic model where elongation is inversely related to termination efficiency. Mutants exhibited correlations in vitro and in vivo, and surprisingly, amounts of transcription in vivo. Assessing in vivo can be confounded by parameters, they used a tRNA with a processing defect and strong terminator, ruling out differences in RNA decay. Data indicate mutants synthesize more RNA than wild-type cells, and can be accounted for by increased elongation. Increased activity appears unrelated to the III repressor M1. Results show elements of the III center, including C, are key determinants of termination, and some activate III for transcription. Mutations in cancer suggest an unforeseen mechanism of III activation in disease.
Researchers have developed a new method to predict which proteins interact with SH2 domains, a type of protein that binds to phosphopeptides, using the structure of SH-phosphope complexes and an algorithm called FoldX. They tested this approach and found it works as well as experimentally derived sequences and substitution matrices in predicting known SH2 targets in vitro and in vivo. The team used this method to predict a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH domains with known structure and phosphorylation state. They validated the predictions using literature-derived SH interactions and a probabilistic score from Bayes integration of coexpression, conservation, interaction in other species, shared partners, and functions. The predictions led to a new hypothesis for SH domains role in signaling.

 The method's portability to other SH domains needs to be shown, but FoldX can predict in vitro thermodynamics of protein-phosphope complexes for nine SH domains, making it applicable for genome-wide predictions. The structure prediction of SH-mediated protein-protein interactions has been addressed once before. The team believes future methods should account for both physics and biology of SH domains. They used Fold to predict protein interactions for nine SH-containing proteins and annotated with predicted information, providing a resource for further testing. Fold performs as well as consensus or substitution matrices in prediction in vitro and vivo interactions. With information on phosphorylation and structure, Fold can give accurate novel interactions.
Researchers have identified a protein called cyclophilin 40 (Cy40) that can break down toxic protein clumps called amyloids in the brain, which are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These clumps are made of a protein called tau, which is rich in proline residues that regulate its structure and aggregation. Cy40, a cis peptid-proly isomerase (Pase), interacts with proline residues in tau and dissolves amyloids in a test tube. In a mouse model of tau accumulation, overexpressing Cy40 preserved neuronal health and cognition. Nuclear magnetic resonance showed Cy40 interacts with proline-rich sites in tau. Cy40 also broke down other aggregating proteins with prolines, but lacking Pase activity prevented disaggregation. A unique property of Cy40 allows it to break amyloids without energy. This study introduces a new protein disagase that can dissolve intracellular amyloids for the first time. Overexpressing Cy40 in a tauopathic brain reduced oligomers and tangles, improving neuronal health and function, suggesting it as a potential therapeutic for tauopathies and amyloid disorders.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how heteroc patterns form in cyanobacteria filaments, a simple example of cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms. Despite many studies on the evolution and maintenance of heteroc patterns, the genetic circuit behind a single cyanobacter's behavior under nitrogen deprivation was unclear. The model combines systems biology and differential equations to describe the genetic circuit of a single cyanacter, allowing the study of its behavior under different conditions, such as nitrogen deprivation, and the dynamics of cyanobacteria by coupling their genetic circuits via diffusion. This reveals the principles of heteroc pattern generation and sustainment. Including diffusion and noise in the model reproduces the main features of heteroc formation and sustainment in cyanobacteria as seen in experiments. The model connects the diffusion of nitrogen along the filament with the genetic circuit of each cyanacter, capturing heteroc development and maintenance.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to explore the association between people's perceptions of the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermect (DTI) program and their adherence to iverectin in three regions with high onchercias prevalence. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in three districts with persistent onchiasis prevalence. Participants were randomly selected from 30 clusters per district. Adherence to iverect was comparable in Bang and Bafia (55.0% and 48.8%, respectively, p>0.05) and lower in Yab (40.7%). Factors related to program and disease perceptions were studied, and perceptions of the program were most determinant of adherence toiver. People with a "positive" opinion ofiverect distribution were more compliant than those with a negative opinion (40% vs 55 in Bang, 48 vs 62 in Bafia, p<0.01). Misconceptions about onchias transmission were common, especially lack of hygiene in Bafia and Yab. In Bang, high proportions believed onias due to sugar consumption (31% vs 5 in Bafia and Yassi, p<0.001). Perceptions ofiverect distribution were strongly associated with adherence. Education and sensitization onias during CDT implementation and community involvement are recommended.
Researchers investigated the relationship between genetic and epigenetic variations and protein biomarkers for cancer and cardiovascular disease by combining DNA methylation and SNP data with protein measurements. They analyzed 121 biomarkers in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 positions and over 10 million SNPs. Epigen-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GW) analyses were performed, and biomarker, DNA methylation, and SNP data were integrated. The study found 124 loci with significant associations, with effect sizes up to 0.22 units per 1% change in methylation and 4 units per allele copy in EW and GW, respectively. Most GW loci were cis-regulatory, while EW loci were trans. Eleven EW loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including one with CXCL, CX9, IL-12, and IL-18 levels. EW signals overlapping with GW loci were driven by genetic variants, while EW signals were confounded by smoking. Cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers had effect on methylation, but not vice versa. The study found associations between biomarkers and methylation at numerous loci, likely reflecting genetic, environmental, or secondary effects of disease pathogenesis.
Researchers have found that the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can impair the function of natural killer (NK) cells, a type of immune cell that helps fight off viral infections. VV can infect NK cells and make them unable to respond to stimulation, leading to a loss of ability to kill infected cells and produce cytokines. This effect is not only seen in infected NK cells, but also in uninfected cells that are exposed to VV in culture. The impairment is due to direct contact between NK cells and VV infected cells, not the surface expression of VV on NK cells. Despite this, NK cells can still release cytotoxic granules when signaling is bypassed, suggesting VV paralyzes NK from responding. VV also represses IF-γ and TNF production. A similar effect is seen with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), which infects NK cells and makes them unresponsive to stimulation. However, HSV-1 affects cytokine production differently than VV. This study reveals a new way VV evades the immune system by paralyzing NK cells, making them unable to function.
Researchers investigated the neural basis of apparent motion (AM), a phenomenon where two stimuli presented at different locations evoke a perception of a moving stimulus between them. They found that AM affects detection of gratings along the path, with maximum impairment at high contrast levels, and strongest when target orientation matches inducers. A population model of early visual processing, based on contrast normalization, suggests that AM-related activation in primary visual cortex (V1) is too small to cause masking or perceived motion. Instead, it predicts suppression of early responses during AM, consistent with predictive coding theory. Predictive models propose higher-level motion predictions "explain" lower-level responses to expected input. Presentation of inducers evokes responses in V cells tuned to locations and properties, interfering with actual stimuli perception. However, masking doesn't necessarily imply V activation. Predictive coding offers an alternative view, where stimuli provide predictable context, and responses along path are suppressed when predictable. The study examined AM's effect on low-level processing by investigating detection of gratings along the path, finding impairment when target matches inducers' orientation. A previous study reported masking at single stimulus level, but not maximum performance reduction, linked to spatial uncertainty. The model captures results, but can't rule out effects in other early cortex areas.
HTLV-1's oncoprotein Tax plays a key role in transforming CD4+ T cells by promoting proliferation and survival, mainly through activating the NF-κB pathway and inducing NF-κ target genes. To understand the underlying mechanism is crucial for understanding HTLV-mediated transformation. Studies have suggested multiple mechanisms for Tax-induced IK activation, but are controversial due to blending of primary Tax-induced IK events and secondary IK activation by cytokines from Tax-induced IK-NF-κ events. Researchers reconstituted Tax-stimulated IK activation in a cell-free system to dissect essential components for IK activation by Tax and biochemical mechanism. They found Tax is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, with Ubc2, Ubc5, or U7, catalyzing free-link polyubiquitin chains. These chains are responsible for IK activation by binding IK's NEM subunit. The study reveals biochemical function of Tax in IK activation, using minimal ubiquitination components for NF-κ activation.

HTLV-1's Tax is the first pathogen shown to activate NF-κ, and studies have advanced understanding of pathophysiological NF- activation. Despite 30 years of research, the molecular mechanism of Tax IK-NF-κ is unclear. Tax is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, working with E2s, catalyzing polyUb assembly for IK activation. The biochemical function of Tax in IK activation clarifies confusion on HTL-1 IK-NF-κ, reveals hijacked factors by HT-1, and sheds light on therapeutics for ATL and T/H.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the number of individuals introduced to a new population (propagule pressure) and the success of alien species establishment. They used a statistical method called meta-analysis to evaluate this relationship across various types of species, including invertebrates, plants, and vertebrates. The study found that a positive effect of propule pressure on success was present in all tested hypotheses, but success was most dependent on a range of 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect was mainly due to different analytical approaches, with larger effect sizes in animal introductions than plant introductions. No variation was accounted for by study scale (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy). The analysis revealed consistency in the relationship between propule pressure and alien establishment.

The study is the first to quantify the relationship between propule and success for alien introductions. It used meta-analytical methods to estimate the effect of propule on success and test heterogeneity. Although study designs and approaches have been recognized, no analysis determined their influence on the strength or shape of the prop effect. The relationship was evaluated for a range of taxa and histories, including invertebrates, plants, trees, and vertebrates. Species and location factors can influence success, so the prop effect is expected to vary in magnitude and direction between studies. Prop pressure is difficult to measure in real-world introductions, so proxies were used instead of direct estimates. Proxies are variables that correlate with the number of individuals released.
Interleukin-17 (IL-17) plays a significant role in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases by enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators through the degradation of encoding mRNAs. The decay of these mRNAs depends on proteins (AUBs) that target AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region of mRN, either facilitating decay or stabilization. Research shows that AUs and mRNAs assemble in a ribonucleoprotein complex in the presence of microRNA (miR16), leading to degradation. Notably, IL-17 attenuates miR expression and promotes binding of stabilizing AUs over destabilizing AUs, reducing decay. This indicates miR independently directs competition between degrading and stabilizing AUs for mRN. AUs affect about 8% of the human transcriptome and miR is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting IL-17 affects many cellular processes beyond inflammation.

IL-17 changes the contribution of miR and AUs to degrade mRN. Besides IL-17, IL-1 also attenuates mRNA degradation. In epithelial and fibroblast cells, IL- with TN- attenuates degradation of mRN encoding inflammatory mediators, resulting in hyper production of pro-inflammatory mediators. This study reports degradation of m encoding IL-8, IL-6, and G-CS by the mRNA pathway, depending on AUs and mi16. Findings show modulation of Ap-miR regulation by IL- depends on specific target, mi usage, and participation of AUs.

IL-8 degradation was inhibited by AUF in absence mi16. IL- attenuated mi expression and binding, promoting IL-8 to AUF, stabilizing IL-8. Similar for other ARE-mRNAs, various AUs compete for binding, balance regulated by IL, likely via mi. IL-17 inhibition mi expression and mi using LNA resulted in attenuated decay. Enhancing mi expression by lentiviral constructs resulted in degradation.
Researchers in Uganda investigated the relationship between cattle and human trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, in areas where the disease is common. The study focused on two districts, Kaberido and Dokolo, where both chronic and acute forms of the disease are found. They compared villages with and without reported cases of the disease in the past six months. Results showed that villages with cases had higher odds of infected cattle with Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that can infect humans, than villages without cases. Cattle age also affected the likelihood of infection, with those between 18-36 months and over 36 months old having higher odds than under 18 months. Villages with cases also had higher likelihood of Trypanosoma rhodesense, the parasite that causes the disease, in cattle than villages without cases. A higher average of 16.3% of cattle infected with Trypanosoma bruce in a village was associated with higher likelihood of Trypanoma rhodes in the same village. The study suggests that villages with high levels of Trypanoma bruce may be at risk for Trypan rhodes.
Researchers have studied the role of the NS complex in regulating housekeeping genes in fruit flies. The NS complex, composed of proteins NS1, NS3, MBD2, and MCR2, binds to 85.5% of its target genes, which are constitutively expressed across different cell types. These genes have increased levels of histone modifications H4ac, H3me2, H3me3, and H9 in their promoter regions, and a well-defined nucleosome-free region and broad transcription initiation patterns. The complex is required for efficient recruitment of RNA polymerase II to these genes, as shown by ChIP-seq analysis of RNA polymerase II in NS1 and NS3-depleted cells. This coincides with reduced binding of TBP and TFI to promoters, indicating the complex's role in pre-initiation complex recruitment. Genes losing most RNA II upon NS knockdown are enriched in replication-related elements. The complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes in flies by modulating polymerase II transcription.
Researchers have created a transgenic mouse model to study facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FD), a progressive muscle disorder caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4 macrosatellite repeat and ectopic expression of DUX, a gene encoding a germline transcription factor. The model recapitulates epigen and D4 expression seen in patients and controls, including high D4 expression in germl, incomplete epigen repression in somatic tissue, and FD-specific variegated D4 expression in sporadic muscle associated with D4 chromatin relaxation. The mice also show D4 is able to activate similar gene groups in muscle as in human cells. This model represents a valuable tool to study FD mechanisms and test therapeutic strategies. 

Two transgenic lines were generated: one carrying D4 from a pathogenic FD1 allele and one from a normal, non-pathogenic allele. Data suggest somatic epigen silencing of D4 is conserved and contracted4 arrays are less efficiently silenced, leading to variegated D4 expression in muscle nuclei. IP and DNA methylation analyses indicate chromatin relaxation in D4-2.5 compared to D-12.5 mice, concord with observed D4 expression, modeling difference between FD patients and individuals. In muscle, D activates gerine and stem programs while suppressing innate response genes. FD has complex etiology: ep silencing by4 in FD1 or heterozygous in chrom modifier SMCH1 in FD2 results in D expression in muscle. The detrimental effects of D in muscle can be reversed by interference, making this model useful for therapeutic studies targeting D expression in muscle.
Researchers have been trying to develop a vaccine against malaria, a disease caused by Plasmodium falcum parasite, using a protein called Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1). However, current AMA1 vaccines only protect against strains closely related to the vaccine, not others. To overcome this problem, scientists created a vaccine with four diverse AMA1 proteins, called Quax or Q, which elicited antibodies that inhibited invasion of both vaccine and non-vaccine strains of the parasite. They found that Quax induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies, associated with conserved domain-3 and reduced domain-2 responses. Monoclonal antibodies against Qu reacted with a cross-reactive epitope on the hydrophobic trough domain-1, which is conserved on AMA1 and includes the 1-loop. These antibodies were 10-fold more potent than previously characterized AMA-inhib mAbs and inhibited AMA binding to its ligand R2. Another mAb, E, bound to domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked proteolytic processing of AMA. A novel mAb E was weakly inhibitory but synergized with a strain-transending mAb G, which binds to conserved face and inhibits R2 binding to AMA. Researchers identified novel susceptible and epitopes that can improve antigen breadth and inhibitory response of AMA vaccines. Vaccination with diverse proteins may provide universal coverage by redirecting response to conserved epitopes.
Researchers have discovered a mechanism that controls the timing of mitotic spindle displacement in cells, which is crucial for unequal cell division. The mitotic spindle is a structure that separates chromosomes during cell division, and its displacement to one side of the cell is necessary for cells to divide unequally. While some molecular mechanisms of spindle displacement have been identified, the timing of this process was not well understood. A conserved mechanism of mitotic progression, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), was found to be involved in timing spindle displacement. In Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time after chromosomes congress to metaphase plate. Reducing function of proteasome, APC, or C20/Fizzy delayed spindle displacement, while inactivating CD in metaphase caused spindle to displace early. Experimentally unlinking spindle from this mechanism resulted in premature displacement of incompletely assembled mitotic components. The study shows that mitotic spindle positioning is delayed until APC inactivates CD, ensuring spindle does not move until fully assembled. This is the first demonstration of mitotic timing spindle in animal cell division. The link between cell cycle and asymmetric division might be evolutionarily conserved, as spindle displaced at similar stage of mitosis in diverse systems.
Researchers conducted a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in two populations, the Andeans and Tibetans, who have lived at high altitudes for millennia. They looked at each chromosome to find regions with unknown functions related to high-altitude phenotypes and examined genes in oxygen sensing pathways. Using four genetic statistics, they found selection-nominated genes and regions in each population. The patterns of adaptation were distinct, with different genes and regions showing positive selection in each group. One gene, EGLN (PH2), known for oxygen sensing, showed selection in both populations, but with different variation patterns. The study suggests several H-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for high-altitude adaptation in Andans and Tibetans, and different chromosomal regions are implicated in response to selection. This provides a basis for future studies to confirm the role of selection-nominated genes and regions in adaptation to high-altitude.
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are a major source of genetic instability that can result from environmental interactions or cellular processes. Efficient repair of DSBS is crucial for cell survival, but faulty repair can lead to mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. The choice of repair pathway is important to maintain genomic integrity. Inverted repeats (IRs) near DSBS can channel repair into a pathway that leads to gene conversion instead of the break-induced replication (BIR) pathway that causes instability. IRs form unusual DNA structures when single-strand (ss) DNA is formed by DS resection. We found that IRs form two types of structures and the choice depends on the length of the spacer between IRs. IRs with a long (1-kb) spacer are involved in intermolecular single-strand annealing (SSA) forming dimers, while IRs with short (12b) spacer participate intramolecular SSA forming fold-back (FB) structures. Both structures interfere with accurate DS repair and channel DS into BIR, promoting genomic destabilization. Protein complexes process FB with short (12b) versus long (1b) ss loops differently. FB with short loops are processed by MR-Sae2, while Rad1-Rad10 process long loops. Our studies reveal mechanisms of genomic destabilization from rerouting DS repair by IRs. Given IRs abundance in the human genome, findings contribute to understanding IR-mediated destabilization associated with disease.
Researchers have developed a new animal model to study how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes infections in the fruit fly Drosila melanogaster. Pseudas aerugin is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts, and chronic infections are thought to be caused by biofilms. Biofilms are structured, multicellular communities of microbes encased in an extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival in the host. The researchers infected Drosila with P aerugin and visualized biofilms in the fly's crop, which had a characteristic structure and extracellular matrix of DNA and exopolysacide. Pugin cells from biofilms had increased resistance to antibiotics compared to planktonic cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on the exopolyside genes, as a mutant failed to form biofilms. The mutant was more virulent than PA1, while a hyperfilm strain demonstrated less virulence than PA1, indicated by fly survival at 14 postinfection. Bio formation by PA1 and in the crop was associated with induction of antimicrobial gene expression 24 postin.
Researchers studied the vasopressin 1 receptor 1 (Av1) gene, which plays a key role in social behaviors, and found that its expression varies between and within species. They looked at the 5' flanking region of the gene and a microsatellite element, a repetitive DNA sequence, to see if they contribute to this variation. Using mice, they found that the 5' flanking region contributes to differences in Av receptor distribution in the brain and impacts behavior in a stress test. They also found that the microsatellite structure affects Av1 expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, matching some of the differences seen between species. This is the first evidence that microsatellites near genes can affect brain expression and behavior. However, many species-specific patterns are not caused by the 5 flanking region alone. The 4 kb of the 5 flanking region also contributes to species-specific Av distribution in the brain. The researchers replaced the 5 flanking region in mice and saw differences in Av levels in the thalam, amygd, vent pallid, and hippocampus. They then looked at the microsatellite and found it affects Av binding in these regions. Transgenic mice with the prairie vole Av1 locus had Av binding like prairie voles and increased affiliative behavior to AV. This shows Av1 expression in brain contributes to inter and intra-species variability in AV behaviors. The Av1 is a model for exploring genomic mechanisms of brain expression and behavior. The microsatellites may enhance evolv traits by increasing expression.
Researchers have found that a protein called Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) can cause double-strand breaks in the DNA at specific regions of the immunoglobulin genes and the c-MYC oncogene in yeast cells. These breaks can lead to chromosomal translocations, which are abnormal rearrangements of the genetic material that can cause cancer. The study used yeast cells that are impaired in a process called mNP biogenesis, which is important for making RNA, to understand how ID causes instability in the genome. They found that ID induces double-strand breaks in these regions, which are then repaired by a process called Non-homous Joining (NHE). This process is similar to how it works in human cells. The c-M oncogene, which has similar sequences, is a hotspot for recombination in yeast cells with impaired mNP biogenesis. The study provides new insights into how mNP biogenesis prevents genome rearrangements and how ID causes instability. It also shows that yeast and human cells have similar pathways to process ID-induced DNA lesions into double-strand breaks, leading to NHE-dependent rearrangements. A yeast system was developed to study how ID leads to double-strand breaks at these regions and the c-M oncogene, similar to those in cells that cause switching or translocations associated with Burkitt lymphoma. This opens new perspectives on ID-mediated rearrangements.
Researchers studied how Escheria coli cells divide their chromosomes when their cell division is not properly aligned. They used a microscope to track the movement of DNA during cell division and found that a protein called Fts can move up to 80% of the chromosome (3.7 million base pairs) from one daughter cell to another at a rate of 1700-800 base pairs per second. This movement happens at the end of cell division when the division protein ZipA has left the cell wall and the wall has narrowed to a small channel smaller than 250 nanometers. The study suggests that the narrow channel is necessary for Fts to move the DNA. 

The researchers also found that most DNA movement occurs when the cell is almost fully divided and the septum is small. This is consistent with previous findings that DNA movement speeds up as division progresses. The study shows that E. coli can reposition their chromosomes even if their division is not properly aligned. The protein Fts has been shown to move 400 kilobases near the replication region in normal cells, but in this study it moved up to 3.7 million base pairs when division is misplaced. The researchers estimated the amount of DNA moved and speed of movement and direction. They suggest that Fts binds to DNA when the sept is not closed and that the constriction is a checkpoint to prevent daughter cells from separating.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework for selecting the optimal set of peptides for epitope-based vaccines, which are used to prevent or treat various diseases, including infectious and cancer. The framework, based on integer linear programming, identifies the best combination of peptides from a given set that will elicit the strongest immune response. This is important because each person's major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are unique, making a combination effective for one person may not work for another. The framework can incorporate various requirements for a good vaccine, such as covering multiple antigens and avoiding peptides with high mutation rates. It outperforms previous methods and can solve problems in seconds. The approach is flexible and can be applied to personalized vaccines. It is the first to find the optimal solution to the vaccine design problem. The framework can be used to find the set of peptides that maximizes overall immunogenicity while meeting specific requirements, such as covering all MHC alleles and avoiding high mutation peptides. This is the first approach to yield provably optimal solutions for vaccine design. The goal is to maximize immunogenicity while meeting requirements, which can be formulated as an integer program. The solution is the set of peptides with highest immunogenicity meeting the requirements. This is the only approach to yield provably optimal solutions for vaccine design.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in HIV-1 transmission to the cervico-vaginal tissue. IL-7 is a cytokine found in high concentrations in the semen of HIV-1-infected men. The study simulated HIV-1 transmission by depositing the virus on cervico-vaginal tissue with IL-7 levels similar to those found in HIV-1-infected individuals. Results showed IL-7 enhanced HIV-1 replication in cervicoaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue. Analysis of infected cells revealed IL-7 reduced CD4 T cell apoptosis and increased anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. IL-7 also increased cycling CD4 T cells. High IL-7 levels in semen may contribute to HIV-1 survival and expansion in the cervicoag mucosa at initial infection. The study is the first to examine IL-7's role in male-to-female HIV transmission. Results suggest high IL-7 in semen may make the female genital tract more susceptible to HIV-1.
Researchers studied how the Zika virus (ZIK) interacts with the RNA interference (RNA) system in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes, which spread the virus. They found that ZIK triggers the production of two types of small RNAs: virus-specific siRNAs and piRNAs. However, the piRNAs lack the characteristic signature of typical small RNAs. The siRNAs were loaded into the Ago2 protein, but silencing this protein did not enhance virus replication. Instead, increased replication was seen in Ago2-knockout cells, indicating an antiviral role of the ex-siRNA pathway. ZIK-specific piRNAs were detected, but lacked the piRNA ping-pong signature and bound to Ago3, not Piwi or Piwi. Silencing Piwi proteins showed that knockdown of Ago, Pi5, or Pi6 did not enhance ZIK replication, but Pi4 displayed antiv activity. ZIK capsid protein amplified replication of a reporter virus, unlike yellow fever protein which inhibits ex-sRNA.
In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a study was conducted to identify the Sporoth species associated with sporotrichosis, a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix. The study analyzed 50 patients with different clinical manifestations of sporrichosis and found that Sporoth brasiliensis was associated with disseminated cutaneous infection, mucosal infection, and hypersensitivity reactions, while Sporoth schenckii was linked to more localized and severe disease. Patients infected with Spor brasili required shorter treatment with itraconazole, 16 weeks, compared to those with Spor schck, 24 weeks. This suggests that Sporoth species are linked to different manifestations of sporrichosis and Spor brasili is effectively treated with itraazole. This is the first study to demonstrate the association between genotypic identification of Sporoth species and clinical aspects of human sporrich. The majority of isolates were identified as Spor schck, but the study adds new information on Sporili disease and supports careful speciation of Sporrix isolates for clinical care. Sporili has been reported in other Brazilian states, but is less common than Sporck. Sporili caused typical forms of sporrich, but also disseminated in one case. Clinical presentations of sporrich by Sporrix are variable and poorly understood, but this study shows direct association between unusual manifestations and Sporili.
Recent studies have suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed beyond annotated genes, but the nature and quantity of these transcripts were unclear. Researchers used single-end and paired RNA-Seq and tiling to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in Poly+ RNA from human and mouse tissues. Relative to tiling, RNASeq identified many transcribed regions outside known exons and non-coding RNAs. Most non-exonic regions in RNASeq are introns, suggesting they are fragments of pre-mRNAs. Chromosomal locations of intergenic regions in RNASeq are near genes, consistent with alternative splicing and polyadenylation usage, promoter and terminator transcripts or new exons. Reads bridging splice sites identified 5,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes. Remaining seqags correspond to single reads with characteristics of random sampling or low background or small transcripts (median 111 bp) present at higher levels, displaying conservation and originating from open chromatin.

The majority of intergenic and intronic seqags have low coverage, exemplified by 70-80% of transcribed regions detected by RNASeq in one sample, consistent with random placement. Tiling arrays are ill-suited to detect low-expressed transcripts. Non-exonic in RNASeq associated with genes include thousands of alternative exons and hundreds promoters. Increased seq coverage in intergenic regions correlated with gene transcripts across 11 Poly+ RNASeq samples. Reads mapping intergenic display high correlation with neighboring genes or associated with 10,000 novel exons. Genome analysis revealed 2,789 uncharacterized fragments with no overlap exons, 1,259 in intergenic. Genic regions transcribed above background consist of coding and noncoding transcripts.
Researchers have developed a new method to make proteins more stable by using a combination of computer and laboratory techniques. This method increased the stability of a protein called Bacillus subtilis YLO domain by 31 degrees Celsius, making it useful for use in hot environments. The method involves five steps: screening for stable mutants, confirming the best ones, redesigning the stable parts, testing, and combining multiple mutations. This approach is simple and can be applied to other proteins that are hard to make stable with other methods, providing a new tool to improve stability.

A previous study made a similar protein called Flavin mononucleotide Fluorescent Protein (FFP) more stable by changing a single amino acid, but it was still not very stable. A more stable FFP is needed for studying microorganisms that live in hot environments. The new method was successful 62% of the time, showing its effectiveness. The most stable parts of the protein are at the interface between two units, suggesting stronger connections between them make it more stable. One mutant, V120, was the most stable at 54.2 degrees Celsius.

Currently, there are three ways to make proteins stable: directed evolution, consensus, and rational design. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses and has been used to make proteins more stable. About a dozen mutants were better than the original, allowing for further improvement by combining them. Two factors were considered: how much more stable they were and how far apart they were from each other.
Researchers studied the diversity of sand flies in the genus Lutzia on Barro Island in Panama, a region where cutaneous leishmaniasis is a health threat to residents and tourists. They found two "cryptic" species, Lu. sp. vespilion and Lu. gzi, and detected Leishmania DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapi and 26.3% of Lu. gzi individuals. The Leish infecting Lu. trapi and Lu. gzi had the same ITS-1 sequence, similar to Leishmania viannia, a species known to cause cutaneous leishiasis in northern and central America. Distinct Wolia strains were found in three sand species, including Lu. trapi, which co-occurred with Leish. Two species, Lu. trap and Lu. g, carried Leish at high frequency and are likely vectors of leishias to humans or mammals. Leish naiff, known to cause cutaneous in South America, was identified in Lu. trap and Lu. g, suggesting its range may have expanded to the Isthmus or it's a recent introduction.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism by which human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivates from latency in dendritic cells (DC). They found that the mitogen and stress kinase (MS) family is involved in this process, specifically through its interaction with the transcription factor CREB. CREB binds to the major early promoter (MP) of the virus, allowing MS to be recruited and phosphorylate histone H3. This leads to histone demethylation and exit from latency. The study suggests that CREB's role in HCV reactivation is not only as a transcription factor, but also in promoting chromatin modifications for viral gene expression. Inhibiting the interaction between CRE and MS could be a therapeutic strategy. In vitro studies showed that chromatin bound to the c-fos promoter is resistant to MS mediated phosphorylation, but CREB binding promotes histone phosphorylation. An adenovirus vector was used to show that ER-MS relationship with CRE-histone H phosphorylation and IE expression from latency is direct. MS binding to MP before reactivation supports this. The study shows IE expression from latency in DC is sensitive to MS inhibition and HCV reactivation involves histone phosphorylation bound to latent MP. MS mediated phosphorylation is dependent on CRE binding to MP.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for the protein N11 in the development of the face and skull in frogs and other vertebrates. N11 is involved in the production of ribosomes, which are essential for all living cells. Defects in ribosome production lead to a group of disorders called ribosomies. The team found that N11 is highly expressed in the cells that form the face and skull in both frogs and mammals. They knocked down N11 in frogs and saw impaired ribosome production, increased cell death, and abnormal development of face cartilage. Inhibiting a protein p53, which helps remove damaged cells, rescued the face defect but not the ribosome issue. This shows a conserved mechanism between ribosome and face cell survival. Excessive activation of this mechanism harmed face development. The study reveals a new role for N11 in face development and the first model of a ribosopathy, showing the link between ribosome proteins and face cell survival.
Researchers have developed a high-density protein microarray to identify proteins that can be used as diagnostic markers for leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease that affects humans and animals worldwide. Leptpirosis is difficult to diagnose, especially in early stages when treatment is most effective, due to lack of adequate laboratory tests. The microarray contained 2,421 proteins, 61% of the proteome of Leptira interrogans serovar Copenhagen, and was tested against IgG from 274 individuals, including 80 with acute, 80 convalescent, and 114 healthy subjects from regions with high, endemic, and no transmission. A nitrocellulose blot validated the microarray results, finding 16 antigens that distinguish acute cases from healthy individuals in high transmission areas and 18 that convalescent cases. Some identified antigens, such as Lip32, non-identical domains Gro, and Lo22, are known to be recognized by human sera, validating the serodiagnostic approach. Novel antigens, including LIC15, showed good sensitivity and specificity for both acute and convalescent patients. This study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptiral infection and identified known seragnostic leptiral antigens recognized by antibodies in leptpi cases. The novel antigens may be used to develop new tests and improve current assays for this neglected disease. Further research is needed to assess their utility in deployable platforms.
Researchers studied the immune response of mosquitoes to a fungus called Beauveria bassiana, which infects and kills mosquitoes. They used the malaria-carrying mosquito Anopheles gambia as a model to investigate the role of melanization, a potent immune mechanism in arthropods, in defense against this fungus. They found that melan formed on all stages of the fungus, including conidia, tubes, and hyphae, but rarely stopped its growth. Silencing key regulators of melanization, TEP and CL8, abolished melan on hypha but not on germinating conidia or tubes. A layer of hemocytes surrounded germinating conidia but not hypha, suggesting melan of early stages is cell-mediated while late is humoral dependent on TEP and CL8. Microscopic analysis revealed T1 association with hye surfaces and requirement of both T and CL8 for recruiting phenolase to these. Fungal growth was rapid in T and CL8 knockdown mosquitoes with increased sensitivity to natural B infections. The study shows melan response significantly retards B growth and dissemination, a finding that may be used to design transgenic fungi with potent control against mosquitoes.
Researchers have identified a new way to prevent the spread of dengue virus by blocking the mosquito's ability to carry the virus. They tested four chemicals that are known to block the virus in mammals and found that two of them, bafilomycin (BAF) and myopholic acid (M), were effective in blocking the virus in the mosquito. Injecting these chemicals into the mosquito before feeding on infected blood reduced the virus by 56-60% in the mosquito's midgut and 90-83% in the salivary gland. The chemicals were also effective when ingested through a sugar meal with infected blood. Silencing the genes that code for the chemicals' target in the mosquito also reduced the virus. The timing of when the chemicals were given was important, as giving them after exposure to the virus reduced their effect. This study shows that blocking the mosquito's ability to carry the virus can reduce the spread of deng.
Researchers studied how changes in cell volume affect brain activity, particularly in conditions like seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization. They combined cell swelling with ion and oxygen levels into a model of brain cell behavior, called the Hodgkin-Hux type spiking dynamics. This model showed that cell swelling can trigger a transition between seizure and spreading states in response to changes in pressure. The study also found that cell volume acts as a parameter that separates seizure and spreading depression, and another that separates spreading from anoxic depolar. The research highlights the protective role of glial cells against seizures and spreading, and provides new insights into anoxic depolar and cell swelling during ischemia. The study suggests that seizures, spreading, and anoxicolar are part of a continuum of brain behavior that can be understood by considering ion, oxygen, and cell response to pressure. The findings demonstrate a framework for understanding a range of brain behaviors that could lead to new treatments for these conditions.
Researchers studied how the body's immune system responds to a fungal infection caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a common in Latin America. They found that a protein complex called NLR3 inflamome is activated when the fungus infects cells, leading to the release of a cytokine called IL-1β. This cytokine is important for fighting off infections, but its role in fighting a primary pathogen like P. brasili is not well understood. The study showed that P. brasili activates NLR3 inflome through a process involving potassium, oxygen, acid, and cathepsin release. They also found that IL-1 signaling is crucial for killing the fungus in mice macrophages. The study suggests that N3 inflome senses and responds to P. brasili infection and plays a role in host defense against the fungus. Further studies are needed to determine if IL-1 and N3 inflome components protect against P. bras in vivo and how IL-1 activates macrophages for killing activity.
Toxoplas gondii is a brain-tropic parasite that infects various cells, including astrocytes and neurons, in vitro. However, in vivo, it primarily infects neurons. Research suggests that neurons are persistently infected because they lack the ability to clear intracellular parasites. To test this theory, a novel Tooplas-mouse model was created to mark and track host cells interacting with parasites, even transiently. Surprisingly, Tooplas shows a strong preference for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection. This preference remains in the setting of IF-γ depletion, which is the mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites, and when parasites are injected directly into the brain. These findings, combined with previous work, indicate neurons are not incidentally infected, but Tooplas's primary in vivo target.

 Studies show Toop primarily interacts with neurons because it invades both astrocytes and neurons in vitro. One possibility is that astrotes and neurons are infected in vivo, but astrotes kill or are killed by the parasite, leaving neurons as the host for persistent infection. Alternatively, Toop could primarily interact with neurons, meaning it persists in these cells because they are where the parasite interfaces. Studies suggest Toop primarily encysts in neurons because they cannot clear intracellular parasites, but none have directly addressed this in vivo due to lack of techniques to identify transiently infected astrotes. A Tooplas strains that inject Cre recombinase into host were generated to overcome this barrier. This finding contradicts the "astro-killing" model of CNS-Toop interactions, and expands upon initial findings to define parenchymal cells interacting with parasites in vivo. During CNS infection with divergent Toop-C strains, neurons make up the majority of GFP parenymal cells regardless of time or infecting strain.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to explain how cells move and change shape during a process called lamellipodial motility. This process involves the interaction between actin, a protein that makes up the cell's skeleton, and myosin, a protein that helps cells move. The model shows how actin and myos work together to create movement and shape the cell's edge, called the lamipodium. Actin grows at the edge of the cell, pushing it forward, while myos pulls it back, creating a balance between the two forces. This balance is key to the cell's movement.

The model found that cell movement depends on three factors: how strong myos is, how sticky the cell is, and how fast actin grows. If myos is weak, the cell stays still. If myos is strong, the cell moves. The direction of movement depends on the cell's edge. If the edge is flat, the cell moves in a straight line. If the edge is curved, the cell turns.

The researchers tested the model with computer simulations and found that it matches real cell behavior. They saw that cells move in a straight or curved paths, depending on the edge shape. The model also showed that cells can turn when the edge is sticky and actin grows fast, causing myos to concentrate at the back of the cell, breaking symmetry.

The study focused on the mechanical aspects of cell movement, like actin growth and myos contraction, rather than chemical signals. Actin at the edge pushes back against myos, which pulls, creating a balance that shapes the cell. The model shows that cell movement depends on three factors: myos strength, stickiness, and actin growth. If myos is weak, the cell stays still. If myos is strong, the cell moves.
Researchers have developed a new method to assess the reliability of protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks, which are complex networks of proteins that interact with each other in cells. These interactions are crucial for many biological processes, but are difficult to study due to high levels of noise and incompleteness in experimental data. For example, yeast-2-hybrid (YH) screens have a false positive rate of up to 64% and false negative rate of 43-71%, while tandem purification (T) experiments have similar levels of noise. The new method uses geometric graphs, a type of mathematical model, to evaluate confidence of interactions and predict new ones. It achieves 85% specificity and 90 sensitivity. The researchers applied it to human PI network from BioGRID and predicted 251 interactions, a significant fraction of which correspond to proteins with common functions. They validated a portion of predictions in HPRD and BioGRID databases. The method is available online.
Researchers have created a fruit fly model to study myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM), a disease caused by a non-coding CT repeat expansion. They tested the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG transcripts in the fly model. The study found that co-expressing CT and CAG repeats led to enhanced toxicity. This was due to the generation of 21-nt repeat-derived siRNAs that targeted C-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA protein, which have C repeats in both flies and humans. These findings suggest that repeat-derived siRNAs may enhance toxicity in diseases with anti-sense transcription.

The study showed that nonoding CT repeats confer length-dependent toxicity in brain and muscle of flies. Expanded CT transcripts accumulated in nuclei and affected splicing, similar to human DM. To understand CUG toxicity, researchers created flies with pure CT repeats in a protein's 3'UTR. These recapitulated key features of CUG expansion diseases. Given that 70% of genes have antiense transcription, they tested co-expressing CT and CAG. This resulted in enhanced toxicity and generation of repeat-derived siRNAs.

Triplet repeat expansions in nonoding regions cause several human diseases, including DM, fragile X, spinocerebellar ataxia, and Huntington's disease. The study suggests that antiense transcripts may play a role in these diseases. Fruit flies have been used to study neurodegenerative diseases relevant to humans.
Researchers have re-examined the phylogeny and virulence of the soft rot-causing bacterium Pectacterium sp. SCC3, isolated from a diseased potato in Finland in the 1980s. Genomic analysis revealed that SCC3, previously classified as P. carotorum, is now accurately classified as P. wasiae. The revised phylog of P. carorum and studies on P. wasiae indicate that P. wasiae has been present in potato fields worldwide, unnoticed. A combination of genomic and in planta experiments identified features that separate SCC3 and other P. wasiae from other soft bacteria, including the absence of a type III secretion system contributing to virulence in other rot species. Experimentally established virulence determinants include a transcription regulator, two type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters containing vir genes. The genome also revealed traits related to life in planta or specific conditions, such as a benzoic acid/salicy acid carbox methyltransferase of eukary origin. This work indicates soft bacteria have a reservoir of unknown traits used in the poorly understood latent stage in planta. The genomic comparison of SCC3 to sequenced Pacter strains, including the type P. wasiae, provides a basis for further investigation of virulence and phylog of rot and other bacteria.
Researchers investigated how the changes in protein composition of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, occur when their DNA is depleted. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion is linked to various human diseases, but little is known about how proteins encoded by the cell's nucleus (nuclear) are affected. The study used network analysis of gene expression data to examine mt-depleted (ρ) mitochondria. By organizing quantified proteomics data into functional networks, properties of mitochondrial dysfunction were analyzed. Up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were grouped into two sub-networks with distinct biological processes. Down-regulated modules were involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while upregulated proteins were responsible for mtDNA repair and protein expression transport. Comparing proteome and transcriptome data showed that ρ cells attempted to compensate for mt depletion by modulating protein expression and transport. Results demonstrate that protein composition remodels mitochondrial networks in response to dysfunctional states, providing a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions.
Researchers have developed a new method to calculate the rates of complex biological processes that occur inside living cells, such as protein synthesis, from rates measured outside the cell. This method has two main parts. First, it introduces a concept called "kinetic distance" to compare the rates of processes in different environments. The distance depends on the rates and can be understood in terms of energy barriers. Second, it minimizes the distance between in vitro and in vivo processes, ensuring the calculated rates match a known property like overall speed in vivo. To test the method, it was applied to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression. The process was described by a model with three pathways for tRNA binding, and rates were determined in vitro. Then, in vivo rates were calculated and validated with three sets of data: codon translation speeds, dynamics, and error frequencies. Results showed good agreement without adjusting parameters. Calculated in vivo rates were more accurate than vitro rates, mainly due to improved tRNA selection. The method is simple and can be applied to other biological processes with known vitro kinetics.
Researchers studied the evolution of Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that infects humans, by analyzing DNA sequences from 97 isolates, including 34 pairs of samples taken from the same individuals over time periods of 0.25 to 10.2 years and 29 isolates from 10 families. They found that genetic diversity increased over time in a predictable way, like a clock, and estimated short-term mutation and recombination rates. The short-term mutation rate was 1.4×10^-6 to 4.5×10^-6 per nucleotide per year, with three times more substitutions introduced by recombination than mutation. Long-term rate over millennia was 5-17 times lower due to removal of non-synonymous mutations by purifying selection. This is different from previous estimates of 1.4×^-9 per year for Escherichia coli and Salmonella, which was based on a universal clock for bacterial RNA sequences. The researchers also found that short-term rates vary greatly between species, spanning several orders of magnitude.
Researchers have discovered that melanopsin, a pigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, plays a significant role in visual perception beyond driving reflex responses such as circadian entrainment and pupillary movements. Using new reporter lines, they found melanin projections extend to the dorsal geniculate nucleus, the origin of thalamocortical neurons, and support physiological responses in the visual cortex in mice lacking rods and cones. Chromatic stimuli isolated melanin responses in mice with intact visual systems reveal melanin input to 40% of neurons in the geniculate nucleus show activation to light. Melanin input increases the firing rate of these neurons, suggesting melanin encodes irradiance. This is confirmed in melanin knockout mice. The study establishes melanin photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamocortical system, providing irradiance information even in the absence of rods and cones. Melanin is a potential origin of visual perception and may support vision in retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection is associated with a significant depletion of mucosal CD4 T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating the immune response to antigens at mucosal surfaces. Researchers investigated whether this depletion affects humoral responses to antigens at mucosal surfaces in HIV-1-infected individuals. A comprehensive analysis of systemic and mucosal humoral responses to intestinal microbiota showed reduced IgG responses to antigens from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but not Bacteroidetes. Intestinal secretions of HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy exhibited elevated IgM levels and decreased IgA/Ig and IgG/Ig ratios to various microbial and food antigens. The findings indicate reduced mucosal B cells' ability to switch from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their response to changing antigens in the gut. Decreased IgA and IgG to microbiota may contribute to microbial translocation across the mucosal barrier, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals. 

The study found four key points: elevated IgM and antigen-specific in intestinal secretions, reduced IgG/Ig and Ig/Ig ratios to microbial and food antigens, reduced Ig to Proteobacteria and Firmutes in plasma, and a correlation between Ig and CD4 counts. CD4 depletion or dysfunction may be responsible for mucosal dysregulation in HIV-1-infected, warranting further investigation. Data show low interdependence of Ig responses between intestinal and systemic compartments. ART-treated HIV-1 individuals had increased IgM and decreased Ig/Ig and Ig/Ig to mucosal antigens, indicating lack of help for class recombination. Altered Ig response to mucosal antigens may promote inflammation and barrier damage. HIV-1 individuals with low CD4 counts had reduced Ig to Proteob and Firmutes. ART-treated individuals had increased Ig to all mucosal antigens and Ig to food and yeast. Viral controllers had decreased Ig to mucosal antig compared to ART and untreated.
Researchers have developed a new model to study how populations of species in ecosystems change over time. In traditional models, populations grow and shrink due to births and deaths of individuals. This new model adds a new mechanism: when one population crashes, it frees up resources for others. This can happen in communities like bacteria, where one strain is wiped out by a virus, or in ecosystems where diseases play a big role. The new model shows that populations go through "diversity waves" triggered by crashes of dominant populations. Diversity peaks at the start of each wave and decreases. Species have a bimodal time-aggregated distribution, with lower peaks of recently collapsed or new species and upper ones that haven't crashed yet. Most waves have multiple peaks. This self-organized structure has long-term memory across waves, creating a scale-free time-aggregated distribution with an exponent of 1.7. The model is robust to variations in rules like diffusion, growth rates, and extinction strategies. Simulations of the model show the same patterns of collapse-driven diversity and scale-free distribution. The model shows that long-term growth rate is not a good measure of fitness, as it's zero in this model. Population dynamics in saturated environments are often described by neutral drift models with resource differences. This model adds episodic collapses. A collapsed population is replenished by a few individuals from other environments. Growth results in a steady state at carrying capacity. At longer times, the system is described by diversity waves, the focus of this study. Waves are an emergent property where surviving populations grow while diversity decays.
Researchers have re-examined the chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, a well-studied paradigm of simple behavior, and found an additional mechanism of navigation. Chemotaxis is the ability of bacteria to follow chemical gradients, which is crucial for their survival and evolution. E. coli follows gradients by comparing chemector concentrations along its path, a strategy efficient for its size and speed. Concentration differences are detected by a sensory system and transmitted to flagellar motors, decreasing tumble probability and reorienting if the change is positive. This regulation of tumble probability explains chemactic drift up the gradient, assumed to be only mechanism of E. coli chemaxis.

Using computer simulations, researchers predict an additional mechanism of navigation in E. coli. They found that not only tumble probability but also reorientation during tumble depends on swimming direction along the gradient. Although the difference in tumble angles is small, it enhances cellular velocity along the gradient. A new level of optimization in E coli chemaxis is discovered, arising from flagellar switching and fine-tuning tumble angle. This strategy is likely used by other peritously flagellated bacteria, indicating another level of bacterial chemaxis development.

The researchers suggest that tuning tumble angle on direction serves as additional navigation for E coli and similar bacteria. This fine tuning is mediated by adjusting tumble frequency, same as conventional chemaxis. Both mechanisms arise from basic motor switching, optimization depends on effect and number of flagella.
Researchers have found that the Stat3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of medullary epithelial cells (mTECs) in the thymus. These cells are essential for establishing tolerance by presenting self-peptides to autoreactive thymocytes and diverting them into regulatory T cells. Activation of the NFκB pathway in TE precursors is necessary for TE maturation and proliferation, but Stat3 signaling also contributes to TE development and homeostasis. Experiments showed that expressing a constitutively active Stat3 gene in the TE compartment increased TE cellularity and bypassed the need for signals from positively selected thymocytes to form the medull region. Conversely, deleting Stat disrupted medull architecture and reduced TE cells. Stat signaling did not affect TE proliferation, but promoted survival of immature MHCloCDlo TE precursors. In contrast, altering the TE compartment did not affect cortical epithelial cellularity or organization. These results demonstrate that, in addition to the NF pathway, Stat-mediated signaling is essential for regulating TE cellularity and medull homeasis.
Researchers have identified 511 small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) in the bacterium Clostridium difficile, a common cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea. They used a computer-based approach to find these RNAs in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome. In parallel, they used RNA sequencing and 5-end sequencing to identify C difficile RNAs and their start sites at three growth stages: exponential, stationary, and starvation. This approach found 251 putative RNAs, including 94 intergenic regulators, 91 antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 RNs was confirmed by specific experiments. Some RNs, including antisense that may control C difficile autolytic activity, showed growth-dependent profiles. Expression of 16 predicted c-G responsive riboswitches was observed, and evidence for their role in motility and biofilm formation was found. Abundant RNs encoded by C CRIS loci may be important for C survival in phage-rich gut. This study provides a basis for future characterization of RN regulation in C difficile.
Researchers have found that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein downregulates the abundance of a liver-specific microRNA called mi-122 by promoting its destabilization through the inhibition of a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly (A) polymer called GL-2. This decrease in mi-122 expression results in the dysregulation of its functions, including its proviral activity for HCV. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from liver biops revealed that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype mi-122 is modified at its 3' end by 3- terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of mi-122 bearing a single nucleotide tail is decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. These single-nucle-tailed mi-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability compared to the 22-nt prototype mi-122. The 3-terminal extension is catalyzed by the unique nucleotidyl transfer activity of GL-2, which can add any ribonucleotide without preference to the mi-122 3 end. The H core protein specifically inhibits GL-2, and its interaction with GL-2 in the cytoplasm is responsible for mi-122 downregulation. Inhibition of GL-2 by the H core affects multiple miRNAs, including mi-122, by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers. Sequencing of small RNAs from liverops showed that among the top 50 most expressed miRN in liver tissues, only six mi exhibited a decrease in 3-end adenylated isomer levels upon H infection. mi-122 levels in human liverops from healthy subjects and patients with H were analyzed, and decreased in specimens from patients (66.3%, 72.7%, and 74.1% in H-1, H-2, and H-3 respectively) compared to normal.
Researchers have found evidence of acquired immunity to Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes disease in humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, in wild lions in Serengeti. They discovered a decrease in prevalence of T. brucei infection in lions that is consistent with an increase in cross-immunity from exposure to a more diverse species, T. congense, the causative of human sleeping sickness. This immunity allows lions to clear T. bruce infections by 3-5 years old and eliminate T. rhodesense by 6 years. Frequent exposure to tset bites accelerates immunity, seen in areas with high tset exposure, such as woodlands compared to plains. This is the first epidemiological evidence of acquired immunity to trypan in any species, challenging the notion that immunity is impossible, making vaccines impractical.
Researchers used mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis to explore the idea that mechanistic models of human coagulation cascades, despite uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, which could serve as therapeutic targets. They tested this hypothesis on a well-studied coagulation cascade model developed from literature. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 datasets from different in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin profiles in presence and absence of anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across trials. Sensitivity coefficients, measuring robustness or fragility of a mechanism, were calculated using Monte Carlo. In absence anticoagul, and surface factor X/activated factor (Xa) and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were fragile, while IX/IX and V/VIII/VIII activation and activity were robust. Anti-Xa and thrombin inhibitors, classes of anticoagulants, have FDA approval for prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and initial treatment deep venous thromosis pulmonary embolism. In vitro and vivo evidence supports prediction IXIX activity robust. Results support hypothesis computationally derived points of fragility human cascades as basis for target selection despite uncertainty.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the interaction between bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and their host bacteria, specifically Campylobacterium jejuni, a foodborne pathogen. They tested the model in an in vitro system and found that it accurately predicted the growth of phage-sensitive and resistant bacteria populations. This is the first study to test a model against in vitro data that includes phage-resistant bacteria. The model suggests that "inundation and proliferation thresholds" are crucial for phage therapy. By fitting the model to data, the researchers estimated these thresholds and rate constants. They also found culture-density dependent features of phage infectivity that need further investigation. The study shows how combining empirical and theoretical approaches can enhance understanding of phage-bacteria interactions. In vitro studies are necessary to understand kinetic properties of phage in vivo.
Researchers have identified a Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the snail Biomphalaria glabr that plays a crucial role in the snail's immune response to the parasitic flatworm Schistoma mansoni. Schistomias is a disease that affects over 260 million people worldwide, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. The snail is an essential host for the parasite's larval development, a trait shared among all digene trematodes. The study found that the TLR, called BTL, is more abundant in snails that are resistant to S. mansoni infection and its expression increases when challenged with the parasite. Knocking down BTL in resistant snails made them susceptible to infection. This is the first functional characterization of a gastropod TLR and shows BTL's importance in snail immune response to S. mansoni.
Researchers have developed a new tool to measure human exposure to disease-carrying mosquitoes in the Pacific islands of French Polynes. These mosquitoes, Aedes aegypt and Aedes polensis, transmit diseases such as dengue chikung and Zika, and Bancroftian filariasis. To assess the risk of disease transmission and effectiveness of control measures, scientists looked at the presence of antibodies against mosquito saliva proteins in human blood. An ELISA test was used to detect and quantify immunoglobulin G (Ig) against salivary gland extracts of Aedes aegpt and Aedes polensis in people exposed to these mosquitoes. In Tahiti and Moore islands, 98% and 68% of individuals had IgG against Aedes aeg and Aedesensis respectively. In contrast, 97% of people from metropolitan France, not exposed to these mosquitoes, had no Ig against saliv gland extracts. Analysis showed no cross-reactivity between Aedes aeg and Aensis saliv extracts. The study suggests Ig response to saliv extracts is a valid biomarker of human exposure to Aedes bites. This new tool will help understand exposure to mosquito bites, identify areas of high disease risk, and evaluate control strategies in Pacific and tropical settings.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, has a unique ability to survive inside human cells called macrophages. To understand how it does this, researchers looked at how the bacteria affects the cell's metabolism. They found that the bacteria changes the cell's metabolic pathways to help it survive and grow. This is a key to its ability to cause disease. The study identified specific reactions in the cell that the bacteria targets to achieve this. Interestingly, this shows how both the host and bacteria work together to determine the severity of the disease. The bacteria's ability to survive is linked to the host's blood sugar levels, and the bacteria's virulence, or ability to cause disease, also plays a role in the outcome. 

The bacteria's ability to adapt to the cell's metabolism is a key to its pathogenicity, or ability to cause disease. The study used different strains of the bacteria with varying virulence, or ability to cause disease, to see how they affect the cell's metabolism over time. The results showed that the bacteria's ability to cause disease is linked to its ability to change the cell's metabolism. The study found that the bacteria regulates the cell's metabolism at the metabolic level, impacting disease pathology. The bacteria's strategies to cause disease were revealed by the study's design, which included different strains with various virulence traits. The study found that blood sugar levels contribute to disease by affecting the cell's ability to fight off the bacteria. This adds to the relationship between diabetes and TB, a known risk factor for the disease.
Researchers studied the role of ZHP-3, a protein in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, in meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation. Meiotic recombination and chiasma formation ensure proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division. Z-3, the C. elegans ortholog of the yeast ZIP gene, is required for recombination. The study found that Z-3 protein is dynamic, shifting from the synaptonal complex (SC) to asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually to foci marking crossover events. A Z-3::GFP transgene partially complements a null mutation, promoting wild-type recombination but high aneuploidy among progeny, indicating defects in meiotic segregation. The bivalent structure is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting segregation defect from inability to remodel chromosomes in response to crosso. SMO-1 mutants exhibit similar phenotypes at higher temperatures, and SMO;Z-3G double mutants more severe meiotic defects than single, consistent with SUM role in SC assembly and bivalent differentiation. The study proposes coordination of recombination with SC assembly and bivalent formation reflects conserved role Zip/ZHP in recombination with morphogenesis.
Aedes albopus, a tropical mosquito species, has spread to temperate regions of Europe and the US, causing public health concerns due to its ability to transmit diseases and nuisance due to its daytime biting behavior. Researchers studied eco-climatic factors affecting Ae. albopus abundance in metropolitan and suburban areas in Rome, Italy, which was colonized in 1997 and is now one of the most infested areas in Southern Europe. Adult mosquitoes were monitored along a 70km-long transect across the metropolitan area, and two spatial-temporal datasets were used to analyze the effect of climatic and environmental variables on Ae. abundance. Results showed a strong association between urban habitats and high abundance in both metropolitan and suburban areas, with "green" islands" of abundance in metropolitan areas, and bimodal dynamics with a peak in autumn due to heavy rains and warm temperatures. The study suggests prioritizing mosquito control measures in urban areas where human-mos contact and disease transmission risk are higher, and public health risks after summer months with high mosquito densities.
Researchers have studied how Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis, invades host cells called macrophages. They found that a group of lipids called phiocer dimocates (DIM) play a key role in this process. DIM are major virulence factors of M, meaning they help the bacterium cause disease. To understand how DIM work, the researchers created mutants of M that couldn't make DIM. They found that DIM help M enter macrophages by changing the host cell's plasma membrane. This change makes it easier for M to be engulfed by the cell. The researchers also found that DIM prevent the acidification of the phagosome, a process that would normally kill the bacterium. They used drugs to remove cholesterol from the cell membrane and found that this abolished the difference between wild-type and mutant strains. Inserting a cholesterol probe showed that the membrane's hydrophobic core changed upon contact with M, but lateral diffusion was unaffected. This effect was dependent on DIM and consistent with a model. The researchers propose that DIM control M invasion by modifying the host membrane's lipid organization, making it more favorable for receptor-mediated phagocytosis. This contributes to the bacterium's survival in a protective niche.
Researchers have been using mean-field approximations to study large neural networks, but these methods don't accurately describe small networks of a few neurons. This is a problem in neuroscience, as many studies involve networks of tens of neurons. To address this, a new analysis of small networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is developed. The dynamics of these networks are studied with a method that's analytically tractable and numerically, and global bifurcations are determined. It's found that strong inhibition leads to complex dynamics, with multiple solutions emerging through symmetry-breaking. This is a finite-size effect, revealing differences between mesoscopic circuits and mean-field approximations. Symmetry-breaking allows mesoscopic networks to regulate heterogeneity, reducing noise's effect on information processing.

The mean-field approximation differs when inhibitory weights are strong. Symmetry-breaking causes a pitchfork bifurcation, with multiple solutions emerging. New bifurcations occur, enriching complexity. The dynamics of small networks were pioneered by Beer, studying bifurcations with symmetric weights and asymptotic approximations. Most literature deals with 2-4 neurons, while methods for tens of neurons are limited. This work extends analysis to biologically plausible networks, deriving bifcation manifolds with less constraints. A finite-size model with excitatory and inhibitory populations is considered. Mean-field provides an approximation, neglecting phenomena like transitions and correlations.
Researchers investigated the presence and viability of Leishmania parasites in extraional sites during human dermal leishiasis. They used Leish 7RNA to estimate parasite burden and viability in extraional sites of dermal leishias patients. The study evaluated the feasibility of discriminating parasite viability by PCR of Leish 7RNA in relation to luciferase activity of transfected intracellular amastigotes in dose-response assays. Monocytes, tonsil swabs, and skin aspirates of 28 cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishias patients were screened by DNA amplification/Southern blot. Positive samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR of Leish 7RNA genes and transcripts. Results showed that 7RNA amplification coincided with lucifer activity, confirming parasite viability. Of 22 patients presenting DNA in extraional samples, Leish 7RNA or genes transcripts were detected in one or more DNA samples 100% and 73% respectively. Gene transcript number from extraional tissues were comparable to lesions. 7RNA were detected in 13/19 (68%) monocytes, 5/12 (42%) tonsil sw, 4/11 (36%) normal aspir, and 22/25 (88%) lesions. Viable parasites present in extraional sites, including monocytes, tons, and skin of dermalias patients. Leish 7RNA is informative for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of human leias.
Researchers have found a way to predict when DNA replication occurs in fruit fly cells using a combination of chromatin features, such as histone modifications and chromatin-binding proteins. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up chromosomes. Histone modifications (HMs) and chromatin-binding proteins (CB) are crucial for DNA replication, but no single one is essential, suggesting they work together like a code. Unlike gene expression, the relationship between chromatin features and replication was unknown. The study used a comprehensive collection of 95 chrom features to predict DNA replication timing in fruit flies using statistical models. Combinations of chrom features showed moderate predictive power, while interactions between histone modifications led to accurate genome-wide predictions that can be improved by chromatin proteins. A simplified model of the relationship between chromatin and replication was derived, reaching 80% of the model's accuracy using six terms. Combinations of histone modifications also predicted DNA timing across different cell types. The study supports the existence of combinatorial histone patterns for replication and reveals cell-type elements, whose investigation might explain the regulation of this fundamental process.
Dengue virus, a mosquito-borne disease, affects 390 million people worldwide and causes at least 25,000 deaths annually, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. Researchers studied the spread of three deng virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3) in Brazil using genetic data. They found that new lineages of each serotype were introduced every 7-10 years, likely from the Caribbean to North and Northeast Brazil, then spreading at a rate of 0.5 km/day. The study suggests that human and mosquito transportation, not mosquito infestation or distance, drives deng virus spread in Brazil. 

The researchers analyzed 178 Brazilian genome sequences to determine factors affecting deng spread nationwide using a spatial model. Predictors of spread included geographic distance, air traffic, mosquito infestation, population density, and area. They found that human and mosquito transportation played a key role in deng spread. The study shows distinct introductions and circulation of serotypes and genotypes, highlighting air's impact on deng spread in Brazil, with new lineages followed by outbreaks every 7-10 years. Epidemiological data supports this, with deng peaks coinciding with new lineage introductions every 7-10 years. However, caution is needed when predicting viral emergence, as recent deng serotype 4 introduction from Asia shows new lineages can be introduced by chance.
Scientists have long sought to understand how the brain processes sensory information and leads to perception and behavior, known as the neural code. A key aspect of this is how neurons interact with each other, as they are not independent but correlated. Correlations between neurons have a significant impact on coding. Researchers investigated how differences in the center-surround receptive field organization across three sensory maps in weakly electric fish influence correlations between electrosens pyram neurons. Using a model based on anatomical differences in field size and overlap, they predicted large differences in activity across maps. However, in vivo recordings showed contrary to predictions, electens pyram neurons in all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this, the effects of surround were incorporated into the model. By varying the surround size relative to the center, multiple structures gave similar correlations. Incorporating physiological differences between maps in the model resulted in similar correlations. The study shows center alone does not determine correlations, important for understanding structure's influence on activity.
Researchers investigated how noise in the responses of neurons affects the ability to encode a stimulus in a population of neurons. They considered a general setting where the tuning curves and heterogeneity of the neurons were not specified, and varied the level of noise to see how it impacted performance. The results showed that if the noise between pairs of neurons had opposite signs to their signal correlations, coding improved compared to independent responses. This "sign rule" (SR) held for different metrics and levels of heterogeneity. However, it was not a necessary condition for good coding, as diverse correlation structures that violated it could also improve performance. The optimal structures were found to lie on the boundaries of possible correlations. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions was provided for performance to be as good as without noise. An example illustrated two regimes with different properties of noise leading to optimal coding. The SR was established for homogenous correlations, but also held for heterogenous populations. Conditions for chosen noise to yield performance as good as deterministic responses were identified, satisfied with high probability for large populations.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa affects the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics. They found that Pseudas aerugin alters S aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner and identified three interactions that either antagonize or potentiate antibiotic activity against aureus. Pseud aerugin's Las endopeptase potentiates vancomycin's effect by breaking down aure's cell wall, rhamolids facilitate proton-motive-independent vancom uptake, and 2-hepty-4-hydroquinoline N-oxide (HQ) induces multidrug tolerance in aure by inhibiting cellular respiration and ATP production. The production of these factors varies between clinical isolates and correlates with their ability to alter aure susceptibility. In a mouse burn infection, vancom treatment of aure was potentiated by the presence of Las-producing P aerugin population. These findings show that susceptibility is not only dependent on the targeted pathogen's genotype, but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the environment. Considering these interactions will improve treatment of polymicrobial infections.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism of platelet clearance in patients with deng virus (DENV) infection, which contributes to thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications. They found that patients with deng had higher levels of von Wille factor (VWF), a protein that binds to platelets, and platelets had more VWF on their surface. The amount of VWF on platelets correlated with plate count. Sialic acid, a molecule on plate surface, was reduced in deng patients, but not due to virus neuraminidase activity. Instead, VWF binding to platelets caused sial loss through platelet neuraminase, an enzyme on plate surface. Inhibiting neuraminase with oseltivir reduced V-induced sial loss. The study suggests that excessive V binding to platelets in deng leads to neuraminase-mediated sial loss and clearance. Oseltiv may treat severe thrombocytopenia in deng.
Researchers have identified a new type of gene regulation in the human genome called bidirectional promoters, where two genes with opposite directions are controlled by a shared regulatory region. These promoters are often linked to genes involved in DNA repair and may play a role in cancer development. Using a database of expressed sequences, they found the most complete list of human genes under bidirectional control and discovered new promoters that function as alternative or novel transcripts. They found a significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in cancer-related genes, including breast and ovarian cancer. The use of this structure in the genome suggests it regulates co-expression among groups of genes. Microarray data from 79 human tissues verified regulatory networks controlled by bidirectional promoters. Some promoters have similar transcription binding sites, including conserved ETS factor sites in ERBB, FCD, and BRCA.

A new algorithm was developed to map bidirectional promoters in the genome using expressed sequences. The set of promoters shows relationships among regulated by bidirectional through co-expression. A subset of promoters regulating breast and ovarian cancer genes contain common transcription sites. Misregulation of bidirectional promoters, especially with common sites, may contribute to cancer development. Data confirmed expression of flanking transcripts for 91%, 58%, and 65% of promoters in genes, EST, and datasets. Enrichment of bidirectional with DNA repair genes implies a link to cancer pathways. Data confirm association with somatic cancer and indicate type relevant. Bidirectional promoters in uter and ovarian cancers were examined. Expression-clustering showed bid not a single network or thousands of pairs, but intermediate relationships between. Ovarian genes showed one or both members significant with bid promoters.
Researchers have studied the sex chromosomes of flies, specifically Diptera, which include fruit flies like Drosophila melanogaster, to understand how sex is determined in these insects. They analyzed the genomes of 37 fly species from 22 different families and found a surprising diversity of sex chromosome types, with over a dozen different configurations. The small dot chromosome is often used as the sex chromosome, but some species have undifferentiated chromosomes, others replaced the dot with a different chromosome, or incorporated up to three elements into the sex chromosome, and some have female heterogamy (Z sex) chromosomes. Transcript analysis shows that dosage compensation, a mechanism to balance gene expression, evolved multiple times in flies by upregulating the single X in males. However, X chromosomes have fewer genes with male-biased expression, possibly due to sex-specific pressures.

Comparative studies of high-quality genomes and transcriptomes of species with independent sex chromosomes will reveal how X chromosomes became demasculized. The analysis reveals a diversity of sex chromosomes hidden underneath similar karyotypes. Chromosomes have been lost, gained, rearranged, or replaced multiple times in Dipt evolution. Data suggest Dipt ancestrally had homomorphic chromosomes and the dot became sex in flies, or the dot was ancestral but reverted to autosomal in mosquitoes and flies. Higher flies show diverse sex kary.
Researchers investigated blood samples from 18 mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 who gave birth to healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009-2012. They tested the blood for Zika virus (ZIK) IgM and IgG antibodies using a commercial kit. One mother who delivered a baby with microaly tested positive for ZIK IgM (16.6%) and three tested positive for ZIK IgG (50%). ZIK showed a trend with microaly. Mothers with ZIK IgG antibodies were more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those without (OR 11.0, 95% CI 0.8-147.9, p=0.083). Similarly, ZIK IgM positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those without (OR 6.8, 95 CI 0.2-195.1). These findings suggest a link between ZIK infection and microaly and presence of ZV cases in the US as early as 2009.
Researchers investigated the transmission of Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infections in the Ashanti region of Ghana, where Buruli ulcer (BU) is prevalent. Although previous studies linked MU to slow-moving water bodies, the exact mode of transmission was unclear. The team used Variable Number Tand Repeat (VN) typing to differentiate MU from other mycobacteria. They matched VN profiles of MU in human samples to environmental samples from 10 water bodies in four endemic communities. Four VN loci in the MU99 genome were used to genotype environmental and human isolates. Sequencing confirmed polymorphism. MU was found in three types of water, but higher in biofilm samples. Four genotypes W, X, Y, and Z were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other genotypes were only in water. A mouse with BU-like lesion was infected with MU. The study suggests patients may have been infected from community water bodies and small mammals within communities could be susceptible to MU.
Researchers analyzed a large database of bird species to understand what drives the global distribution of alien species. They found that the number of alien species in different areas is influenced by a combination of human and environmental factors, with human activities introducing species to new locations and environments allowing them to persist. However, the global and temporal drivers of alien species introduction and richness are not well understood. The study found that the origins and identities of alien birds were largely driven by European colonialism, mainly British, but recent introductions are more widespread and involve more species and countries, driven by economic activity. Globally, alien species richness is highest at mid-latitudes and determined by human effects, notably the number of introduced species. Environmental factors also play a role, with native and alien species positively associated. The study shows that colonization pressure is key to understanding species richness and areas with high native species are resistant to alien at a global scale, emphasizing threats to environments from introductions.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a protein that helps RNA polymerase I (RPol I) transcribe ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. However, its ability to bind to any DNA and form nucleosome-like complexes suggests a broader role in chromatin structure. Research showed that depleting UBF reduced rRNA genes, but had little effect on synthesis or cell growth, leaving its role in R I transcription unclear. Using a mouse model, researchers found UBF is essential for embryo development beyond morula stage. Conditional deletion in cells revealed UBF is also essential for r gene transcription and defines chromatin conformation of enhancer sequences. Loss of U prevents SL/TIFB initiation and RPI/T1 complex recruitment, accompanied by H3K9, histone H1, and HPα, but not DNA methylation. Genes retain H4 and H2, suggesting rRNA can maintain active state without U. Unexpectedly, rRNA loss does not suppress 5, tRNA or snRNA, or hundreds of genes in ribosome biogenesis. U also induces formation of somatic nucleolar precursor body (NPB) containing r synthesis factors, but not r loci.
Researchers have challenged a long-held understanding of how the Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway, a crucial for cell growth and development in animals, works in the adult intestine. This pathway is often overactive in most colorectal cancers. In the past, it was thought that Wingless must be secreted and move to distant cells to signal properly pattern tissues. However, a recent study found that a membrane-bound form of Wingless produced normal adults, suggesting secretion and movement are not necessary for patterning. This study tested this principle in the adult intestine, where Wingless signals mark boundaries between compartments. Results show that Wingless is essential for regulating gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling with the Decaplegic pathway, all disrupted by Wing tethering. These findings support the need for direct, long-range action of Wingless in patterning, relevant to development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. 

The adult gut forms through different mechanisms than the larva and has unique demands, including continuous turnover and regeneration. The study focused on W pathway gradients in the intestine, demarcating major compartments. The role of morphogens in patterning was unclear until the 1990s, resolved by studies on conserved pathways Wingless and Decaplegic in Drosophila. Defects in W pathway in epithelium indicate W secretion and movement are critical for gut development. This identifies a context where direct action of W in patter is unambiguous, supporting previous studies in larval disc.

The Doph intestine, like mammalian, is maintained by stem cells and subdivided into compartments with different types, expression, histology, physiology, and function.
Researchers studied the role of urokinase plasogen activator (uPA) in Group A streptococcus (GAS) infections, a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. They found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of host plasogen activators, streokinase was required for surface plmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of streokin, uPA was sufficient to promote surface plmin acquisition by strain 544 during incubation with plmin or human plasma. GAS also activated zym pro-uPA in human plasma. To assess u's contribution to invasive disease, a transgenic mouse model was used. C57/6 and AlbG mice expressing human plmin transgene were more susceptible to invasive disease than u− mice. Decreased virulence in u− mice correlated with decreased dissemination and reduced surface plmin by GAS. These findings have implications for understanding GAS pathogenesis and targeting plmin activation in bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of Type IV secretion system components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host interface. Colonization of the stomach by H. pylori is a significant risk factor for gastric cancer development. The H. pylori pathogenic island (cPA) encodes components of a Type IV system (TSS) that translocates the oncoprotein Cag into gastric epithelial cells, and Cag is a component of cTSS that binds host αβ1 integrin. Researchers used mass spectrometry to co-purify Cag, Cag (integrin-binding protein), and Cag (protein with sequence similarity to C). These proteins are encoded by contiguous genes in cPA and detectable on the bacterial surface. All proteins are required for C translocation into host cells and H. pyl-induced IL-8 secretion by epithelial cells. However, proteins are not homologous components of TSS in other species. Scanning microscopy reveals proteins involved in pilus formation between H. pyl and epithelial cells. Δag and ΔcL strains fail to form pilus, whereas ΔH strain exhibits hyperiliated and elongated pilus compared to wild-type. This suggests pilus dimensions regulated by C. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide in C, C, C, and C. Deletion motifs abrogate C translocation and IL-8, and C-terminal motifs C and C required pilus formation.
Researchers studied gene expression in cattle vaccinated against bovine tuberculosis (bTB) to identify predictors of protection. Bovine TB is a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis group. Vaccination is a long-term solution to control the disease, with a focus on developing a cattle vaccine against TB. Identifying biomarkers remains elusive, and the goal is to find host correlates of protection. The team hypothesized that studying gene expression could identify in vitro predictors to help vaccine development. Cattle were vaccinated with BCG or heterologous B prime-adenovirus vectored subunit boosting. Efficacy was determined after M bovis challenge. RNA was prepared from P-stimulated PB from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected and unaccinated control prior Mbo challenge and expression by RNAseq. 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected compared vaccinated-un and unacc control. Cytokine-cytokine interaction was most related with IL-22 identified as dominant of protection besides INFγ. Expression of these genes by RNAseq was evaluated RT-qPCR in independent PB samples BCG vaccinated unacc. This confirmed IL as predictor of vaccine efficacy.
Researchers studied how microtubules are organized in cells, specifically at a structure called the non-centrosomal microtub organizing center (ncTOC). This structure is found in most cells, but how it regulates microtule organization is not well understood. They created a system to test the role of two proteins, γ-tulin ring complex (γ-TRC) and AIR-1/AurA, at the apical ncTO in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal cells. γ-TRC and AIR-1 are required to form microtules at the centrosome, but not at the apical ncTO. However, microtules remain organized at the apical ncTO when γ-T and AIR are depleted. This suggests different microule centers use distinct proteins for their function. The apical ncTO is composed of two populations: γu-dependent and -independent microtules that compete for resources.
Researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes, which is the process of determining the origin of genetic material from each parent. Most human genome initiatives do not do this due to cost and complexity. They used the NA128 genome as a standard. The methods included laboratory-based and computational approaches. Laboratory methods prepared DNA in unique ways to facilitate phasing, while computational methods used sequencing data and population haplotype information. Metrics included error rates, haplotype lengths, and phasing accuracy. A hybrid approach using population phasing, genome sequencing, and haplotype frequencies produced accurate results. Population phasing improved with genome data, and parental genotypes reduced errors by 10-fold. A voting scheme combining multiple predictions enhanced performance. Regions with phasing errors had low polymorphism and SNV density.
Researchers studied how the type-III protein secretion system in Salmonella enterica, a type of bacteria that causes disease in humans. This system is used to secrete proteins that help the bacteria move and infect host cells. They found that the system can work without an enzyme called ATPase, which was thought to be necessary for the process. Instead, the bacteria used energy from a force called proton motive force to secrete the proteins. This force is created by a difference in the concentration of protons across the cell membrane. The researchers also found that this force can bypass the need for another enzyme called Salmonella pathogenic island 1, which is important for the bacteria's virulence. Their results show that ATPase is not necessary for type-III protein secretion and propose its role is to help deliver substrates to the export apparatus and ensure efficient secretion. The study has implications for the evolution of the flagellum and type-III systems in bacteria.
Researchers studied a large family of simple biochemical networks, called gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which control essential biological functions like cell differentiation and cell cycle. They used a computational method called chemical reaction network theory to analyze over 40,000 possible networks formed by two-factor genes and their proteins, assuming basic biochemical processes. The study found that about 90% of these networks can be bistable, meaning they can switch between two or more states, including some without typical features associated with bistable systems. Most could only be identified as bistable through detailed analysis. The researchers identified 11 minimal bistable networks, which cannot be broken down into smaller bistable sub-networks. This suggests that bistable behavior in GRNs is common and not easily lost through evolution. To apply this method to real systems, they used data from yeast and found several GRNs predicted to be bistable. 

The study used a class of small GRNs with two-factor genes and proteins, finding 36,771 bistable networks out of 40,680. The entire family can be understood from 11 minimal bistable networks, which cannot be broken down into smaller bistable sub-networks. Analysis showed 36% of networks are bistable for some parameters, 9% have multiple states, and 6.5% are monostable regardless of parameters. The study focused on basic transcriptional regulation but did not include all mechanisms. One way to achieve nonlinearity is degradation of TF dimers, which protects against proteolysis. The identified networks are not guaranteed bistable but their topologies make them good candidates, providing hypotheses for experimentation. This approach can be used for other systems with available data.
Researchers have identified a new genetic cause of orofacial cleft, a common birth defect, in humans and mice. Mutations in the HY2 gene, which encodes hyaluronidase 2, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, a key component of the developing palate and heart tissue, lead to the condition. Studies in mice showed that these mutations reduce hyalidase levels, resulting in craniofacial abnormalities, including submucal cleft palate. Some mice also had triatum sinister, a rare heart defect, and hearing loss. Similar features were found in humans with HY2 mutations. This is the first explanation for triatum sinister in humans. The study highlights the importance of hyal turnover for normal development in humans and mice.
Researchers have discovered a new details about how the inner hair cells in the ear detect sound. These cells have tiny links called stereocilia that convert sound into electrical signals. The links are made of two proteins, protocadherin 15 (PCD15) and cadherin 23 (CD23). Scientists thought the links were static, but now they found that they change. When sound hits the ear, links break and need to be fixed. Hair cells can fix links and restore hearing, but the process was unknown. Researchers used a special microscope to see the links and proteins. They found two types of links: one with PCD15 at both ends and one with P15 at one end and CD23 at the other. When links break, CD23 goes away and P15 moves to the side of the cell. New links form with P15 at both ends first, then change to P15 at one end and CD23 at the other. This process helps hair cells detect sound normally. The study shows how hair cells fix links and keep hearing.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a prevalent arbovirus that causes an estimated 100 million symptomatic deng infections every year, with a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild deng fever (DF) to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The transition from DF to DHF is not well understood. A mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DH patients at critical and recovery phases of infection identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were up to 5-fold higher in DH compared to DF patients, correlated with higher aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transamin (ALT) levels, indicating liver injury. Uric acid, the most abundant antioxidant in blood, was 1.5-fold lower in DH compared to DF, suggesting decreased endogenous defense and oxidative stress. In the recovery phase, eight metabolites remained higher or lower in DH patients, including chodeoxyglycolic acid, a bile acid. This indicates prolonged liver impact from DENV in DH patients. Altered metabolic pathways linked to DH in critical and recovery phases of deng infection were identified, providing insights into host-DENV interactions between DF and DH. This study advances understanding of DH pathogenesis, suggesting novel targets for deng management.
Researchers have identified a key enzyme called guanine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypaniasis. This enzyme plays a crucial role in converting guanine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) to inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP), maintaining the balance of purine nucleotides inside the parasite. The study found that the GR in T. brucei is distinct from those in animals, with a unique insertion of a cystathion synthase (CBS) domain. The recombinant protein of T. bruce GR catalyzed the conversion of G to IMP in the presence of NAD, with different affinities for G and NAD compared to animal GRs. The addition of monoval cations like K and NH4 increased GR activity of T. bruce, but not animal GRs. The purine analog ribavir inhibited T. br GR, but not animal GR. This suggests the mechanism of GR in T. br is different from animals. The study also showed that ribavir inhibited the growth of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic agent against trypanias.
Researchers used computer simulations to study how two drugs, benzocaine and phenyto, block sodium channels in cells. Sodium channels control electrical activity in cells and are used to treat seizures, arrhythmia, and pain. To develop new drugs that target specific channels, scientists need to know how current blockers work. The study used a crystal structure of a bacterial sodium channel, Nav, to find where benzaine and pheny bind and how they enter the channel. Both drugs bind in two areas with non-specific, hydrophobic interactions: one above the gate and at the entrance to the lipid-filled fenestrations. Three methods found the same sites and suggest binding at the gate is more favorable. The drugs can pass through fenestr with small energy, suggesting a hydroobic route. The study highlights important residues directing drugs into fenestr and forming binding sites.
Researchers investigated the role of MyD88 signaling in the immune response to intestinal infection with the pathogen C. rodium. My88 is a key component of the immune system that helps fight off infections, but its specific role in the intestine was not well understood. To study this, they created mice that could turn on or off My88 in specific cell types. They found that My88 in dendritic cells (DC) and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were crucial for fighting off the infection. In DC, My88 activated an early immune response called group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and Th17/Th cells. In IEC, My88 kept the epithelial barrier strong and made antimicrobial peptides. Without My88 in these cells, mice were more susceptible to infection. My in other cells, like macrophages and T cells, did not help much. The study shows that My88 in DC and IEC are essential for a full response to C. rodium infection.
Researchers are working to eliminate onchocerciasis, a parasitic worm disease, in Africa through annual or biannual mass drug administration (MDA). One tool to determine if transmission is interrupted and treatment can stop is an immunodiagnostic test detecting IgG antibodies in blood to Onchocerca volulus antigen Ov16. A mathematical model, ONOS, was extended to include Ov antibody serostatus of individuals. Seroconversion occurs when the worm establishes in host, before or after maturation or mf production. The study focused on serconversion in children, ignoring seroreversion. Yearly MDA reduces parasite rate in humans, lowering serconversion in newborns and young, while those serconverted remain positive. Microfilaria prevalence in 5+ and Ov antibody in under 10 declined with M duration. The association between indicators and predicted probability of elimination depends on endemic levels, serconversion trigger, and test sensitivity/specificity. Understanding Ov antibody dynamics is crucial for accurate interpretation and precise endpoint MDA. The study shows endpoint depends on endemic levels, to be considered in guidelines for stopping M.
Researchers have found that prions, a type of infectious protein, can change their properties when grown in different environments. When prions that were sensitive to a drug called swainine were grown in a cell line called PK1 in the presence of swine, drug-resistant variants emerged. This suggests that prions are made up of a mix of different variants, and the fittest ones are selected in a particular environment. Even after cloning, prion populations showed heterogeneity, indicating mutations occur at the conformation level. Brain-derived prions are naturally resistant to swine, so it was not surprising that pr that became sensitive after growth in cells could revert to resistance. However, pr grown in brain or PK cells are swine sensitive, researchers investigated if it was possible to select swine-resistant by growth in presence of drug. Interestingly, this was not possible with standard PK cells, but certain sublines of PK allowed swine-resistant, even swine-dependent (propagated more in presence of drug) to be isolated. Once established, they could be passed in PK cells without losing swine dependence. Misfolded pr protein (Pr) associated with swine variant was cleared faster in PK cells than its sensitive counterpart, indicating structural differences of misfold Pr underlie pr properties. Propagation of pr in inhibitory drug may cause selection of resistant pr and variants that propagate efficiently in presence drug. Adaptations likely due conformation changes abnormal pr protein.
Researchers have mapped out the vast space of all possible metabolic systems that extract energy from carbon sources, a fundamental to life. They analyzed 101 of these systems, each with all possible combinations of 51 reactions, to see how they work on 10 different carbon sources. This led to 102 possible outcomes, or "phenotypes". Most systems with one outcome make up a tiny fraction of the space, but there are over 100 million with the same outcome. These systems often form a network, where any can be reached from each other with a few changes. The distance between systems with different outcomes is small, allowing for new systems to adapt to new sources with few changes. However, some systems with many reactions struggle to survive. Increasing complexity helps systems adapt and innovate. 

The researchers looked at neighborhoods of systems on the same source to see if they have new outcomes. If so, which outcomes depend on where in space a system is located. They compared 100 pairs of systems, each with one reaction different, on a source. A system's outcome is a string of 10, with 1 for viable or 0 for not on a source. A change is innovative if leads to new outcomes on sources. To study this, they looked at a small space of 101 systems. Metabolism is attractive because it extracts energy from carbon and limited to 10 sources and 102 outcomes. Most systems are different, but many in one network. They asked how this applies to systems on multiple sources. This is harder, with 10 sources and 102 outcomes. They sampled 100 systems from each network on sources. Each outcome is a vector of 10, with 1 for viable or 0 on source. They asked if multiple new outcomes near a system exist.
Researchers studied the genetic variation and geographic distribution of the Triatoma dimata complex, a parasite that transmits Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas disease, across Mexico and the Neotropics. They analyzed two fragments of the ND4 gene to identify specific haplogroups and found that genetic diversity was lowest in areas with most human modification, where T cruz infection was highest. Haplog 1 and 3 had more T cruz than expected, while hap 2 had less. There was a difference in DT and DTI frequencies in hap 1 and 3, but not in 2. All Neotropical hapgroups had moderate to high diversity, with greatest between 1 and 3. The complex diverged from its most recent common ancestor 0.97-0.85 million years ago, with primary divergence of 2 and 3. Effective population size of 1 and 2 increased 0.02-0.03 million years ago. This study supports the origin of the complex around the Tehante Isthmus and recent divergence of three haplogroups with differential T cruz infection and DT specificity, important for vector capacity.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFR) is a rod-borne disease caused by hantaviruses, mainly Hanta virus and Seoul virus. Environmental factors affect the risk of contracting hant infections by influencing rodent dynamics and human-rod contact. This study aimed to identify environmental factors favoring rod-to-human transmission to inform prevention and control strategies. Data from 2006-2015 on rodent hosts, havirus, epidemiology, and environment were analyzed. 709 HFR cases were included. Rod species in Chhou, a hotspot, were Rattus norvegicus, Musculus, Rflavius, and others. Species played different roles in various land types, all associated with transmission. Some were linked to FR in forest and water, while R norveicus and Ravius to grassland, and Mus and Ravi to built land. Rod community was associated with environmental variability. Predictive models showed cultivated land highest risk for FR incidence, matching 2014-201 statistics. Heterogeneity of FR may be influenced by rod community, associated with local conditions. Future work should focus on preventing FR in moist environments.
Researchers have found that mutations in the HRAS gene, which can cause Costello syndrome (CS), a rare genetic disorder, can also be found in cancer. They discovered a new mutation, c.35_36>T, in a 12-year-old boy with mild CS. Analysis showed high levels of exon 2 skipping in HRAS DNA. Using wild and mutant HR genes, they confirmed that c.35_36>T causes skipping by disrupting a splicing enhancer and creating a splicing silencer. They found that HR exon 2 is vulnerable due to a weak 3' splice site, making it dependent on splicing proteins like SRS2. Most cancer and CS-causing mutations are located here, affecting splicing differently. Results show that CS and cancer phenotype is not only determined by mutant HRAS transforming potential, but also by exon 2 inclusion efficiency from different mutations. A splicing oligonucleotide (SO) that blocks the enhancer causes skipping and halts cancer cell proliferation, revealing a potential for new cancer therapy.
Researchers have found that a specific enzyme called METTL3 plays a crucial role in the development of the cerebellum, a part of the brain responsible for motor control and coordination. METTL adds a chemical modification called m6 to RNA, which helps regulate gene expression and protein production. In mice without METTL, the cerebellum does not develop properly, leading to a condition called cerebellar hypoplasia. This is caused by the death of granule cells in the cerebellum, which are essential for its function. The study found that METTL's m6 modification affects the stability and splicing of RNA, leading to changes in gene expression and cell death. The researchers conclude that METTL is essential for cerebell development and m6 modification is key to its proper function.
Researchers have studied how transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG work together to regulate gene expression in embryonic stem (ES) cells. These cells can become any cell type in the developing embryo. They found that when these factors bind together, they are with a co-activator called H3ac and increase nearby gene expression. Many of these binding sites are active in early development. Comparing human and mouse ES cells, they found that only 5% of individual binding events are shared, but 15% of combinatorial binding and 53-63% of combinator binding at enhancers are conserved. This suggests that the combination of OCT, SO2, and NANOG is critical for ES cells and plays a role in early development by binding conserved enhancers. They also found that rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding, while "hotspots" bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues are under evolutionary constraints. In ES cells, combinatorial binding of OCT, SO2, and NAN identifies enhancers with H3ac and Med localization. Many combinatorially bound enhancers are active in early development. This implies conserved combinatorial events in ES control key genes involved in differentiation and connects pluripotency and development through OCT, SO2, and NANOG binding at enhancers.
AML/ETO, a protein resulting from a chromosomal translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 21, initiates acute myel leukemia by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA. It interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, A1, by targeting A1 binding sites. However, transcriptional regulation by A/ETO likely relies on a complex network, as the protein interacts with other transcription factors, including E-proteins, and targets other sites on DNA. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling identified AETO-dependent transcriptional regulation. AETO was found to co-localize with A, demonstrating the fusion follows the binding pattern of the wild protein but does not primarily displace it. The binding of E-protein H was rearranged upon AETO expression, and the protein co-localized with A and H on many regulated targets. Furthermore, the level of H was increased in primary and cell lines expressing AETO. Our results suggest a major role for the interaction of AETO with A and H in transcription regulation by the protein.
Researchers investigated the role of the Leishmania donani histone acetyltransferase H2 (H2) in regulating gene expression. They found that H2 acetylates histone H4 in vitro and in vivo, and is essential for cell growth and survival. Without H2, cells had defects in cell cycle progression and poor survival. The team discovered that downregulation of cyclins CY4 and CY9, responsible for S and G2/M phase defects in H2-depleted cells. Leish genes are arranged in unidirectional clusters, with genes coordinately transcribed as polyc units from divergent strand regions (SS), which initiate bidirectionally on opposite strands. CY4 and CY9 have their own promoters, activated in a cell-dependent manner. Two tiers of regulation exist: transcription of polyc units initiates at SS, likely constitutively, while a subset have their own promoters, some activated cell-dependently. The second tier is sensitive to H10 acylation, resulting in downregulation in H-de cells. This study reveals cell-specific activation of promoters in trypanoids, uncovering new facets of regulation in this family.
Researchers investigated how people infer the intentions of others in social interactions. They created a game where 16 pairs of volunteers played a probabilistic task, with one as "player" and one "adviser". The adviser had more information and gave a recommendation. The game made the adviser's incentives to help or mislead change over time. Using a Bayesian model, they found that players' behavior was best explained by hierarchical learning: they estimated the adviser's intentions to predict advice accuracy. Volatility also affected decisions: players trusted advice more when they thought adviser's intentions were stable. The model predicted players' ratings of adviser helpfulness and adviser's self-reported strategy. Results suggest people use hierarchical models to infer intentions, use volatility in decision-making, and combine advice with other info. The framework can measure individual differences and may help study maladaptive social cognition.

In the game, players with changing adviser intentions showed stronger hierarchical learning and used volatility to update advice. Participants with helpful advisers saw intentions as stable and weighted advice more. A model with hierarchical learning and volatility explained behavior best. Players' updating reflected adviser's policy and used advice in decisions. Those with helpful advisers saw intentions as stable and weighted advice more, shown by lower volatility and higher values.
Scrub typhus, a disease endemic in Asia, has been found in urban areas, including Seoul, South Korea's largest city. From 2010 to 2013, national data showed indigenous scrub typh cases in Seoul. Researchers analyzed clinical features of patients from a hospital and compared them to a control group. Chigger mites were collected in the city and identified using DNA sequencing. Eighty-eight cases of scrub typh were found in Seoul, mostly in mountain areas (56.8%), parks (20.5%), near homes (17%), and rivers (5.7%). Eighty-seven chigger mites were collected in Gak mountain, with 87.4% identified as Helenula miag and 9.2 as Leotridium. DNA from miag mites yielded O tsugushi Bong strain. Twenty-six patients had low APACHE score, low complication rate, and no hypalemia. The study found indigenous scrub in Seoul and a subgroup with mild features. Ch mites miag infected O tsugushi within the city in endemic area. Scrub ty needs to be considered a differential disease and target for prevention.

Patients visited hospital due to fever, 96.2 had maculopular skin rash. Studies have shown urban scrub in literature. This study investigated status and characteristics in Seoul at northern latitude. Prospectively determined causative mites within the city. Presence of O tsugushi in ch mites confirmed. Composition of miag m and infection Otsug are findings. Study shows scrub can spread into area under high incidence, though slow increase and magnitude. Mites infest mammals, birds, domestic cats, and dogs. Proportion of miag in high area with Otsug, dominant Bong, suggests may play role in infection. However, needs further data to determine role.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called HENN-1 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is involved in the regulation of gene activity through a process called RNA interference (RNAi). They found that HENN-1 affects two types of RNA molecules, 26 and 21, which are involved in RNAi pathways. Surprisingly, the stability of 21 RNAs was only mildly affected by loss of H-1, while introduction of artificial 21 target RNA did not destabilize non-methylated 21 RN. In contrast, 26 RN displayed reduced stability and responded to loss of H- by increased 3-uridylation. Within the 26 class, they found that ER-1-bound 26 RN were modified by H- while AL-3/4-bound 26 were not. Global expression analysis of- mutants revealed mild effects, including downregulation of gerine-expressed genes. The study suggests that apart from direct effects on 26 RNA levels, most effects on gene expression are indirect.
Researchers have identified a new role for the protein Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 (HNF1) in regulating the process of protein glycosylation, which is the addition of sugar molecules to proteins. Glycosylation affects protein function and is involved in many physiological and pathological processes. A study of 2,705 individuals in three populations found common variants in the HNF and fucyltransferase genes F6 and F8 influence glycan levels in plasma. HNF and its target H4 regulate expression of fucyltransfer and fucose biosynthesis genes. HNF is necessary and sufficient to drive expression of these genes in liver cells. This reveals H as a master regulator of multiple stages in glycosylation process. Implications for regulation of immunity, embryonic development, protein folding, and understanding mechanisms of cancer, heart disease, metabolic, and inflammatory disorders.
Researchers have found that a protein called Centromere Protein C (CPC) is stabilized by single-stranded RNA at the centromeres, which are the points where the genome attaches to the cytoskeleton. Centromeres bind to kinetochores, which in turn bind spindles and move chromosomes. However, the DNA sequence of centrom has little role in recruiting kinetocho. This is an example of genetic information being transmitted in a way that is independent of DNA sequence, or epigenetically. The researchers found that RNA from centrom remains within the kinetore region and is part of the epigen marking system. They studied maize CPC, a key kinore protein, and found that DNA binding is conferred by a region of 122 amino acids and is sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long single-stranded nucleic acids promote binding of CPC to DNA, and types of RNAs that stabilize binding match size and character of RN present in kineto in vivo. Removing the binding module causes partial localization of CPC in vivo. The data suggest centrom RNA recruits CPC to kinore by altering DNA characteristics.

 Maize centrom repeats are undermethylated and transcribed to stable RNAs that remain bound to chromatin. Centrom RNAs are 40-200 in length, transcribed from both strands and maintained single stranded. RNA may serve as structural template to recruit kinore. Researchers used in vitro and vivo studies to show maize CPC has DNA and RNA capacities, DNA/RNA domain localized to exon region and required for centere localization. RNA facilitates binding of CPC to DNA in vitro, providing mechanism for RNA involvement in centere specification. Single-stranded RNA has strong effect on binding, suggesting centrom RNA as epetic mark that mediates final assembly. CPC is recruited kinore by protein contacts then converted to DNA binding by centrom RNA.
Researchers have identified genetic variants associated with birth weight, childhood obesity, and body mass index in children. They examined the role of the placenta, a critical organ for fetal development and postnatal health, in mediating these genetic causes. The study found that genetic variants in the placenta significantly contribute to birth weight and body mass in children. In fact, the placenta is more important for determining weight at birth and body mass in children than other tissues such as fat and liver. The researchers discovered hundreds of genes controlled by genetic variants that influence these traits. The study reveals that placental transcription in the womb plays a key role in determining body size after birth. This may lead to new possibilities for preventing childhood obesity.

The study found extensive enrichment of genetic variants in the placenta associated with birth weight, childhood, and body mass. The placenta is relevant for determining weight at birth and body in children. Identifying genes mediating genetic predisposition for these traits is crucial for understanding mechanisms and developing prevention strategies. Integrative genomics can analyze genetic results. The study shows influence of genetically controlled expression linked to birth and body mass supports this. One key finding is that placental variants are more associated with body mass hits than variants from other tissues, including fat and liver.

The study compared placental genes with genes in adult tissues, including blood, artery, fat, and muscle. Over 3,000 genes were found to be controlled by genetics, showing the placenta is transcriptionally active. This activity is largely controlled by fetal genetics. A large analysis of birth, childhood, and body mass genome association studies identified multiple loci suggesting a strong determinant for these conditions.
A study was conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India to determine the burden of post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) in an endemic area and compare diagnostic methods for detecting the disease. PKDL is a chronic condition that follows successful treatment of visceral leishiasis (VL) and is not life-threatening, but often goes untreated due to its cosmetic nature. The study found a prevalence of 27.5% PKDL among antileman antibody positive cases, with 26 cases detected through active surveillance and confirmed by PCR diagnosis. Three diagnostic methods were used: PCR, slit smear, and r-39 strip. PCR was most sensitive at 88.46% for confirmation. Most lesions persisted after treatment but disappeared within 6-12 months, with two cases reappearing after 1.5 years of miltefine treatment. A significant number of PK patients remained undiagnosed without active surveys, highlighting the need for such in other areas to eliminate kalaazar. PCR is helpful for diagnosis, but a well-designed study with more samples is needed to determine if PK patients are parasite-free after treatment and which need longer treatment. PK occurs in 10-20% of VL cases in India, 50-60% in Sudan, and 2% of PK cases with no history of kalaazar. Unlike VL, PK is not life-threatening and patients don't seek care, maintaining parasites in population.
Researchers have discovered that the process of "competence" in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a type of bacteria, relies on a cell-to-cell contact mechanism. Competence is a genetic program that enables the bacteria to take up new genetic material from their environment, a process called horizontal gene transfer. In the past, it was known that a signaling molecule called Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP) triggers this process, creating a positive feedback loop. However, how this process is coordinated across the entire population was unclear. Scientists monitored competence development in real-time in four distinct pneumocococcal lineages and found that it relies on a self-activated cell fraction that arises through a growth-dependent mechanism. They found that the CSP remains bound to cells during this event and the rate of competence corresponds to contact between activated and quiescent cells. A two-step cell sensing mechanism was validated by measuring competence during co-cultivation of strains altered to produce or respond to CSP. The protein ComD retains CSP, limiting its diffusion in the medium. It is proposed that competence cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a subpopulation that transmits CSP by cell contact.
Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV) L2 protein acts as a chaper to transport the viral genome (vDNA) from endosomes to the trans-Gol network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus, where replication occurs. To reach the nucleus, the L2/v complex must cross intracellular membranes. Researchers developed a system using subcellular compartmentalization of enzyme BirA and its substrate to detect translocation of L2 from incoming virions. They found that L translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell arrest causes retention of L/v at TGN; release and progression past G2 enables trans across limiting membrane and infection. Microscopy of Ed-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid shift in vDNA localization during mitosis. At G2/early phase v egress from T to pericentricular location, accumulating prometaph where it begins to associate with condensed chromosomes. By metaphase and anaphase v is bound to mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into daughter nuclei. Mutations in defined chromatin binding of L blocked translocation, suggesting dependent on chromatin during prometaph. This is the first virus to functionally couple penetration of membranes to mitosis, explaining part of HPV tropism for mitotic keratinocytes.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to measure the transmissibility of one strain of a pathogen compared to another, using data from experiments where animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains. They observed the mixture in each animal over time and multiple generations of transmission, using influenza in ferrets as an example. This is important in three contexts: when new strains of influenza arise and compete for hosts, during a pandemic where a new strain competes with existing ones, and with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) that reduce transmission but promote resistant strains. The framework also estimates the size of the transmitted inoculum, or initial amount of pathogen.

The transibility of strains is crucial in determining the course of an outbreak and impact of interventions like NIs. The method is applicable to other viral and bacterial pathogens, as long as within-host dynamics and competitive effects are considered. Estimating the within-host reproduction number is a key in influenza research, and this method improves experimental design. It also estimates the number of infecting units transferred from donor to recipient, important for models of transmission and emergence of resistant strains. The method is applicable to other pathogens, requiring consideration of within-host dynamics and competitive effects.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called BBX21 plays a key role in how plants respond to light and a hormone called abscisic acid (ABA) during seed germination and early seedling development. ABA is a hormone that helps plants adapt to various environmental stresses and is involved in many stages of a plant's life cycle. Light is another important cue that regulates growth and development in plants. The study found that BB21 interacts with two other proteins, HY5 and ABI5, which are involved in ABA signaling. BB21 acts upstream of HY and ABI5 in controlling seed germination. HY activates ABI expression, and BB21 interferes with HY binding to ABI promoter. ABI also activates its own expression, but BB21 negatively regulates this by interacting with ABI. The study shows that BB21 coordinates with HY and ABI on ABI promoter and these regulators work together to integrate light and ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana. This integration is important for plant survival.
Researchers have studied the Mediator complex in Candida albicans, a pathogenic fungus, to understand its role in gene expression. The Mediator is a co-regulator of RNA polymerase II conserved in eukaryotes. The study focused on Med subunits Med31, Med20, and S9/M13. C. albicans Med shares some functions with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizoscharomyces pombe, such as response to stresses and role of Med31 in genes regulated by activator Ace2. However, C. albicans Med has additional roles in virulence genes, such as morphogenesis and adhesins. Med31,20, and S9/M13 contribute to virulence of C. alb, filamentation, biofilm formation, and ALS is biologically relevant for biofilm development. Med affects virulence of C. alb in worm model. Med31 and S9/M13 regulate cell adhes genes differently in S. cerevisiae and C. alb, repressing FLO in S cerevis and activating ALS in C. alb. This suggests Med subunits regulate adhesion differently in two distantly related species.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa develops resistance to antibiotics when it forms a biofilm, a complex community of bacteria attached to a surface. Biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics than individual bacteria floating in liquid. To understand why, they created a large collection of mutant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and tested each one in two conditions: as a biofilm and floating in liquid, with and with or without the antibiotic tobramycin. This allowed them to see which genes contribute to resistance in each state. They found many genes that help biofilms resist tobrycin, but not floating bacteria, and vice versa. Some genes are important for resistance in both states, but most are more important in biofilms. This study helps explain why biofilms are hard to treat and could lead to new treatments.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Flexible Algorithm for Model Selection (FoS) to analyze complex biological systems with many interacting components and unknown dynamics. Finding the right model to describe these systems and identify key processes is challenging due to the vast number of possibilities. Traditional algorithms compare a few models or search the entire space, which can be impractical for large systems. The new algorithm uses local and non-local search methods to avoid getting stuck in local minima and account for similar processes. It was tested on simulated data and shown to handle various structures. The algorithm was also used to study CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation under different conditions, revealing changes in proliferation in 3D cultures compared to suspension. The algorithm's flexibility makes it applicable to many biological problems and useful for evaluating complex model spaces.

The algorithm was designed to handle large model spaces and diverse structures, addressing a need for improved search and selection methods. It allows unbiased inference of parameters and processes by comparing different structures when prior knowledge is lacking. Other algorithms, like Mangan et al's, work well in recovering dynamics but rely on dense sampling and neglect compensating effects. Existing algorithms for dynamical systems rely on exhaustive searches or predefined structures. Fos was motivated for complex systems, but can be applied to various problems, unlike others designed for specific structures.
Researchers in Bolivia conducted a 12-month study to evaluate the effectiveness of benznidazole (BN) treatment in children infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The study involved 103 seropositive children who received BN, with 3 dropping out due to side effects. Blood samples were taken before, during, and after treatment, and analyzed for serology, conventional PCR, and real-time PCR, and Th1/2/17 cytokines, including IL-17. 57 children completed the study, with 6 (11%) showing both PCR+ and qPCR+, 24 (42%) PCR- but q+, and 27 (47%) PCR- and q-. IL-17 levels were higher in seropitive children before treatment and decreased to normal levels after. IL-17 levels were positively related to parasite counts by qPCR. At 12 months, IL-17 levels in non-reactive subjects were higher than reactive or ambiguous, suggesting IL-17 as a potential biomarker for treatment response. Plasma IL-17 might detect persistent infection and inflammation.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary cause of bacterial meningitis, has a genome rich in repetitive DNA, nearly 2% of which is occupied by a small transposon called Coria. Researchers have identified eight subtypes of the element with four distinct transcriptional ends. Two of these ends encode strong promoters, with the strongest driven by a polymorphism Y128 at the right end. The elements can drive transcription of adjacent genes and may express non-coding RNAs. Comparing three meningococ genomes, more than two-thirds of Coria elements maintain the same subtype at a particular locus due to recombination switching between elements in a strain. Upon switching, a new subtype can spread through the population by natural transformation. This may be a new mechanism for variation in meningococcus. The strain-to-strain variability of Coria and number of strong promoters allows for widespread effects in the population. Defining the strength of promoters by subtypes Cor ends provides a resource to predict transcription effects of a subtype at a locus.
Researchers have identified two proteins, Chae and Vel, in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostus that regulate the production of a toxin called Txin. This toxin promotes virulence, or the ability of the pathogen to cause disease, in maize plants with a specific genetic trait called Texas sterile cytoplasm. The toxin production of Txin is increased in the dark and decreased in the absence of Chae and Vel. Expression of genes involved in Txin production is also increased in the dark and decreased in the absence of Chae and Vel. Overexpression of Vel increases Txin production in the dark, while overexpression of Chae increases it in the light. Chae and Vel mutants have altered virulence on maize with Texas sterile cytoplasm and normal cytoplasm. Deletion of Chae or Vel reduces tolerance to oxidative stress. Chae and Vel mutants have reduced expression of a gene CAT, one of three catalase genes, and decreased hyphal growth, asexual sporulation, and sterility. Chae overexpression is sterile while Vel overexpression is fertile. Ch and Vel repress melanin biosynthesis genes, leading to enhanced melanization in mutants and reduced in overexpression strains.
Researchers have studied the mechanism of ion selectivity in bacterial Nav channels, which are proteins that allow certain ions to pass through the cell membrane while blocking others. They used computer simulations to model how ions move through the channel and found that potassium ions can block the channel when forces are applied in one direction, but not the other. This block is due to an unstable state in the energy landscape of the ions, which can be locked in place by forces. In contrast, sodium ions move through the channel together as a unit in a "knock-on" mechanism in both directions. The simulations predicted energy needed to break the potassium block matches experimentally measured values for bacterial channels to allow potassium ions to pass. This study shows that including non-equilibrium factors in simulations can reveal mechanisms of selectivity not seen in crystal structures or equilibrium energy landscapes. The results differ from previous findings and match electrophysiological measurements of bacterial channels.
Researchers studied the spread of the rabies virus in the brains of dogs with furious and paralytic rabies, two forms of the disease. They found that the virus spread faster in the furious form, as measured by the amount of virus in brain cells and RNA. The study looked at the amount of virus in different parts of the brain and spinal cord in 5 dogs with furious and 5 with paralytic rabies. Results showed more virus in furious dogs at all levels, even when comparing similar amounts and percentages of infected cells. This suggests the virus spreads slower in paraly form, possibly due to differences in how it moves inside cells. This could be related to inflammation, as previous studies found more inflammation in paraly form. 

The study used images to show the spread of virus and compared to previous findings on virus in brain cells. Results match previous findings on virus in brain cells and RNA. Virus spread from back to front of brain to back in both forms, with most in spinal cord and brainstem. Amount of virus in cells decreased from front to back in both forms, with most in brainstem and spinal cord in furious dogs. The study suggests virus moves slower in paraly form, possibly due to differences in how it moves inside cells. This could be related to inflammation, as previous studies found more inflammation in par form.
Researchers studied the protein CTC in fruit flies to understand its role in gene regulation. CTC is a zinc-finger protein that blocks enhancers from interacting with promoters. In flies, only one CTC binding site was known, the Fab-8 in the Bithax complex (BX). The team used chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray to find CTC sites in the BX and other regions. They found CTC binds to the Fab8, Fab6, and Mc insulators, and three new sites, Fab-2, Fab-3, and Fab-4. CTC is associated with all known or predicted insulators in BX, suggesting a common mechanism. They compared CTC sites with Polycomb sites and histone modifications to support BX regulation model.

The team used Ch-array to investigate C sites in BX and other regions. C binds to Fab8 and other boundaries. A study showed Fab8 contains CTC sites and mutation reduces its insulating activity. The team used Ch-array to find C sites in BX and other regions. C binds to Fab8, Fab, and Mc, and new sites Fab-2, Fab-3, Fab-4. C is associated with all or predicted insulators in BX, suggesting common mechanism.

CTC can form clusters and mediate chromatin domains. Partitioning elements into domains is key to enhancer-promoter interaction. A C homolog was found in flies and required for Fab8 function in BX. C binds a core sequence in flies and vertebrates. Ch-array enabled a C consensus. Mapping sites propose all or ins in BX function C dependent.
Researchers have long understood that enzymes recognize their substrates by changing shape to fit them better. This process, called induced fit, is crucial for efficient catalysis, but has been hard to study due to its dynamic nature. A team of scientists used a slow-binding inhibitor, actin, to peptide deformylase, a metal-dependent enzyme. They solved crystal structures of the initial and final states, as well as intermediate snapshots during the process. Actin reshapes a hydrophobic pocket, closing the site, which is then locked by additional interactions. Biochemical and computational analyses reveal the sequence of events from encounter to key binding. A "movie" reconstructs this process, extrapolating to catalysis.

The study integrates crystallography, biophysics, and kinetics, providing a complete picture of slow-binding mechanism. While focused on inhibition, the phenomenon applies to broader receptor-lig interactions. Slow-binding inhibitors are favored for therapeutics, with unique properties like potency and long-lasting effects. Actin, a slow-binding peptide deformase inhibitor, was studied. Crystallography and reconstructions of enzyme motions and catalytic events have been documented, but often with unnatural inhibitors, not mimicking actin. Actin's slow binding kinetics, 10 seconds, is puzzling compared to 10 milliseconds for catalysis. Conformation during hydrogen bond formation may explain this, aligning substrate and stabilizing the complex.

Structural and kinetic clues have hinted at induced fit, but direct evidence is critical. Enzyme-inhib interaction is more amenable than enzyme-substrate as no chemical transformation occurs.
Researchers have studied how sensory information is transferred from the thalamus to the cortex, the primary gateway that relays sensory information to the brain. They found that a single cortical cell receives input from many thal cells, but each thal cell also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback's influence is often ignored during sensory processing. The study used dynamic-clamp techniques in thal slices and simulated a hybrid retinothalocort pathway with biological cells and circuits. They mimicked cortical input with a mix of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, creating a variable level of activity in thal cells. The study showed that retocort signal efficiency depends on three factors: the number of thocort cells, cortthal synaptic statistics, and correlation between thal cells. Surprisingly, efficiency increased when thal cells were desynchronized by cortical feedback. This mechanism could direct attention to specific thal subassemblies and select input to cortex based on cortical influence.
Researchers have found that a protein called NMAD-1 plays a crucial role in regulating DNA replication and repair during meiosis in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Meiosis is the process by which the worm's reproductive cells divide to produce gametes. NM-1 mutants have reduced fertility and defects in meiosis, leading to reduced embryo production and increased incidence of males due to chromosomal errors. The researchers found that NM-1 binds to proteins that regulate DNA repair and replication, including topoisomerase TOP-2, and localizes with TOP-2 on chromatin. They also found that TOP-2 binding to chromatin depends on NM-1. This suggests NM-1 functions at DNA sites to regulate replication and repair during meiosis. The study aimed to understand NM-1's role in meiosis and how it affects the worm's reproduction. They found that NM-1 mutants have impaired meiosis, increased males, and RAD-51 foci, and reduced replication rates. This suggests NM-1's demethylation activity is central to its role in meiosis. NM-1 has been proposed as a 6 DNA demethylase in other organisms, but its substrate in C elegans is unknown. The study aimed to investigate NM-1's role by characterizing mutants. NM- deletion and catalytic mutants have impaired fertility, increased males, and RAD-51 foci, and reduced rates. These findings suggest NM-1's demylation at DNA is key to its role in meiosis.
Researchers have identified a new protein called adipocyte membrane-associated protein (AAP) that plays a key role in the early stages of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. CMV is a common virus that can cause serious diseases in newborns and people with weakened immune systems. The virus has a large genome and complex proteins that allow it to infect many types of human cells, but how it infects cells is not fully understood. The study found that AAP is necessary for CMV infection in two types of cells: epithelial and fibroblasts. Without AAP, CMV infection was reduced in these cells. Surprisingly, adding AAP to cells that are not usually resistant to CMV, such as canine and murine cells, made them susceptible to CMV infection. The study also found that AAP helps CMV enter cells by interacting with a specific proteins on the virus at low pH and moving a protein called pp65 to the cell's nucleus. These results suggest AAP is a new factor that helps CMV infect cells and is important in the virus's infection process.
Researchers have developed a new model that combines intrinsic and extrinsic factors to understand how hematopoietic progenitor cells commit to a specific lineages. This model shows that cytokine-mediated receptor feedback can induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced decommitment. The model supports both instruct and stochastic theories of commitment: cell fates are driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can strongly bias lineage by regulating inherently noisy cell decisions with complex behaviors such as ligand ultrasensitivity and multistability. The kinetics of differentiation to a mature state depend on the progenitor as well as the route of commitment chosen. The model agrees with lineage-specific receptor kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a framework to integrate classical and alternative paths in hematopoies observed experimentally.
Researchers have used electron microscopy to study the structure of the Bunyamwera virus, a member of the Orthunavirus genus, which poses a threat to human and animal health. The virus particles are irregularly shaped, but have a repeating pattern of glycoprotein spikes on their surface. Each spike is 18 nanometers long and changes shape when exposed to acidic environments. Using a technique called subtomogram averaging, the researchers created a 3D model of the trimeric glycoprotein spike with a resolution of 3 nanometers. The glycoprotein consists of a fusion protein class II and has a unique tripod-like structure. The spikes interact with each other at the base and tips. This arrangement is different from other known fusion proteins. The study shows that the virus changes shape when entering host cells and provides a blueprint for the structure of this group of emerging pathogens. 

The virus's glycoproteins are similar to those of related viruses that cause disease, such as SBV and ORO. The researchers used electron microscopy to study the prototypic virus, Bunamwera, to address the lack of knowledge about Orthunavirus structure. The virus changes shape when exposed to acid, rearranging the head of the trimer spike, which is the fusion glyprotein. The results provide the first 3D analysis of an Orthunavirus and a model for this group of medically important viruses, showing a unique fusion protein arrangement.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genes associated with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), a leading cause of blindness in Asia. They analyzed data from 5,308 individuals of Asian descent and found a significant link between a variant in the ABCC5 gene (rs199) and increased risk of PG. The variant was associated with a 13% higher risk of PG in a separate study of 4,276 cases and 18,801 controls. The association was stronger when controls with open angles were included. The study suggests that genetic variants influencing anterior chamber depth may contribute to PG risk. Anterior chamber depth is a known anatomical risk factor for PG, with shallower depth increasing the risk. The study provides clues to the genetic mechanisms behind this major cause of blindness. Further research is needed to identify functional polymorphisms related to PG pathogenesis. The study also found that AB5 is expressed in structures relevant to PG, such as the iris, ciliary body, and lens.
Researchers have identified the first examples of developmental enhancers, called bilaterally conserved regulatory elements (BREs), that are shared between deuterostomes and protomes, two groups of animals that were previously thought to have distinct developmental toolkits. These enhancers, called Bres, show sequence and gene conservation and are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways. They drive the expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. The discovery of Bres suggests extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between the protome and deuterome clades, but more may be revealed as understanding of cis-reg logic and bilian genomes grows. Bres are developmental enhancers that encode complex patterns of transcription factor binding sites, such as Bore, an enhancer of Id, which is predicted to function as a BMP responsive element and drives expression in the developing nervous system. The small number of identified Bres implies extensive cis-regulatory rewiring, making it hard to know the true number of Bres. As more genomes are sequenced and our understanding of cis logic improves, screening is refined, more bilater conserved elements will be discovered. Bres offer a new avenue for exploring how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how it evolves.
Researchers studied the impact of vaccination on the diversity of the H3N2 influenza virus within individuals. They used next-generation sequencing to analyze viruses from a vaccine trial and found no significant difference in diversity between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. The majority of single nucleotide variants were rare and few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 nucleotide variants across the genome and diversity did not vary with vaccination status or antibody levels. Contrary to expectations, vaccination had little impact on intrah diversity in natural infection and vaccine immunity may be a minor contributor to antigen drift at local scales. The study did not find differences in genome or antigen diversity between vaccinated and unvacc populations in three H3N seasons.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of a genetically modified, weakened Leishmania donov parasite (LC-/-) as a vaccine against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in mice of different ages. VL is a severe disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donov, with no effective vaccine available for any age group. Previous studies showed LC- induced a strong immune response in young mice. This study compared LC- mediated immune response in 18-month-old (aged) and 2-month (young) mice. Analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from infected with LC- showed enhanced effector responses, augmenting CD4+ T cell function compared to wild-type (WT) infected cells. Similarly, splenic dendritic cells from LC- infected young and aged mice induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6, IF-γ, TN) and down-regulated anti-inflammatory (IL-10) genes. Immunization with LC- induced IgG2 antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, pro-inflammatory responses, and heightened leishicidal activity in young and aged mice. Upon virulent Leish challenge, LC- immunized mice displayed multifunctional Th-type CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 cells, reducing parasite burden in spleen and liver. Notably, LC- induced response in dendritic cells was similar in aged and young, but adaptive response in T and B cells was reduced in aged, correlating with less protection. LC- immunization induced significant but diminished response in aged mice compared to young.
Researchers created chimeric viruses by combining the capsid proteins of two different enteroviruses, EV-D68 and EV94, to understand why they have different properties and cause different diseases. EV68 is a respiratory virus that replicates in the respiratory tract and causes mild disease, while EV94 is an enteric virus that replicates in the gut and causes various pathologies. They found that the capsid proteins of EV68 make the virus sensitive to acid and determine its ability to grow in respiratory and intestinal cells, but not in neural cells. They also found that the caps proteins help the virus adapt to optimal temperature, with EV94 needing a mutation in VP1 and EV68 not adapting to higher temperatures. The researchers showed that EV68 retains its ability to bind to cells after acid treatment, but loses infectivity. In contrast, non-structural proteins modulate the immune response in tissues. This study reveals a new aspect of the diversity of enteroviruses, one of the most prevalent viruses worldwide, and could aid in developing vaccines and antiviral treatments.
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gEI is a transmembrane receptor found on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds human immunoglobulin G (Ig). It can also participate in antibody bridging (ABB), a process where antigen fragments of Ig bind viral antigen while the Fc binds to gI. Researchers investigated the fate of viral antigens associated with gI-bound Ig using an in vitro system. They found that cells expressing gI and viral antigen HSV-1 endocyted antiIg and Ig in a gI-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This suggests gI can mediate clearance of infected cells of viral antigens to evade Ig-mediated responses, a mechanism for viral evasion and pathogenesis.
Researchers have studied the transcriptome of the protoscoleces (PSC) of Echinococcus granulosus, a parasite that causes cistic hydatid disease in humans and animals worldwide. They used Roche 454 sequencing and in silico analysis to explore the excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite. The study generated 26,514 non-reduant sequences, of which 22,910 (86.4%) were mapped to the published E. granus genome and 17,705 (66.8%) were in coding sequence (CDS) regions. Of the 2,280 predicted ESPs, 138 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 124 in protein metabolism, and 11 in glycolysis/glucone (GLN) pathways. Additionally, 44 antigen proteins, 25 molecular chaperones, and 4 proteases were identified. Many proteins were enriched in development-related pathways, such as TGF receptor and insulin pathways. This study provides valuable information on parasite adaptation to hosts, which can aid in developing new targets for hydat treatment and control.
In the fungus Aspergillus nidans, the protein NirA plays a crucial role in regulating the assimilation of nitrate, a key nitrogen source in soil. When nitrate is present, NirA accumulates in the nucleus and activates transcription of genes involved in nit assimilation. However, when nitrate is absent, Nir is found in the cytosol and inactive. Researchers used mass spectrometry to identify a conserved methine in Nir's nuclear export sequence, Met169, which is oxidized to methion sulfox (Metox) in the absence of nitrate. This oxidation depends on Fmo, a flav-containing monxygen, which uses methion and cystine but not glutathione as substrates. The function of Fmo cannot be replaced by alternative F proteins in A. nidans. Exposure to nitrate leads to rapid reduction of Nir-Met169 to Met169, independent of thiorexin and methion sulfox reductases. Replacement of Met169 with isoleuc, a sterically similar but not oxidizable residue, leads to partial loss of Nir activity and insensitivity to Fmo-mediated export. In contrast, replacement with alanine transforms the protein into a permanently nuclear and active factor. Co-immoprecipitation of Nir-Kap interactions and subcell localization of Nir mutants show that Met oxidation leads to change in Nir conformation.
Researchers studied how functional constraints shape the evolution of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, which allow action potentials to propagate. Since the 1950s, mathematical models by Hodgkin and Hux suggested that sodium channel properties must be tightly constrained for action potentials to propagate. There are nine mammalian genes encoding voltage-gated channels, many of which are over 90% identical in sequence, suggesting similar function. However, the multiplicity of genes raises the question: why so many? The researchers found that the simplest constraints - membrane excitability and unique resting potential - directly constrain sodium properties. They compared predicted constraints with data on mammalian channel properties from 172 sets of measurements from 40 publications, wild-type and mutant, under various conditions. Data from all channels, including mutants, obeyed the excitability constraint, while channels in muscle obeyed the unique potential, and channels in neuronal did not. Excitability alone distinguished nine channels into four groups consistent with phylogenetic analysis. Calculations suggest functional differences between groups.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for antiviral drugs to treat serious influenza infections. The viral polymer, which replicates and transcribes the genome, is a promising target since inhibitors can stop replication at an early stage. Studies on the heterotrimeric polymer, comprising subunits PA and PB1 and PB2, have led to a structure-based approach to optimize inhibitors. The unique cap-snatching mechanism of transcription can be inhibited by targeting the PB cap-binding or endonuc domains. This study presents high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 PA endonuc domain with specific inhibitors, including diketo compounds and green tea catechin, which chelate two manganese ions in the active site. The binding mode of different compounds and mononucleotide phosphate highlights how substituents on the metal scaffold can bind in distinct pockets and the active site's plasticity. These results will help design more potent inhibitors targeting the capatching enduc activity of influenza polymerase.

The study provides the first detailed information on specific binding to influenza polymerase. New options targeting the virus are urgently needed. This will guide medicinal chemistry approaches to optimize lead compounds for efficient inhibition. With additional enduc-inhibitor structures and sequence variations causing resistance, this advances novel and efficacious therapeutics targeting replication.

The capatching mechanism has been a target since inhibition can stall replication, sites are conserved, and no host counterpart. Despite trials, no structures have been of HN enduc with inhibitors or analogs, limiting structure optimization. To overcome, the enduc from other strains with amino sequences were investigated. The pH1 enduc complexed with divalent ions and 4-substit 2-dioxo acid is reported.
Researchers have developed a new immunization protocol to produce a single antivenom that can neutralize the venom of three medically important snakes in Thailand and neighboring countries: the White-lipped viper, Malayan viper, and Russ's viper. The protocol uses a low-dose, low-volume multi-site immunization method, which has been shown to be effective in producing antiven against other snake venoms. Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three venoms and showed a rapid increase in antibodies against the venoms, reaching a plateau at the 8th week post-immunization. The antiven showed high neutralization potency against the venom of the three snakes, exceeding the minimum limits set by the Queen Saoh Memorial Institute. The antiven also effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephroxic activities of the venoms. This immunization protocol can be useful in producing potent antiven against snake venoms and other diseases such as tetanus, diphtheria, and rabies.
Researchers have found that a protein called Sse, produced by Salmonella bacteria, helps the bacteria to stay in the body for a long time by stopping the movement of immune cells. These cells, called macrophages and dendritic cells, are important for fighting off infections. Sse blocks their movement by interacting with a host protein called IQAP, which is involved in cell movement. This allows Salmonella to survive in the body for at least 45 days without being cleared by the immune system. The protein Sse is injected into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenic Island 2 (SPI2) system, a tool used by bacteria to deliver proteins into host cells. Sse is similar to a toxin that blocks cell movement in other bacteria. A mutation in Sse eliminates its function. Infection with Salmonella that produces Sse has fewer immune cells in the spleen compared to those that do not produce Sse. This shows that Sse is important for Salmonella to stay in the body.
Researchers have identified a genetic mechanism behind the high virulence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA), a pathogen that causes severe disease in healthy individuals. CA-MRSA is more virulent than hospital-acquired-MRSA (HARSA). The study found that the product of the p-mec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCm of HSA, but not CA, suppresses the expression of phenol-sol-soluble modulin (PSM), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. The p-m RNA inhibits translation of the agr gene encoding a transcription factor for PSM via binding to agr mRNA. Mutations in the p-m promoter in 25% of 325 clinical MRSA isolates attenuated transcription, and 9% had no p-m. Most p-mutated or p-deleted HARSAs had increased PSM expression compared to those with intact p-m, and some produced high amounts comparable to CA-MRSA. Deletion of p-m from HARS with p-m increased expression of Agr and P and virulence in mice.
Researchers have created a mouse model to study a phenomenon called antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE), where maternal antibodies from a mother to child can make the child more susceptible to a severe disease. In this case, the disease is caused by the deng virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne illness that can be deadly. The model uses mice that lack a key part of their immune system, type I interferon (IF), which helps fight off viruses. Mice born to mothers with antibodies against DENV were infected with a different type of D (DENV2) and died within 4 days, while those born to mothers without antibodies survived. Symptoms included liver damage, leaky blood vessels, and low blood cell counts. Treatment with anti-TNF, a protein that helps reduce inflammation, saved the mice and restored healthy liver cells. However, blocking another protein IL-6 did not affect the outcome. This model can help scientists understand how ADE works and test potential treatments and vaccines.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify factors associated with visceral leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania infantum parasite, in the Americas. They analyzed 51 studies and found that male sex was a risk factor for infection when diagnosed with the leishman skin test, but not with serological tests. Younger individuals were less likely to be infected but more prone to illness. Presence of dogs at home, higher seropositivity in nearby, lower socioeconomic status, and vegetated areas were associated with infection. However, chickens in the house and nutritional status were not linked. Studies had methodological limitations and biases, but consistent patterns emerged for some factors, suggesting targeted control measures. Ecological studies showed dog seropositivity linked to human infection, highlighting dogs as a marker for visceral leishias occurrence. This review is the first on factors for L infant in the Americas, clarifying aspects and raising new questions. Results cannot be applied to other contexts due to the disease's unique characteristics. A review in Asia found similar patterns for variables, such as clustering, household conditions, vegetation, and poverty. In Brazil, case-fatality rates varied 4.2-10% in treated patients. Diagnosis uses hypersensitivity tests, parasitological, serological, and molecular methods.
Inhalation of Francisella tularens (Ft) causes acute and fatal pneumonia, with the lung's cytokine environment favoring bacterial replication. However, the underlying mechanisms of acute pathogenesis and lethality remain unclear. Research on the sequential and systemic immune response in tularemia reveals that an innate cellular response, not bacterial burden or cytokine production, drives pathology and host mortality. Lethal infection with Ft elicits medullary and extra-medullary myopoies, recruiting large numbers of immature myeloid and MDSC cells to the lungs. These cells fail to mature, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of function, and death, partially dependent on Ly6+ cells. Acceleration of this process may account for rapid lethality with FtS4. In contrast, sub-lethal infection with LVS has a pulmonary response of mature neutrophils and monocytes, required for protection, suggesting a threshold for lethal infection. Eliciting a mature phagocyte response provides transient, but dramatic, innate protection against Ft4. This study shows the nature of myoid response may determine host mortality versus survival following Francis infection.
Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is a global concern due to its rapid spread and potential to transmit infectious diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses. To understand its colonization pattern, researchers combined classical genetics and Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approaches to analyze populations from Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas. In Southeast Asia, populations from China, Thailand, and Japan show low differentiation and high co-ancestry, indicating a common origin and high connectivity. China appears to be the oldest population. Outside Asia, invasion in La Reunion, America, and the Mediterranean is supported by chaotic distribution, maintaining high diversity in adventive populations. Independent introductions may have facilitated establishment through admixture of unrelated genomes, resulting in high intra-population variability. This may extend to genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence. Ancestry and admixture may create conditions for efficient arvirus transmission and outbreak. The study provides origins of populations from Asia, the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Pacific, and America, valuable for models predicting vector competence and risk. Spread occurred under different conditions, varying competence between eco-geographic populations due to unexplored genetic and environmental interactions. Knowledge is crucial for assessing arv outbreaks in old and new areas. Invasion routes were inferred using Approx Bayesian (ABC method, implemented in DIY2.0. The Chinese sample, collected in Southeast, native area, shows low differentiation and high coance with other Asian samples, confirming ancestral origin. albict was primarily supported by chaotic distribution, mediated by human activity.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes chronic infections in wounds and found that its ability to grow in high-density, not its virulence or biofilm functions, is key to its fitness in these infections. They analyzed human isolates from chronic wounds and found they were often defective in virulence functions and biofilm formation, and that many virulence and biofilm genes were not required for bacterial fitness in mouse wounds. In contrast, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolic and energy, and membrane integrity were critical. This suggests that bacterial fitness in wounds is influenced by conditions such as anaerobic, oxidative, and membrane stress, which can be represented by high-density bacterial growth in the absence of a host. These findings shed light on bacterial functions in chronic infections, the nature of stresses applied to bacteria at infection sites, and suggest potential targets to compromise infection pathogenesis.
A study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of chronic hydrocele, a common manifestation of bancrofilariasis, a disease prevalent in 80 countries. Researchers evaluated the occurrence of intrascrot lymphangiectasia, testis morphology, and hydrocele recurrence in patients who underwent hydrocelectomy in a bancrofilariasis endemic area. A total of 968 patients with unilateral or bilateral hydrocele (Group 1) and 218 from the same area who had hydrocele-sparing hydrolectomy elsewhere (Group 2) were enrolled. Hydrocele rates in Group 1 and Group 2 were 0.3% and 19.3, respectively (p<0.001). No recurrence was seen in Group 2. Lymphatic vessels were seen in 30.9% and 46.3 of patients in Group 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.081). Testicles were abnormal in 18% and 35.7 of patients in Group 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.025). Lymph fluid from dilated lymphatic vessels is a component of chronic hydrocele fluid threatening test integrity in bancfilari endemic areas. To prevent recurrence, authors advise complete excision of hydrocele and suture or excision of leaking vessels.
Researchers have identified a deubiquinating enzyme, Ts37, in the parasite Trichella spiralis, a zoonotic nematode that causes trichlos, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. This enzyme is a cystine protease, similar to a human protein called UCH5. The study used a probe to detect deubiquinating activity in T spir larvae and identified several potential enzymes, including Ts37. The gene encoding Ts37 was cloned and expressed as a recombinant protein, which was purified and shown to have deubiquinating activity. Co-precipitation with recombinant Ts37 showed it associates with T spir proteome components, including ADR1, a yeast homologue. The inhibitor LD-44 reduced Ts37 activity and viability of cultured larvae, suggesting U enzymes play a role in parasite biology. The interaction between Ts37 and proteome has been conserved throughout evolution.
Researchers have identified a new potential target for treating Chagas disease, a tropical illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Cysteine protease, an enzyme in the parasite, is considered a valid target for treatment. The study tested nitrile-based cystine protease inhibitors, compounds that also inhibit cathepsin K, a related enzyme. Two compounds showed strong anti-tryosomal activity against the parasite, with EC50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 micromolar, significantly lower than against cruzain, a recombinant form of the enzyme. This suggests the compounds may target other cystine proteases, not just cruzain. The study also tested catheps K inhibitors on a cyclohexane dicbox scaffold, and found two compounds had greater anti-tryosomal activity than expected from cruzain inhibition. This challenges the idea that cruzain activity is a good predictor of anti-tryosomal activity. Cystine protease inhibition is a valid target for Chagas treatment, as shown by previous studies on cystine inhibitor 777 in animal models and analogs in a murine Chagas model. The study's results suggest compounds 5 and 11 may have a polypharmac profile, targeting other cystine proteases in the parasite. The cystine protease profile indicates a new antag target may share characteristics with catps K, and phenic screening for antag agents should include inhibitors of this enzyme.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the physical structure of the maize genome, which covers 93.5% of the genome and is aligned with 86.1% of the genetic map. The map contains 25,908 genetic markers that align nearly 73% of the maize genome to the rice genome. The study found that 1 kilobase in rice corresponds to 3.2 kilobase in maize, indicating a 6-fold genome expansion in maize. This is due to maize's polyploid origin, where most regions correspond to two regions in maize. Inversions account for most chromosome variations during diploidization. The study also found evidence of ancient duplication before maize and rice divergence. Reconstructing the paleobotany of maize shows its progenitors had 10 chromosomes.

The comparison of maize and rice genomes shed light on chromosomes contributing to polloid, rearrangements and diploid, and homologous regions. RFLP mapping showed two maize chromosomes align with one rice and sorghum, a whole genome duplication event. Table 3 lists primary and secondary duplications in maize. Detection of 3 copies per over (Table 2) supports tetraploid emergence. Duplications in rice are not limited to its ancestor. Average size is similar to rice physical map. A genetic map was developed to anchor and orient contigs along chromosomes. Multiple events contribute to maize complex pattern. Synteny analysis shows rearrangements since maize and rice divergence.
Researchers have long believed that prions, the infectious agents responsible for transmissible spong encephalopathies, are composed of misfolded versions of the prion protein (PrPSc) that replicate in the body without nucleic acids by inducing misfolding of cellular pr protein (Pr). The most common form of human prion disease, sporadic, is thought to originate from a low frequency of spontaneous misfolding generating the first PrSc particle, which then propagates as the infectious form of disease. To mimic early events in sporadic disease etiology, researchers attempted de novo generation of infectious PrSc in vitro using protein misfolding amplification (PM) procedure. Under standard PM conditions and precautions to avoid cross-contamination, de novo generation of PrSc was not observed, supporting its use for diagnostic applications. However, PM was modified to generate PrSc in absence of pre-existing PrSc in different species at low and variable rates. De novo generated PrSc was infectious when inoculated into wild hamsters, producing a new disease with unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. Results support the prion hypothesis and provide a model to study mechanism of sporadic prion disease, suggesting prion diversity is not restricted to known forms, and new infectious foldings may produce novel phenotypes.
Researchers have developed a new model, called the Angular Velocity Unit (AV), to estimate the angular velocity of a bee's movement in its environment. This model is based on electrophysiological data and behavioral data from honeybees. The AV is thought to be an extension of the optomotor response, a pathway in the bee's brain that helps with motion detection. The model was tested using a corridor-center paradigm, where bees fly through a corridor with square or sinusoidal gratings on the walls. When combined with an existing flight control algorithm, the model reproduces the invariance of the flight path to the frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from centering behavior seen in real bees. The model also shows a constant response to distance along the corridor for a range of grating frequencies, suggesting it can be used as a visual odometer. 

The model, called the Angular Detector Unit (ADU), reproduces patterns previously unaccounted for in the corridor-center response, such as deviations in flight path from the center for different grating frequencies and square or sinusoidal gratings. The detector only responds to frequencies up to 10-100Hz, lower than those experienced in bee experiments. Additional circuitry must be present to calculate AV. Neurons in the ventral cord of the bee respond to moving patterns in the field of view. Odometry in bees is unaffected by environment frequency, suggesting AV neurons could estimate distance by summing output over time. The model tested this relationship and results show a wide range of frequencies (0.1-10)
Untreated Infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambense Are Not 100% Fatal

A long-term follow-up study of 50 African trypanosomiasis (AT) patients from the Ivory Coast who refused treatment after diagnosis found that 10 out of 11 patients who continued to refuse treatment showed parasite clearance using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of these patients (7/10) displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming negative to trypanosome antigens Liat 1.3, 1.5, and 1.6. Two alternative progressions of AT were observed: an asymptomatic infection with long-lasting serological responses and spontaneous resolution with negative parasitological and PCR results and dropping antibody titers. This study does not estimate the frequency of these courses but notes that field programs encounter subjects with positive serologic results but negative parasitological tests. Recognizing trypanotolerance in humans is a major step for future research in AT.

African trypanosomias (AT) or sleeping sickness is caused by Trypanosoma sub-species transmitted by tse flies, Tryosoma bruce (T.b) gambense and T.b rhodense, with T gambense causing 95% of cases. The disease evolves from hemolymphatic to meningoencephitic phase when parasites invade central nervous system leading neurological disorders. This study combines clinical, serological, molecular, and parasit investigations using specific tools and sensitive tests, the most comprehensive on Tryosoma bruce gambense infection in humans.
Researchers investigated how ionizing radiation affects the development of cancer, particularly in relation to the p53 gene, a key tumor suppressor that protects against genetic damage. They hypothesized that radiation selects for p-deficient hematopoietic progenitors, which are cells that lack the p53 gene, contributing to the link between radiation and lymphoid malignancies. Using mouse models, they found that p53 disruption provides a selective advantage after radiation, leading to long-term expansion of p-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. This is due to several factors: protection from radiation-induced elimination of progenitor cells, prevention of radiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor cells, improved maintenance of progenitor fitness, and elimination of competing p-type progenitors. The study suggests that radiation's carcinogenic effect is partly explained by selection for cells with p disruption, which protects progenitor cells from immediate and long-term reductions following radiation.
Researchers have identified a protein called SmKI-1 in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a type of flatworm that causes schistosomiasis in humans. This protein acts as a serine protease inhibitor, which means it blocks the activity of enzymes called trypsin and neutrophil elastase. These enzymes play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and fighting off infections, but can also contribute to inflammation and tissue damage when overactive. The study found that Sm-1's Kunit domain, a specific part of the protein, blocks the active site of neutil elastase, preventing it from working. This could be a way the parasite evades the host's immune system. The researchers also showed that Sm-1 inhibits the ability of neutils to kill schistosomes, the larval stage of the parasite. To investigate further, they knocked down the Sm-1 gene in S. mansoni and observed a significant impact on parasite development in vitro and vivo. They tested Sm-1's anti-inflammatory potential in mouse models of diseases, such as liver damage and arthritis, and found it reduced neutrophil recruitment and elast activity. In another model, Sm-1 reduced neutil accumulation, IL-1 secretion, and hyperiception. Sm-1 also inhibited neutil recruitment in response to carrageenan in mice. The study concludes that Sm-1 is essential for S. mans survival and has potential as a therapeutic against inflammatory diseases.
Researchers have developed a new method to accurately model high-resolution structures of transmembrane helical (TM) proteins, which are crucial for various cellular functions but have remained largely uncharacterized due to lack of close structural homologues. The method was tested on 50 pairs of TM protein homologues with diverse topology, size, and sequence identity, and achieved near-atomic prediction of membrane-embedded regions, outperforming starting templates. Models of adenosine A2 and chemokine CX4 receptors were ranked first in GPCR-CK prediction contests. Unlike templates, the models are suitable for computer-based engineering and redesigned X-ray structures exhibit similar interactions. The method should be useful for atom-level modeling and design of structurally uncharacterized TM proteins from a range of homologues.
Listeria monocytogen, the bacterium responsible for listeriosis, a foodborne disease that poses serious risks to fetuses, newborns, and immunocompromised adults, has been found to switch from an active, motile lifestyle to a state of persistence in vacuoles in human hepatocytes and trophlast cells. This switch occurs after several days of infection, where bacteria stop producing the actin-nucle protein Act and become trapped in lysosome-like vacoles termed Lister-Containing Vacoles (Lis). Subpopulations of bacteria resist degradation in Lis and enter a slow-replicative state. In subculture of host cells harboring Lis, bacteria show capacity to cycle between vacolar and act-based motility stages. When Act is absent, as in ΔAct mutants, vacolar bacteria parasitize host in a "viable but nonculturable" (VB) state, preventing detection by conventional counting methods. Exposure to high doses of gentamicin does not trigger Lis formation but selects for vacolar VB bacteria. These results reveal L monocogen's ability to enter persistent state in epithelial cells, favoring asymptomatic carriage, lengthening incubation of listiosis and bacterial survival during therapy.
Researchers have developed a neuromechanical model of auditory perception to study the phenomenon of auditory streaming, where a sequence of high and low frequency tones in an A-BA pattern can be perceived as a single or separate streams. The model combines neuroscientific and psychoacoustic experiments to investigate the alternations between these interpretations. Unlike previous models, it includes units with sensory inputs that mimic the brain's response to tones and a computation for competition in the primary auditory cortex. Mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise are implemented, along with slow NMDA excitation for temporal memory. The model predicts that manipulating the frequency difference between tones affects the dominance of the stronger percept, a property seen in other bistable paradigms. Experiments confirm this prediction and improve the model, achieving agreement between results. The model provides a platform to consider other conditions, including context and attention. 

The study focuses on the dynamics after the first percept switch, motivated by physiological and perceptual models. It incorporates sound-evoked A responses to a competition and identifies states in neuronal dynamics rather than preassigned units. NMD-like dynamics enables binding from one triplet to the next. Increasing stimulus strength favors the attended percept, but inputs should be dynamic and dependent on state. Future work will explore attention effects in streaming. Studies report integrated and segregated percepts, but other interpretations have been documented. The neuromechanical formulation and tonopic organization distinguish it from existing models. Parameters balance adaptation and noise were tuned to match durations, fitting a log distribution. A responses were interpreted using functions that mimic build up. Other data have been conceptual based on tonopic organization. When tones are far apart, activity is separated to drive representations.
Researchers have developed a new method to assess the allergenicity of Schistosoma mansoni proteins using a humanized Ratophil Leukemia (RSAT8) cell line. This cell line is used in combination with a cell-free in vitro translation system and quality controls to evaluate the potential allergenicity of S. mansoni antigens. The method allows for rapid translation of S. mans proteins in 90 minutes, eliminating the need for purification. Antigen integrity is confirmed using Western blotting. After incubation with infected serum, the RSAT8 cell line is challenged with the translated mixture and luciferase activity measured, indicating cellular activation by the allergen. This method is suitable for assessing novel S. mans allergens and high-throughput studies using individual sera. Characterized plant and parasitic allergens, such as Par 2, SmAL-1, and IgE factor SE/alpha-1, were expressed in wheat lysate and E. coli and activated the basophil reporter line. SmAL-1, but not SmAL2, was able to activate the cell line. This technology paves the way for genome-wide assessment of S mans allergenicity, the Schistoma allergome. It could also unravel the allergome of S mans and other medically important parasites, leading to a better understanding of allergity and protection mechanisms at the molecular level.
Researchers studied the effects of transposable elements (TEs) on gene expression in the fruit fly Drosophila, specifically in a hybrid syndrome called dysgenesis. This occurs when TEs from one parent are not present in the other parent's genome, causing germline damage and sterility. They found that when TEs from the father are not matched with the mother's pool of silencing PI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), they become activated in the offspring. Using D. virilis as a model, they characterized the effects of TE divergence between parents on offspring. They discovered that differences in TE landscape lead to persisting germline expression, transmitted to the next generation, and increased piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. Gene expression is influenced by the piRNA profile of parents, arising from polymorphic TE insertions. These results support a model where early germl events establish a chronic state of TE and gene expression, maintained through adulthood and passed to the next generation. This shows divergence in TE is associated with piRNA-mediated transgener effects on gene expression within populations.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating Fragile X Syndrome, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. They found that overexpressing three histone deacetylases (HDAC3, 6, or 11) suppresses neurodegeneration in a Drosila model of Fragile X. This is due to selective transcriptional repression of the CG repeat-containing gene. The team also found increased acetylation of histones at the F1 locus in patient lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, which correlates with elevated F1 mRNA expression. Histone acetylase inhibitors reduced F1 expression to control levels in patient cell lines and extended lifespan in CG repeat-expressing Dila. These findings support a model where the CG repeat promotes chromatin remodeling, increasing toxic F1 mRNA. The results also suggest that histone inhibitors or acetylase activators can selectively repress the F1 locus.
Host genetics play a critical role in controlling CD8 T cell function and immunopathology during chronic viral infection. Effective CD8 T cells are vital for controlling chronic viral infections, but factors such as the immune response contribute to maintaining effector CD8 cell responses versus CD T cell exhaustion during chronic infection. Specific MHC alleles and MHC heterogeneity are associated with CD8 T function and viral control during human infection, but it is unclear to what extent host genetics influence the establishment of chronic infection. To examine the impact of M heterogeneity versus non-MHC host on development of chronic infection, mice were infected with the clone-13 (Cl-13) strain of lymphocytic choriomitis virus (LCMV). Following Cl-13 infection, H-2xdB D2F1 and B1 mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice. Strikingly, H-2xd2B1 on C57 genetic background exhibited mortality following Cl-13 infection. CD T depletion prevented mortality in Cl-infected D2F mice indicating mortality was CD T-dependent. D2F mice maintained CD T effector cytokine production and reduced T exhaustion marker PD-1 expression. In addition, D2F induced larger T response than B1 mice Cl-13 mortality D2 mice dependent CD T-mediated IF-γ production. Following chronic infection, increased CD T response allowed rapid viral clearance at cost enhanced immunology dependent both M diversity and host genetic background.
Researchers studied the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria that causes anthrax, in northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. They analyzed 106 strains from six provinces, including Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Gans, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Yunn. The study found five subgroups of B. anthracis, A. Br.001/002, A. Brum, A. Aust, A. Ames, and A.008/009. All subgroups were found in Xinjiang, while one in Shaanxi, two in Gans, three Qinghai, and four in Inner Mongolia. However, the distribution of B. anthrac populations differed from strains before 1990 in China. The A. Ames subgroup was also found in Inner Mongolia and other provinces.

The researchers used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and multilocus-number tandem repeat (MLVA) analysis with 15 markers to identify the subgroups. They found 21 new genotypes, including MLVA-28, ML-30, ML-31, ML-38, ML-CH3, and MLCH18. By SNP and MLVA analysis, the diversification of genotypes and distribution of B anthrac populations is becoming balanced in northwestern China. The study provides preliminary results on diversity of B anthrac in China, helping prevention and control of the disease.
Researchers studied how the body defends against a type of bacteria called Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, which can cause severe diarrheal disease by attaching to the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. They found that goblet cells, a type of cell in the intestines, play a key role in this defense. Goblet cells produce a mediator called REL-β, which is strongly induced during infection and found in stool and serum. However, its role in defense was unclear. Mice lacking REL- gene (Retb-) were infected with the bacteria and showed increased mortality and mucosal damage due to deeper pathogen penetration. Immunostaining showed Retb- mice were impaired in infection-induced epithelial cell proliferation. REL- did not directly increase proliferation, but acted as a chemoattract for CD+ T cells. Correspondingly, Ret- mice had impaired CD+ cell recruitment and reduced interleukin-22, a cytokine that increases proliferation. Delivery of REL- to Ret- mice restored CD+ cell, increased IL-22 and proliferation, and reduced pathology. These findings show REL- and goblet cells recruit CD+ cells to protect against enteric pathogen via increased proliferation.
Researchers have discovered a crucial interaction between a specific part of the norovirus protein (VPg) and a region of the host protein eIF4, which is essential for the initiation of translation of the norirus genome. Norirus is a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans and has an unusual mechanism of protein synthesis that relies on interactions between VP and eukotic factors in the host cells. The study focused on murine norirus (MNV) and found that VP binds to a middle part of e4 (residues 652-113). Further analysis showed that a 20 amino acids at the end of MN VP directly bind to the HE-1 domain of e4 via a conserved motif in all noriruses. This interaction was confirmed by pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal calorimetry. The binding site on e4 was defined by NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by mutagenesis and binding assays. The site is non-overlapping with the binding for e4 on e4, showing norirus VP can form ternary VP-e4-e4 complexes. A fusion proteins containing the C-terminal of MN VP inhibited in vitro translation of norirus but not cap or I-dependent translation. This defines structural and functional details of norirus VP and e4 interaction and a potential target for antiviral therapy.
Researchers investigated the evolution of gene clusters in bacterial genomes, where genes encoding proteins in a common pathway are often found near each other on the chromosome. Several theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including natural selection and the selfish operon model. The selfish model suggests that clustered genes are more likely to be transferred to other species, increasing their chances of survival. Another theory, the persistence model, proposes that close genes are less likely to be disrupted by deletions. The study developed computational models to examine conditions under which clusters can evolve. The selfish model was re-implemented and run under various conditions, and a Moran process was introduced where selection for clustering occurs through genome inversion. A model combining selection and inversion was also developed to track rearrangements. Surprisingly, clusters failed to evolve under many conditions. Factors promoting evolution include low gene number in pathway, high population size, and selfish model, high transfer rate. Analysis showed evolution can occur under direct and indirect selection with certain conditions. The selfish model remains a viable explanation under these conditions.
Malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions worldwide. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to severe consequences of infection due to the adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a variant of Pf1, a parasite-encoded antigen on the surface of infected cells, called VARCS, which binds to chroit sulfate on syncyotrophoblasts in the intervillous space of placent. VARCS is only expressed in the presence of placenta, suggesting its expression is repressed in men or non-pregnant women, but the mechanism is not understood.

Researchers found that the gene encoding VARCS contains a small open reading frame that represses translation of the mRNA, a novel form of regulation in malaria parasites. This mechanism is reversible, allowing high levels of protein upon selection, enabling parasites to upregulate expression in appropriate host tissue. Further studies on VARCS regulation and protein expression will provide insights into host-parasite interactions underlying disease pathogenesis.

Analysis of VARCS transcripts from parasites and pregnant women revealed the open frame upstream Pf1 region is not spliced and present in mRNA, indicating VARCS is encoded by bicronic transcript. This suggests additional regulation of Pf1 variant with pregnancy malaria, preventing expression when plac is not available. VARCS can be detected in non-pregn individuals, including children and men, suggesting post-transcription repression in these individuals, lower immune exposure. Contrary evidence by proteomic study detected VARCS parasites non-plental and earlier study CSA-binding parasites nonregn hosts.

The parasite genome contains 60 genes varying between isolates, VARCS conserved in most, if not all, isolates. Selective pressure preservation exemplified by homologue in chimpanzee parasite Plmod reowi.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 34 children infected with the deng virus (DENV) in Nicaragua to understand why some develop severe symptoms while others do not. They used a technique called genome-wide microarray to look at the expression of genes in blood cells on day 3-6 of illness. The study found differences in gene expression between children with severe and mild symptoms, especially in genes related to protein synthesis and energy production. Children with deng hemorrhagic fever had different genes related to neutrophil anti-microbial peptides, which help fight infection. Combining their data with previous studies, they found DENV infection affects protein and nucleic acid metabolism. In contrast, lab experiments showed increased interferon response, but this was not seen in patient samples, suggesting interferon response is short-lived by day 3-6 of illness. The study highlights differences between severe and mild DENV manifestations and identifies commonalities.
Researchers have studied how herpesviruses, a type of virus that causes disease, enter the body. They found that one type, called Murid Herpesvirus-4 (Mu-4), targets the olfactory epithelium, a layer of cells in the nose responsible for smell. Mu-4 binds to a molecule called heparan sulfate (HS) on the epithelium, which helps it enter the body. The epithelium has HS on its surface, allowing Mu-4 to bind and enter. The virus then travels down the cilia, tiny hair-like structures on the epithelium, and infects neurons or glial cells, which support neurons. This suggests the olfactory epithelium is a key entry point for herpesviruses.

 Mu-4 can infect neurons, even though it's not typically a neuron-targeting virus. The epithelium may provide a way for herpesviruses to enter the body. HS is thought to be a non-specific capture for viruses, but also plays a key role in Mu-4 entry. This means targeting the epithel with HS could be a way to control herpes infection. Other factors, like availability of HS, may also limit Mu- entry to the epithel.

The study used Mu-4 as a model to understand the relationship between HS, virus binding, and infection. They found that Mu- infects sustacular cells, which support neurons, at a ratio of 3.6:1. This suggests Mu- specifically targets the epithel, not just a result of inhalation. The epithel has different types of cells, including neurons, sustacular, and precursor.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the bacterium Salmonella regulates its ability to invade human cells. This regulation occurs at the post-transcription level, meaning it affects how genes are read after they are made, not how they are made. A protein called CRP-c is a key player in this process. Without CR-c, Salmonella produces more genes that help it invade cells, making it more virulent. CR-c also controls a protein called Hil, which is a master regulator of invasion. This control happens through a specific part of the Hil gene called the 3' untranslated region (UTR). A small RNA called Spot 42 is also involved, and is repressed by CR-c. When this repression is lifted, Spot 42 promotes Hil expression. In experiments show that Spot 42 targets the 3'UTR of Hil. These findings highlight the importance of the Hil 3'UT as a control point for Salmonella invasion gene expression.
Researchers investigated the relationship between CAG repeat instability, chromatin structure, and transcription in the context of Huntington's disease (HD) using R6 and R2 transgenic mouse lines. These mice express a similar transgene, integrated at different sites, and exhibit tissue-specific HD instability. The study found that CAG instability is higher in R2 tissues compared to R1 samples, correlating with high transgene expression and chromatin accessibility. High levels of transgene expression and histone H3 trimethylation at the HD locus were observed in R2 mice, while H9 dimethylation was reduced. However, levels of transgene expression and histone marks were similar in striatum and cerebellum, two tissues showing different C instability levels. The study suggests that transcription modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo, with elongation regulated in a tissue-dependent manner contributing to tissue-selective C instability. The transgene is integrated in a more euchromatin and transcriptionally active region in R2 mice than R1, supporting active chrom structure in increased C instability. C instability was higher in R2, irrespective of repeat size, than R1, indicating chrom context at site integration and expression rather than initial size underlies instability. Despite similar HD expression in striatum and cerebellum, these tissues present different instability levels. Histone modifications associated with heterochrom, euchrom, and initiation were comparable in striatum and cerebell of mice. Accessibility to DNA repair factors when chrom is open was tested, but chrom accessibility unlikely underlies tissue-selective HD somatic C instability.
Researchers have identified specific genetic changes in the Enterovirus 71 (EV) virus that may contribute to its ability to spread and cause severe disease in humans. EV is a highly contagious virus that can cause a range of symptoms, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological problems. To understand how it spreads, scientists analyzed the virus in immunocompromised patients with disseminated disease. They compared full-length genomes from respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and blood specimens and found three key changes: a non-conservative amino acid change in the VP1 protein, a conservative substitution in protein 2, and a silent mutation in protein 3. These changes occurred within five days of infection. Infectious clones were created with these mutations and tested in cell culture, revealing the VP1 change gave a replicative advantage in neuroblastoma cells. This mutation was associated with a second nonervative change in the VP1 loop in neuroblast cells. Models of the virus were built to see how these changes affect structure and interactions with host cells, showing no significant changes but possible altered interactions. The study suggests the VP1 loop of EV plays a role in cell tropism, independent of EV lineage, contributing to dissemination and neurotropism in immunocompromised patients.
Researchers have studied how certain bacteria called Streptoccus recognize and respond to signals that help them take in new genetic material from their environment. This process, called competence, is crucial for their evolution and allows them to gain traits like antibiotic resistance or virulence. In Streptoccus, a type of bacteria, this process is controlled by a system called quorum sensing (QS) mediated by small peptides called pherones. One such system, ComRS, involves a peptide Com that is processed, secreted, and imported into the cell where it activates a protein ComR. Com then turns on a feedback loop to make more Com and another protein SigX. ComRS are found in most Streptoccus species, but their sequences are different, suggesting a way for species-specific communication. To study interaction between Strept species and detail, researchers developed a test to measure Com proteins' response to their own and other species' pherones in living cells. They found Com proteins are strict, intermediate, or promiscuous in specificity. They also solved the structure of Com from Suis to see how it interacts with pher and find features that explain recognition. Using this, they probed the pher binding site in Com proteins from other species and found a variable and conserved face, where conserved parts bind and variable parts discriminate pher. This work provides a model for ph recognition and prediction of new pher that activate Com.
Researchers have studied how centromeres, specific regions on chromosomes that maintain their position over many generations, in the yeast Candida albicans, a pathogenic fungus. Unlike other eukaryotes, centeres in C. albicans are short, simple, and fully sequenced, making it an attractive model for studying centeric DNA properties. The team found that centeres are associated with a replication origin that fires first on their respective chromosome, and epigen formation of new centeres (neocromeres) is accompanied by shifts in replication timing, making neocere the first to replicate and associated with origin complex (ORC) components. Changing the level of centere-specific histone H isoform led to a concomitant change in OR association with centere regions, supporting that centere determine origin activity. Analysis of centere-associated DNA revealed a replication pattern characteristic of constitutively active origins. This pattern is conserved with centere position among strains and species, independent of DNA sequence. The study suggests that timing of replication serves as an epigen mechanism for inheriting centere position.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors contributing to chronic back pain in adults of European ancestry. They analyzed data from 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 with chronic back pain cases and 128,494 controls from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology consortium and UK Biobank. The study found a genome-wide significant association with a variant in the SOX5 gene, which was replicated in an additional 283,752 UKob participants and exceeded genome-wide significance in a joint analysis. Two other loci, CC26/GMC and DCC, also reached genome-wide significance in a joint analysis. This is the first genome-wide association study for chronic pain and identifies a genetic link to the SO5 gene.
Taenia solium cysticosis is a neglected zoonotic disease that affects humans and pigs in many developing countries, particularly in West Cameroon. The disease is underreported due to its various symptoms, with epilepsy being the most recognized, and lack of diagnostic tools in endemic areas. A study was conducted to estimate the burden of the disease in Cameroon using cost and Disability Adjusted Life (DAL) Year estimations. Parameters were collected and imported into software, with different distributions used for each type of information. Based on a 3.6% prevalence, 50,326 people with neurocystercosis-associated epilepsy were estimated, representing 1.0% of the population, and 15,961 pigs with cysticosis, 5.6% of the pig population. Total costs of Taenia solium cystosis in Cameroon were estimated at 10,255,202 Euro, with 4.7% due to pig losses and 95.3 to direct and indirect human losses. Monetary burden per case was 194 Euro. Average DALs lost were 9.0 per thousand persons per year. This study provides country-specific estimations of human and animal burden of the zoon disease. Comparison with a South Africa study indicates salaries play a significant role in monetary burden. Knowing prevalence and salary can indicate total cost. Estimated DALs lost were higher than other neglected diseases.
Researchers have identified a non-coding RNA called Rsa in Staphylococcus aureus that reduces the bacteria's ability to cause disease. Rsa is a small RNA molecule that doesn't code for a protein, but instead regulates the expression of other genes. It works by binding to a specific sequence in the mRNA of a gene called mgrA, which is a master regulator of gene expression. This binding prevents the translation of mgrA, leading to increased biofilm formation and decreased capsule synthesis. Biofilm is a sticky substance that helps bacteria stick to surfaces, while capsule is a protective layer around the bacteria. Without capsule, the bacteria are more easily killed by the immune system. In animal models, Rsa reduced the severity of infections and increased chronic infections. Rsa is part of a network that helps S. aureus interact with the immune system, making it less invasive and more likely to cause chronic infections. This is the first example of a small RNA in S. aureus acting as a virulence suppressor. S. aureus is a common human commensal, and Rsa may have evolved to help it coexist with the host without causing harm.
Researchers have developed a new method to visualize the process of HIV-1 uncoating, a crucial step in the virus's life cycle, using a fluorescently tagged protein called cyclophilin A-DRed (CA-DRed). This protein binds tightly to the HIV-1 capsid and remains associated with the core even after the viral membrane is removed, allowing for the first time-resolved imaging of unco in vitro and in living cells. The rate of loss of CA-DRed from the core is modulated by the stability of the core and is accelerated upon initiation of reverse transcription. The majority of cores lose CA-D shortly after fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. Single particle tracking at late post-infection reveals gradual loss of CA-D dependent on reverse transcription. Unco occurs in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. This novel assay enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 unco in living cells and reveals previously unapprecited spatio-temporal features of this incompletely understood process.
Researchers investigated the relationship between oligonucleotide usage and properties in prokary genomes, including codon usage, DNA stacking, and structural conformation. They analyzed oligonucle frequencies in coding and non-coding regions and found that proary chromosomes can be described by hexanucle frequencies, suggesting proary DNA is short-range correlated. Oligonucle usage varied more in AT-rich and host-associated genomes than GC and freeiving genomes, mainly in nonoding regions. Bias in tetranucle usage correlated with GC content and coding regions were more biased than nonoding. Nonoding regions were 5.5% more AT-rich than coding, on average, in 402 examined chromosomes. Pronounced compositional differences were found within and between AT and GC genomes. GC genomes were more similar in tetranucle usage nonoding than AT genomes. Differences may be attributed to lifestyle, as tetran usage host-associated was more dissimilar and less biased than freeiving.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism of meiotic drive that affects non-crossover recombination, but not crossover recombination, in humans. Meiotic recombination is a process that ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity through large-scale reciprocal crossovers and local gene events called nonrosso. The study analyzed both types of recombinant molecules in sperm at six active hotspots and found a novel form of biased transmission exclusive to non-crossover recombination. This bias arises from differences in crossover and non-crossover heterodup formation and mismatch repair. This form of biased conversion does not influence hotspot activity like SNPs that initiate recombination, but is a new source of recombination-driven meiotic drive that may affect thousands of hotspots throughout the genome. Interestingly, this drive favors G/C over A base pairs, consistent with established correlations between GC content and recombination in mammalian genomes.

The study found that heterozygosity at a single SNP can lead to differences in initiation between haplotypes and influence hotspot activity in cis. Transmission of alleles from DSB-suppressed hapotype to recombinant progeny results in meiotic drive of hotspot-suppress variants, leading to hotspot extinction. Biased conversions have been observed in some assays as deviations from expected 1:1 allele frequencies in recombinant progeny. This can occur if initiation occurs more on one chromosome than the other and broken is corrected from uncut homologue.

Researchers found this form of meiotic drive strong enough to promote allele fixation, suggesting it may contribute to correlation between GC content and recombination and evolution of genomic composition. A survey of PR9-regulated hotspot substantiated finding that heterozygosity at 5.2 drives biased conversion. The observed hotspot is consistent with differential recombination between hapypes, noted at other hotspots.
Researchers have developed a new computational model to understand how environmental chemicals and drugs affect human health. The model, called a protein-protein network, connects chemicals to diseases and proteins in the body. This helps identify which chemicals may be harmful and which proteins they target. The network also finds unexpected links between chemicals and proteins. Examples include chemicals linked to breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis, and potential targets for diethylhexylphthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloribenzo-dioxin, pirix acid, and permethrin. These connections are supported by recent studies, showing the power of combining toxicogenomics data with other types of data.

The model uses data from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, which contains information on chemicals and proteins associated with diseases. The researchers selected 42,194 associations between 2,490 compounds and 6,060 proteins known to be involved in human diseases. To predict which chemicals affect health, they analyzed clusters to identify new disease-chemical associations. When linking chemicals to diseases, it's important to note there's no direction, meaning it's not possible to separate positive from negative associations between a chemical and disease.

Analysis of environmental chemicals with gene expression is lacking. With advances in toxicogenomics, information on protein activity in response to small exposures becomes available.
Researchers have developed a new way to study how the brain processes sound by creating a computer model that mimics how neurons in the primary auditory cortex respond to sound. This model, called a network receptive field, shows that these neurons are sensitive to a much larger range of sound features than previously thought, including time and frequency. It also reveals that the brain processes sound in a non-linear way, meaning it doesn't just add up the parts of the sound, but combines them in complex ways. The model is made up of several smaller fields that interact with each other and can be excitatory or inhibitory, meaning they can either increase or decrease the signal. This interaction allows the brain to detect specific patterns in sound and may be important for recognizing sounds. The model is more accurate than previous methods and shows how the brain processes sound in a more complex way, but is still easy to understand in a physiological context. This approach can help understand how the brain processes sound and may lead to new treatments for hearing loss or disorders.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called casein kinase 2 (CK-2) in regulating the mammalian circadian clock, which is the internal biological process that allows an organism to anticipate and adapt to the 24-hour day-night cycle. They found that CK-2 phosphorylates, or adds a phosphate group to, a protein called BMAL1, which is a key component of the circadian clock. This phosphorylation is controlled by a protein called CRY, which acts as a repressor, or inhibitor, of CK-2 activity. CRY binds to CK-2 and prevents it from phosphorylating BM1, creating a negative feedback loop that is integral to the circadian oscillator. The researchers also found that CRY has a dual function, not only repressing BM1-CLOCK transcription but also repressing CK-2 activity towards BM1. In mice without CRY, BM1 is hyperphosphorylated, suggesting C's role in rhythmic BM1 modification. The study shows CK-2 is not a constitutively active kinase, as previously thought, but is regulated by CRY. A model illustrates the mechanism of CK-mediated postlational loop and its role in the circadian core oscillator.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Salmonella enterica adapts to bile, a substance in the digestive system that kills bacteria. They found that bile disrupts membranes, denatures proteins, and damages DNA. To survive, Salmonella changes its gene expression, upregulating the Rpo-dependent stress response and other stress responses. The stress response is crucial, as Rpo mutants are sensitive to bile. Adaptation is not just a population response, but individual cells can become resistant without it. When a non-adapted Salmonella culture is plated on lethal bile, resistant colonies appear at a frequency of 10^-6 to 10^-7 per cell. Fluctuation analysis shows these colonies come from resistant cells in the culture. Some isolates are stable, indicating resistance can be acquired by mutation. Genome sequencing of resistant mutants shows lipopolysaccharide transport changes cause mutational resistance. However, selection on lethal bile also provides non-mutational isolates. These may come from cells in a physiological state to survive bile. This is supported by gene expression analysis: Salmonella cells activate stress genes in the absence of bile. This shows phenotypic heterogeneity in bacterial populations and adaptive value of gene fluctuations.
Researchers have discovered that the bacteriophage Mu, a virus that infects E. coli, is organized as a stable domain within the E. coli chromosome. This domain is formed by the proximity of the Mu's ends, which are 37 kilobases apart on the genome. The formation and maintenance of this domain is dependent on a strong gyrase site at the center of Mu, Mu proteins, and E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, F, and H. This domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations, but prophage lambda does not form an independent domain. Low-level transcription from phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent, promotes the establishment and maintenance of the Mu domain. The researchers propose that the domain confers transposition readiness to Mu by topological requirements of the reaction and proximity of Mu ends. The benefits to the host from a subset of proteins expressed by prophage may help its long-term stability.
Primaquine (PQ) is the only licensed drug that prevents Plasium vivax (Pv) relapses and clears mature gametocytes of Plasium falciparum (Pf). A study in Papua New Guinea investigated the effect of Q on Pv and Pf gamocyte carriage after treatment. Children received radical cure with chloroquine, artemether-lumeftrine plus Q or placebo. Blood samples were collected 2-4 weekly over 8 months. Gamocytes were detected by reverse transcription PCR targeting p25 and p25. Q reduced Pv gamocyte incidence by 73%, comparable to its effect on blood-stage infections. 92% of Pv and 79 of Pf gamocyte infections were asymptomatic. Pv gamocyte positivity and density were associated with high-stage parasite densities. Mixed-species infections had lower gamocytes than single-species for both Pv and Pf. No difference was found between Q and placebo in Pv gamocyte density or proportion of Pv infections carrying gamocytes. Relapses likely caused by hypnoite were as likely to carry gamocytes as new infections by infective bite. Relapses contributed to Pv reservoir, highlighting importance of anti-hypite treatment for control.
Researchers have studied how a family of proteins called Rho GTPases, which play a crucial role in various cellular processes such as cell migration, division, and endocytosis. These proteins, including RA, Rac, and Cdc42, have different effects on actin remodeling, but share a common mechanism of targeting the plasma membrane and activation through GTP binding. The researchers developed a framework to analyze data from these systems, revealing details of GTP cycling between the membrane and cytosol, which is key to differential regulation of these switches. Analysis of Rac cycling shows lower affinity of GDI for RacG compared to RacDP can be explained by faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. Non-steady-state solutions for membrane of GTP are presented in multidimensional charts. This methodology is applied to glucose-stimulated cycling in pancreatic β-cells, illustrating effects of Gs/Gs and affinities between Gases and membrane or GDI on bound GTP. Similar charts can be used to assess targeted modifications for altered Gase-G balance in disease scenarios. The study demonstrates R-GTP cycling can access diverse pathways in different systems through experimental manipulations.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs collect data to assess the impact of interventions and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) goals for schistosomiasis morbidity control and elimination. Typically, data are collected from school-aged children (SAC) as they are easy to sample and likely to be infected. However, adults are also likely to be infected. This study investigates how the age distribution of infection impacts mathematical model recommendations for preventive chemotherapy levels to achieve WHO goals. For moderate prevalence regions, treating only SAC may achieve goals, but for high prevalence with high adult infection, adult treatment is required. The optimal strategy for a region requires considering adult burden, not solely SAC prevalence. Past epidemiological data informed models, but more detailed data are needed to accurately determine treatment. Collecting data from a broader age range, including adults, is crucial to determine strategy. Additional data, such as individual adherence, should be collected in M&E. Including adults in treatment efforts, a large Schistoma burden remains untreated, creating a reservoir. In 2002, adults in high-risk areas and women of childbearing age were excluded from coverage. Mathematical models recommended adaptations, such as increased treatment levels or frequency. Burden in adults varies geographically, impacted by local and cultural factors, access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities. Infection profile and burden in adults varies for schosome in countries and communities. This study explores how age profiles with low to high adult burdens impact model recommendations. Collecting age-specific data, including adults, is important in M&E. SAC are likely infected due to age-related contact and absence of immunity, treatment focused on this group to prevent morbidity.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict surgery outcomes for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a disorder causing seizures. The model uses brain connectivity data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 patients with TLE and 39 healthy controls. It simulates seizure onset and location to validate the model. The model shows patients with TLE tend to switch from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls. Regions in the left hemisphere, particularly temporal and subcortical areas, are frequent starting points for seizures in patients. Contralateral and frontal regions may play a role in seizure spreading or resistance. The model predicts individualized surgery, not following a standard procedure, may lead to better outcomes than current clinical practice. This work is a step towards personalized modeling epilepsy surgery to inform treatment strategies.

The model simulates brain as a network, with regions as nodes and connections mapped through DTI. Seizure initiation and spreading can be modeled using individual connectivity. Previous studies used a subset of areas, not whole brain connectivity. The model aims to predict surgery outcomes after resective surgery, with 50-80% success rate. Hypothesis is that predictions will be in this range and subject-specific surgery will reduce seizures more than standard procedures.

The model is validated by examining initial seizure locations. In TLE, left temporal lobe seizures are expected. The top 10 nodes for patients and controls are shown in blue and red, with green in both.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) uses several strategies to evade the host's antiviral defenses, including interference with interferon and apoptotic signaling. The virus encodes four interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) that function in a dominant negative manner to block cellular IR activities and target IR-induced proteins such as p53 and TGF-β-activated Smad factors. Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which HHV-8 inactivates the pro-apopt Bcl-2 family member Bim, a key regulator of HH-8 replication, through nuclear translocation of vIR-1. Immunofluorescence and western analysis revealed vIR-1 localization in infected cells, and co-localization of vIR-1 and Bim in nuclei of lytically infected endothelial cells. Co-precipitation assays showed a direct interaction between v-1 and Bim, with v-1 B-binding residues mapped by deletion and mutagenesis. Generation of B-refactory v-1 variants revealed the importance of v-1:B interaction in prolication and anti-apopt activity. Blocking the interaction with a cell-perme peptide confirmed the relevance of v-1:B association to v- prolication. This is the first report of an IR protein interacting with a B-2 family member and sequestering B or any member as a means of inactivation. The data reveal a novel mechanism used by virus to control replication-induced apoptosis and suggest inhibiting v-1:B interaction may provide an antiral strategy.
Researchers have found that a protein called epithelial integrin, specifically αVβ6, plays a crucial role in regulating the immune response of the lung to injury and infection. This protein is important for maintaining the lung's readiness to respond to invaders. When the lung is injured, αV6 is upregulated, but its role in this process is not well understood. The study shows that upregulation of α6 during influenza infection contributes to disease. Mice lacking α6 have increased survival during infection due to reduced viral spread into the alveolar spaces, leading to less lung injury. Although α6-deficient mice have normal lungs, they have constitutively activated CD11+ alolar macrophages and elevated type I interferon (IF) signaling. This is due to loss of α6-activated growth factor (TGFβ). Administering exogenous TGF to α6 mice reduces CD11+ macrophages, type IF activity, and protective phenotype during infection. Protection extends to other respiratory pathogens like Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. The study shows loss of one epithelial protein αβ integrin alters lung environment during homeostasis and infection, leading to reduced injury and improved survival.
Researchers at a reference center in Argentina analyzed 733 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania Viia brazili, the most common species causing the disease in the Americas. The study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the Leishin Skin Test (LST), a diagnostic tool based on delayed hypersensitivity to Leish antigens, as a complement to diagnosis. The test was performed on individuals with clinically compatible lesions between 2006-2015. Results showed that 65% of cases were confirmed through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 having negative ST. Among those with negative smears, 190 were also negative by ST, but 69 had positive ST. Sensitivity of ST was similar across age groups, but lesions older than 21 days correlated with positive results for both smear and ST. These findings support the use of ST as a diagnostic complement for cutaneous leishiasis across age groups in endemic areas. The correlation with smear was high, suggesting standardization of the technique and further research into protocols will aid management of suspicious cases.
Researchers have identified a genetic mechanism that contributes to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) by studying how the body's immune cells, called macrophages, respond to a type of bad cholesterol called oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). When macrophages are exposed to oxLD, they transform into foam cells that contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. The researchers used a technique called FA-seq to map the changes in the macro's genetic material, called chromatin, after exposure to oxLD. They found that oxLD changed the structure of chrom at specific sites, which affected the expression of nearby genes involved in foam cell formation and atherosclerosis. One of these genes, PP2, is regulated by a protein called CEB-beta, which was previously not known to be involved in foam cell formation. The researchers found that a variant of the PP2 gene, rs72624, is associated with CAD risk and is located in an oxLD-induced enhancer, a site where CEB binds. The protective allele of rs72624 increased CEB binding and enhancer activity. The study also showed that the PP2 protein, L3, is present in human atherosclerotic plaques and oxLD exposure increases its expression in macroages, leading to increased degradation of pro-inflammatory mediators. This research provides a new understanding of how genetic variants contribute to CAD and highlights the importance of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving environmental stimuli. It also provides a basis for studying approaches to prevent foam cell formation and atherosclerosis.
Researchers in Malawi conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of a single round of azithromycin mass treatment in districts with a trachoma prevalence of 5.0-9% in 1-9 year olds. The World Health Organization recommends three rounds of treatment in such districts, but this may not be practical due to the large number of endemic areas and resources required. The Malawi Ministry of Health administered one round of azithycin to 8 districts with baseline prevalence 5.0-9%, achieving 80% coverage. Surveys were conducted 6 months later in 18 evaluation units of the districts. Each unit had a trach prevalence less than 5%. The study shows that one round of azycin with 80% coverage can reduce trach prevalence to less than 5% in Malawi districts with 5.0-9% prevalence. This approach may be a cost-effective way to eliminate trach in these areas.
Scientists have discovered how plants use calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPs) to trigger immune responses to pathogens. Plants have a built-in defense system to fight off infections without a specialized immune system like humans have. A specific proteins called nucleotide-binding leucine repeat (NLR) recognize pathogens and activate immune responses, including cell death, oxygen production, and changes in gene expression. Researchers found six related CPs in Arabidopsis, a plant, that mediate immune responses activated by LR proteins R2 and RPM1. The activation of CP2 by pathogen effectors controls cell death, while sustained activation of CP4, 5, and 11 directly phosphorylates transcription factors WRKY28, 48 to regulate gene expression crucial for pathogen restriction. CP2, 4, and 11 also phosphorylate membrane NAD oxidases for oxygen production. This study reveals complex mechanisms of LR immune sensors mediated by CPs with distinct specificity and dynamics.

LR proteins in plants recognize pathogen effectors to initiate immune responses, increasing calcium concentration, gene expression, and cell death. In Arabidopsis, LR2 initiates resistance to Pseudomonas syringe effector Avr2, while RPM recognizes unrelated effectors Avr1 and AvB. CP1 and 2 phosphorylate RHD and RHF in vitro, reducing ROS production in cp1, 2 mutants. Genetic evidence shows calcium signaling via CPs plays a role in diverse signaling and resistance by intracellular LR sensors.

A subgroup of WR transcription factors act with CPs in LR signaling. Sustained activation of CP4, 5, 11 phosphorylates WRKY28, 48 for gene expression, while CP2, 4, 11 phosphorylate NAD oxidases for production and cell death. LR do not directly interact with pathogens but monitor host proteins to mount responses. Avr2 degrades Arabid R4 to activate R2, while Avr1 and B induce R4 phosphorylation via kinases to initiate RPM.
Researchers in Mali used a statistical method called state-space forecasting to predict the spread of Schistosoma haobium, a parasitic disease that affects millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. They analyzed data from 1996 to 2004 in the district of Nion, Mali, and found that their predictions were accurate for up to 5 months in advance. This method can help public health programs in developing countries manage and assess the impact of the disease and interventions. It also captured interactions between the disease and factors like climate, irrigation, and public health interventions, making it a useful tool for managing Schos haob in Mali and potentially in the Sahel region.
Researchers studied how the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) interacts with host cells to infect them. CMV has a protein called pp150 that binds to cyclin A, a protein that helps cells divide, to prevent the virus from expressing its genes in the S2 phase of the cell cycle. This restriction makes cells resistant to infection. The researchers created a mutant virus that can't bind cyclin A to see what happens. Without cyclin, the virus expressed its genes in S2 and caused cells to arrest in the G2 phase, but not go into mitosis. A viral protein p21 destabilized cyclin to keep cells in G2. A double mutant with both pp and p21 unable to bind cyclin caused most cells to enter mitosis, harming cell and virus growth. This shows pp and p21 work together to keep cells in cycle and avoid cyclin to let the virus replicate.
Researchers investigated the genetic causes of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease that leads to paralysis and death. They used a targeted sequencing approach to examine 169 known ALS genes in 242 sporadic cases and 129 controls, looking for novel variants linked to the disease. The study found a significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases, suggesting they are identifying disease-causing mutations. This study highlights the use of next-generation sequencing and functional analysis to understand the genetic basis of sporadic ALS.

The researchers used a candidate approach to find new mutations in relevant ALS genes in sporadic cases and studied newly identified variants with bioinformatics and functional analysis. They found a higher burden of deleterious mutations in cases than controls, indicating novel or rare mutations in key genes may contribute to sporadic ALS. Next-generation sequencing has opened a new era in disease study, but distinguishing disease-causing from benign variants is a challenge. New approaches are needed to make sequencing results clinically informative.

Familial ALS is more homogeneous than sporadic, with 20 genes explaining 60% of cases. The study found rare or novel variants in 144 of 242 patients, suggesting at least 40% of cases have no identified genetic cause. New variants were found in ALS and associated genes, but no association with previously identified SNPs in the population, except APO. New genes were identified through trio and RRM studies.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of immune cell memory to the influenza virus. They found that IL-6 is crucial for the formation of long-term CD4 T cell memory, but not CD8 cell memory. IL-6 limits the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are a type of immune cell that can suppress other immune responses. This allows virus-specific CD4 T cells to be more active, helping to clear the virus and keep the host healthy. The study used mice with and without IL-6 and found that those without IL-6 had impaired CD4 memory, but not CD8 memory. The effect of IL-6 on CD4 and CD8 cells is not due to its ability to signal, but its ability to suppress Tregs. IL-6 has been shown to suppress Tregs in other studies. The researchers found that Tregs from mice without IL-6 were more active and suppressed virus-specific CD4 cells, but those with IL-6 were not. This supports the idea that IL-6 inhibits Tregs. The study also found that IL-6 does not affect CD4 cell survival, as there was no difference in cell death between mice with and without IL6 after infection. The main target of IL-6 in this study is Tregs, not CD4 cells, as CD8 memory is not impaired in mice without IL6.
Researchers have discovered a new function of an enzyme called enol in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, a type of amoeba that causes intestinal infections. Enol is known to convert a molecule called 2-phosphoglycerate to phospholpyruvate, a key step in glucose metabolism. However, the study found that enol also interacts with a protein called Dmt2, which adds methyl groups to DNA and RNA. This interaction was unexpected, as glycolytic enzymes like enol were thought to be only in the cytoplasm. Enol was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of the parasite and acts as an inhibitor of Dmt, reducing RNA methylation. Glucose levels control enol's activity, and when glucose is low, enol accumulates in the nucleus and forms a complex with Dnmt, reducing RNA methylation. The study also showed that enol is the first protein to interact with Dmt and that glucose metabolism affects Dmt activity. Further research is needed to understand the role of enol and Dmt in higher organisms.
Researchers have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) in the saliva of mosquitoes for the first time. miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are generally found inside cells. However, circulating miRN have been found in human serum and saliva. This study found 103 miRN in mosquito saliva, 31 of which were new. Some miRN were only present in mosquitoes infected with Chikungunya virus (CHV), a mosquito-borne pathogen. The researchers tested five of these miRN and found they play a role in CHV transmission and infection during feeding on a host. Inhibiting these mi decreased viral replication, suggesting they help CHV spread in the host. This is the first report of exogenous miRN in mosquito saliva.
Researchers have investigated the role of three proteins, Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59, in repairing damaged mitochondrial DNA in yeast cells. Mitochondria have their own DNA, separate from the cell's main DNA, which encodes proteins for energy production. Deletions in this DNA can cause inherited diseases and cancers. Most deletions are flanked by repetitive sequences, suggesting they result from recombination events. The study found that Rad51 and Rad59 are in the mitochondria's matrix and Rad51 binds to DNA. A tool was used to create a double-strand break in the mitochondrial DNA, allowing analysis of repair in yeast. Loss of these proteins decreased deletion rate and Rad51 and Rad59 impaired repair of induced breaks. This is the first study to show Rad51,52, and59 impact mtDNA repair. A system was improved to introduce a single break per genome to identify repair proteins. Mitochondrial base excision repair has been studied, showing conserved pathways exist. Evidence of homologous recombination repair in mitochondria of different species, including yeast, fruit flies, and mice. Rad51 and59 localize to mitochondria. Identifying factors interacting with Rad51,52,59 will help elucidate repair pathways. Double-strand break repair mechanisms are poorly understood, particularly in mitochondria. Homologous recombination in yeast, plant, and mammalian mtDNA has been reported, but few proteins in recombination identified. Control of break induction allowed study of mtDNA repair using genetic and molecular methods. Loss of proteins delayed break processing and deletion. Rad51 and59 in mitochondria argue effects are direct.
Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a significant global health burden, particularly among disadvantaged populations, resulting from acute rheumatic fever (AR), a complication of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection. The role of social and environmental factors in GAS infection and progression to AR/RHD is not well understood. This systematic review aimed to determine the association between social determinants of health and GAS, AR, and RHD, and the effect of interventions targeting these. Observational and experimental studies measuring crowding, dwelling, characteristics, education, employment, income, socioeconomic status, and nutrition were included. Findings were assessed against the Bradford criteria for evidence of causation. 1,164 publications were identified, 90 met criteria, comprising 91 studies, with 49% poor quality. Crowding was most assessed (14 studies GAS, 36 AR/RHD) followed by socioeconomic status (6, 36). Most studies reported a positive association with risk of GAS, AR/RHD. Crow and socioeconomic status met criteria for causation. There was substantial heterogeneity across studies. The literature lacks quality, mostly observational, not interventional. Crow as a cause of GAS and ARHD presents a target for prevention.

A systematic review of social and environmental factors for GAS, AR/RHD found only one previous study. Four reviews explored SES or poverty. This review examined socioeconomic and environmental factors GAS, AR/RHD, and interventions. PubMed, Cochr Library, Embase were searched. 3% studies showed mixed results. Socioeconomic position compared cases to non-cases was based on geographical, economic, social, or asset ownership. Socioeconomic status was in 6 studies GAS, 36 AR/RHD. This review is the most extensive on social determinants of health and GAS, ARHD. Exclusion of non-English articles and single reviewer appraisal were limitations. Positive findings were associated with publication after 1996, 100% of case studies reported at least one association, 64.9% other studies (p=0.002).
Researchers studied the Pho/PhP bacterial signaling network, a two-component system found in many bacteria. They found that a single mutation in the kinase PhQ protein, which abolishes its phosphatase activity, results in a striking change in the network's behavior. The mutant responds to stimuli in a bistable manner, meaning it has two distinct states, on and off, whereas the wild-type has a graded response. Mutant cells in these states have different morphologies and the state is inherited over generations. External conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the on state. Mathematical modeling suggests bistability depends on autoregulation of key proteins PhP and PhQ in the circuit. The mutant's characteristics come at a fitness cost, with the on state having lower fitness in rich medium. However, due to inheritance, a population of on cells can be epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state. The study demonstrates the versatility of the two-component architecture and highlights tradeoffs in the Pho/PhP system.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating a rare and deadly brain infection called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. This infection is considered rare but has a high mortality rate and no established treatment, making it devastating. To develop new treatments, scientists are repurposing existing drugs used for other diseases. Naegia fleri needs ergoster, a building block of cell membranes, to survive. Disrupting sterol synthesis with small molecules is a strategy against fungal and agricultural pathogens. The amoeba encodes ster 14-demethylase CYP51, similar to fungal targets. This raises the possibility of repurposing antifungal drugs for P treatment. 

Studies showed that antifungal drugs azoles, conazoles, affect sterol synthesis and viability of Naegia trophotes. Identified the endogenous C51 substrate by mass spectrometry of lipids. Analyzed interactions between recombinant C51 and conoles by spectroscopy and x-ray. The data validated C51 as a target in Naegleri and conoles as candidates for P treatment. Fluconazole and micon have been used with other drugs in human P patients. Sterol biosynthesis occurs in most eukaryotes, including human pathogens like fungi and freeiving amoeb. The similarity raises possibility of repur antifungal drugs and az-based P therapy for P.
Researchers studied the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4α) in the immune response to nematode infections. Nematodes trigger a protective type 2 immune response in the host, and IL-4α plays a key role in this process. However, it was not known if IL-4α is needed to maintain this response after it is established. The researchers used a special mice model where the IL-4 gene can be turned on or off at will to study this. They found that IL-α is needed to keep the type 2 immune response going and to fight off the nematode Nippostrongus brasiliensis. They also showed that if IL-α is turned off before a second infection with N. brasiliensis, the immune response is not as strong and the nematodes are not cleared as quickly. This study shows that IL-α is needed to keep the type 2 immune response going, a new function beyond its role in starting it. The type 2 response is key to fighting nemodes, and IL-α plays a crucial role in this.
Researchers have analyzed the distribution of Bartonella bacteria in mammals to understand how it has evolved and switched hosts over time, which can reveal current patterns and potential for cross-species transmission. The study used the largest collection of Bartonella glA genotypes, including 67 new genotypes, and found that the pathogen likely originated as an environmental bacterium infecting insects before mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or key hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. There is evidence of exchange between phylogenetically distant domestic and wildlife, likely due to increased contact. To protect health, care should be taken to avoid contact between humans, animals, and wildlife.

The study shows Bartonella is a system for examining impacts of humans on disease spread within and between species, across landscapes globally. Phylogenetic inferences should be interpreted with caution due to available data and taxa sampled. There may be missing links between inferred hosts not sampled. The pathogen is ideal for tracing zoonotic and impacts on native hosts. The study constructed global phylogenies of Barton from 16sRNA and citrate synth (glA) to determine evolutionary history, patterns, host switching, and spillo into humans from commals to wild.

Some host specificity of Bartonella is due to ecological factors rather than immunological incompatibility. Given diversity of zoonotic strains, including divergent with clinical presentations, physicians should consider broad hosts and Barton genotypes when investigating suspected infections. Certain species associated with humans, such as dogs, cats, cows, and rats, have brought strains globally. Rats are in the largest clade of rodent Barton (clade B. queensensis, B. elizabeth, B. triborum, B. massensis, B. rattassensis, B. inf). Humans influence on Barton categorized genotypes as found in rats, other rodents, humans, domestic, carnivores, wild, artiodactyl, wildiodact, shrews, and bats.
Long noncoding RNA MALAT plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression by controlling the expression of oncogenic transcription factor BMYB. MALAT is upregulated in cancer tissues and associated with hyperproliferation, but its underlying mechanism was poorly understood. Researchers found that MALAT levels change during normal cell cycle progression. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in human diploid fibroblasts revealed MALAT modulates expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1 and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT leads to activation of p53 and its target genes. Cell defects in MALAT-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels, indicating p53 is a major mediator of MALAT activity. MALAT-depleted cells display reduced expression of BMYB, an oncogenic factor in G/M progression, due to altered splicing of BMY preRNA and aberrant splicing. In cells, MALAT promotes proliferation by modulating expression and preRNA of cycle transcription factors. Findings provide mechanistic insights into MALAT's role in regulating proliferation. MALAT's levels during cell cycle influence expression of genes involved in progression. Depletion in human diploid fibroblasts induces DNA damage and activation of p53 and target genes. Cell defects in MAL-depleted are sensitive to p levels, indicating p53 is effector of MAL function. Mitotic defects in MAL-de suggest MAL role in mitosis via expression/preRNA of mitosis genes or defect in p-deficient cells is result of DNA stalled forks. Mitosis is most canonical pathway downregulated in MAL-de fibblasts. Abnormal MAL expression in types or tissues results in aberrant splicing leading to misexpression of cycle genes, contributing to progression. MAL may influence key regulators activator or repressor, resulting in alteration of downstream cycle genes. Observed splicing changes in regulator BMY in MAL-de. Unlike MAL-de, p or p+MAL cells responded to serum by expression of cycle genes. Results indicate p vital to G arrest in MAL-de cells.
Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating insect growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction. While its role in repressing larval metamosis is well understood, the molecular basis of its action in promoting adult reproduction is not fully elucidated. Research has shown that Methoprene (Met), the J receptor, mediates J action during metamosis and vitelogenesis, but the precise mechanism behind the latter is lacking. This study used RNA interference (RNAi) to mimic a J-deprived condition in migratory locusts and found that J stimulates DNA replication and ploidy in preparation for vitelogenesis. Two genes, Mc4 and Mc7, in the DNA replication pathway were expressed in the presence of J and Met. Depletion of Mc or Mc7 inhibited novo synthesis and ploidy, resulting in reduced vitelogenin mRNA and impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Luciferase and electrophoretic mobility assays showed Met directly regulates Mc and Mc by binding to upstream sequences with E-box or E-like motifs. This suggests the J-receptor acts on Mc and Mc to regulate replication and ploidy for vitelogenesis and oocyte maturation.
Researchers conducted a study to determine the optimal duration of prednisone treatment for lepro patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI). The study, called "Treatment Early Neurop in Lepy" (TENL), compared a 20-week and 32-week prednisone courses. 868 lepro patients with recent NFI (less than 6 months) were randomly assigned to either a 20-week or 32-week prednisone treatment. Prednisone was started at 45-60mg/day, then tapered. NFI was assessed by muscle testing and monofilament testing. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored function at 78 weeks. Secondary outcomes included Reaction Scale, SAL Scale, and Participation Scale. Results showed no significant difference between groups: 78.1% in the 20-week arm and 77.5 in the 32 arm (p=0.821). Secondary outcomes also showed no difference, except a higher adverse events in the longer arm. A 20-week predone was as effective as 32 in improving and restoring NFI in lepro patients. Twenty weeks is the preferred initial treatment for lepro neuropathy, with a minority needing individualized treatment.
Researchers studied the vocalizations of male Rocky Mountain elk and European red deer to understand how sound production relates to anatomy and physiology. They created a computer model of the larynx and vocal tract based on elk anatomy and biomechanics to simulate sound production. The model produced a range of fundamental frequencies, from 65 to 140 Hz. Low frequencies required low vocal fold strain, high lung pressure, and large glottal flow, while high frequencies needed large muscular effort and lung pressure. Glottal efficiency, the ratio of radiated sound to aerodynamic power, was higher in elk, suggesting an advantage in high-pitched signaling. This is due to lower airflow requirements and acoustic radiation at higher frequencies. Both types are used by males during mating, serving as honest signals. The low-frequency call relates to body size, high-frequency to muscular strength and endurance. Contrary to expectation, some large mammals use high-pitched vocalization. The study simulated elk and red calls with a finite model of oscillating vocal folds and larynge cartilage, applying muscle activations and vocal tract propagation to understand the system. The lnx model was based on anatomy and biomechanics of Rocky elk and red laryes. Elk vocalizations were near the top, red vocalizations near the bottom. Fold oscillation was sustained at minimum 65 Hz and maximum 140 Hz. High pressures were necessary in both, calls were uttered at high rates in both species. Efficiency of aerodynamic to acoustic energy in the larynge source differed. Production with high F0 provided an advantage.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-through sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, a technique used to map transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications. Current methods discard reads that map to multiple locations on the genome, known as multi-reads, to focus on reads that map uniquely to one location, known as uni-reads. This can omit up to 30% of alignable reads. The new approach allocates multi-read as fractional counts using a weighted scheme, increasing sequencing depth by 22-25% and 17% in STAT and GATA ChIP samples. Incorporating multi-read identifies novel peaks not detectable by uni-read and improves peak detection in mappable regions. Analysis shows multi-read peaks have similar characteristics to uni-read, but mostly reside in segmental duplications. Validation by quantitative real-time ChIP confirms novel GATA peaks and identifies target genes.
Researchers estimated the economic benefits of reaching the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) targets for four neglected tropical diseases: Chagas disease, African trypaniasis, lepro, and visceral leishias. These diseases are difficult to control and costly to manage, and mainly affect disadvantaged populations in low- and middle-income countries. The study calculated the economic benefits of avoiding productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments due to these diseases by reaching the targets. 

The researchers combined data on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments related to these diseases with projections of people suffering from each disease, country, and year 2011-2020 and 202-203. They compared an ideal scenario where the 2020 targets were met with a counterfactual scenario where the situation stayed the same as 1990. The economic benefit was the difference between the two scenarios. 

The total productivity gained for the four diseases was $23.1 billion in 201-202 and $35.9 in 202-203, corresponding to $10.7 and $16.6 billion. Reduction in out-of-pocket payments was $14 billion and $18 for the same periods. The study had limitations, such as no data for leprosy and combining data from various sources of variable quality. Despite this, the benefits of reaching targets are considerable and exceed investments by governments and partners. Given the frequency of diseases among the poorest, these investments represent good value for improving well-being and reducing inequity.
A long-held assumption in neuroscience is that highly selective neurons, which respond to a narrow range of sensory inputs, carry more information about external stimuli. In the auditory cortex, neurons initially respond to a wide range of sounds and then become highly selective in sustained responses. This has led to the idea that the first epoch encodes the presence and the second encodes content of a sound. Contrary to this, researchers found that the population conveys similar information across both epochs, despite selectivity differences. The amount of information encoded depends on the total number of spikes in the population, not selectivity. Inhomogeneous Poisson spiking behavior accounts for this property. These results suggest a new principle of encoding shared among sensory systems.

In the auditory cortex, selectivity increases as spiking evolves after sound onset. Initially, neurons respond to many sounds with high spiking rates, then settle to lower values. Adaptation leads to fewer active neurons, a sparser representation, and higher selectivity. This adaptation is shared among sensory systems. Based on selectivity, the theory posits unselective responses encode presence and selective responses encode identity. However, interpreting informativeness based on selectivity has caveats.

Current understanding of sensory processing is built on neurons responding to specific inputs. Highly selective neurons are thought to provide more information. Observations in the auditory cortex raise questions about dynamic encoding in sensory systems.
Researchers have found that a protein called OX40 plays a crucial role in controlling viral infections that persist in the body for a long time. Unlike short-term infections, where the immune system quickly clears the virus, long-term infections require the immune system to keep fighting the virus to prevent it from spreading. O40 is a co-stimulatory molecule that helps T cells, a type of immune cells, to stay active and fight the virus. Without O40, T cells fail to accumulate and the body's ability to produce antibodies and fight the virus is severely impaired. In mice without O40, the virus was not controlled over time, showing the importance of this pathway in long-term infections. 

 O40 promotes long-term survival of T cells, so researchers thought it might be more important in long-term infections. In contrast to short-term infections, O shapes both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses and antibody production in long-term infections. Mice without O40 had a severely impaired anti-viral response. While O's role in short-term infections is known, its role in long-term was unclear. O is important in driving T responses to several viruses, but dispensable in short-term LCM infection. O-deficient mice had impaired CD4 responses, but CD8 responses and virus control were unaffected. However, O's importance in long-term remained unclear. O and PD-1, another protein, correlated with O in both short and long-term infections, suggesting O's sustained expression is due to ongoing antigen recognition. O was stronger on CD4 cells, but some CD8 cells also expressed O. Findings establish O as key in sustaining cellular and humoral immunity in long-term and have implications for studying T dysfunction in humans.
Researchers have identified a remarkable example of convergent evolution in aquatic animals, where a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrates and invertebrates across three phyla. This phenomenon is distinct from the convergent evolution of morphological features like wings, where a pattern of movement occurs across a morphologically diverse set of appendages in aquatic animals. These animals swim by undulating their fins while keeping their body relatively rigid, with fins running lengthwise along the body rather than crosswise like a trout's tail. The researchers hypothesize that the regulation of optimal wavelength, elongation, and fination in these phyla may reflect common genetic networks underlying convergent evolution, as seen in electric organs. They found that the optimal wavelength maximizes force generated by the body, also maximizing swimming speed. By dividing the length of undulation along an animal's fin by mean amplitude, the result is consistently 20, called the optimal wavelength (OS). This value can predict the number of undulations along a swimming animal's fin at any velocity. The study unifies a vast diversity of swimmers, from invertebrates like cuttlefish to vertebrates cartilaginous and bony fish.
Researchers have investigated the role of condens, a class of evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, in neural stem cell (NS) divisions during cerebral cortex development. They found that two types of condens, condens I and II, are essential for NS divisions and survival in mice. Simultaneous depletion of both condens causes severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, leading to DNA damage and p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condens I and II lead to slower loss of NS, with distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation in condin II-depleted NS and mitotic delays in condin I-depleted NS. NS depleted of condin II display hyperclustering of perentric heterochatin and nucleoli, indicating condin II's role in establishing interphase architecture. These defects persist in postmit neurons. The study shows condens I and II have overlapping and non-overlapping functions in NS, providing insight into balancing acts of two condin complexes.
Researchers have studied the genetic and epigenetic changes that occur in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a type of flatworm that causes schistosomiasis in humans, as it develops from a larva to adult in a vertebrate host. This parasite is unusual because its sex is determined by a genetic system, but physical differences between males and females appear only after it infects a host. To understand how this process, the researchers compared the genetic activity of males and females at five stages of development: larva, early worm, and adult. They found 7,168 genes were different between sexes at least one stage, and 4,065 had known functions. They also looked at epigenetic marks, which are chemical changes to DNA that affect gene activity, and found differences between males and females. The study shows that sex in S. mansoni is linked to different genetic and epigenetic changes that affect how it interacts with the host and how it reproduces. These findings could lead to new targets for treating schosomiasis and understanding how the parasite develops in the host.
Researchers propose a new approach to handle disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts by assigning a confidence value to each annotation, representing the probability of its correctness. They developed two probabilistic models to estimate individual annotator certainty and tested them on a dataset of 10,000 sentences annotated by eight experts, with a 1,000 sentences further annotated by five new experts. The approach significantly increases the probability of choosing the correct annotation even in the worst-case scenario where all annotators disagree. A corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated in several dimensions is made publicly available. The study aims to quantify certainty in individual annotations for a group of annotators, retaining the dataset for training and testing machine learning methods. Two probabilistic models are introduced based on the corpus, validated with a second annotation cycle by five new annotators on a 1,000-sentence subset. The goal is to generate a manually annotated corpus for training computers to perform tasks at scale.
Researchers have developed a new approach to produce antiviral antibodies to protect against hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a deadly disease caused by Andes virus (AND) and related viruses in South America. They used a DNA vaccine platform in geese to produce antibodies, which can be purified in high concentrations from egg yolks. The geese were vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding AND virus glycoproteins and developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies, which lasted over a year. A booster vaccination resulted in extremely high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Analysis showed the antibodies were highly reactive to specific amino sequences of AND glycoprote. The researchers tested the ge-derived antibodies in a hamster model of lethal HPS and found they protected 8/8 and 7/8 hamsters when administered post-exposure. In contrast, all hamsters receiving normal ge antibodies or no treatment developed HPS. This demonstrates the DNA/goose platform can produce a candidate antiral product preventing lethal disease when administered post-exposure.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Dmta enzyme in cancer development by studying its effects on DNA methylation patterns in a mouse model of lung cancer. Dmta is responsible for establishing normal methylation patterns, and mutations in Dmt have been linked to leukemia. Deleting Dmt in a mouse model of lung cancer led to tumor progression, suggesting it might suppress development by stabilizing methylation. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing showed profound methylation changes in K-as-induced lung cancer. Dmt-type tumors had large hypomethyl domains in nuclear-associated regions, while Dmt-deficient tumors were uniformly hypomethylated. Further analysis revealed Dmt maintains methylation of active chromosome domains and Dmt-deficient tumors showed deregulation in these domains. The study defines features of cancer methylomes and Dmt's role in maintaining methylation in cancer.
Researchers have studied the neural activity patterns in the premotor cortex of songbirds to understand how they generate sequences of neural activity that control singing. They used multi-electrode recordings and calcium imaging to find that activity in this area is organized on a scale of 100 micrometers. Within this scale, basal ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons fire at a specific phase of a 30 Hz rhythm. This shows that premotor activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, and a mesoscopic pattern underlies the generation of neural sequences controlling song. 

In songbirds, the relationship between time and space in premotor area HVC is neither random nor globally organized as a wave, but clustered on 100 micrometer scale. A 30 Hz rhythm in local field potential correlated with inhibition of one neuron type, HX, and this rhythm is coherent over scale matching projection calcium activity. This suggests a microcircuit where multiple excitatory neurons drive interneurons. Inhibitory show pattern activity throughout song, whereas projection fire spars, with events correlated between neighbors. This suggests a microc where pools of excitatory drive interne populations.
Researchers have identified 64 genes in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans that are essential for development and also extend lifespan when inactivated. These genes are highly conserved from yeast to humans and play a role in insulin, metabolic, translation, RNA, and chromatin pathways. Many of these genes extend lifespan as much as the strongest regulators of aging. Early inactivation of these genes causes growth arrest at larval stages, and some animals live longer than wild-type adults. The gene daf-16 is required for survival of arrested larvae, suggesting increased longevity is a response to gene inactivation. Insulin-signaling plays a role in regulation of aging at any stage of life. 

The study screened 2,700 genes essential for C. elegans development and found 64 that extend lifespan when inactivated. These genes are conserved from yeast to humans and involved in insulin, metabolic, translation, RNA, and chromatin pathways. Many extend lifespan as much as strongest regulators of aging. Early inactivation causes growth arrest at larval stages and some live longer than wild-type adults. d-16 is required for survival of arrested larvae, suggesting increased longevity a response to inactivation. Insulin-signaling plays role in aging at any stage.
Researchers have identified a critical step in the process of zebraf fin regeneration: the creation of a specialized epidermis that guides growth from underlying tissue. They performed a genetic screen to find mutations that block this process and found a temperature-sensitive allele of lamin beta 1, a component of the extracellular matrix, that prevents regeneration. Lamin beta 1, not its paralog, is induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation and is required to establish a polarized epithelial layer. This leads to expression of morphogenetic factors, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Ig1, patterning of osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. Lamin 1 is dispensable for juvenile growth, homeostatic tissue, adult maintenance, repair of fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblast. Mutations or transgenic receptor inhibition disrupt lamin 1 expression, linking growth factor to epithelial maturation during regeneration. The study reveals induction of lamin 1 in epithelial cells as a key step in formation of signaling-competent epidermis.
Researchers compared different methods for accounting for relatedness in genome-wide association studies using family data, specifically linear mixed models (LMM) approaches. Several LMM software packages have been developed, but it's unclear how they differ from previous implementations. They applied LMM to a genome-wide study of visceral leishiasis in 348 Brazilian families (362 individuals, 197 genotyped) and compared results to traditional family-based tests and alternative approaches. The LMM approaches showed strong concordance and controlled genome-wide error, except for some when applied to longitudinal data with repeated measures. They also correlated with alternative approaches, apart from transmission-based when SNPs had small or no effects. LMM performed well compared to competing methods, with concordance in most applications, making implementation choice based on speed and ease-of-use rather than power error considerations.

The study used real and simulated data from a genome association study of visceral leishias in 348 families (363 individuals, 197 with genotype and phenotype). The Brazilian data was used with a larger case-control set by Fola et al. The analysis was computationally convenient in L software, but slow in standard software like GWAS. The results relate to genotypes from a single data set, a Brazilian study of leishias.

The performance of LMM and alternative approaches were compared through application to real and simulated data from the Brazilian data. Kinship between individuals were estimated prior to fitting linear model on genome data, rather than theoretical values. Fitting a linear model for each SNP across genome was computationally challenging.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that inhibit the growth of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, in mammalian cells. A 200-compound library was screened using a recombinant T. cruzi strain expressing β-galactosidase. Three compounds, P1, NT, and CX, were selected for their high activity against T. cruz and low toxicity to host cells in vitro, with IC50 values of 54, 190, and 23 nM, respectively. Each compound has a different mechanism of action on intracellular T. cruz amigotes: CX shows trypanocidal activity, essential for chronic stage development, NT has tryostatic effect, and P1 affects division. These compounds also show activity against intracellular T. cruz from Y strain and related species Leishmania and L. Characterization of anti-T. cruz activity led to selection of two compounds with IC values 2M, P6 and CX, 100 times lower than current medicines. This provides new candidates for treatments against Chagas and leishiasis.
Researchers have developed a new, portable diagnostic tool for detecting Brugia parasites in mosquitoes, which cause lymphatic filariasis. The tool, called "Backpack PCR," uses a simple DNA extraction method and a test-based detection system, making it suitable for use in resource-limited areas. Traditional DNA extraction methods are time-consuming and expensive, requiring thermal cyclers or real-time instruments, which are not available in many endemic locations. The new platform combines a rapid NaOH DNA extraction with a battery-powered PCR and test-based detection, allowing for field use in minimal settings. The team compared the new method to standard column-based extraction and real-time PCR, finding it to be sensitive and specific. They also compared it to conventional PCR and gel electrophoresis, demonstrating its effectiveness. By using a miniaturized PCR, they showed the platform can be used at the point-of-collection, fitting in a small backpack. This eliminates reliance on expensive equipment without compromising detection sensitivity, providing an alternative to column-based extractions requiring infrastructure. The system increases feasibility of molecular monitoring in B. malayi-endemic areas and provides a framework for detecting W. bancfti, responsible for 90% of global burden.
Researchers have studied the self-assembly of elastom proteins, which are proteins that can stretch and recoil like rubber. These proteins are made up of repeating units called domains that provide elasticity and help the assembly process, and cross-linking elements that stabilize the structure. Changes in the number and arrangement of these domains affect the assembly and properties of the protein. A new computer model was created to simulate the self-assembly of these proteins with different architectures. The model showed that the size and number of domains can impact the structure and integrity of the protein. For example, proteins with more cross-link elements and smaller domains were more stable. This study provides insights into how elastom proteins evolved and can help design new materials with similar properties. Elastom proteins are made of alternating domains that provide elasticity and cross-link elements that stabilize the structure. A computer model was created to simulate the assembly of these proteins with different architectures. The model showed that the size and number of domains affect the structure and stability of the protein. For example, proteins with more cross-link elements and smaller domains were more stable. This study helps understand how elastom proteins evolved and can design new materials with similar properties.
Researchers have investigated the role of the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) in the Ebola virus genome, which are longer than most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. They found that the 5-UTRs do not function as internal ribosomal entry sites, but instead regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a reporter gene. The 5-UT from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation compared to a beta-actin 5-UT. The 5-UT has four upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and ablating each uUG enhanced translation of the primary open reading frame (ORF), most dramatically in the case of the L5-UT. The uUG was sufficient to initiate translation, surrounded by a weak Koz sequence and suppressed ORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where e2 was phosphorylated, the presence of uOR maintained translation of LOR, indicating u modulates translation in response to cellular stress. To address the role of u in virus replication, a recombinant Ebola was generated with the u mutated to UCG. Mutating two nucleotides outside previously-defined protein and cis-regulatory sequences attenuated virus titers 10-100 lower than wild-type in Vero A549 cells. The mutant also exhibited RNA synthesis as early as 6 post-infection and sensitivity to stressor thapsargin. These data identify mechanisms by which Ebola regulates polymerase expression and demonstrate relevance to replication and a potential therapeutic target.
Researchers have developed a new method to map double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the human genome, which are breaks in the DNA that can lead to cancer and other diseases. They found that these breaks are not random, but occur in specific areas called domains, about 50-250 kilobases long, scattered along chromosomes. About 30% of these domains have genes that are turned on or off together, and the proteins PAR1 and HNPA2B1 bind to the ends of these domains. This suggests a new way genes are regulated by being turned on or off in groups, with breaks in the DNA and these proteins binding sites. This is important for understanding how chromosomes are organized and how genes are turned on or off, which can help with cancer and gene therapy.

The study found that breaks in DNA are not just random, but occur in specific areas that are protected from fragmentation. They also found that some of these areas have genes that are turned on together, suggesting a new way genes are regulated in groups. The proteins PAR1 and HN2B1 bind to the ends of these areas, which could influence how genes are turned on or off. This is a clue to how chromosomes are organized and how genes are regulated, which is important for understanding cancer and gene therapy.

The researchers also found that these breaks could be fragile sites in chromosomes, and their method can be used to study fragile sites in many types of human cells. The proteins PAR and HN2B have not been known to work together before, but H2 is known to interact with a protein that fixes DNA breaks. This study shows that H2 binds to thousands of sites in the genome, which can help understand its role in chromosome function.
Researchers studied trypanosomat infections in bats from two areas with different levels of preservation in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They analyzed 181 bat specimens from Reserva Ecológica Guçu (REG) and Estação Florestal Mata Atlântica (EFMA) and found 24 infected individuals (13%) with trypanosomatids. The most common parasite detected was Trypanosoma dionii (54%), followed by T. cruzi DTI and TIV and Tryosoma sp. in Neotropical phlost bats. Mixed infections were also observed. T. cruz DTI and TIV are involved in acute Chagas disease cases in Brazil and T. dionii was found in an infected child's heart. A new parasite, Crithidia mellific, was discovered infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas. Bats from the Atlantic Forest harbor a great diversity of trypanids, maintaining tryosid diversity in the sylvatic environment.
Ticks are the most common arthropod vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe, and Ixodes ricinus is a key species that transmits many bacteria, viruses, and parasites. These ticks can be co-infected with multiple pathogens, increasing the likelihood of transmission to humans or animals. However, little is known about co-infection rates and most studies focus on well-known pathogens. Ticks also carry symbionts that play roles in tick biology and may interfere with pathogen transmission. This study evaluated the prevalence of 38 pathogens and symbionts and co-infections, as well as interactions between pathogens and symbion. 267 Iodes ricinus females were collected in the Ardennes and analyzed for 37 pathogens by high-throughput real-time PCR, Tick-borne encephalitis virus by RT-PCR, and symbion by nested PCR. Results showed 45% of ticks were co-infected, carrying up to five pathogens. Adding symbion prevalence, all ticks were infected with at least one microorganism, up to eight in one tick. Interactions between pathogens suggested a strong association between Borrelia garini and B afii, no interactions between symbion and pathogens. This study reveals high pathogen co-infection rates, raising questions about co-transmission to humans and animals, and health consequences. High symbion coexistence with pathogens opens avenues for research on effects on pathogen transmission and vector competence.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how hematopoietic stem cells decide to become either erythroid or myeloid cells. This decision is governed by a genetic switch involving two master genes, PU.1 and GATA-1. Prior to commitment, these genes are expressed at low levels, a "primed" state. The model shows that mutual antagonism and autoregulation between these genes makes the system bistable, allowing for robust lineage determination. A new mechanism involving a cofactor regulated by one of the master genes is necessary for bistability and switch-like behavior. Suppressing the cofactor can lead to loss of cooperativity and a primed state. The PU.1-GATA switch also interacts with another antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which reinforces the decision through feedback loops, making it irreversible. This switch is an example of a network implementing both primed and committed states through cofactor recruitment. Perturbing feedback between regulators and targets suggests reprogramming strategies. The approach can aid lineage studies and search for determining genes.
Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen, has high resistance to lysozym, a key effector of the innate immune system, due to a complex network of transcription regulators and genes oat, pgA, dlt, and sig. Researchers sought to identify genes modulating E. faalis resistance to lyzym. Random transposon mutagenesis in a quadruple oat/pgA/dlt/sig mutant led to identification of insertions in the enteroccal polyschar antigen (EPA) region, downstream of conserved epA-ep genes, proposed to encode core machinery. The PA region was thought to be responsible for EPA decoration, but its role was unknown. This study shows EPA decoration contributes to resistance to antimicrobials and virulence in zebraf model by conferring resistance phagocytosis. Results indicate production of EPA backbone is not sufficient for E. faalis infections, revealing an essential role of modification for enteroccal pathogenesis. Several genes contributing to EPA decoration play a role in resistance to innate system and virulence. Deletion of pgA in L monocogen is associated with 32-fold decrease in resistance. Transposon mutagenesis of OP strain showed disruption of genes encoding EPA decoration increases E fa resistance lyzym. In-frame deletion in wild-type background had same effect. Contribution of oat, pgA, dlt, and sig to lyzym resistance was carried out using E fa J2 as background, avirulent in zraf model. Mapping transon sites revealed 16 insertions downstream conserved epAep region, encoding core apparatus producing EPA. Region displays variability and proposed responsible for EPA decoration. This study shows quadruple mutant oat/pgA/dlt/sig still high resistance lyzym compared to Firmutes.
Researchers have developed a new model called RER to analyze how genes are regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a type of blood cancer. This model combines data from two large databases: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). These databases contain information on genetic and epigenetic factors that affect gene expression, such as copy number variation, DNA methylation, transcription factors, and microRNA post-transcription regulation. The new model, RER, infers sample-specific regulatory activities of transcription factors and microRNAs, which are then used to infer their interactions. This two-stage framework overcomes a challenge of integrating generic cell-line data from ENCODE with sample-specific TC measurements. The researchers tested R on AML data from TC and related binding data from K562 cells in EN. They verified the model's accuracy with 10-fold cross-validation and showed it outperformed existing methods in detecting microRNA/transcription factor targets. Additionally, they identified 18 regulators whose activities clustered with cytogenetic risk and one, miR-548, which targets were enriched in leukemia-related pathways, suggesting its role in AML pathogenesis. Survival analysis using inferred activities as a potential AML prognostic marker. The study provides a framework that integrates TC and EN data, revealing AML regulatory program at a global level.
Researchers studied the role of RNA interference (RNAi) in the fungus Colletotrichum higginsum, a pathogen that infects various crops worldwide. They created mutants lacking genes for three key RNAi proteins: RDR, DCL, and AGO. The mutants grew normally on regular and minimal media, but showed defects in producing spores and spore morphology. The team analyzed RNA and small RNA populations in parental and mutant strains, finding greatest effects in Δcl, ΔclΔcl, and Δago strains. A previously unknown virus, Colotrichum higginsum non-segmented RNA virus 1 (ChV1), was repressed in these mutants. Phylogenetic analysis showed ChV is related to segmented viruses. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs with AG1 showed abundant 5'U-containing siRNAs. Higginsum and Δcl strains cured of ChV showed spore and morphology defects were caused by ChV. RNAi involving DCL and AG in C is proposed as an antiviral mechanism.
Researchers have studied the role of histone acetyltransferase MOF in meiotic expansion of H2 phosphorylation during spermatogenesis in mice. They found that MOF is involved in all three waves of H2 phosphorylation, which occur during different stages of meiotic prophase. The first wave is ATM-dependent and occurs at leptotene, the second and third are ATR-dependent at zygot and pachene, respectively. The third wave marks unsynapsed chromosomes. MO deletion in spermatocytes caused loss of H4ac and H2 phosphorylation in leptene and zgot spermatocytes. In almost 40% of early-mid pachene spermatocytes, H2 and M1 were detected along unsyn axes but failed to expand, causing meiotic sex inactivation failure. MO also facilitates meiotic double-strand break repair after RAD51 recruitment. The study shows MO regulates meiosis and expansion of H2 phosphorylation from lept to pene stages initiated by ATM and ATR.
Researchers studied the effects of Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) on the development of T-cells in the immune system. They used a special mice model called "Immune System" Rag-2/-c/-, which has a weakened immune system. The mice were infected with HT-1 at an early stage when three types of T-cells were present. The virus was found in T-cells in all infected mice and increased over time. In infected mice, T development was altered, with more mature T-cells and fewer immature ones. Mature T-c accumulated in the spleen and were activated, shown by a marker CD25. This was linked to the presence of Tax and increased expression of anti-apoptotic gene bfl-1 in T-cells. Lymphoma and leukemia were found in infected mice several months after infection. These results show the potential of the model to study the initial steps of leukemogenic process by HT-1.

HT-1 infection expanded mature T-cells in the periphery of infected mice. Tax activated genes involved in survival and proliferation in the thym of infected mice, favoring expansion of mature T-cells. A correlation was found between proviral load and alterations of T development in infected mice. CD4 and CD8 expression was analyzed on T-c of less mature and more mature subpopulations in mock and infected mice with low and high proviral load. Mature-c predominated over immature in mice with high proviral load, indicating HT-1 perturbs T development at immature level, propelling towards mature stages. Increased transcription of b-1 was found in T of infected mice. Mature-c accumulated in thym and spleen of infected and increased CD25 CD+ T-cells. Pathological features in some mice might be related to disturbances of T development by HT- infection.
In Sudan, schistosomiasis remains a major public health concern, particularly Schistosoma haematium infection. An integrated control program was implemented in Jabal locality, White State, Sudan from 2009-2011. The study aimed to reduce the disease prevalence of schosomiasis among 482,902 residents, with 78,615 primary school students as the main target group. Urine and stool specimens were examined using sedimentation and Kato-Kato-Katz methods to assess the prevalence of S. haematium and S. mansoni at baseline and follow-up. The prevalence of S. haematium decreased from 28.5% to 13.5% after 6-9 months post-treatment, with higher reduction in girls and rural residents compared to boys and urban. Health education increased awareness about schosiasis, and a water facility was built in Alida village, reducing infection rates compared to a neighboring village. However, S. mansoni prevalence remained unchanged. Approximately 200,000 received praziquantel therapy, education, or clean water. The project achieved a 50% reduction in S. haematium prevalence.
Researchers have discovered that the matrix protein of the Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, plays a crucial role in viral budding by trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Unlike other paramyxiruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm, NiV's matrix protein was found in the nucleus early stages of infection before localizing to the plasma membrane. Mutations in the bipartite nuclear localization signal and leucine-rich nuclear export signal in Ni-M impaired its trafficking and abolished budding. A conserved lysine residue in the NLS mediated nuclear import and was also a site for monoubiquination regulating export. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV budding, while depletion of ubiquitin blocked it. Live NiV budding was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, with an IC50 of 2.7nM, a concentration achievable in humans. This suggests a potential therapeutic target for acute Ni infection.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how non-enveloped viruses, such as poliovirus, enter and deliver their genetic material into cells. These viruses are difficult to study because their entry mechanisms are not well understood due to technical challenges in visualizing the process and distinguishing between productive and non-productive pathways. The new method combines live-cell imaging of viral capsid and genome with infectivity assays to track early events in poliovirus infection. The study found that polirus genome release is efficient and rapid, not limiting overall infectivity or infection rate. The virus binds to cell surface receptors and enters through a clath, caveolin, flotillin, and microtubule-independent, but tyrosine and actin-dependent endocytic mechanism. After internalization, genome release occurs from vesicles or membrane invaginations within 100-200 nm of plasma membrane. This settles debate on whether polirus directly breaks membrane or relies on endocyt to deliver genome into cell. The method is expected to be applicable to other nonvelop viruses.
Dengue fever remains a significant public health concern in Cambodia, particularly affecting children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDC) relies heavily on education as a means of prevention and control, delivering it to communities and schools. An ethnographic study conducted in 2003-2004 in eastern Cambodia explored the approaches used in education and their effectiveness in controlling deng. Community education is provided through health centre activities and campaigns, but is underfunded and irregular; school education is limited in time and lacks follow-up. As a result, adherence is partial.

Health education plays a key role in informing people to prevent and participate in controlling deng, but in resource-poor countries, efficacy is complicated by economic and infrastructural factors. In Cambodia, deng education through outreach and school programs is insufficient and underfunded. This doesn't mean a reduced need for education, however. Local control activities involving members through education in community and schools can reduce deng, but this can't occur where education is poorly resourced and knowledge isn't translated to practice.

Two factors impact outreach: political commitment and resources. We explore input and effectiveness of community and school education to address this gap. Challenges facing deng control in Cambodia are elucidated. No specific model was used for health activities or education; strategy and content included various activities, information and practices to reduce deng and mortality. Community education is through radio, television, billboards, banners, posters, and leaflets. Existing deng materials must be redefined practical and relevant. Little training in health education for practitioners, they lack skills and perceive education not part of work.
Researchers have identified circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes, parasites that cause chronic and debilitating diseases in humans and animals, in the bloodstream of infected hosts. Using a novel technology, they found over 200 miRNA sequences of nematode origin in Dirofia imis-infected dog plasma and 21 in Onchocerca volulus-infected human serum. Two miRNAs, mi-71 and mi-34, were detected in D. imis-infected dog plasma and discriminated infected from uninfected samples. However, miRNA numbers did not correlate with microfilaria (mf) counts. This may be due to imprecision in mf counts or mi contributions from unknown number of adult worms. Parasite-derived miRNAs were found in plasma or serum of species that do not live in the bloodstream. A large number of candidate miRNAs were found in mammalian hosts infected with several filarial nematodes, 245 in D. imis-infected dog plasma and 261 in B. pangi-infected dog. RT-qPCR assays were developed to discriminate infected from uninf samples, but did not reflect mf counts. B. pangi adults live in lymphatic vessels, while O. volulus life stages do not have direct contact with blood. Two miRNAs, mi-71 and mi-34, were detected in all D. imis-infected dogs and previously reported in whole worm extracts.
Researchers have created a detailed model to study how a type of enzyme called Src kinase changes shape when it becomes active. Src kinases play a key role in cell signaling, helping cells communicate with each other. The change from inactive to active state involves significant changes in shape. The team built a simplified model of the active part of the enzyme, called the catalytic domain, using structures of two stable states. They simulated the shape changes between these states and mapped the energy landscape of possible shapes. Two main paths for activation were found. In the first, interactions between a specific parts of the enzyme changed together. In the second, a part of the enzyme unfolded. The team also looked at how a specific part, the α helix, and activation loop, interacted. They tested a statistical model to see if it could explain the changes in shape. The results provide a framework for understanding how Src changes shape when it becomes active.
Researchers have identified the genetic basis of lethality in offspring from crosses between Arabidopsis thaliana plants with different numbers of chromosomes. They found a single gene, TT2, which is active in the mother plant, controls the viability of offspring with extra chromosomes. Mutations in TT2 reduced lethality in offspring from crosses with extra chromosomes. The gene TT2 also affects the formation of cells in the endosperm, the part of the seed. The study suggests that lethality in offspring with extra chromosomes can evolve quickly due to single gene mutations. The mother's gene TT2 plays a role in preparing the offspring for the extra chromosomes, making them viable. The research shows that lethality in offspring is a barrier to speciation, or the formation of new species, in plants. 

The study found a single gene, DSL1, which is linked to TT2, and affects lethality in offspring with extra chromosomes. Mutations in DSL reduced lethality in offspring. The gene is active in the mother and affects the formation of cells in the endperm. The study suggests lethality in offspring with extra chromosomes can evolve quickly due to single mutations. The mother's gene TT2 prepares offspring for extra chromosomes, making them viable. The research shows lethality in offspring is a barrier to speciation, or new species formation in plants.
Researchers studied the co-evolution of bacteria and their hosts in bats and rodents using Bartonella and Leptira as models. They analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes in 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella in 38 rodents, and 26 Leptira in 20 bats. The results showed that Bartonella and their bat hosts had a significant co-evolutionary fit, meaning they evolved together over time. Bartonella and rodent hosts also had a strong pattern of co-speciation, meaning they evolved together. However, Leptira and bats did not have a significant co-evolution, meaning they did not evolve together. Separate analysis of New and Old World data showed the same results. Event-based phylogeny was used to reconstruct evolutionary histories of each pathogen and host. Leptira bats had the most host switches, while Bartonella had the fewest. Bartonella in bats and rodents had co-evolution with minimal host switching, while Leptira bats had no congruence with host and many switches. Differences in disease transmission and host ecology may explain these co-evolution patterns. Understanding co-evolution and host-switching will help predict spillo between mammal reservoirs and humans.
Researchers have developed a new framework to understand how animals like fish and eels move through the water using a "undulatory" motion. This motion involves a wave-like movement of the body that creates forward motion. The question is whether muscle contractions or the fluid around the animal cause this movement is key to understanding how animals swim. A forced oscillation framework was applied to a chain model of undulatory swimming to see how forcing leads to movement. The study found that muscle contractions trigger the first movements of the body, which cause forward motion. Simple patterns can create complex movements that lead to swimming. The frequency of muscle contractions relative to the natural movement of the system is important for the shape of the body during swimming. This approach also helps understand the best movement for fast swimming. Results from a chain model were confirmed by computer simulations. Previous findings on the best stiffness for speed are explained.

A chain model of undulatory swimming was used to study how movement emerges from forcing. The system is forced by muscles, fluid, or both. Deformations from muscles and fluid are not separated. The system is forced by muscles, fluid, or both. A framework was applied to undulatory to understand movement from muscular and environmental forcing. For muscle activation, the frequency of the system is important for body shape. Quantitatively, how muscle work is used in deformation and dissipated into fluid is shown. A expression for swimming velocity is derived from equations.

Movement of undulatory swimmers starts from muscle activation. Two issues are in undulatory. First, muscle to deformation. Second, deformation to movement. The forced oscillation formulation is presented, then used to generate motion. Examples of active and passive swimming are presented, including typical motions involve lower modes. Power transfer during swimming is discussed.
Researchers have found that genetic recombination between the parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals can create new strains of the human pathogen responsible for sleeping sickness in Africa, known as African Trypanosomias or HAT. This is similar to how the pandemic H1N1/09 flu virus emerged from a mix of swine and human influenza viruses. They investigated if recombination between subspecies of T. brucei from humans and animals could generate new strains of the human pathogen T. rhodesense (T) responsible for HAT in East Africa. A single gene, SRA, is responsible for human infectivity in T and can be transferred to the animal pathogen T by reproduction. They tracked the inheritance of S in crosses of T and T set up by co-transmitting genetically-engineered trypan lines through tse flies. S was transferred into new backgrounds by reproduction between T and T, creating new strains of the path T. There was no evidence of reduced growth or transmissibility in hybrid trypanosomes carrying S. Expression of S is crucial for survival of T in the host, but the gene exists as a single copy in representative T strains. S was found on homologue IV in most T isolates, but Ugandan T had S on both homologues. Mobility of S by recombination explains genetic variability of T in Africa. New strains of path T are generated by recombination with animal-infect trypanosomes, posing a risk for future outbreaks of H.
Researchers studied how electrical connections between cells in the pancreas, called gap junctions, affect insulin production in people with neonatal diabetes. They found that reduced gap junctions lead to increased calcium and insulin release in response to high glucose. This is opposite of what happens in healthy people, where gap junctions suppress insulin release at high glucose levels. The team used a computer model to predict how gap junction affects calcium and insulin in people with different mutations that cause neonatal diabetes. They found that reducing gap junction can recover calcium and insulin in people with certain mutations. The model also showed that noise, or randomness, plays a role in this recovery. The study provides new understanding of how the pancreas works as a system and how gap junctions contribute to diabetes. It suggests new treatment options for neonatal diabetes and other forms of diabetes caused by genetic mutations. In the absence of gap junction, calcium has been shown to increase, which can improve pancreas function in people with certain mutations. The study compared a computer model of pancreas activity and insulin to measurements in people with different mutations and gap levels. Gap junction strongly suppresses calcium and insulin in people with certain mutations, and recovery can be achieved with reduced coupling. The model predicted recovery for many mutations, including KCNJ and AB8, which cause neon diabetes.
Researchers have developed a framework to predict the behavior of complex gene networks by accounting for a phenomenon called retroactivity, which affects how a module's performance changes when connected to other modules. The framework uses three matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which can be calculated from measurable parameters like dissociation constants and promoter concentrations. Internal retroactivity measures the effect of connections within a module on its dynamics, while scaling and mixingactivity describe how connections between modules affect each other's dynamics. By analyzing modules in isolation, the framework can accurately predict how they interact. The researchers applied this to common network motifs like autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, toggle, and single motif. They also created a metric to measure a module's robustness to connections with other modules, useful for evaluating natural networks and designing synthetic systems to minimize retroactivity.
Researchers have studied the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the human X and Y chromosomes, a region that has undergone rapid evolution and is essential for proper separation of X and Y chromosomes during meiosis. They found that the PAR with the highest crossover rate, PAR1, has a 17-fold higher rate than the genome average. However, the mechanism of this high crossover is unknown. A study in mice suggested that crossovers in PAR may be independent of the protein PRDM9, which localizes crossovers in autosomes. To investigate recombination in this region, researchers created a fine-scale map of crossovers using African-American pedigrees and analyzed recombination rates from linkage disequilibrium in human populations. They also identified PRDM binding sites in human cells. Contrary to mice, PRDM does not localize recombination in human PAR. Instead, recombination is a rapid and intense driver of evolution in PAR. Hotspots differ among human populations and have changed between human and chimpanzee, with no shared hotspots.
Researchers have identified a new form of the histone demethylase enzyme JMJD2/KDM4, called Δ-JM2, that plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle differentiation. In muscle cells, specific genes are silenced by epigenetic modifications, including histone H3 methylation. The promoter of the gene encoding myogenic factor myogen (My) is repressed, which is key for muscle initiation. The mechanism of H3 demethylation at My promoter is unclear. ΔM2 increases during differentiation of C2 myoblast into myotubes. Genome-wide expression and siRNA knockdown indicate ΔM is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific expression. Moreover, ΔM promotes MyD conversion of NIH3T cells into muscle cells. ChIP-chip analysis shows Δ binds mainly to transcriptional control genes and this is linked to activation. Δ is recruited to My promoter at onset. This binding is essential to demethyl H3me and Hme. The induction of ΔM is crucial for muscle by removing repressive chromatin marks at My promoter, promoting My expression and contributing to muscle-specific expression.

A genome-wide approach shows Δ acts as coactivator for many genes during muscle differentiation. Δ binds to My promoter to regulate H methylation, allowing My expression and myot differentiation. To investigate JM2 role in muscle, expression was characterized in mouse myoblast line C2, extensively used as skeletal model. Premature entry into differentiation and undifferentiated cells is tightly controlled during development and regeneration. demylation H3 at mylast-myube depends on Δ since accurate My induction H was not observed in depleted cells. Δ lacks demase, must recruit H9-specific demase. Δ regulates H9 methylation and acetylation at muscle promoters such as My during differentiation.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is a global effort to eradicate Guinea worm disease (GWD), one of the two neglected tropical diseases targeted by the World Health Organization (WHO). The program is in its final stages, with only 25 cases reported in 2016, but eradication requires certification by WHO of absence of transmission in all countries. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of GWEP when cases are low and cost per case is high. Using data from GW, we estimate costs of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages, and model cost-effectiveness from 1986-203. We compare GW to two scenarios: doing nothing since 1986 and control (surveillance and response 2016-203). Results show GW cost $11.95 (4.70-12.49) per case averted 198-203, and $0.004-0.5 per capita per year for pre-cert and certification. GW is more cost-effective than control by 203, and certainly cost-effective if willing to pay $0.10 per year of life without GWD risk. Even if costs double, GW is still cost-effective relative to nothing. Whether GW is most-effective depends on time horizon.
Researchers studied the protein BB32 from the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, to understand how it evades the human immune system's complement system. They found that the carbox-terminal part of BB32, called BB32-C, binds to and inhibits the serine protease of the classical complement pathway, C1. They then looked at similar proteins from related to BB32 in other Lyme disease-causing bacteria, B afii and Bgarin, and found that they also bind to C1 and inhibit the complement. However, one of these proteins, B19, was less effective at inhibiting the complement. To understand why, they created a new protein that combined parts of BB32 and B19, and solved the structure of BB32 to 1.7 angstrom resolution. It has an anti-parallel four-helix fold with a protruding alpha-helix. The structure showed that parts of BB32 important for binding to C1 are on the surface. They also found that BB32 only binds to C1 with the serine protease domain. This study improves understanding of how BB32 inhibits C1 and how Lyme disease-causing bacteria evade the immune system.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the fungus Candida albicans, a common human pathogen, changes from a harmless to disease-causing form. This change involves a protein called F2, which is regulated by two kinases, Cdc28 and C1. Normally, F2 helps cells grow and divide, but when Candida albicans becomes pathogenic, its F2 is modified by C28 and C1, changing its function. This modification allows F2 to promote genes involved in disease-causing processes, such as interacting with the host and forming biofilms. Without this modification, Candida alb fails to cause disease. F2 also interacts with another protein, Pob, in a way that depends on its modification by C28 and C1. This interaction helps F2 target the right genes for modification. The study found that F2's modification is not just for cell growth, but also for disease-causing processes.
Researchers have found that the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) is essential for the growth and infectivity of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei in a mouse model. TK catalyzes the formation of dTMP and dUMP and is one of several salvage enzymes that appear to be redundant to the de novo pathway. Surprisingly, analysis of TK null and RNA cells showed that it is required for growth and infectivity. Unlike humans and other kinetoplastids, T. bruce lacks dCMP deaminase (DD), which provides an alternative to dUMP formation. Ect expression of human DD resulted in rescue of the RNA growth phenotype and selection of viable null cells. Metabolite profiling by LCMSMS revealed a buildup of deoxyrimidine nucleides in depleted cells. Knock of cytidine deaminase (DA), which converts deoxycidine to deuridine, led to thym/deuridine auxrophy. These results suggested that T. br encodes an unidentified 5-nucleidase that converts deoxyrim nucleides to their nucleosides, leading to buildup in depleted cells at expense of T pools. Bioinformatics identified potential genes that could encode 5-nid activity, including an HD protein that catalyzes dephorylation deoxyonucle 5-monosph. TK is essential for synthesis thine nucleides regardless of nucleos precursors from de novo or salvage.
Researchers studied how genes in bacteria and other prokaryotes are translated into proteins without a specific sequence called the Shine-Dalgarn sequence. This sequence usually helps the ribosome bind to the mRNA and start translation. However, many genes lack this sequence, and it was unknown how they initiate translation. The team searched various proary genomes and found that mRNAs without Shinealg sequence are less structured in their translation region and have minimal folding at the start codon. They used reporter genes in bacteria to show that RNA being unfolded is necessary for start cod recognition in Shinealg-independent translation. Results suggest that start codons in single-stranded regions, while internal codons are in structured areas of mRNA. This provides a mechanism for translation site recognition without ribosome site.
Researchers studied 874 patients with visceral leishmanias (VL) in Bihar, India, who received 20mg/kg liposomal amphotin B (Ambis) as first-line treatment between 2007 and 2012. The study aimed to describe characteristics of patients who developed post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL), a skin disorder that occurs in up to 10% of VL patients in India. Of 831 patients completing treatment, 24 (0.3%) returned to the program with symptoms confirmed PKDL, diagnosed by clinical history, appearance, and skin smear examination. 89% had macular lesions, with a median time to development of 1.2 (0.8-2.2) years following treatment. Demographic and clinical characteristics of VL patients who developed PKDL were similar to those who did not. However, time to PKDL was shorter with Ambis in patients previously treated with sodium stibogluconate for VL. In a large cohort of VL patients in Bihar treated with 20/kg Ambis, PKDL appears infrequent with no risk factors. Median to developing PK compared to conventional treatments should be considered when counseling patients with regimens including Ambis.
Researchers studied the re-infestation of Triatoma infans, the main vector of Chagas disease, in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. They used continuous and discrete-time models to analyze infestation dynamics and found a 6-month lag between detection of new infestation and dispersal events. More bugs established from May to November than from November to May, coinciding with an increase in dispersal distance. The probability of new establishment increased with time since last infestation. These findings challenge current understanding of T. infans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge. Experiments are needed to close these gaps.

 Models showed seasonality in bug establishment on new sites by T. infans coincided with seasonality in dispersal distance. Three aspects of T.ans control were addressed: establishment rate of new populations as a function of distance from existing populations, mechanisms for seasonality in establishment, and effect of insecticide and previous infestation on rates. A continuous model estimated within-season changes and time-dependent effects of insect spraying, but requires assumptions about disperser sources. Contribution of each site to establishment was estimated by interpolation between bugs at source and t and t+1 (Figure 2).

The current strategy for controlling Chagas is interrupting transmission by screening donors and suppressing the vector. Since T. infans occurs in poor areas with limited resources, increasing efficiency is crucial. The spatial and temporal pattern of insecticide application maximizing efficiency is unknown. In contrast to non-spatial analysis, this study shows individual site properties like distance, infestation history, and spraying history contribute to establishment rate. Optimizing control timing requires understanding seasonality of dispersal intensity and distance, not just duration.
Researchers studied the effects of polyomavirus SV40 (SV40) on Syrian hamsters, a common animal model for studying SV40 infections. They found that SV40 can infect various tissues, including the liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain, with the kidney being the primary site for long-term infection. The virus was also detected in the liver, but to a lesser extent. The study showed that SV40 microRNA (miRNA) is expressed in infected tissues and plays a role in reducing viral DNA levels in infected tissues, particularly in those with simple regulatory regions. However, miRNA-negative viruses had higher DNA loads in liver and kidney compared to wild-type SV40. Early viral transcripts were more abundant than late transcripts in liver and kidney, and infectious virus was rarely detected. There was limited clearance of mi-deficient viruses. Wild-type and mi-negative SV40 showed similar transformation rates in cells in vitro and tumor induction in hamsters in vivo. The study demonstrated broad tissue tropism for SV40 in hamsters and first evidence of miRNA expression and function in vivo.
Researchers have conducted the most comprehensive genome-wide examination of positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals to date, using high-coverage assemblies of eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset improved statistical power and allowed for new lineage and clade-specific tests to be applied. Approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two species showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR < 0.05) according to a likelihood test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of selection on lineages or clades. Identified PSGs were enriched in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but also in specific functions such as complement immunity and perception. Several pathways were enriched PSG, suggesting co-evolution of interacting genes. A Bayesian analysis indicated PSG switched between positive and non-selection multiple times, suggesting selection is often episodic. PSGs were expressed at lower levels and tissue-specific than non-PSGs. Genes in spleen, testes, liver, and breast were enriched PSG, but not in brain. This study provides evidence for widespread selection in mammalian evolution and insights into selection's functional implications.
Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes skin and mucosal surfaces, often forms persistent infections through surface-associated communities called biofilms. Researchers have discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure that promotes S. aureus biofilm integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed these fibers have amyloid properties and consist of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). Mutants unable to produce PS are susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix-degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Previous studies associated PS with biofilm disassembly, but data show soluble PS disperse biofilms while polymerized do not. This suggests PS aggregation into amyloid fibers modulates their biological role in biofilms.

The S. aureus biofilm matrix contains polysaccharides and DNA that interact with structural and enzym proteins. Under certain conditions, S. aureus produces amyloid fibers that contribute to biofilm integrity. Purification analysis revealed several PS of the phenol modulin family present. These fibers share morph and biophysical characteristics with bacterial amyloids like E. coli, B. subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chemical and genetic analysis revealed fibril structures composed of PS.

Ordered PS aggregation into amyloid fibers abrogate bio disassembly attributed to moneric PS. Findings suggest PS modulate bioassembly using amyloid aggregation as control for activity. This is the first to identify and characterize extracellular fibril in S. aureus. Results indicate aggregation amyloid regulates PS in bioenvironment. S aure PS found in biofilms fibrils, implicating fibril as means altering activity and function.
Researchers have developed a new method to monitor the persistence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in infected individuals. Chagas affects over 6 million people in more than 20 countries, mainly in Latin America. Current methods to check for the parasite in the blood have limitations, such as low levels of the parasite in the blood. The new method uses an antibody test, called Ab3, which shows a strong correlation with the parasite presence of T. cruzi. Ab3 is present in high levels in untreated patients and decreases in those treated with benznidazole, a medication that clears the parasite from the blood. This suggests Ab3 is a new biomarker for parasite persistence in Chagas patients. The researchers believe Ab3 is produced by the immune system in response to parasites that are not detectable by blood tests. Measuring Ab3 could help monitor the status of infected patients.
Chikungunya virus (CHV) is an arthrogenic alphavirus that causes fever and severe joint and muscle pain. Chronic musculoskeletal pain persists in a fraction of patients for months to years after infection. Researchers wanted to understand what causes chronic disease. They created a recombinant CHV that expresses Cre recombinase (CH-C) to identify cells that contribute to pathogenesis during chronic phase. CH-C replicated in myoblast and fibroblasts and induced arthritis in mice during acute phase. Importantly, it also induced chronic disease, including viral RNA and myitis and synovitis similar to wild-type CHV. CH-C of tdato reporter mice resulted in population of tdato cells that persisted at least 112 days. Immunofluorescence and cytometry revealed these cells were predominantly myofib and dermal muscle fibbl. Treatment with antibody against Mra, a host receptor CHV, reduced number of td cells and diminished levels of viral, implicating these cells as reservoir of viral. Isolation and cytometry of td fibbl from skin and ankle analysis for RNA showed these cells harbor most persistent CHV RNA. CH-C and tdato system identifies cells that survive CHV in vivo and are enriched persistent CHV RNA. This model is useful for studying CH path in acute and chronic disease stages.
Researchers applied dimension reduction methods to understand how brain activity in the brain's visual cortex relates to its function. However, it's unclear how these results apply to recordings with many neurons or trials. The study addressed this by analyzing recordings from non-human primates and computer models that mimic brain activity through balance of excitation and inhibition. They compared two key outputs of dimension reduction - shared dimension and variance - with neuron count. Results showed that networks with clustered connections behaved differently and in vivo recordings matched the clustered model. Recordings from tens of neurons were enough to identify dominant variability that applies to larger parts of the network. This can help interpret results from limited neurons and trials and relate to brain structure.

The study focused on shared variability among recorded neurons, which is important for information encoded by a group of neurons. Dimension reduction methods were applied to V1 recordings and spiking models to see how they generalize to many neurons and trials, and relate to network structure. Spiking models allowed sampling many neurons and trials, so outputs were measured over a range of neuron and trial counts. This showed if results from few neurons are representative of the network. Also, trends were influenced by network structure. Clustered networks had fewer dimensions, but large variance. This suggests dimension reduction provides more detailed single-trial activity than PCA. Spontaneous activity in vivo and spiking models were studied. Trends of shared dimension and variance with neurons and trials were analyzed. V1 recordings from anesthetized macaques and clustered and spiking models were used.
Researchers have discovered that a molecule called 2-aminoacetophen (2-AA), produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plays a crucial role in modulating the host's immune response to infection. In experiments, mice treated with 2-AA before infection had a 90% survival rate, compared to 10% in non-treated mice. 2-AA activates key immune pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor NF-κ, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also attenuates immune response by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment with 2 is characterized by transcriptional block of JNK and NF-κ activation, with preserved ERK1/2 activation, leading to CCA/enhancer protein-β and cEBβ complex formation, preventing NFκ activation. This dampening of inflammation and increased survival concurs with 2's ability to signal bacteria to switch to chronic infection mode. Unlike other QS molecules that promote virulence, 2 decreases immune activation and allows pathogen persistence. Cytokine profiling shows 2 limits pro-inflammatory activation.
Researchers studied the L1-DT1 gene, a domesticated from a LINE-1 retroelement, in mammals. They found that L1T1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. L1T1 has evolved under positive selection in primate and mouse, and prosian L1 has replenished itself with a recent L1 ORF from prosian genome. This suggests L1 has been selected for novelty, possibly for genome defense. L1 loss is associated with L extinction in several megab lineages, but not sigmodine rodents. They hypothesize L1 evolved for genome defense against L elements, then incorporated pluripotency in some line. The study highlights retroelement domestication's role in mammalian biology, and domesticated genes can adopt functions in lineages.

The L1-D1 gene has a bipart double-ORF organization, conserved since its birth. Genome searches revealed L1 lost at least three times in placental mammals. The origin of L1 dates to 106 million years ago, older than domesticated retrogenes syncin and F1. Human L1 has a role in pluripotency, but cases of L1 loss and selection show it's not essential. Shared synten location shows true orthologs, not independent domestic events. L1 restriction function may be lost in species with extinct L, megats and rats. This suggests selection can't be only constraint for L1 retention. Divergent L insertion patterns explain L retention in mammals without active L and plurotency role in humans.
Researchers have found that a highly conserved bacterial protein called RNase Y is essential for the bacterium Vibrio cholera, which causes cholera. This protein plays a crucial role in processing the 3' end of a type of RNA called 16S and controlling the quality of ribosomes, which are the cell's protein-making factories. These roles are so important that RN Y is part of the minimal set of genes needed for life. However, RN is not essential in E coli, another type of bacteria, and its loss makes it more sensitive to stress. The study shows that RN is an endonuclease in Vibrio cholera and crucial for virulence, stress, RNA processing, and ribosome control, and part of a set of essential enzymes in many pathogens. To understand its function, researchers analyzed RNA and ribosomes of Vibrio cholera partially depleted of RN and other enzymes involved in 16S RNA processing. Results show that RN is also crucial for 16 S RNA 3 maturation in Vibrio and its absence hinders subunit assembly into 70 ribosomes. RN's importance to Vibrio pathogenesis was demonstrated by loss of colonization, biofilm formation, toxin production, and expression of virulence RNAs in Vibrio depleted of RN. Notably, RN genes of distant pathogens can complement E coli strain under stress, showing conservation of RN's activity in regulation. This study provides first exploration of RN's role in human pathogen and its function across species in essential processes.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the structure of human transcription factor networks (TF) and their robustness to genetic and environmental perturbations. They found that TF networks share a common assortativity signature, which contributes to phenotypic robustness. Assortativity measures the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect. The researchers used DNase-seq data to measure the assortativity of genome-wide TF in 41 human cell and tissue types. They determined the extent to which each of the four components of assortativity contributes to robustness. Theoretical models have shown that TF with increased assortativity exhibit increased robustness to mutations and gene duplication. However, the biological context of these findings is limited as the assortativity of real-world TF has not been characterized. The study suggests that in addition to topological properties, the components of assortativity should be considered to advance understanding network systems.
Researchers investigated how populations of inhibitory (IN) and excitatory (EX) neurons in the brain's sensory cortex process information from stimuli. They recorded the activity of up to 74 neurons in the anesthetized rat somatosensory cortex using 128-electrode arrays. Two types of whisker stimuli were used: location and frequency. IN neurons were better at distinguishing between stimuli than EX neurons in granular and infra-granular layers. Ensembles of IN neurons provided as much information as ensembles of the 20 most informative EX neurons, but with less redundancy. This suggests that IN neurons dominate the cortical network, efficiently processing sensory activity. 

Individual IN neurons had higher stimulus-related information than EX counterparts in granular and infra-gran layers, showing sharper responses to different stimuli. The study used multi-electrode arrays to record populations in anhet adult rat cortex. Sensory-evoked activity was recorded in response to whisker stimuli varied in location and frequency. High stimulus information in IN requires precise control over neuronal activity. IN ensembles had less redundancy than comparable EX cells. IN cells were sharper tuned to stimuli than principal neurons. They conveyed more information about location and frequency than EX neurons due to higher spikes, precision, and lower adaptation. Information in IN and EX cells was compared across layers.
Researchers have developed a new way to program living cells to perform calculations using RNA, a type of genetic material found in all living organisms. They created a "computer" in a cell that can add two pieces of information together and report the result as a color change in fluorescence. This is a step forward in synthetic biology, a field that aims to reprogram cells to perform new functions. The system uses small RNA molecules to control gene expression and sense signals, making it a key player in this field. This design can be used as a building block for more complex RNA-based computers.

The team engineered a genetic circuit in E. coli bacteria that adds two pieces of information, encoded in IPTG and aT molecules, and reports the sum as red and green fluorescence. They used RNA to control gene expression, which is versatile and can be designed at the nucleotide level. This is an advantage over previous designs that used proteins, which are limited in number and hard to design. The circuit is also more organized and scalable, and has a smaller genetic footprint.

This work shows RNA can be a key in synthetic biology and paves the way for more complex RNA-based computers. It's a step forward from previous work on logic gates, cascades, loops, and counters. The team focused on riboregulation of translation to implement the design.
Researchers have studied the enzyme cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (c-II), which plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular nucleotide pools by dephosphorylating 6-hydroxypine nucleide 5'-monosphates. High levels of c-II are linked to poor outcomes in cancer patients treated with cytotoxic nucleide analogues. To understand its role in resistance to therapy, scientists screened ribonucleide phosphates as potential c-II inhibitors. These compounds have a chemically stable phosphorus-carbon bond instead of the regular phosphoester bond. Among 34 analogues, six were better ligands than the natural substrate inosine 5-monophosphate (IMP). The study of purine and pyrimidine analogues and modifications defined rules for affinity. Docking predictions and experimental measurements showed three c-II residues Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210 are crucial for binding. Compounds 19, 21, 23, and 32-34 inhibited c-II activity at 2mM. The study highlights the importance of non-hydrolysable phosphon bond in designing new c-II inhibitors and hydrophobic stacking by protein residues.
Researchers have found that milk and colostrum from sheep infected with scrapie, a type of transmissible spong encephalopathy, contain infectious prions. This contradicts previous studies that found no evidence of prions in milk from affected ruminants. The study detected prion infectivity in colostrum and milk from sheep several months before clinical symptoms appeared. Abnormal pr protein was also found in mammary glands and lactal ducts of infected ewes. Prion accumulation was linked to mammary ectopic lymph follicles caused by Maedi virus infection. However, prion infectivity was also found in milk and colstrum from ewes with healthy mammary glands and those with lymphoproliferative mastitis. Milk and colstr infectivity was detected in cellular, casein, and whey fractions. In a mouse model, the highest infectious titre was equivalent to 6 micrograms of brain from a terminally scrap-affected ewe. These findings suggest that colstr and milk from ruminants with T could contribute to T transmission, either directly or through milk in animal feed. This raises concerns about human exposure to T from ovine and other T-susceptible dairy products.
During the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak in Liberia, researchers analyzed data from 16,370 laboratory samples collected between April 4, 2014 and March 29, 2015. A total of 10,536 individuals were tested, with 3,897 confirmed positive for Ebola virus RNA. The study found significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola RNA. Young children and elderly, and rural residents were at higher risk of death. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period. 

Data collection and management were challenging due to malfunctioning surveillance and reporting systems. However, laboratories were able to register demographic and clinical information systematically. The investigation was part of the public health response in Liberia and not considered research on human subjects, as data were not collected for research purposes but for response. Raw data were anonymized and samples identified by serial numbers. Patients were triaged at health facilities and transferred to Ebola Units if suspected or probable cases. Statistical significance should be interpreted with caution due to large sample size.
Researchers have studied the catalytic mechanism of tyrosase, a copper-containing enzyme that converts phenol to orthoquinone, in complex with a protein called cadd. They found that a specific residue, Tyr98, in cadd, is converted to a quinone through μ2:2-pero-dopper II and Cu II-dasiquinone intermediates. Despite previous studies, the exact mechanism was unclear. High-resolution cryo-crystal structures revealed a new step: Cu movement triggers hydroxylation and syn-anti rearrangement of copper ligands, placing the substrate's hydroxyl group in an equatorial position for electrophilic attack by CuO2 oxidant. UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the intermediates. The cadd residue may interact with dopquin more weakly than deoxy form due to copper shift, releasing quin-containing cadd. In the accepted mechanism, quin is separated from deoxy and a new substrate enters. Crystallography showed Cu movement to Cu-3 occurs before hydroxylation, with Cu-3 being the functional site, not artifact. A catalytic mechanism of tyrosase toward cadd Tyr98 is proposed, with oxidation and protonation triggering intermediates. However, cadd binding may differ from genuine substrate. Tyrosase is a type 3 copper protein, including catech oxidase and hemocyan, which oxidizes cateol to quin but lacks monooxygen activity, while hemyan is a dioxygen carrier in arthropods and mollus.
Researchers have studied the early stages of ribosome production in eukaryotic cells, specifically the formation of the large ribosomal subunit. They focused on the first precursor to the large subunit, the pre-60 particle, which contains 30 assembly factors (AFs) including RNA helicases. These helicases drive conformation rearrangements but lack substrate specificity in vitro. The team found that Dbp helase, essential for normal pre-60 accumulation in yeast, associates with a complex of four AFs: N1, N2, N8, and R3. N1 forms the backbone of the complex and is essential for Dbp insertion into the pre- particles. The researchers also mapped N1 RNA binding sites on 25 rRNA, supporting its role in core formation and clustering of helices. Additionally, N crosslinks to snoRNAs involved in decoding and peptid transfer modifications. The study suggests Dbp and N1 play key roles in compacting the core 25 rRNA and controlling snoRNA-rRNA interactions.
Researchers investigated how the brain's catecholamine system, which includes neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, regulates learning in a changing environment. They found that the cateolamine system plays a crucial role in adapting learning rate to environmental changes. The study used a combination of scalp electrophysiology, pharmacology, and computational modeling to analyze brain activity in 32 participants. They discovered that the P3 component of the EEG, a measure of phasic cateolamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of prediction error on learning. The P3 also mediated the impact of unexpected outcomes and uncertainty on learning. A pharmacological manipulation of cateamine activity affected learning following task changes, depending on participants' baseline learning rate. These findings provide evidence for a causal role of cateamine systems in learning regulation as a function of environmental change.
Researchers implemented a syndrom surveillance system called EPIC in two rural villages in Senegal to monitor infectious diseases. The system used data from two Point-Of-Care (POC) laboratories established in the region. From 2010 to 2016, 2,577 patient samples from 775 patients were tested in the Diel and Ndi POC, and 739 were found positive for at least one pathogen. The analysis with EPIC generated 443 alarms. In 2016, 316 samples from 298 patients were tested in the Niak POC, and 56 were positive for at least one pathogen. EPIC generated 14 alarms. The system was implemented in less than a month, showing its scalability. Compared to other surveillance systems in Africa, EPIC's strength is its ability to monitor 27 tests for 15 pathogens in real-time. However, improvements are needed to enhance the system. EPIC has successfully used data from two rural POC in Senegal, West Africa.
Researchers studied how cells in blood vessels, called endothelial cells, respond to a chemical signal called histamine. They found that the way these cells respond depends on how they are arranged. When cells are alone or in a single layer, they react differently to histamine than when they are in a network with other cells. The researchers used a combination of computer models and tiny patterns on a surface to study this. They found that when cells are in a network, they send signals to each other through special connections, called gap junctions, and this affects how they react to histamine. This signaling also affects how cells move and contract, which is important for blood vessel function. The study suggests that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemicals based on how they are arranged, which is important for how blood vessels work.
Researchers studied the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major cause of lower respiratory disease in infants, to understand how the body's immune system responds to the virus. They used a technique called whole-genome phage display libraries (GFPDL) to analyze antibodies in infants before and after primary RSV infection. The study found many epitopes, or regions on the virus that trigger an immune response, spanning the entire ectodomain of the G protein. This study focused on the contribution of antigenic regions outside the conserved cystine domain (CCD) of the G protein to immunity. They compared the immunogenicity and neutralization efficacy of RSV antigen sites using recombinant E. coli expressed ectomain (REG), CCD-deleted ectomain (REGD), N and C-terminal subdomains, and antigen peptides. REG, REGD, and peptides generated antibodies in rabbits and mice that bound glycosylated recombinant mammalian expressed ectomain (RM) and intact RSV particles, but had minimal neutralization titers compared to intact ectomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A Line 19, and viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was reduced in vaccinated animals compared to unimmun controls. Control viral loads post-R challenge correlated with serum binding to virus. Low Th2/Th cytokine ratios were found in lungs of REGD vaccinated mice after challenge.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the splicing component b2 (b2) in the specification of Drosophila neuropeideric neurons, specifically the Tv4 neurons in the ventral nerve cord. These neurons receive a signal from their target cells, which triggers the activation of the FMa gene. A genetic screen identified b2 and Pr8, components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, as involved in Tv specification. This study focuses on the role of RNA processing in target-derived signaling. b2 and Pr8 control the expression of the FMa neuropeptide in Tv neurons through two mechanisms: proper axonal pathfinding to receive the BMP ligand and proper splicing of genes in the BMP pathway, thickins (tk) and Medea. The Tv neuron requires a retrograde signal to differentiate and activate FMa, making it an excellent model for studying instructive signals in nervous system development. B2 and Pr8 are essential components of the spliceosome, but their role in cell specification is unknown. Mutants of b2 and Pr8 show Tv differentiation defects, suggesting a specific role in RNA processing. B2 regulates BMP signaling in Tv neurons at three points: axon pathfinding, Dm expression, and activation. The study reveals involvement of RNA in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the body controls the levels of certain proteins called F-box proteins, which are part of a group of enzymes called SCF ubiquitin ligases. These enzymes are important for many cellular processes, but their imbalance can lead to diseases like cancer. One way to control F-box levels is through a process called autoubiquitation, where the SC complex breaks down the protein. However, a new study found another way to control F-box levels, specifically for a protein called Met30, which is separate from the SC complex. This new pathway involves a different part of the SC called Cdc/Cul, but not the main part Sk1. The study showed this new pathway is crucial for maintaining chromosome stability and protecting against heavy metal stress. It also revealed a new function for a group of SC ubiquitin ligases called C53/R1/C34, independent of Sk1.
Kines-3 motors, such as mammalian KIF1, drive the transport of synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. In the absence of cargo, Kines motors are inactive to prevent motility and ATP hydrolysis. Current models suggest KIF1 is monomeric in the inactive state, activated by concentration-driven dimerization on the membrane. However, research found that native and expressed K1 are dimeric in the inactive state, not activated by cargo-induced dimerization. Instead, K1 motors are autoinhibited by two distinct mechanisms, suggesting a model for activation of dimer K1 by cargo binding. Successive truncations result in monom and dimer motors that undergo one-dimensional diffusion along microtub lattice, but only dimer motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. This indicates K1 may use both diffuse and processive motility for long-distance transport in neuronal cells.

Expressed and endogenous mammalian K1 exist in dimer, inactive state, invalidating cargo-induced dimer model. Autoinhibition is supported by identifying sequences and mechanisms for dimer inhibition. Only dimer motors undergo processive, ATP-driven motility. Dimer K1 motility is characterized by smooth, unidirectional movement along microtubes with velocity comparable to vesicles in vivo. Monomeric and dimer K1 undergo 1D on microtubes, indicating nonspecific binding that enhances processivity. Loss of K1 or Unc104 results in decreased vesicles in axonal growth and death, highlighting the importance of kines regulation for correct cargo transport.
Researchers studied the regulation of seed metabolism in tomatoes by analyzing the metabolite profiles of 76 different tomato lines grown in two consecutive seasons. They found 30 metabolite trait loci (QTL) and high variability in amino acid content across the population, with seasonal fluctuations in sugars. Integration of data showed that genetic background, not environment or tissue, was the main factor for metabolic polymorphism. Analysis of variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in the lines than the M82 cultivar. Heritability suggested different modes of inheritance for seed and fruit metabolites. Metabolic network analysis showed seed dependence on amino acids, with sugars and organic acids. Six highly regulated amino acids, Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro, were identified, with strong interdependence confirmed by QTL mapping. The study highlights redundancy in seed regulation, coordination with fruit metabolism, and centrality of amino acids in seed network. Combining metabolite profiling with QTL mapping revealed regulatory mechanisms in seed metabolism. Statistical analysis showed significant effects of season and organ on metabolite abundance, suggesting genetic dependence on environment and development. Fluctuations in sugar levels may be due to environmental differences. The study shows metabolite profiling with genetic variability can reveal regulatory mechanisms in seed metabolism, highlighting differences between seeds and fruit in network structure and modes of inheritance.
Vibrio cholera, a bacterial pathogen, colonizes both the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract. To colonize these niches, it uses a protein called N-acetylucosamine binding protein (Gbp), which mediates attachment to marine chitin and mammalian mucin through an unknown mechanism. Research reveals that Gbp has an elongated, four-domain structure with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. A screen shows Gbp binds GlcNA oligosacides. Truncated Gbp mutants show domains 1 and 4 interact with chitin in vitro, while in vivo studies reveal domain 1 is crucial for mucin and intestinal colonization. Bacterial studies show domains 2 and 3 bind V cholera surface. Mouse virulence assays show only first three domains Gbp are required for colonization. This explains how Gbp provides modular interactions between V cholera, intestinal epithelium, and chinous exoskeleton.
Researchers studied how the immune system's response to tuberculosis (TB) and found that a specific type of immune cell, called HLA-DR+CD4 effector T cells, is resistant to suppression by another type of immune cell called regulatory T cells. This resistance allows the HLA-DR+ cells to contribute to inflammation in TB. The study found that these cells express higher levels of certain cytokines, such as IFN-gamma, IL-17, and IL-22, which can counteract the function of regulatory cells. Blocking the CCR5 and PD1 pathways, which are known to promote regulatory cell suppression, showed that HLA+DR cells are resistant to suppression. Additionally, HLA+ cells expressed higher levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines, which can negatively regulate regulatory function. The study provides new insight into how HLA-DR+ cells contribute to inflammation and loss of regulatory homeostasis in TB. The findings are consistent with the idea that TB and other chronic infections are associated with immune activation. The study identifies HLA+ cells as a potential marker for disease and response to therapy.
Researchers studied mice that lack a protein called PrP, which is linked to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor, and are susceptible to prion infection but accumulate anchorless PrSc. They investigated whether these mice could propagate prions despite the deviant structure and location of anchorless PrSc and found that R and ME prions, but not 22 pr, propagated in GPI mice developed novel tropisms. Surprisingly, levels of proteinase-resistant PrSc (PrPres) in R- or ME-infected GPI brain were 25-50 times higher than wild-type. When returned to wild brain, ME pr recovered original properties, but R pr gave rise to a novel strain, S, which remained unchanged after three passages in wild mice. Both R and S are stably propagated in wild mice, suggesting a high energy barrier is abated in GPI mice.
In the fruit fly embryo, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning the dorsal-ventral axis during embryonic development. The pathway is transduced by the Mad transcription factor and opposed by the Brinker repressor. Researchers used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the BMP-responsive transcription network in the fly embryo. They identified multiple target genes, including positive and negative regulators of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling. Manipulation of EGF levels showed that it negatively regulates embryonic BMP transcription. The BMP network has a self-regulating property, balancing its activity with the antagonistic EGF pathway for correct patterning. The study also found key roles for the Zelda and Zerkünt transcription factors in establishing the expression domain and widespread binding of insulator proteins to Mad and Brinker-bound regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BE-32 insulator showed reduced transcription of a BMP target gene and fewer amios cells specified by BMP signaling. The findings provide a model for Mad-dependent activation and its relevance to signal interpretation in vertebrates.
In Tunisia, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major are increasing and spreading from the south to new areas in the center. To understand the evolution and population dynamics of L major, researchers performed multi-locus microsatellite typing of isolates from Tunisian governorates where the disease is endemic (Gaf, Kairan, and Sidi Bouid governorates) collected between 1991-1992 and 2008-201. Analysis of genotyping results shows that over two decades, Leish parasites evolved generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of 200-201 isolates from three governorates indicate L populations did not spread from south to center Tunisia according to geographical gradient, suggesting human activities might be source of disease expansion. Genotype analysis suggests flows between governor and districts, human activities, reservoir, and environmental changes explain disease progression. This study provides insights into evolution and spread L in Tunisia, improving understanding parasite between geographically and temporally distinct populations.

Human isolates in three governor between 200-201 assessed population dynamics L according geographical and emergence leishias epidemics in populations. Isolates in Sidi Bouid governor 199-199 and 200-201 compared evolution L populations same area twenty years. Z incidence Leish genetic diversity increasing, assuming Leish adapted environment [7, 8, 48]. Last twenty, Tunisia rapid ecosystem modifications anthropic disturbed sandfly, rodent, impacting Leish population since 1990. Migration other regions excluded. Genetic differentiation L population Sidi and Africa, Asia, Middle East, Iran, Pakistan [20, 19, 50] considerable.

Findings revealed decreasing gradient Gsa Kair and Sidi between 200-201. According chronology leishias Tunisia, Gsa oldest, well-established focus. First outbreak 188 Elguar, southern Gsa. First Kair, Sidi 198, 199. Study shows genetic differentiation Gsa Sidi Kair, not Kair Sidi.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of anthelmint chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in reducing helmin infections among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. They found that deworming with albendazole and prazantel significantly reduced the odds of infection with any helmin species by 89%. Access to safe flooring and latrines offered additional protection, with a 66% lower odds of infection. For schistosomiasis, treatment with prantel was protective. Among individuals not treated with albend or prazant, safe flooring and latrine access reduced the odds of infection by 34 and 59%, respectively. There was no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthint chemotherapy and W resources. The study suggests dewing is effective in reducing helmin infections among HIV-infected adults, with W offering minimal additional benefit except for safe flooring.
Researchers have studied the structure and function of a type of protein called lectin-like bacteriocin, found in certain bacteria that live on plants. These proteins can kill closely related bacteria, including some plant pathogens like Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas species, but how they work was unknown. The researchers looked at the structure of LlpW, a lectin-like bacterin from Pseudomonas putida, and found it has two parts: a mannose-binding lectin (MB) domain and a C-terminal beta-hair extension. The C-terminal MB domain is similar to MB domains in plant lectins and binds to mannose and oligosaccharides. Mutations showed that the sugar-binding site in this domain is crucial for killing bacteria. The N-terminal MB domain is similar but structurally different and lacks a mannose-binding site. Experiments with engineered N-domain chimeras from Llp homologs with different killing spectra showed the N-domain determines specificity. This bacterin is made of two domains that evolved separately for target recognition and toxicity.

The LlpW from Pseudomonas putida is the first bacterial member of the MB lectin family, which includes proteins with two MB domains. Llp is a bacteridal and fits the picture of MB domains in defense. No antibacterial activity has been found in eukaryotic MB proteins, making it hard to identify features that give Llp its intraspecific activity. Defensive roles have been proposed for oligomannose MB lectins based on insectidal, nematic, antifungal, and antiviral activities. Some plant lectins trigger apoptosis in cancer cells and are found in mucus and epithelial cells, suggesting a protective function for MB domains.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the process of sporulation involves two coordinated developmental programs that lead to the formation of a spore, or forespore, within a mother cell. The regulation of the foresore transcription factor σG at this stage has been unclear. Research has shown that σ activity requires eight proteins encoded in the spoII operon and the foresore protein SpoQ, which share similarities with components of specialized secretion systems. One of these proteins, SpoIA, resembles an ATPase and demonstrates that its ATP motifs are necessary for σ activity and spore formation. The SpoIA and SpoQ proteins reside in a multimer complex that spans the membranes surrounding the foresore, and are required to maintain its integrity. Without them, the foresore develops invaginates and collapses. Importantly, maintaining foresore integrity does not require σ, indicating that its collapse is not due to failure to activate σ and late gene expression. The SpoIA-SpoQ complex forms a novel apparatus that links the cell to foresore, using components from various secretion systems in Gram-negative bacteria. SpoIA resembles ATPases in type II and IV systems. The SpoQ, SpoIA, and ATP motifs in SpoIA are necessary for fores integrity, and their absence leads to invagination and collapse. The SpoIA proteins in the cell and SpoQ in fores form a multimer complex that spans the membranes surrounding fores, and ATP motifs in SpoIA are required for function.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder (BD), a highly heritable and disabling disease. They analyzed data from 1,190 cases and 401 controls, and an additional 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls, but did not find genome-wide significant associations for individual loci. However, they found an association between the power to detect effects from a previous genome-wide study and replication (P=1.5×10^-7). To rule out a false positive result, they analyzed replication in a meta-analysis of height and showed a linear relationship between power and replication. They found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near exons had a greater probability of replication, suggesting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. This indicates that common genetic variation near exons (±10kb) could be identified in larger studies, providing a framework for assessing potential replication combining results from multiple studies.
Scientists have long sought to understand how cells grow and divide, particularly in cancer cells. Previous studies have used a method called knockdown to see how genes affect growth, but it has limitations. Researchers used a new approach to assign a score to each gene based on its expression and growth in 60 cancer cell lines. They found genes that help cancer grow have a high score, while those that prevent it have a low score. Processes like cell cycle, DNA, and protein production are linked to growth, while migration is not. Analysis of non-cancer cells shows differences in translation and protein-making machines are linked to growth. A comparison across species shows cancer growth is like microorganisms, but nonancer is not. Combining cancer and nonancer signatures can predict patient outcomes and gene importance in cancer. These results show a difference between cancer and nonancer growth, which may lead to new cancer-fighting drugs.

A large-scale study of 126 genes in 60 cancer lines found genes and processes related to growth. Genes in translation and protein-making are linked to growth. Analysis of high-scoring genes shows they are in translation and protein-making. This is in line with previous studies that these are cancer targets. A study of known cancer and tumor genes found they have opposite effects, so their scores are high. Tumor suppressor genes have low scores, while oncogenes have high. Genes that help prevent cancer have low scores, while those that cause it have high.
Cysticercosis (CE) can affect the heart and vena cava, but cases are rare. A study of 11 patients with cardiac and endovascular CE over 15 years (1995-2009) is reported. Main symptoms included chest pain and shortness of breath, although 2 were asymptomatic. Cysts were mostly in the right atrium and vena cava. 9 had disseminated CE. Echocardiography diagnosed, serology, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography/magnetic imaging, and histology aided diagnosis and follow-up. 9 had surgery and long-term antiparas for 25 months (4-93). One died intraoperatively due to cyst rupture and vena dissemination. 2 died 10 and 14 years later due to pulmonary embolism and failure. One lost to follow. Those with cardiac only did not have complications and were cured. One required second operation. With vena involvement developed PE and multiple complications. CE is associated with high risk of lethal complications. Manifestations vary by location. Isolated cardiac may be cured, while endovascular extrac is associated with severe complications. CE should be in differential diagnosis of cardiovascular in endemic areas.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus uses to evade the human immune system. This mechanism involves a protein called Tir, a mimic of the human Toll-like receptor, which is part of the innate immune system. When Tir is expressed in human cells, it blocks the signaling pathway that leads to inflammation, reducing the body's response to infection. In a mouse model of skin infection, the bacteria with Tir were less virulent, meaning they caused less damage, than those without it. The researchers also found that Tir is linked to lower activity of white blood cells that fight infection, neutrophils and macrophages. This suggests that Tir plays a key role in reducing the body's response to infection.

Tir is located in a part of the bacterial chromosome called SCC, which also carries a gene for resistance to the antibiotic fusidic acid. Interestingly, low doses of fusidic acid increased Tir expression. Studies showed no link between Tir and clinical presentation of disease, but found an advantage in bacteria with this element. Two traits, virulence and resistance, are linked to the success of the bacteria in causing infection.
Researchers studied the development of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and mosquitoes (Anopheles gambia) to understand how gene expression changes contribute to their different body shapes. They analyzed gene expression data from embryos of both species and found that many genes with similar functions have similar expression patterns. However, some genes showed differences in timing and duration of expression. One group of these genes is involved in the formation of the mosquito's extraembryonic membrane, which is different from the fruit fly's. This group is reactivated later in development for cuticle synthesis. Another difference was found in maternal genes, which are passed from mother to offspring, with a sharp drop in expression in fruit flies but sustained in mosquitoes. The researchers propose using this method to identify genes responsible for body shape differences between species.
Researchers in Papua New Guinea investigated the presence of Haemophilus duyi and Treponema pallidum subsp pertue, bacteria, which cause ulcers in children in Africa and the Pacific region, on asymptomatic people, flies, and household items in an endemic setting. They conducted a cross-sectional study in rural villages on Lih Island, Papua Guinea during a yaws elimination campaign. Participants were asymptomatic individuals from households with ulcers and without ulcers. Swabs were taken from the skin of asymptomatic individuals, flies, and surfaces. Specimens were tested by PCR for H. duyi and T. pertue DNA. Of 78 asymptomatic participants, 21% had H. duyi PCR positivity and 1% T. pertue positivity. In subgroup analysis, H. duyi positivity did not differ in exposed or not exposed to case in household 24% vs 18%. Of 17 cultures from asymptomatic, 12 yielded definitive H. duyi skin colonization. Of 10 flies, 90 had H. duyi and 50 T. pertue DNA. Of 6 sheets, 33 had H duyi and 17 T. pert DNA This is the first H duyi on asymptomatic skin and H du and T. pertue in flies and items. Ubiquity H du in environment contributes to spread.

The study aimed to demonstrate viable H du in children, contacts of ulcer more likely to carry DNA than households without disease, and identify environmental sources like lin and flies for H and T. pertue DNA. PCR showed 20% asymptomatic children in du-endemic had detect H du DNA on skin, no cutaneous ulcer or symptoms. People without ulcer had similar rates to with H du case in household. Participants with PCR-positive changed lin less than once week than without bacterial DNA. Flies outside houses with ulcers 90 had H du and 50 T pertue DNA. 21 flies H du detected by standard and 21 replicates real-time PCR, relatively abundant.
The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force has developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training and curricula across various user groups and programs. The competencies were based on surveys of employers and training programs and refined through a multi-year community engagement process. This report presents the current status of the competencies and uses cases illustrating their application in diverse training contexts. The competencies aim to assist educators by providing a framework to share experiences and best practices in bioinformatics education despite divergent needs and expectations. A series of use cases demonstrate the competencies' value in defining, refining, and assessing bioinformatics training, highlighting diverse needs, user types, programs, and settings. Bioinformatics users require a basic understanding of methods and stronger interpretation of outputs. The competencies provide a basis for educators to design, refine, and evaluate training programs despite divergent goals and populations. They are not a prescription for specific curricula or standards.
Researchers studied the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercalis, which infects over a billion people worldwide, to understand how its development is arrested third-stage larva (L3) is formed. Unlike other nematodes that infect humans, S. steralis has both parasitic and free-living forms, allowing scientists to investigate mechanisms of L3 arrest and activation. The free-living nemode Caenorhabditis elegans has a similar developmentally arrested larva, the dauer, controlled by four pathways: cyclic GMP (cG) signaling, insulin/IG-1-like (IS) signaling, transforming factor (TGF) signaling, and biosynthesis of dachronic acid (DA) ligands. The researchers hypothesized that homologous pathways in S. steral have similar regulation and are involved in L3 arrest. They conducted a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome, generating 2.3 billion paired reads from seven developmental stages, and constructed expression profiles for S steral homologs of C elegans dauer genes. Intriguingly, genes encoding G pathway components were coordinately upregulated in L3. In contrast to C elegans, Seral has a paucity of genes encoding IS ligands, several of which have abundance suggesting involvement in L3 development. Seven Seral genes encoding homologs the Cans regulatory TGF ligand were identified, three expressed only in L. Putative biosynthetic genes did not appear coordinately regulated L development. The data suggest dauer genes in Seral may play a role in L development, with significant differences between species.
Researchers studied the effects of two bacterial toxins, Cytothal distending toxin (CDT) and colibactin, on cells. These toxins are secreted by pathogenic bacteria and can cause cancer. The study aimed to see how these toxins affect cell nuclei in the context of survival. Experiments were done on mice infected with bacteria, cell cultures, and xenograft models. Results showed that CD and colact induced nuclear remodeling with formation of cytoplasmic invaginations in cell nuclei. These structures, observed in vivo and in vitro, are nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The NR core contains ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and components of complex CR involved in mRNA turnover. These are active sites of translation, with high ploidy, and MAP and calcium signaling. Data also showed that concentration of ribonucleoproteins within nucleus is dynamic and protects cell from genotoxic stress. Bacterial genotoxin-induced NR is a gateway for mRNA to be transported for local translation. Findings offer insights into NR formation, a feature of many cancers, not only in response to DNA damage but also to genotoxic bacteria.
Researchers used three-dimensional computed tomography (3D) to evaluate maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy, a disease that can cause facial deformities. Previous studies have only used visual grading to assess maxillary changes in living patients. The study reconstructed 3D images of the maxilla in 10 patients with lepro and 5 controls, measuring the anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA). The difference in MA between patients and controls was evaluated, accounting for individual skull size. Findings were compared to paleopathological studies. Three patients with lepromatous leprosy showed marked maxillary atrophy (8.6-11.1-17.9mm), consistent with visual deformity and paleopathological findings. Precise bone defects could be calculated for reconstructive surgery. The study confirmed maxillary regression in paleopathological studies and illustrated maxillary deformities in living patients lepro. 

The study used volume rendering and multiplan reconstruction to compare maxillary deformities with paleopath studies. Stereoscopic 3D images enabled easier evaluation, showing nasal and alveolar deformities in 4 of 10 patients. Maxillary lesions in old lepro skeletons were described as facies lepro and rhinaxillary syndrome, with DNA M. lepr identified. Objective evaluation of lesions has not been performed. Difference in MA and MA indicates atrophied thickness, corresponding to bone prosthesis needed for reconstruction. This method may aid reconstructive surgery. The study's small sample size is a limitation, but 3-CT is a promising tool for maxillary deformities and lesions.
Researchers investigated how the auditory system represents sounds in a way that is not affected by background noise. They found that neurons in the auditory pathway adapt to the statistics of sounds as they ascend from the ear to the brain. This adaptation increases the ability to recognize sounds in noise. To test this, they recorded responses from neurons in the midbrain and cortex of anesthetized ferrets to complex sounds in noise and compared them to a model of the ear. They found that adaptation to statistics increases from ear to brain and that populations that adapt most to statistics are most tolerant to noise. This suggests that adaptation is a key to building noise-invariant sound representations in the brain. 

In three experiments, they measured neural responses to sounds in noise and found a progressive increase in noise tolerance from ear to brain. Neuron-level and population changes in adaptation and noise tolerance are correlated, suggesting adaptation drives noise-toler representations. They found that responses become more independent of noise level as they ascend the pathway. They also measured how coding in auditory centers is affected by noise and found a progressive increase in adaptation to altered statistics. By the cortex, populations represent sound in a noiseoler fashion, responding to common features between clean and noisy conditions. Adaptation to statistics increases along the pathway and accounts for how noise affects sound representations. As neurons adapt to statistics, they shift from low-level sound attributes to mean, contrast, and noise-independent information. This is a step towards context-invariant sound representations seen in higher areas.
Researchers studied how the yeast protein-protein interaction network, or interactome, changes in response to heat shock, a type of cellular stress. They used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-studied organism, as a model. The interactome is a complex network of proteins that interact with each other, and stress response genes have been well-characterized. However, how the interact changes during stress has not been investigated. The team calculated the changes in interaction weights of the interactome from mRNA levels upon heat shock. They found that heat significantly decreased the overlaps and connections of interactome modules. The diameter of interactome increased 4.9 times in heat. Key proteins of heat response became centers of heat-induced communities and provided residual connections after shock. The changes resembled a "stratus-culus" transition of interact structure, from connected to multifocal. Results showed heat induced partial disintegration of global interact organization. This may occur in other stresses and complex systems, such as proteins, social networks, and ecosystems. The study provides a system-level adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis to assess the effect of amiodarone on ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas disease, a chronic condition caused by Trypanosoma cruzi prevalent in Latin America. They searched MEDLINE, Embase, and LACS databases up to January 2018 and included 9 studies (3 before-after studies, 5 case series, and 1 randomized trial) with a total of 38 patients allowing individual patient data analysis. Amiodone reduced ventricular tachardia episodes by 99.9% (95%CI 99.8-100%), ventricular beats by 93.1 (95%82.4-97.4), and ventricular couplets by 79% (RR 0.21, 95CI 0.11-0.39). Studies not included in individual data analysis showed similar reductions in ventricular beats, tachardia, and couplets. Amiodone was associated with corne microdepos 61.1% (CI 19.0-91.5), gastrointestinal events 16.1 (6-34.2), bradycard 12.7 (3-35.6), dermatological 10.6 (4-21.9), and discontinuation 7.68 (4-13.7). Quality evidence ranged from moderate to low. Amiodone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias but lacks evidence for hard endpoints sudden death, hospitalization.
Researchers studied the seasonal patterns of deng fever in rural Ecuador from 2009-2016 using data from two hospitals. They found that deng fever rates varied throughout the year, with peaks in mid-March. Cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and less on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays did not affect deng diagnoses, except for an increase on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact deng diagnoses in school-aged children. Climate factors, such as precipitation and temperature, also affected deng rates. The study is one of the first to examine long-term deng seasonality in Ecuador and one of few from rural areas. It can inform local health planning and global models of d fever trends.
Researchers have discovered a new way to activate the body's innate immune system to fight off viral infections without the need for specific antibodies or prior knowledge of the virus. They found that expressing a protein called Rd, which is part of a virus, in the absence of other viral proteins, can trigger a strong and long-lasting immune response in mice. This response, called interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), is 80 times stronger than the body's natural response to infection and protects against lethal viral challenge. The mechanism works through a protein called MDA and is independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cells show similar results, with Rd inducing an IS network and blocking HIV-1 infection. Importantly, mice with lifelong IS elevations are healthy and normal. The study provides a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiv protection.
Researchers tested the independent-action hypothesis (IAH) for a plant virus, Tobacco etch virus (TEV), which states that each virion has an equal probability of infection and virions act independently during the infection process. They found that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency (<2%). The probability of a genotype infecting the inoculated leaf systemically was near 1, but in rare cases, genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf by other genotypes. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection was predicted by the independent model. Independent action appears to hold for TE, and Ne is dose-dependent for this RNA virus. The number of virions causing systemic infection can be small and approaches 1 at low doses. Dose dependency in TE suggests that Ne estimates for different viruses are not meaningful unless dose effects are considered.
Researchers have developed a new statistical method to study how genes are turned on and off in different parts of the body. Most previous studies looked at one type of cell or tissue at a time, ignoring information from other parts. The new method, called Sparse Bayesian Regression, looks at multiple tissues and genetic variants together. It was tested on 2,000 genes in four tissues and found more true genetic effects than previous methods. One example, a gene called Hopx, was found to be controlled by two genetic variants, which was missed by other methods. The new method also found 27% of genes are regulated across all four tissues, increasing the number of genetic effects found by 5 times. This approach can help understand complex genetic control of gene expression and can be applied to other systems and humans. 

The new method uses an efficient algorithm, Evolutionary Stochastic Search, and is better than other methods in finding genetic effects within and across tissues. It can find multiple genetic effects on a gene, not just one. Global analysis of multiple tissues is now possible, but few methods combined gene expression with genetic variants. The new method uses sparse regression to handle many genetic points and find effects. It finds more genetic effects than single marker methods for the same error rate and identifies regulation across tissues. The method also finds uncertainty in best predictors and assesses each genetic contribution to gene variability.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how cells die through a process called extrinsic apoptosis, which is triggered by external signals such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TRAIL. This process involves a "variable-delay, snap" switch that allows cells to choose between life and death. The model, based on known reaction pathways, was trained with data from experiments and accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL. Analysis shows that the delay before effector caspase activation is determined by initiator casase-8 activity and reactions downstream of the TR receptor. The sudden activation of effector casases is achieved by membrane permeabilization and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. The interactions among Bcl-2 family, partition of Sm from its partner XIAP, and pore assembly mechanics are critical for snap control.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Listeria monocytogen infects the placenta during pregnancy. The placenta protects the fetus from the mother's immune system and other pathogens, but L monocytogen has a way to breach this barrier. A protein called Internalin P (InP) helps the bacterium infect the placenta. The researchers found that InP binds to a protein called afadin, which is involved in cell-cell junctions. They created a crystal structure of InP and saw it has a unique feature that helps it bind to afadin. When cells with InP were tested, they had less force on a surface, similar to cells without afadin. Bacteria with InP couldn't form actin protrusions, a step in crossing the placenta, and cells without afadin didn't help. This suggests InP targets afadin to help monocogen cross the placenta.
Researchers have used mass spectrometry techniques to study the proteome of Treponema pallidum s. pallum, the bacterium that causes syphilis, a chronic disease. Little is known about the T. pallum proteome, so this study aimed to bring insights into its pathogenic and expression profiles during infection. They analyzed T. pallum DAL-1 strain isolated from rabbits using multidimensional separation and mass spectrometry, detecting 603 peptides corresponding to 557 unique proteins, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the T. pallum proteome to date, providing valuable insights into in vivo protein expression and paving the way for understanding the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism.

The study detected proteins were characterized by predicted function and localization, with half allocated to various categories. Proteins with unclear annotations were subjected to additional analysis. 116 potential membrane proteins were identified, 16 with evidence of outer localization. 12 proteins related to the paralog tpr gene family were found. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free methods, showing a low correlation with previous microarray data. The study found no overlap with human and rabbit protein databases, and detected 58% of the predicted proteome using mass spectrometry methods.
Protein Kinase A (PK) is a key receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotes. AMP binds to two tandem AMP-binding domains (CBD-A and B) within the regulatory subunit of PK (R), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). The CBD-A in PKα is required for PK inhibition and activation, while CBD functions as a "gate" domain that modulates control exerted by CBD. Preliminary evidence suggests CBD dynamics are critical for gate function. To test this hypothesis, researchers used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to investigate two-domain PKα (91-379) in apo, c2, and C-bound forms. Comparative NMR analyses led to a double conformation selection model, where each CBD samples active and inactive states independently of adjacent CBD within a degenerate free landscape. Degener is critical to explain sensitivity of CBD to interactions and high affinity for AMP. Binding AMP eliminates degener, stabilizing active conformation within CBD and inter-C contacts, which require AMP. The inter-C interface is dispensable for intra-C conformation selection but indispensable for PK activation as occludes subunit sites within CBD. Structurally homolog c-bound CBD exhibit differences in dynamics, supporting conservation of structure does not imply dynamics.
Researchers studied the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (IS15) in macrophages during vaccinia virus infection. IS15 is a protein induced by interferon and associated with antiviral immunity. They compared the proteomes of IS15- and IS+ bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMD) after vaccinia virus (V) infection. The results showed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were altered in IS- MD treated with interferon. Mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were higher in IS+ MD than IS- MD following interferon treatment, indicating IS-dependent mechanisms. IS depletion led to a change in macroage polarization. IS- macrophages showed a pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern, but blocked nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase activation. Following interferon treatment, NO release was higher in IS+ macroages than IS- macroages, concomitant with a decrease in viral titer. IS- macroages were permissive for VV replication following interferon treatment. The study demonstrates that IS governs the functionality of mitochondria, specifically oxidative phosphorylation and mitagy, broadening its role as antiral agent.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that regulates the HIV-1 protein Vpu, which plays a crucial role in the virus's life cycle. Vpu has two functions: degrading the cellular receptor CD4 and enhancing viral particle release. It binds CD4 and recruits the βTr subunit of the SCβCP ubiquitin ligase complex through its phosphorylated DS52XX56 motif. However, V escapes degradation by inhibiting the degradation of βTr targets such as β-caten and Iκα. The study found V's inhibitory function on Em1 and C25, βTr substrates involved in cell cycle progression. A novel phosphorylation site in V was underscored, especially in cells arrested in early mitosis, V undergoes phosphorylation of serine 61, adjacent to βTr-binding. This triggers V degradation by βTr-independent process. Mutation V61 in HIV-1 extends its half-life and increases release from HeLa cells. The S61 determinant is conserved in HIV-1 isolates. Results show differential phosphorylation of V determines its fate as adaptor or substrate of ubiquitin ligases. Conservation of V degradation, despite negative effect on release, suggests role in overall HIV fitness.
Researchers investigated how the development of tissues in the body is coordinated with whole-body development to ensure robustness against environmental and physiological perturbations. They proposed two hypotheses: tissue pattering is coordinated with whole-body over time or at developmental milestones. To test this, they developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosila larvae based on patterning gene expression and linked it to whole-body events: moul, larval wandering and pupation. They found patter in the disc aligned at moul and pupation, indicating these events are milestones. Between these, patter showed variability in response to temperature and physiological changes. Data also showed discs from larvae had greater variability in patter stage, suggesting wandering is not a milestone. The study reveals patter remains robust against perturbations by aligning at milestones, providing insight into how individual tissue development is coordinated with the body as a whole.
In highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae, endosomes play a crucial role in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of cargo, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, the connection between these processes is not well understood. Researchers found that the ESCRT regulator Did2 coordinates endosomal transport in fungal hypha of Ustago may. Without Did, endosomes fail to reach the vacuole, long-distance transport is disrupted, and shuttling of early endosomes is abnormal. The late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease P1 show increased shuttling on aberrant endosomes, indicating defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach, causing disturbed processive movement. The endosomal RNP linker Up1 is absent on endosomes, leading to defects in long-distance mRNA transport. Did2 regulates endosomal maturation and provides correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long transport. 

Endosomal maturation and fusion with vacuoles depend on functional ESC machinery for vacolar sorting. Without Did, Rab7 and P1 shuttle more intensely on early endosomes, a rare in wildtype hypha. A link between ESC complex and endosomal transport is found, but indirect, affecting mRNPs on endosomes. Endosomal maturation is essential for endytic recycling and polar growth in cells. ESC components are present early on long trafficking. Did is needed for vacolar cargo sorting and efficient long transport. Loss reduces endosomal proteins and processivity. In addition to vacolar trafficking, Did determines early end identity in polar cells, ensuring correct long transport of mRNAs and septins.
Researchers have compared two types of riboswitches, which are molecules that regulate gene expression in bacteria by binding to adenine, a component of DNA. The ribwitches in Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulificus differ in how they control gene expression, one at the level of transcription and the other at translation. The study found that both ribwitches have different properties when binding to adenine and operate under different rules. The Bacillus subtil ribwitch needs adenine to be present during transcription to function, while Vibrio can bind adenine after transcription is complete and still regulate translation. The study also showed that the speed of transcription is important for Bacillus ribwitch to work efficiently, supporting its role in transcription regulation. In contrast, Vibrio ribwitch can regulate without transcription and translation being coupled. The results suggest that the type of regulation, transcription or translation, affects ribwitch mechanisms.
Researchers have identified a pattern of primer-dependent transcription initiation (PDI) in the bacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholera. PDI is a process where a 2-4 nucleotide oligonucleotide primer is used to initiate transcription, which is prevalent in stationary phase of growth in E. coli. coli. The study found that PDI plays a regulatory role in biofilm formation in E. coli and is also occurs in the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholera. A high-throughput sequencing of RNA 5' ends (5 RNA-seq) showed that PDI is similar in both organisms. P is detected in stationary phase, not exponential phase, and preferentially at promoters with T-1+1 or G-1+ sequence. RNA-seq and primer analyses indicate P from T-1+ and G+1 produces transcripts from position -1. The researchers propose a growth-dependent process generates 5'-UA-3 and 5'-GG- oligonucleotides in both E. coli and V. cholera. The study suggests P may be widespread in Gammaprotebacteria and fluctuates as a function of growth state.
Researchers investigated how parental genome imbalance affects the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis, a plant species. Imprinted genes are genes that are expressed from only one parental allele, either from the mother or father. Previous studies in mammals and plants showed that genome imbalance affects embryo growth and may lead to reproductive isolation between species. This study focused on four imprinted genes: FERTIZATION INDEPENDENT SE2 (FIS), FLOWERING WINGEN (FWA), MEDE (ME), and PES (P1) controlled by DNA methylation and histone methylation. Results showed that genome imbalance deregulated expression of IS and P in an antagonistic manner. Increased dosage of maternal alleles caused loss of imprinting of IS and ME. IS controls histone methylation, which represses ME and P expression, but changes of P and ME could not be fully explained by fluctuations of IS expression. This suggests that genome imbalance deregulates imprinting mechanisms independent of known regulators. The complexity of regulations between expressed and silenced imprinted genes in response to imbalance does not support simple models from parental conflict hypothesis.
Researchers have analyzed brain activity recordings from electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to understand how brain rhythms, or oscillations, are organized in the brain. They found that these oscillations appear as bands of specific frequencies on a non-oscillatory background, or non-rhythmic, background. Unlike previous studies, this research focused on what brain rhythms tell us about brain connectivity, not how they are generated or if they are necessary for function. The team created "virtual brains" or networks that mimic EEG/ME recordings and found that these networks share structural and dynamic features with real brains. They also recreated diseased brains, such as epileptic and schizophrenic, with altered oscillatory activity and found similar changes in connectivity and dynamics. The study suggests that complexity, a measure of network organization, is a good indicator of brain health, with diseased brains showing lower complexity. This research has implications for understanding brain health and disease.
Researchers analyzed genetic data from 1,374 Hispanic individuals in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to understand the population structure of Hispanics in the United States. They used 60,000 genetic markers to identify patterns of ancestry and found four distinct groups: Dominican/Cuban, Mexican/Central American, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican. These groups align with participants' self-identified ethnicity. The study also looked at genetic associations between triglycerides and two genes, LPL and TR1, previously linked to trigides in Caucasians, but not confirmed in Hispanics. They found significant associations in both genes, highlighting the importance of considering population structure and genetic heterogeneity in studies of Hispanics.

The study used principal components analysis to identify ancestry in samples from the Hap phase and Human Diversity Panel. The first two components showed Caucasian and African and Native American origins, while the third and fourth components separated samples by geographic location. The researchers removed SNPs in long-range linkage disequilibrium among Caucasians to focus on differences among Hispanic and Native groups. This approach allowed them to detect finer differences among groups of distinct origins.

The study has implications for genetic analysis of Hispanic cohorts. It demonstrates the need to consider population structure and genetic heterogeneity in studies of this population. The Multi-Eth Study Atherosclerosis provides a large and well-characterized sample of Hispanics, making it a valuable resource for future research.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the Elong complex, a group of proteins involved in DNA replication and repair, in maintaining gene silencing and genome stability. They found that Elong interacts with the protein PCNA, a key player in DNA replication and repair. Without Elong's catalytic subunit, El3, cells lose gene silencing and become sensitive to DNA damage. Deletion of El or mutations in other Elong subunits also result in loss of silencing and increased sensitivity to DNA damage. El3 is required for cell progression in the presence of DNA inhibitor hydroxyurea. Analysis shows El3 mutant exacerbates sensitivity to damage in cells lacking histone chaperone As1 and H3 lysine acetylase R109. El3 interacts with PCNA and binds Elong complex in vivo and vitro. These findings reveal Elong's role in silencing and genome stability, linked to replication and repair pathways.
Researchers have developed a new method to improve the process of manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications. This process, called triage, involves retrieving relevant articles from databases like PubMed, but often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this, they used machine learning to assist the triage process. They trained a deep learning model on a dataset of curated publications from UniProt/SwissProt and NHRIEB GWAS Catalog, then applied it to new publications. The method outperformed current query-based methods, improving efficiency and enriching curated content. It achieved 1.81 and 2.99 times higher precision than current methods for UniProt/Siss and GW Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. The method retrieved many relevant publications the query method couldn't find. This shows machine-assisted triage can make the process more efficient, allowing curators to focus on quality improvement.

The researchers compared their method to knowledge-specific query methods and found it greatly improved efficiency in UniProt/Siss and GW Catalog. They used convolutional neural networks to classify documents, a new application in speeding up real-world triage for biomedical literature. The method was evaluated on three datasets, achieving high performance on UniProt/Siss and GW Catalog before 2017. It worked well on different datasets and settings, with manual teams confirming higher precision without compromising recall. In Uni/Siss, it found relevant publications the query method couldn't.
A study investigated the link between gain-of-function mutations in the KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 channels and atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with short QT syndrome type 3 (SQT3). The researchers used detailed computer models of human atrial electrophysiology to understand how these mutations lead to arrhythmias and identify potential treatment targets. They modified a model of the human atrial action potential to mimic the effects of heterozygous and homozygous forms of the D172 and E299 Kir2.1 mutations. The study found that both mutations shortened the action potential duration (AP) and conduction velocity (CV) and reduced the effective refractory period (ERP), making it easier for arrhythmias to occur. In 2D and 3D tissue models, the stability of reentrant excitation was affected by changes in tissue excitability and AP dispersion. Blocking IK and IKr channels was effective in terminating arrhythm in heterozygous D172 conditions, while IK block alone may be safer for E299 mutation. Combining IK and IK block produced a synergistic antiarrhythmic effect in both forms of S3. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of atrial arrhythm with S3 Kir2.1 mutations and possible pharmacological strategies for managing S3-linked AF.
Researchers investigated whether adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) can prevent cardiac damage in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. Chagas is a complex disease endemic in Central and South America, with increasing non-vector forms of transmission in developed countries. Mice were infected with T. cruzi and injected with ASC 3 days post-infection. Tracking showed cells remained in the abdominal cavity up to 9 days and most migrated to abdominal subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. ASC reduced blood parasitemia, followed by cardiac inflammation and fibrosis at 30 days. Cytokine release from heart cells exposed to T. cruzi antigens showed anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated mice, while splenocytes produced pro-inflammatory response, important for parasite control in placebo and ASC groups. However, splen from ASC released higher IL-10 at 60. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed right ventricular dilation prevented in ASC mice. Injection of ASC after T. cruz infection prevented remodeling through modulation of immune response, promoting parasite control and heart protection from damage.
Researchers have developed new compounds called DHZ36 and DHZ36.1, which are analogs of Retro-2, a previously shown to reduce Leishmania infections in mice. These new compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit Leish infections in mammalian cells. Results show that DH36 and DH36.1 are more effective than Retro-2 in reducing Leish infections, with EC50 values of 13.63 and 10.57 μM, respectively, compared to 40.15 μM for Retro-2. Additionally, DH36 and DH36.1 reversed Leish suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Unlike Retro-2, DH36 and DH.36 can kill Leish parasites in axenic cultures, which is a desirable for treating Leish infections. Studies validate and extend the structure-activity relationship of Retro-2. The compounds were tested on axenic Leish promastigotes and in macrophage infections, showing Retro-2 is Leish static, while DH36 and DH.36 are Leish-cidal. The compounds are non-toxic to mammalian cells, suggesting the retrograde pathway is more sensitive in Leish. DH36 and DH.36 are more effective than Retro-2 in suppressing Leish infections, consistent with previous studies and proposed mode of action.
Researchers have developed a method to predict which genes are sensitive to regulation by the nucleosome, a complex that organizes DNA and helps control gene expression. They found that the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1 (AML-1) transcription factor, which regulates immune gene expression, is sensitive to nucleosome regulation within the Ly49 gene family. This was confirmed in a cell line that naturally expresses Ly49, where nucleosomes were depleted at AML-1 binding sites in expressed Ly49 compared to silent Ly genes. The study suggests nucleosome contributes to Ly49 expression and proposes a method to predict nucleosome sensitivity to aid in understanding its role in gene regulation. 

A whole-chromosome analysis revealed many transcription factors have nucleosome coverage and lack 10 bp periodicity, identifying AML-1 as sensitive in the Ly cluster. This suggests many factors have potential to be nucleosome-sensitive on a genome scale. Predictions were confirmed in a line where expressed Ly genes showed nucleosome depletion at AML-1 sites compared to inactive genes. It's interesting to study AML-1 sensitivity at non-Ly genes to determine if it's a trait for Ly regulation only. In a line that naturally expresses Ly, AML-1 sites are depleted nucleosomes in promoter/enhancer regions of expressed Ly compared to unexpressed genes, implicating nucleosome in Ly regulation in vivo.
Researchers have identified a key step in the process that controls cell growth and division, called the restriction point, where the cell decides whether to continue growing or stop. This process is controlled by proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are activated by another protein called CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, the known CA for CD2 and CD1 is cyclin-HCD7, which is always active. However, the critical step is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by C25 phosphatases, not T-loop phosphorylation. CD4 and CD6, bound to cyclin D, are master regulators of mitogenic signaling, initiating pR inactivation and cell commitment at the restriction point. Unlike CD1 and CD2, CD6, CD4 has a highly regulated T-loop phosphorylation at 172, which determines its activity. Whether CD4 and CD6 are phosphorylated by CD7 is unclear. To answer this, researchers used a genetic approach with CD7-sensitive cells, which can be inhibited by adenine analogs. CD7 inhibition prevented CD4 phosphorylation, but CD6 was partly dependent on p21. In response to CD7, p-bound CD4 increased with disappearance of phosphorylated p, which was catalyzed by CD and CD2. S130 mutation of p prevented CD4 phosphorylation and inhibited CD6 and CD2 phosphorylation of p and p-bound CD4. CD7 revealed crucial indirect involvement in CD4 and CD6 phosphorylation, existence of other CD-activating kinases, and CD-dependent feedback by p phosphorylation by CD and CD2 to sustain CD activation and restriction passage.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUET/M1 that plays a crucial role in meiosis, a process that produces haploid cells essential for sexual reproduction in plants. Meiosis is triggered by transcription factors that activate a cascade of gene expression, but these factors are not conserved and mechanisms ensuring proper meiotic expression in multicellular eukaryotes are poorly understood. DUET1, a PHD finger protein, is essential for Arabidopsis male meiosis and functions as a transcription regulator. It binds to H3Kme2 in vitro and this interaction is critical for its function during meiosis. DUET is required for microtubule organization during me II, independently of its function in I. It shows stage-specific expression confined to diplot. Two genes, TDM1 and J, are critical for cell transitions and spindle organization in meiosis and are targets of DU, with T1 being a direct. DU regulates microtub organization and cell transitions during me and activates meiotic gene T1. Profiling showed reduced expression of 12% of known meiotic genes in du mutant. Results reveal DU as transcription regulator during me in plants and suggest meiotic under stagewise control in plants like yeast.
Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by fragile X premutation CG repeats. Previous studies have shown that fragile X CG repeats can cause neurodegeneration and that CG-binding proteins α and hnRNP A/B can modulate CG-mediated neurotoxicity. Researchers investigated the role of α in CG-mediated neurode using a proteomic approach and identified over 100 proteins that interact with α. Notably, R62, the Drosophila ortholog of p RNA helicase, can modulate CG-mediated neurode. They found that CG repeats decrease R62 transcription, leading to nuclear accumulation of H70 transcript and other mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. This suggests that abnormal accumulation of these mRN, likely due to impaired export, contributes to FAS pathogenesis.

Researchers focused on R62, the Dophila orth of p RNA helic, as it interacts with α and modulates CG neurode. Biochemically, fragile XCG repeats decrease R62 transcription, leading to accumulation of H70, a target of R, in the nucleus. Expression of XCG repeats reduced viability of heterozygous R mutant flies, supporting a strong interaction between R and CG-mediated cell death. They studied R in context of CG neurode. R is Doph orth of p helic.

The study found nuclear accumulation of specific mRN caused by XCG repeats, indicating a deficit in export may contribute to FAS. Earlier studies showed α and hnNP A/B are CG-binding proteins that modulate CG-toxicity. Through proteomic, genetic, and microarray analyses, researchers show accumulation of m caused by XCG may contribute to FAS, potentially via impaired export due decreased R levels seen upon XCG expression.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria, forms complex communities called biofilms on surfaces. These biofilms are held together by an extracellular matrix, a mixture of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. Researchers studied how this matrix forms and its components during bio development. They focused on the polyscharide Psl, a key component of the matrix, and its role in biofilm formation. 

During attachment, Psl is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and matrix assembly. This holds bacteria in the biofilm on the surface. Disrupting P from the surface disrupts the matrix and bio structure. During maturation, P accumulates on the periphery of 3D microcolonies, creating a P-free cavity in the microcol center. Dead cells and extracellular DNA are concentrated in the P-free area. Deleting genes controlling cell death and autolysis affects matrix and microcol formation. 

Data shows how P aerugin builds a matrix and cavity for cell dispersal. Visualization reveals Psl as a key matrix component, opening avenues for therapeutics for bio-related complications. Exopolacides, found in animal and plant tissues, are also in microbial biofilms. Three exopolacides, P, Pel, and alginate, contribute to P aerugin biofilm formation. Psl, from the polyschar locus, is required for adherence and bio structure. aerugin forms a matrix, maintaining adherence and bio architecture during development. The matrix does not overlap with DNA, but coordinates bio structure. Data indicates Psl as a key component, playing a role in aerugin persistence.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of pancreatic cancer tumors and two types of lab models used to study cancer: patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PD) is a type of cancer with poor prognosis, and new treatments are needed to improve outcomes. PDX and PDO are promising tools to find new treatments, but to be effective, they must match the cancer's genetic diversity and patient-specific sensitivities. The study compared the genetic makeup of 16 pairs of tumors and PDX from PD and metastasis, including 5 pairs of primary tumor, PDX, and PDO. A pipeline was developed to score concordance between models and human tumors for genetic events, mutations, variations, and copy variations. Tumor comparisons showed single-gene concord across major PD driver genes, but poor agreement across mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome analysis of structural variation (SV) highlighted concordance across chromosomes with clustered events. Ploidy presented a challenge when assessing copy changes, but ploidy-correct copy states showed agreement between pairs. The study found that PDX and PDO can serve as transplantable systems for probing PD properties, but may be best for different levels of genomic complexity.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study in 19,091 breast cancer cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent to identify genetic factors contributing to breast cancer. They analyzed 690,947 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, then evaluated 5,365 SNPs in 3,972 and 3,852, and finally 94 SNPs in 5,203 and 5,138. The top 22 SNPs were further investigated in 17,423 subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934). The study found a strong association between SNP rs9482, near the TGF-activated kinase 2 gene on chromosome 6q25.1, and breast cancer risk, with a P-value of 3.8×10^-12 in combined analysis. Adjusted odds ratios were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for A/A and AA genotypes compared to GG. Two other SNPs, rs3951 in the ESR gene and rs710 at 11q24.3, showed consistent association in each stage. This study provides evidence for a novel breast susceptibility locus represented by rs9482 and two possible loci in ESR and 11q.3.
Researchers studied a group of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa to understand the genetic factors behind cryptococcal meningitis, a major cause of mortality worldwide. They found high genetic diversity among isolates in the region, with 50 sequence types identified, including 18 new ones, and 72% of isolates belonging to 7 high-frequency types. Analysis showed no geographical clustering, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent acquisition. Comparison of genetic data with clinical parameters revealed a link between lineage and outcome, with VNB lineage having worse survival (HR 3.35, CI 1.51-7.20, p=0.003) even after adjusting for known indicators and treatment. Phenotypic assays on a subset of 89 isolates showed lineage-associated virulence, with VN displaying increased lacc activity (p=0.001) and CSF survival (p=0.000). This indicates Cryptoccus is a heterogeneous pathogen and lineage plays a role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection. Understanding genetic diversity in Africa will help investigate how diversity is structured across environments and assess risks posed to infection.
Researchers have identified a key component of the signaling pathway that regulates the white phenotype of the fungus Candida albicans, a pathogen that can cause infections in humans. The component, called Tec1, is a transcription factor that controls the response to pheromone, a molecule that triggers the white phenotype. This pathway is a new example of how signaling pathways can evolve, as it has components from different ancestral programs in the fungus. The upstream part of the pathway comes from the mating process, the middle part from filamentation, and the downstream part from biofilm formation. This evolution of the pathway provides a model for how signaling pathways can change over time. Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that has not had time to replace or modify its components in response to new pressures. The study of this pathway gives insight into the evolution of new signaling and may be a paradigm for other pathways. The white and opaque pathways of Candida alb share some components with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but have different relationships. The opaque pathway shares components with the haploid pherone response of cerevisiae.
Researchers investigated the variation in genomic GC content among bacteria, which ranges from less than 20% to over 70%. They tested the hypothesis that this variation is due to differences in mutation patterns by examining synonymous polymorphism datasets from 149 bacterial species. The study found a significant excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations in GC-rich bacteria, but not in AT-rich bacteria, across diverse species. This pattern cannot be explained by mutation bias, as it would imply GC-rich bacteria are losing GC content, which is unsustainable. Translational selection or gene conversion is also unlikely, as optimal codons are AT-rich and excess GC→SNPs are seen in datasets with no recombination evidence. Therefore, the study concludes there is selection for increased GC content in many species. Since GC content is correlated with genomic content, there is also selection on base composition in bacteria.

The researchers tested if GC content is a result of mutation bias by analyzing synonymous variation in 149 species. They found a large excess of GC→SNPs at 4-fold degenerate sites in GC-rich bacteria, with AT-rich showing the opposite. Patterns are seen across phyla and classes, not limited to specific groups. Datasets from 8 phyla, 15 classes, and 77 genera were used, with at least 8 species and 10 SNPs at 4-fold sites. GC→AT nucleotide diversity was less 0.1. GC-rich have a genuine excess of GC→ mutations, while AT-rich may be due to infinite sites violation. Half of species have Z<0.5 with low diversity, reducing violations: 14 of 25.
Researchers have developed a new approach to map the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections (STH) in Kenya, using data from 106,370 individuals surveyed between 1974 and 2009. They combined ecological and climatic factors from high-resolution satellite data with survey locations to predict the probability of infection exceeding 20% across the country for 1989 and 2009. Maps for each species were integrated to estimate combined STH prevalence, adjusting for associations between species. Population data was combined with models to estimate the population at risk and requiring treatment in 2009. Results show high endemicity below 20% in most areas, with areas ≥20% around Lake Victoria and coast. Comparison of 198 and 2009 distributions show STH prevalence decreased over time. The model estimated 2.8 million school-age children in districts warrant mass treatment. Bayesian geostatistical models can estimate combined prevalence and suggest a quarter of Kenya's school children live in high-prevalence areas warranting treatment. Control reducing infection, updated models can refine decision-making in helth.
Researchers studied how the immune system fights Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis. They found that a type of immune cell called innate lymphocytes, specifically invariant NKT cells, play a key role in controlling the infection. These cells recognize infected macrophages and produce interferon-γ, a cytokine that activates macrophages to kill bacteria. The study used a lab system to test this and found that NKT cells are necessary for controlling bacterial replication. They also found that even small numbers of N cells can restrict bacterial growth. To see if N cells help in real life, they transferred them into mice infected with Mtb and found that they reduced bacterial load in the lungs. This is the first evidence that N cells protect against Mtb in the body.
Researchers have studied how a protein called Bacillus subtilis spore coat transglutase (Tgl) helps form strong chemical bonds between proteins in the coat that surrounds bacterial spores. Unlike other similar enzymes, T is produced in an active form and doesn't need additional factors to work. However, its activity needs to be controlled to avoid unwanted reactions. The study found that substrates attached to the spore before T production guide T to its location on the sp surface. T's ability to recognize these substrates is crucial for its localization. The researchers identified specific sites on T that interact with substrates and found that one side of T is more important for assembly than the other. The first step in T's reaction, interacting with substrates and forming a chemical intermediate, also determines its location. This suggests T helps "lock" in place" pre-assembled complexes on the sp's surface. The study also showed that T becomes part of the cross-linked products during reaction. The researchers propose that T's dependency on substrates controls time, location, and extent of its activity to fortify pre-assembled complexes on the sp's surface.
Opisthorchis vivini, a foodborne trematode species, causes biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma in Laos. An estimated 2.5 million individuals are infected, but epidemiological studies are scarce and spatial distribution unknown. A study aimed to map O. vivini in southern Laos, identify risk factors, and predict prevalence at unsurveyed locations. A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire was conducted in 51 villages in Champas province in 2007. Data on demographics, socioeconomic status, water, sanitation, and behavior were combined with remotely sensed environmental data into a geographical system. Bayesian statistical models identified risk factors and spatial pattern of O. vivini. Prevalence among 3,371 participants was 61.1%. Age, Lao ethnic group, education, occupation (farmer, fisherman, animal breeder), and unsafe water source were risk factors. History of praziquel treatment, access sanitation, and distance to freshwater were protective. Spatial O. vivini were governed by environmental factors, with two risk profiles: low in mountains, high in Mekong corridor. A map of O viv infection in Champas province is presented, important for targeting control efforts. Infection is associated with exposure to fish, behavior, culture, and lack of sanitation.

A geostat approach was used to understand O viv distribution and risk. The model predicted prevalence at all locations, despite large intervals. Two risk zones were identified: high, low. This study provides insight into O viv in Champack and emphasizes environmental factors. Infection appears to be focal at small scale. Bayesian methods incorporate spatial structure, offering features over classical approaches. Spatial models explained risk variability better than non-spatial. The role of environment pertains to fish, Lao preference for raw dishes, lack of sanitation sustains transmission. Prevalence in Champ is alarming, calling for public interventions.
In the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the presence of Anopheles and Cule mosquito larvae is common, which can lead to the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria. However, the importance of drains as larval habitats is unknown. Researchers analyzed data from the Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special survey in 2006 to determine the type of habitats focusing on drains. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors impacting the presence of mosquito larvae. The study found that more than 70% of larval habitats in Dar Sala were human-made. Aquatic habitats associated with agriculture had the highest proportion of Anophe larvae and second of Cule larvae. However, the majority of aquatic habitats were drains, 42% and 43% of all culicine and 33 of anopheline habitats were drains. Compared to drains with flowing water, the odds of Anophe and Cx larvae were 8.8 and 6.3 times larger, respectively, in drains with stagnant water. There was a positive association between vegetation and mosquito presence. The proportion of habitats with larvae was spatially correlated. Restoring and maintaining drains in Dar Sala has the potential to eliminate more than 40% of mosquito larval habitats treated with laricides by UMCP.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection leads to changes in lipid metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected cells, favoring viral replication. Previous research showed that DENV inhibits the phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), creating a cholesterol-rich environment for viral replication. This study found higher MG activity in DENV-infected cells, associated with inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMP inhibition by metformin reduced MG activity, suggesting AMP inactivation mediates enhanced MG activity. Reduced AMP phosphorylation activity was observed in D-infected cells at 12 and 24 hours post-infection. MG and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, suggesting MG and AMP activity in replicative complex formation. Metform and lovastatin, an MG inhibitor, altered co-localization and replicative formation, indicating active MG required for complex formation. Metform showed dose-dependent antiviral effect in D-infected cells, while compound C, an AMP inhibitor, increased viral copies and infected cells. PP2, a modulating MG phosphatase, was not affected by D-infection. Data show elevated MG activity in D-infected mediated AMP inhibition, not increased PP activity. Inhibition showed antiral effect in MG-independent manner. Results suggest D-infection increases MG through AMP inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol ER for replicative formation.
Researchers used computer simulations to study the movement of transfer RNA (tRNA) on the ribosome, a cellular machine that builds proteins. They found that the process can be broken down into two parts: slow, large movements and fast, small changes. The ribosome is thought to work like a "ratchet" machine, where random movements lead to big changes. To understand this, they looked at a simulation of the ribosome and found groups of residues that move together, like a rigid body. These movements are important for RNA transfer. The study provides a way to connect the energy and speed of the process, giving an upper limit to the energy barrier. This framework can be used for other processes with many steps and states.
Researchers have explored the genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a rare malignancy that accounts for up to 3-5% of thyroid cancers. They analyzed 84 sporadic MTC samples and 36 normal thyroid tissues using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel, discovering 101 mutations in 18 genes. The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene, occurring in 47 cases, followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threon kinase 11, v-Hardyuckerman 4 sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, mut homolog 1, Kiest sarcoma viral oncogene hom, and proto-oncogene. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and break-ap fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), with 2 of 98 cases positive for ALK. Targeted sequencing identified Glutaminefructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GF1)-ALK and echoderm microtubule-associated protein 4 (E4)-ALK fusions. PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the GF1-ALK fusion, indicating an intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. A metastatic M case with E4ALK showed a dramatic response to AL inhibitor crizotin. The study found several mutations in MTC and first identified AL fusions in M, suggesting E4ALK may be a driver and target for AL inhibitors, and GFALK a candidate for molecular therapy.
A study was conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India to evaluate the role of asymptomatic Leishmanias in the transmission of Visceral Leishiasis (VL) in the region. The goal of the study was to understand how asymptomatic individuals contribute to the spread of the disease and their potential to develop into symptomatic Visc Leishias or Post-Kala D Leishias (PKDL). A total of 289 people were screened for Leishial antibody using rapid diagnostic kits, and 185 were found positive. Of these, 96 had a history of VL or PK and 89 did not. 79 were classified as asymptomatic Leishias and 10 as VL. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was 7.9:1. Among the asymptomatic cases, 2 were lost to follow-up as they moved to other areas. Progression to disease in asymptomatic individuals occurred up to 3 years after the survey. If no VL or PK cases are present for 2 years, it does not mean the area is free of Leishias, as symptomatic VL or PK may appear after 3 years if asymptomatic cases are present. Asympt individuals need attention for VL elimination program initiated by adjoining countries. The study found a prevalence of 3.16% asympt Leish infection in the population, lower than previous studies in Bihar. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was 7.9:1.
Researchers used a technique called Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze genetic rearrangements in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. These rearrangements can lead to diseases and cancer. They found that the presence of a repetitive element called Ty on a non-essential chromosome arm of the yeast genome increased genome instability due to increased formation of non-reciprocal translocations. Using MLPA, they analyzed large numbers of these rearrangements and found that the distribution of translocations induced by Ty in a wild-type strain was random. The majority of these translocations were mediated by six targets on four different chromosomes, even though there were 254 potential targets in the yeast genome. The majority of Ty-mediated translocations resulted from RAD-dependent recombination, but a number of non-recipro trans were mediated by RAD-independent recombination between Ty elements. RAD-independent trans did not require Rad51 or Rad59 proteins or Rad1-10 endonuc complex. Defects in ASF-RT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 resulted in increased rearrangements and whole-chromosome duplications, and aneup that occurred with rearrang.
Researchers have developed a new method called Semi-Definite-based Underestimation (SD) to improve protein docking, which is the process of associating two proteins. Docking is driven by energy funnels, areas where interactions are favorable near the native state. SD minimizes functions with funnel-shaped basins, but applying it to rotational and translational space (SE(3) is challenging due to its geometry. The team introduced a strategy to separate variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance, and angular orientations. Removing the center-to-center distance improved efficiency, as the five-dimensional space has a well-behaved surface for underestimation. This method explores energy surfaces of complexes corresponding to local energy minima, similar to macromolecular association through collisions. Results show the energy landscape is a funnel in a broad neighborhood of the native and SD generates predictions with less than 5Å RMSD and a 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods.

The application of SD to protein-protein docking validates that the energy landscape is a funnel near the native. However, direct application in SE(3 fails to yield underestimators. The most favorable distances occur when proteins are in contact but not overlap, so it explores energy spanned encounters. Results show methods discover energy funnels, quality predictions, and substantial gain compared to Monte Carlo.

The docking problem is defined by fixing the first protein's position and orientation, six variables for the second's position and orientation, and variables for side-chains. Minimizing the energy function with respect to side-chains is done by local methods. Theoretical convergence to the minimum is guaranteed under some conditions, but practical problems don't satisfy them. SD was applied to docking using a quadratic underestimation, but the search space was not discussed and only bound problems were used.
