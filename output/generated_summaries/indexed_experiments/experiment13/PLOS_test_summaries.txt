Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of cases of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) cases in the past two decades, but pockets of infection remain and it's essential to assess which areas are on track for elimination and where efforts should be focused. A mathematical model was developed for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to capture the dynamics of the disease at a local level of 10,000 people. This is the first time a stochastic model has been directly fitted to data, allowing for better understanding of uncertainty. The model was applied to 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kwu province, reflecting spatial heterogeneity in cases. Under current strategies, the area Kinamba II, with a third of the zone's cases, is expected to be last for elimination. Deterministic and stochastic models were compared, with deterministic being faster but producing similar results. This suggests using deterministic fits for larger areas and stochastic for projections to capture variation and elimination estimations.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze the tumor microenvironment (ME) of cancer patients, which contains information about the cancer through its cellular and spatial distribution of cells and immune populations. The goal is to explore variations in ME between patients and predict outcomes such as survival and treatment success with immunotherapies. The new method uses spatial functions to summarize relationships in ME and applies data analysis to predict outcomes and identify important relationships. This approach was tested on simulated data and real data from triple-negative breast and lung cancer patients. 

The method starts by creating functions for cell-cell interactions in images, reduces dimensions using principal analysis, and combines with patient data such as age and sex. A random model is used to predict outcomes. Spatial functions have been used in ME analysis before. An example shows the distribution of immune cells around tumor cells in a breast cancer patient. 

This paper presents a new method for analyzing rich ME data. It compares ME and clinical data from two groups and develops a model to identify differences in cell, protein, or mixture distribution. The model also predicts a new patient's group using ME data. Various technologies are available, each with benefits and trade-offs. Comparing ME, relationships between cell types, such as tumor and immune cells, or proteins, predict outcomes and guide interventions.
Researchers studied how abnormal neural synchronization in the brain, which is linked to several disorders, affects brain function. They computationally analyzed how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure change, particularly during synchronization and how they are affected by external perturbations. To investigate the impact of different plasticity mechanisms, they combined a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic and structural plasticity: (i) spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), (ii) homeostatic structural plasticity (SP), (iii) a combination of ST and SP, and (iv) a combination of ST and SP with weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate diverse neuronal firing timescales, they introduced a simple stochastic model, enabling detailed analysis. Network theory revealed that structural reorganization enhances network synchrony. Weaker connections were preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony was achieved with sparser connections than in ST-only model. Strengthening contacts from high-firing to low-firing neurons and weakening in opposite direction, followed by removal, allowed strong synchrony with fewer connections. This reorganization resulted in degree-degree correlations and assortativity. They compared desynchronization in ST-only model with desynchronization models (iii and iv). Latter required higher intensity for long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform preclinical and clinical studies using invasive or non-invasive modalities to induce lasting relief, e.g., Parkinson's disease.
Researchers have studied how some animals, like planarians, can regenerate large parts of their nervous system after injuries. They found that neurons and glia (supporting cells) are made from different types of stem cells. In planarians, neurons express a protein called delta-2 at specific positions in the central and peripheral nervous system. Glia are made from mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors that express Notch-1. Inhibiting delta-2 or Notch-1 reduced glia, but not other phocytic cell types. Losing delta-2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation, while transplanting delta-2-express neurons made gl at an ectopic location. The study suggests that delta-2-express neurons instruct phoc progenitors to become glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration and pattern of cell types.

A model was proposed where delta-2-express neurons interact with Notch-express phoc progenitors to regenerate planarian neurons and glia. Delta-2 acts in neurons and Notch in phoc progenitors during gl regeneration. This presents a solution to the challenge of coordinated regeneration between neurons and glia, where delta-2 on neurons and Notch on phoc progenitors specify gl fate and differentiation. The mechanism is modular, allowing evolution of new gl configurations in the nervous system by neurons acquiring or losing delta-2 and accessing phoc progenitors.

Notch signaling's role in neuronlia development led researchers to explore its role in planarian gl regeneration. Notch signaling is essential for cell fate and patterning in Metazoa. The study suggests a mechanism between nervous system and phoc progen specifies glia.
Researchers have developed new approaches to create HIV vaccines that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. To understand how these vaccines work, they studied the role of gamma-delta (γδ) T cells in the early stages of HIV infection. They looked at participants who developed broad neutralizing antibodies and compared to those who did not. They found differences in γδ cell surface markers between the two groups. γ cells were activated early in the first weeks of infection and associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on δ1 cells and CD57 on δ2 cells were higher in broad neutralizers and associated with development of neutral breadth later. Levels of CD16 on δ1 cells also linked to early Env-specific IgM production. 

In contrast, δ1 cells expanded during chronic infection and not with viral load. Expression of CD16 δ1 and CD57 δ2 during early infection were higher in broad and associated with development of neutral later. Levels of CD16 δ1 associated with early Env IgM production. 

The study looked at γ cells before and during HIV infection in 217 individuals identified as 'broad' and 'non-road' neutralizers. Found δ2 cells reduced early and loss associated with viral load. Understanding how γ cells promote neutral antibodies could help develop vaccines targeting these to improve humoral responses, especially broad and neutral to HIV-1 Env. 

The study evaluated frequency and phenotype of γ cells from pre-HIV and during infection in participants with or without neutral breadth. Found δ cells lower at 18 post first HIV positive in broad, reflecting higher viral load. CD16 on δ1 and δ2 as well as CD57 δ2 higher in broad.
Researchers have found that cancer cells secrete two proteins, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), which work together to enhance the spread of cancer to other parts of the body. Blocking these proteins with a new type of antibody, called a bispecific antibody, reduced cancer spread in mouse models. Bispecific antibodies are promising for treating cancer because they can target two proteins at once, but understanding how they work is key to making them effective. A model was created to study how bis antibodies bind to IL-6 and IL-8 receptors. The model showed that the balance between binding to one or two receptors affects how well the antibody works, providing insights for designing new treatments. 

A bispecific antibody, BS1, was made to target IL-6 and IL-8 receptors, which drive cancer spread. The model included equations for receptors, antibodies, and their complexes. To better target IL-6 and IL-8, a new bis antibody, BS1, was engineered against IL-6 and IL8 receptors. BS1 has two arms with antibodies against IL-6 and IL-8. Data suggest targeting IL-6, IL-8, and their receptors is a good way to stop cancer spread and death. Monoclonal antibodies have been used to treat cancer for 20 years due to their specificity, stability, and actions. 

Simulations of BS binding to IL-6 and IL-8 showed that the amount of receptors and their ratio affects how well the antibody works. When IL-6 and IL-8 are equal, bis binding is like two separate antibodies.
Researchers studied how centrosomes, which are structures that help organize spindles in most cell types, but are lacking in most oocytes. They found that in C. elegans oocytes, microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards from chromosomes to form poles, but forces must be balanced to create a stable structure. Microtule dynamics must also be controlled to maintain length and organization. The study focused on Z-8, a conserved doubleort-family kinase, the mammalian homolog of microtub-associated protein upregulated in many cancers. Z- depletion from oocytes resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects. Experiments with monopolar spindles showed Z- led to excess forces within the spindle, suggesting a role in regulating force-generating motor BM-1/kines-5. Z- is also required for microtule dynamics within the oocyte and kinase for function during meiosis and mitosis. The study reveals new roles for Z- in oocytes and how centrosomal spindles are stabilized for faithful meiosis. Z- regulates microt dynamics to facilitate proper turnover of microtules within the spindle and influences activity of motors that walk on microtules to build and stabilize the spindle. It has a microtub-binding doubleort domain and kinase domain. Previous studies showed Z- is required for spindle positioning in C eleg mitotically dividing embryos and modulates microule dynamics in mitosis. This study shows Z- is required for assembly and stability of oocyte spindle and kinase for functions in mitosis and meiosis, and reveals roles in modulating microule and motor forces within oocyte.
Researchers investigated the relationship between circulating metabolites, type 2 diabetes (T2), and genetics in the UK Biob dataset. They analyzed 249 metabolites, 92% of which were lipids, and found 79 associated with T2, spanning lipid classes except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites were causally affected by T2, spanning all classes, including branched amino acids. Using interaction trait locus analysis, four metabolites were consistently replicated in an Estonian dataset, with genetic loci in different regions showing regulation in T2 cases compared to controls. Variants from this analysis were significant for metabolites in the population but not associated with T risk, suggesting T's impact on genetic regulation. Through differential analysis, 165 metabolites were associated with microvascular, macro, or both types of T complications, with few discriminating between classes. Of these, 40 were not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting mechanisms specific to complications. This study provides a map of T's consequences on metabolite levels and regulation, enabling understanding of T trajectory to complications.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonizes humans and causes infections, ranging from mild to life-threatening conditions. They found two ways the host can survive infection: resistance and tolerance. Resistance limits the pathogen's burden, while tolerance limits the health impact of the pathogen. In previous work, they established that mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection, while CC024 is tolerant. To identify genes involved in tolerance, they crossed CC061 and CC mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MR infection in F and F generations was 65% and 55, following a complex inheritance pattern for CC increased survival. Colonization in F animals was more extreme than parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. They identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. The WSBi allele in CC mice contributed to MR tolerant phenotype. Two genes, Car1 and Car2, have high-impact variants in this region. Car and Car are receptors for complement Ca, anaphylato, triggering a massive immune response. They hypothesize Ca may have altered binding variant in CC mice, reducing cytokine damage and tolerance to higher pathogen and longer survival.
Researchers studied how genetic interactions between genes affect the ability of a population to adapt to its environment. They found that these interactions can limit the availability of beneficial genetic traits and create complex distributions of fitness effects among mutations. Current models of evolution often ignore these interactions and consider only additive relationships between genes and traits. The study used a simple regulatory network to model and simulated adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. They found that both models had fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected and a complex distribution of fitness among mutations. The network model had a bimodal distribution with a considerable density of deleterious mutations. This is similar to the cost of complexity where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. The results suggest that genetic networks can generate complex distributions of fitness effects. 

The study combined biological modeling with tools to evaluate the distribution of beneficial mutations during adaptive walks. It found differences from classical expectations in some cases. Understanding genetic influence on adaptation is an under-explored area, particularly in distribution of fitness effects. Both models showed similarities in adaptive walks, number of steps and distribution of effects among beneficial mutations. However, network models had fewer large-effect mutations than additive as the walk went on. This was highlighted by difference in responses to selection: rate of trait evolution. Network simulations approached optimum slower than additive on average. 

The study explored a simple network's influence on evolution during adaptive scenario. Models have relied on genotype-phenotype relationships, overlooking gene networks that drive expression. The distribution of fitness changed when non-additive maps were considered. This affects a population's chance to adapt to environment. A simple regulatory motif motivated the approach and nonlinear map into adaptive theory. A trait lies a network of genes and elements controlling protein expression.
Researchers have proposed a new understanding of how the brain's cortical circuits integrate information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. They suggest that neurons are naturally equipped to optimally perform this integration using a Bayesian approach. In this view, apical dendrites represent prior expectations of somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, effective potentials and conductances. The researchers demonstrate that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment computes the corresponding posterior. They also derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their reliabilities. This theory explains various findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration and makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and plasticity.

The study interprets the physics of neurons as Bayesian computations, showing that conduct-based models naturally compute posterior distributions from likelihood and prior in dendritic compartments. Somatic membrane dynamics is derived from gradient ascent on posterior, and synaptic plasticity matches posterior to a target distribution. Before plasticity, they discuss a consequence for dynamics from the Bayesian view. Conduct-based integration predicts properties differ from classical models, with somatic reflecting prior in absence of input. Dendritic adjusts reliability to past success in matching somatic distributions. Simulations demonstrate learning a multisens task.
Researchers have used the AlphaFold database to predict the structure of proteins from 48 whole proteomes, covering over 226,000 amino acids. They classified 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins, with 90% accuracy. The study focused on eukaryotes and bacteria, finding that eukotes have more disordered regions and unassigned domains, and a higher proportion of globular and small repeats. Shared domains between eukotes and bacteria include Rossm, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. The researchers compared homolog groups from the proteome to the Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) reference and found that accurate structure predictions converged with sequence classifications for well-understood families. However, less populated homolog groups showed structural classification of previously unannotated domains by sequence. The study suggests that domain classification strategies for large protein sets can be improved by combining structure and sequence predictions.
Researchers have studied the life cycle of BK polyomavirus (BKPy), a common cause of kidney failure in transplant patients with no effective treatment. They found that the virus relies on the host cell cycle to express its large antigen (TAg) and produce new viruses. This contradicts the current model where TAg is expressed early and pushes the cell into the S phase for replication. Instead, BKV requires an initial S phase to replicate, similar to other small DNA viruses like papilloma and adenoviruses. The study used single-cell analysis to track TAg expression throughout the cell cycle and found robust expression in cells with more than 4N DNA content, suggesting BKV production depends on initial S phase. To confirm, they used inhibitors that only affect host replication, not viral, and found both TAg and viral production rely on initial S phase. BKV is unusual as it replicates host DNA and requires re-replication for replication. The current model proposes early TAg causes S entry for viral replication, but this study shows canonical licensing and firing mechanisms are required for re-replication. The findings change our understanding of BKV life cycle, requiring initial S for robust TAg and viral production. Late gene expression showed VP2/3 follows TAg as cells progress to re-replication, suggesting infectious viruses form in replicating cells. This aligns with BKV model where TAg precedes late proteins but replication after cell reaches 4N.
Researchers have developed a new method called FIO to identify genes associated with binary traits, such as diseases. This method, called transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), combines gene expression studies with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Unlike existing methods, FIO models all genes on a chromosome at once to capture correlations between genes, increasing its power. FIO uses a probit model to link gene expression to binary outcomes, accounting for correlations among genes on the same chromosome. This reduces false discoveries and increases power compared to existing methods. The researchers tested FIO on six diseases in the UK Biob dataset and found it reduced the number of causal genes by 27.9-36% to 36.9%. FIO prioritized genes associated with diseases, such as GATA for asthma, ABC2 for gout, and SHB for hypertension. FIO is an effective tool for TWAS of binary traits.
Researchers have discovered that two proteins, Btn2 and Hsp, play a crucial role in protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when cells are exposed to hydrogen peroxide, leading to protein misfolding and aggregation. Normally, misfolded proteins are either refolded or degraded, but when they evade this process, they are sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent dysfunction and toxicity. Btn and Hsp act as sequeases, sequestering oxidized proteins into defined proteolytic quality control (PQC) sites after exposure. Without them, oxidized proteins accumulate, leading to toxicity. The absence of Btn and Hsp makes cells sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. Overexpressing Hsp, a protein that breaks down aggregates, rescues this sensitivity. The researchers found that the Sup35 translation factor is an in vivo sequease substrate and that Btn and Hsp suppress the formation of the Sup35 prion, an amyloid form. In sequease mutants, prion formation doesn't require insoluble protein localization, where amyloids are thought to fragment and propagate. Instead, both amorph and amyloid Sup35 are increased in Btn Hsp mutants, suggesting prion forms at multiple sites during oxidative stress without sequease activity. The study identifies protein sequestration as a key antioxidant mechanism mitigating protein-induced aggregation damage.
Researchers conducted a large-scale CRISPR screen to identify non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with glioblastoma (GB) invasion. Most studies on GB have focused on coding genes, but few have evaluated the role of non-coding RNAs without protein-coding potential in invasion. They used CRISPR-interference (CRPR) to evaluate the function of GB-associated lRNAs in an unbiased screen, characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates. A CRPR lRNA loss-of-function screen was implemented to evaluate the association of lRNA knockdown (KD) with invasion in Matrig. Top candidates were validated using CRPR and oligonucleotide (AS)-mediated knock in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Atlas (TA) and Genotypeissue (GT) survival analysis. Mediators of lRNA effect were identified via differential expression following lRNA KD and assessed for invasion knock and rescue experiments. Forty lRNAs were significantly associated with a 33-83% decrease in invasion (p<0.01) upon knock. The top candidate, LINC45, demonstrated an 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knock, while LINC45 expression was associated with patient survival and tumor grade (p<0.0001). RNA analysis of L45 knock revealed WAS3, implicated in tumor studies, was highly correlated with lRNA, while WAS KD was associated with decrease in invasion. WAS overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive lost with L45 KD. CR screening identified L45, a previously unannotated lRNA, as critical to GB invasion Gene expression is associated with grade and survival.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes sequences of auditory stimuli using electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of sounds generated by a stochastic process. They developed a new clustering method to identify patterns in the EEG signals that correspond to the brain's internal model of the sequence. The goal was to determine the type of model the brain uses to recognize patterns in the sequence of sounds. Previous studies assumed specific types of models, but the actual type used by the brain was unknown. The new method grouped EEG signals based on their similarity, allowing for a more efficient model of the data. By applying this approach, the researchers found that the brain uses the repetition of certain sounds to build a model of the sequence. The sequence was generated by a tree with probabilities for each next sound based on the previous sounds. The study shows that the brain selects a model based on strong patterns in the sequence of sounds.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, but has limitations. It fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcript-size (total number of transcripts per cell) and dissociation/processing-induced crypt gene expression, particularly in heterogeneous tissues that require dissociation for analysis. This leads to discrepancies between bulk RNA-seq results and reconstituted bulk-seq using sc-se data. To address this, researchers propose a computationally calculated "cell-specific weighting factor" (cWF). They introduce a concept and method for computing c and report WF for 76 cell types across 10 organs, validated by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk-se data using sc data and WF. WF also predict aging progression, suggesting diagnostic applications and association with aging mechanism. The study provides a method to solve sc-se limitations in complex tissues and suggests biological significance of WF.
Researchers have developed a new statistical approach called radial multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) to estimate the effect of multiple exposures on an outcome simultaneously. This method extends the traditional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, which uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of a single exposure on an outcome. However, MR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic variants, which affect multiple traits, violating one of its core assumptions. To address this, the researchers propose radial MR, a formulation of VM that visualizes the effect of each exposure in a VM analysis and allows for removal of outlying SNPs that violate assumptions. The radialVMR package implements this method and demonstrates its effectiveness through simulations and real-world analyses. 

Radial MR facilitates the assessment of pleotropic associations between genetic variants and phenotypes using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. It visualizes outliers and allows direct estimation of multiple exposures' effects simultaneously, making inspection and comparison challenging. The researchers present radialVM approach to visualize effects and identify SNPs outlying association with all exposures, then remove them to obtain unbiased results. RadialVM plots are useful for highlighting individual SNPs' contribution to heterogeneity with each exposure. Univar MR analyses result in biased estimates where SNs are associated with multiple relevant phenotypes. Radial MR estimates exposure-specific heterogeneity and statistics, tests instrument strength, and prunes SNs contributing to heterogeneity, then re-estimates the model without them.
Researchers studied the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly, over a period of 7 days to understand how their behavior changes across different timescales. They recorded the flies at 100 frames per second using a camera and used a deep learning framework to create a dataset of nearly 2 billion instances of the flies' postures. The team identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion and used the data to explore how the flies' behavior changes throughout the day and days. They found daily patterns in these behaviors, including trends in grooming, probis extension, and locom speed, which added to what is known about the flies' circadian cycle.

The study found a decline in probis extension and locom speed as the flies spent more time idle, and identified the hour after dawn as a unique time in their daily pattern. This hour tracked with other indicators of health, such as locom speed and time spent resting. High-resolution data revealed differences in morning and evening activity peaks, primarily in grooming behavior. Daily patterns were seen in all behaviors, including grooming, probis extension, and locomotion, with a decline in difference between day and night hours as the flies weakened and died, similar to weakening circadian rhythms with age.

The study aimed to understand interactions between timescales, from hours to lifespans, using an organism with various behaviors and short lifespan. Dophila melanaster has many behaviors, some spontaneous and simple, in isolated environments. Previous studies used coarse metrics, such as activity counts from Doph Activity Monitors, showing peaks in locom activity around morning and evening, anticipating lighting changes.
Researchers have identified a new functions for a protein called PTP-22 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, beyond its role in the immune system. They found that P-22 plays a role in molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. A genetic screen showed that loss of P-22 activity alleviated molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in related kinases NE-2 and NE-3, which act at the interface of membrane and actin regulation. To understand P- functions, researchers carried out proximity studies to identify interactors of P- during development. They found the guanine nucleotide exchange factor DN-1 as an in vivo partner of P. Loss of DN- also suppressed mol defects. Genetic, localization, and labeling studies revealed P in several epidermal complexes, including hemidesomes, suggesting P plays a role in maintaining tissue integrity. Proximity labeling also implicated P in functions to nucleoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline, nearly one-third of identified P proximity are gran components. These studies highlight the utility of genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel functions.
Malaria cases and deaths in Africa and India are expected to increase significantly if artem resistance expands. To understand the spread of artem resistance in Southeast Asia is crucial for health organizations to prioritize malaria control measures. However, data on artem resistance are limited. Researchers used a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network on non-synonymous mutations in the Kel 13 gene associated with artem resistance and a Bayesian geostat model to produce spatio-temporal predictions oftem resistance. Maps show expansion of the K mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 200 to 202, with the most change between 2010 and 2015. The study provides critical information for malaria elimination in Southeast Asia by predicting spatio-temp patterns and extents oftem resistance at the subcontinent level.

A geostat model of molecular markers associated with artem resistance in the Kel 13 gene was developed and calibrated to the most comprehensive dataset from the WorldWideimal Resistance Network. Spatio-temp maps of K marker prevalence will support monitoring of resistance in Southeast, targeting strategies and elimination efforts. No fine-scale predictive maps exist fortem within Asia, but molecular markers associated with resistance can be used. A significant amount of data on K markers exists, allowing predictive spatio-temp maps to be presented for the first time of artem resistance in the Greaterong Subregion.

The study provides data-driven predictive maps of artem resistance in the Greaterong Sub, providing estimates for locations with no data. Health agencies can use these maps to guide prioritization of surveillance and policies to prevent resistance spread. A previous study quantified the spread of K mutations with a similar model-based framework, but predictions were only for Myanmar in 2014 based on limited data. The results are consistent with earlier work and data on ar resistance spread.
Researchers have found that two proteins, NLR1 and CARD8, play a crucial role in the body's immune response to infection. These proteins exist in different forms due to a process called autoproteolysis, resulting in full-length, cleaved N-terminal, and cleaved-terminal peptides. These peptides form autoinhibitory complexes, which regulate the immune response. However, the mechanism behind this process was unclear. The study found that NLR and CARD form autohibitory complexes involving N-terminal and cleaved-terminal interactions, with distinct mechanisms. The linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 plays a role in forming N-terminal autohibitory, while Z5 of rat NLR and CARD mediate N-terminal interaction. Additionally, the protease dipeptid peptidase 9 (DPP9) was involved in these complexes, interacting with N-terminal of NLR1 and CARD through Z5. However, D9 cannot bind to N-terminal of human NLR. Functional assays showed that D9 is involved in N-terminal complex of rodent NLR and CARD, but does not affect inhibitory activity. This study enhances understanding of regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in immune response and highlights complexity of their interactions.
Researchers have found that defects in protein homeostasis, or the balance of proteins within cells, can lead to proteotoxic stress, which affects cellular fitness and overall health. In various tissues, cell-based mechanisms detect and eliminate compromised cells, known as "losers," by healthier neighbors. However, the connection between proteotoxic stress and cell survival remains unclear. This study reveals the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localized protein R1 (Rer1) in regulating protein homeostasis in the Drosophila wing epithelium. Results show that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukary initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Analysis found that R1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through competition. Interestingly, R1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression, causing overgrowth under prote stress. Results suggest that increased R1 levels provide protection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating prote stress and supporting overgrowth.
Researchers have found that mutations in the CHEK2 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. However, most of the 3,188 amino acid changes caused by non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of CHE2 have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHE2-encoded protein (CHK2). To test the function of these variants, researchers used a method called yeast complementation, where they tested the ability of CHE2 variants to complement a yeast ortholog of CHE2, RAD53. This method has been used to provide information on over 100 CHE2 SNVs and aligns with functional assays in human cells and pathogenicity. In this study, researchers tested all 4,887 possible SNs in the CHE2 reading frame for ability to complement RAD53 using a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS). Of the non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein while 2,417 were tolerated. The results correlate with previous structure and function data and provide a new functional assay for variants of uncertain significance in clinical databases. This approach can be used to predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants found in screening and applied to other cancer genes.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae controls its genetic and physical traits. The bacterium forms multiple populations with different genetic and physical characteristics, such as opaque and transparent colonies, due to changes in the hS genes in the opacity-determin locus. The researchers found that the Spx1-TA toxin-antitoxin system regulates the orientations of hS inversions and associated traits, such as colony opacity. The system is a type II toxin-antoxin system, where toxin TenA is repressed by its antitoxin Spx1. Overexpression of Ten leads to growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S. pneumonia, while antitox Spx1 represses the transcription of the sp1-ten operon. Ten binds to ribosome factor Rim, reducing alternative factor ComX, which activates transformation genes. Reduced ComX enhances transcription of invertase psr, favoring transparent colony-associated hS configurations. Moderate Ten expression reshapes pneumoccal epigen and colony. Spontaneous variations in the promoter region generate subpopulations with epetic and phenotypic diversity.
Researchers have developed a new method called generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA) to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions and extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), cannot accomplish this because they operate on one dataset at a time. Contrastive PCA was proposed to address this problem but has limited adoption due to requiring a hyperparameter, resulting in multiple solutions with no way of knowing which is correct, and treating foreground and background conditions differently. gcPCA is a flexible, hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. It analyzes the covariance of datasets to find dimensions that exhibit largest changes between conditions. This builds on contrast PCA but eliminates the need for hyperparameter. gc is useful for analyzing high-dimensional biological data, such as detecting hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity in type II diabetes single-cell sequencing. It is a fast, robust, and easy-to-use method for comparing datasets to gain insights into complex phenomena.
Researchers have created a detailed model of how B cell receptor (BCR) signaling works in Burkitt lymphoma cells, a type of blood cancer. BCR signaling is crucial for B cell survival and maturation, but is often deregulated in B cell lymphomas. The team used data from two Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, BL-2 and BL-41, to build a semi-quantitative model of BCR signaling. The model revealed feedback and cros structures in the BCR network, including a negative cros from p38 to ME/ERK. This interaction was confirmed in different B and CD40 signaling in BL cells. The model was also applied to diffuse large B lymphoma cells with aberrant B signaling, showing that B aberration does not cause major rewiring. The model was transferable from BL-2 to BL-41 cells and to diffuse large B lymphoma cells. Three new connections were found: positive cros from mTOR to JNK, positive from GSK to ZAP, and negative from p38 to RAF/MEK. The model was used to describe B signaling in general, not just BL-2 cells.
Researchers have found that the Notch receptor network is crucial for tissue growth and maintenance, and its activity is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: cell-to-cell interactions between neighboring cells and cell-to-cell interactions within the same cell. Different combinations of Notch receptors and ligands elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, determining the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signaling. This study explored the molecular basis of Notch ligands DLL and JAG, which control angiogenic sprouting through a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches. They found two mechanisms underpin this process: DLL induces Notch receptor activation, while JAG blocks DLL cis-inhibition through a JAG/DLL complex. A new model of Not signaling was proposed, recapitulating tip and stalk cell formation necessary for sprouting. 

The study combined experimental and mathematical approaches to control Notch activity by DLL and J1, uncovering a new role for heteromeric JAG/DLL complexes enabling angiogenic sprouting by regulating endothelial cell differentiation into tip and stalk cells. Data showed hetereric J/DLL complex relieves Notch receptor inhibition, enabling efficient Not signaling. Experimental results suggest two factors underlie J1 antagonizing DLL for tip and stalk cell selection in sprouting. Consistent with findings, DLL homomers and DLL-J1 heteromers mediate Notch cis-inhibition. Angiogenic sprouting involves regulated interplay between Notch and VEGF receptor signaling, a new model was proposed. A model of Not signaling was presented, incorporating J1 antagonizing DLL through hetereric DLL-J1 complexes, underlying observed effects in sprouting.
Researchers have developed a new method called Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM) to improve clustering in bioinformatics and other fields. Clustering is used for exploratory analysis and prediction, but often ignores data uncertainty or measurement error. DPM uses uncertainty associated with data points to create more accurate clusters. Experiments show DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data and real data, including immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics. DPM separates autoimmune diseases from other subgroups like adult-onset arthritis. The method can also cluster gene expression datasets summarized by gene signatures. A new procedure was created to summarize a signature on a different dataset than where it was discovered, considering variability in expression across genes. Three gene datasets with IMD were analyzed using relevant signatures, and DPM clusters associated with disease were replicated across datasets. This work shows that data uncertainty should inform clustering and presents a method to do so, DPM. It also allows using gene signatures in different datasets than where they were defined, shown by summarizing gene expression in IMD patients using DPM. Clustering by GWAS features recapitulated known relationships in IMD and suggests using uncertainty in clustering, such as polygenic scores. The method of summarizing gene expression extends signature uses, taking variability into account, which DPM. Ignoring uncertainty led to clusters not associated with disease in two examples. Three gene signatures linked to IMD were used in three datasets, summarizing expression with mean and uncertainty. Bayesian methods offer advantages in conveying uncertainty and inferring clusters, DPM adapts a Dirichlet process model to uncertain data. Experiments show accounting for uncertainty alters clustering and performance on simulated and real data.
Researchers have found that deep neural networks, which are often used to model the human visual system, struggle to account for the importance of shape in human vision. Unlike humans, who rely heavily on shape to categorize objects, deep networks rely more on features like color and texture. This issue has been observed, but the reasons behind it are unclear. To investigate, researchers created artificial images where shape, color, and texture can be used to predict the class. They trained networks from scratch to classify with single features and combinations, showing some architectures can't learn shape, while others can use shape but are biased towards other features. The bias can be explained by interactions between weight updates in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests different algorithms with sparse, local changes are needed to make networks sensitive to shape and improve human-like vision.

The study used artificial images to understand why deep networks prefer color and texture over shape. Some architectures, like vision transformers, are structurally unable to learn shape, while convolutional networks develop bias despite learning shape-based classification. Instead of changing architecture, networks to recognize shape, changes to the learning algorithm are needed. Experiments show that color and texture bias arise from gradient dynamics, specifically how gradients align with classes. Breaking this requires changing gradients, except for spConv, all convolution networks show bias towards color or texture. Focusing on ConvNet, researchers found they can classify by shape but fail to learn if another feature predicts class. Humans and networks were compared on categorizing by shape, color, object, or single patch. Humans relied on shape, networks on other features like color or size. Researchers followed a similar approach to why networks fail shape classification, finding it's for color and texture networks but not shape. They hypothesize gradient dynamics explain bias, reducing alignment enables shape classification.
Researchers have developed a new model to study how liver cells called hepatic stellate cells (HSC) contribute to liver fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver function in chronic diseases. HSC produce a protein called extracellular matrix (ECM) that leads to fibrosis. The model uses a language called Kappa to study HSC dynamics during fib progression and reversion. HSC are modeled as cells with seven states that interact with a molecule called TGF1, which regulates their activation and secretion of collagen, a main component of ECM. Studies show HSC play a critical role in fib progression and reversion. Activated Hs are eliminated during reversion, but reactivation of inactivated Hs (iSC) sustain fib. The model is sensitive to TGF1 levels, suggesting it can adapt to different disease conditions. Data from a mouse model of liver fibrosis validated the model's predictions. It also predicts accumulation of iSC in chronic disease. RNA sequencing from patients with liver disease confirmed this, identifying iSC as markers of fibrosis. The study provides a model of H dynamics in liver disease and can explore iSC role in liver homeostasis. It can also be applied to fibrosis in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze data from multiple studies to understand how genetic factors affect health outcomes, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels. This method, called meta-analysis, is often used to combine data from many studies to find overall effects, but has limitations when dealing with large amounts of genetic data. The new method, called Meta2, can handle high amounts of genetic data and account for differences between studies, such as different testing methods used. It was tested on data from over 5,800 people in the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine program and showed it was efficient and accurate. The method can also look at individual genetic factors that affect outcomes, not just the overall effect. It was used to study how gene expression affects blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The method is available for use in a software package called Meta2 on GitHub.
Researchers have developed a new method, called PWH, to identify genes that drive cancer growth in individual patients. Unlike existing methods, PWH considers how genes interact with each other in a group of patients with the same mutations. This approach is important because patients with the same driver mutations often share the same cancer mechanism, but those with same passenger mutations do not. PWH was tested on 16 cancer datasets and outperformed existing methods in identifying known and specific drivers. It also found both common and rare drivers. Personalized driver profiles can help understand tumor heterogeneity and guide treatment. One predicted gene, low-density lipoprotein receptor 1, was validated to promote tumor growth in cell assays.

PWH integrates somatic mutations, gene expression, and interaction networks to predict drivers. It uses samples from the same cancer type to improve prediction. The method was tested on five cancer types and compared to other methods. PWH identified known and specific drivers better. It also found both common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles can help understand tumor heterogeneity and guide treatment.

PWH is a genome/transcript analysis that identifies drivers by gene influence on networks across samples. It hypothesizes that same cancer types share molecular characteristics and mechanisms. Leveraging same type samples improves prediction. PWH requires somatic, expression, and interaction for each cancer type. Predicted drivers were compared to other methods on overlap with known drivers. The number of known drivers identified by methods is shown for each type.

PWH was tested on 16 cancer datasets and outperformed existing methods. It identified known and specific drivers. Also, it found common and rare. Personalized profiles can help understand heterogeneity and guide treatment. One predicted gene, low-density liprotein 1, was validated to promote growth in cell assays.
Researchers have developed a computer model called the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) that simulates epilepsy by combining personalized brain anatomy with dynamic models of abnormal brain activity. This model can generate seizure patterns similar to those recorded by invasive methods like stereoelectro EEG, allowing for testing of hypotheses before surgery. To improve the model's accuracy, the researchers used a global optimization approach called SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm that uses parallel computing to find high-quality solutions without excessive time. They tested the model on synthetic data and found it outperformed other solvers in scalability and performance. Additionally, they used Bayesian optimization to fine-tune the model's parameters, improving accuracy and efficiency. The team also added a phase to quantify uncertainty in the model's parameters, assessing variability across different problems. This study has the potential to improve brain area estimation in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making. 

The researchers aimed to create an efficient and parallel solver for complex brain models related to epilepsy. They wanted a solver that could work on various platforms, from desktop to supercomputers. The model captures seizure dynamics and simulates intracran recordings, aiding surgical strategy and decision-making. VEP is a model that estimates parameters in a high-dimensional space to identify brain networks involved in seizure generation. Achieving accuracy in modeling is challenging, inferring information from data, such as brain networks from sterelect EEG. Optimizing parameters is key to understanding data-generating processes, like abnormal brain dynamics and connectivity.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health issue with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. While it is understood that TB is due to Mtb growth in the lungs, the rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of infected animals, such as monkeys or rabbits, are largely unknown. Researchers infected rabbits with a virulent M isolate of the Beijing lineage, H878, carrying an unstable plasmid p10, and found that p10 is more stable in H878 than a commonly used laboratory-adapted M strain H37. The kinetics of plid-bearing bacteria in M-infected rabbits did not follow an expected decline; the percent plid cells increased between 28-56 days post-infection and remained stable 84-112 days-in despite a large increase in bacterial numbers. Mathematical modeling suggested a non-monot change in plid cells can be explained by a lung M population of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics. A model with homogeneous M population could not explain the data when run stochastically. Results suggest bacterial dynamics in granulomas are independent.
Researchers have developed a new computational tool called GlycanModeler to predict the structure of carbohydrates, also known as glycans, attached to proteins. These glycans play a crucial role in many biological functions, but determining their structure is notoriously difficult. Glycaner uses data from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations to build glycans layer by layer. The tool was tested on various glycan structures and showed high accuracy in predicting native and experimental structures. It was also used to design a new glycan to shield a protein from antibody recognition, which was experimentally verified. This work can aid in predicting glycoprotein structure, glycan masking, and structure determination.

Glycobiology tools have been developed for glycosylation, validation, chemistry, analysis, and docking. Traditional methods involve molecular dynamics simulations or manual placement of glycans into density. Recent tools focus on building and refining structures using density, especially for complex glycans like HIV. Glycaner was tested for density-guided modeling and decoy discrimination.

Glycaner and associated tools can model glycans through de novo and density-guided modeling. The algorithm was optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity, achieving a median RMS of 2.7.7. The results show Glycaner can predict structures de novo, build into density, and coat protein surfaces.
In the fungus Penicillium oxalicum, the protein ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF (Skp-Cul1-F-box) complex plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality control by targeting specific substrates for degradation. The Skp1-Cul-F-box complex recognizes substrates through interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate, where the F-box determines specificity. However, the limited number of identified ubiquitin-ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the field. In P. oxalic, transcription factors such as Brl, CreA, Xln, and Ace1, conserved in filamentous fungi, regulate fungal development and transcription of hemi-cellulase genes. Transcription factor Ace1, also known as Slt, positively correlates with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively with expression of hemi-cellulase genes. The ubiquitinase-substrate pair SCFbx-Ace1 is identified in P. oxum, with most PoF23 present in free form within the nucleus and a small portion associating with Sk1 to form PoF23-Sk1 heterodimer. Under glucose, Po23 absence results in decreased transcription of brA gene, which encodes master for asexual development and spore pigmentation genes, and impaired conidiation. Under cellulose, transcription of hemi-cellase genes in Po23 mutant is upregulated. Po23 recognizes and activates transcription factor Ace, allowing it to regulate target genes with different effects under signals. Po23 acts as transcription coactivator, recognizing Ace, allowing latter to regulate transcription of target genes.
Researchers have studied the basement membrane (BM), a crucial component of tissues and organs, to understand how it forms and diversifies during development. They focused on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster's follicular epithelium, which relies on a BM composed of oriented fibrils and a homogenous matrix. The team found that two proteins, Rab10 and Rab8, define parallel routes for BM secretion. When both routes were blocked, BM production stopped, but genetic interactions showed they competed. Rab10 promotes lateral and planar-polarized secretion, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion, leading to fibril and homogenous BM formation, respectively. The dystroph-associated protein complex (DAP) and Rab10 are in a plan-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAP is essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards Rab10. The exocyst complex has a dual function: it interacts with dystroph to limit planar polarization and is required for Rab8 route. These results highlight BM secretion mechanisms and how diversity emerges from distinct routes control. 

In single cell analysis, diversification is due to Rab10 lateral planarized and Rab8 basal secretion. DAP is in the same compartment as Rab10 and influences planar polarization. The exocyst is required for homogenous BM formation. BM secretion and diversification are essential for development. This work shows how proteins are secreted in epithelial cells and diversification can arise from different routes with exit sites. These routes are integrated in polarity axes (apical, basal, planar). The synergic effect of Rab8 and10 suggests they are alternative routes with redundancy for BM.
Researchers have developed a new machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), which are crucial for HIV treatment. The model uses a technique called multi-task learning (MTL) that trains on multiple antibodies at once, improving predictions and addressing two main challenges: underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes in current datasets and combinations of antibodies needed to avoid resistance. The new model, called language-based universal model (LBUM), was trained on Env sequences with neutralization data and fine-tuned with both non-bnAb and bnAb data. It outperformed classical machine learning algorithms, random forests and gradient boosting, in predicting HIV-1 resistance to 33 antibodies. The study shows that MT can mitigate bias against underrepresented subtypes and learn patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict epitopes and select optimal bn combinations. This approach can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a blood cancer characterized by the abnormal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. Treatments for MM vary between patients, making it essential to develop predictive models for informed decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that pathway dysfunction is associated with disease progression. This study considered two strategies: pathway score method and grouplasso using pathway information. The former converted gene expression to pathway scores for fitting. Three methods (ssSEA, GS, GS, and z-scores) and 14 databases were used for pathway calculation. These methods were implemented in microarray data (GSE324) and a candidate model with best performance was obtained. The model was compared with gene-based and published models in external data. Results showed grouplass incorporating pathway (Vax) outperformed gene in both internal and external validation. Immune pathways were more predictive for MM. Vax also outperformed published models. The new model was resistant to missing values, and presence <5% did not deteriorate accuracy using imputation. Pathway-based models using grouplass were alternatives to gene-based for MM. These were documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM) with imputation method for future validation.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study how a protein called Drp regulates the division of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. When cells are injured, Drp helps mitochondria split into smaller pieces, which can lead to cell death. To understand how Drp works, the researchers created a system of equations to predict how Drp's activity changes over time. They found that the rate of mitochondria division depends on one key parameter, called mu, which represents the rate at which Drp breaks down into smaller pieces. Surprisingly, as mu increases, the rate of mitochondria division first increases and then decreases. This suggests that targeting Drp's ability to break down may have an unexpected effect on the division process. Understanding how Drp works may help find new treatments for cell death caused by injury. 

The model is based on how Drp interacts with other molecules on the mitochondria's outer layer and how it breaks down into smaller pieces. Since little is known about these interactions, the researchers tested different scenarios to see how they affect the rate of division. They found that the total number of divisions over time depends only on mu, making it a key factor in Drp-dependent division. Mitochondria division is the process of splitting into two smaller organelles. The model focuses on Drp's role after cell injury when its concentration increases. Drp stays on new mitochondria for a while, which could be added to the model with a delay or extra pool of division complexes. This would affect available Drp in the cell and make its concentration more important for division rate and total.
Researchers have developed a new gene drive system using CRISPR/Cas technology to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. The system targets the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in the fruit fly Drosoph suuk, a significant pest. The goal is to suppress the spread of disease and pests. However, a major challenge is the rapid evolution of resistance. To prevent this, the researchers used multiple gRNAs to target functional regions of the T2 gene. They found low levels of homing in the germline, but feeding octamine restored egg-laying in T2 mutant females, making it easier to maintain the drive. The team tested a similar system in Dophila melanogaster and improved it by adding promoter-C9 transgenes to increase homing efficiency. They discovered that genetic variations in wild populations limit the spread of gene alleles and affect Cas9 activity. The study shows potential to rescue female infertility caused by the drive, useful for large-scale production of gene transgenic insects.
Research suggests that the brain's ability to learn is not only limited by the energy needed for computation, but also by the energy required to form and store memories. Experiments have shown that even simple learning tasks, which require only a few synaptic updates, have a significant metabolic cost. Learning complex tasks, such as achieving 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, require at least 108 synaptic updates. This implies that the brain has evolved to learn using as little energy as possible. The study explores the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks using a parsimonious model. Two plasticity algorithms are proposed to save energy: 1) modifying only synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. In networks are often larger than needed, yet backpropagation updates all synapses. In this case, savings can be achieved with slightly worse learning time. Restricting plasticity helps save energy associated with synaptic plasticity. The results may lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a match between artificial and biological learning. The algorithms may also benefit hardware, as electronic storage is energetically costly.
Scientists have engineered microbes to have smaller genomes to make them more efficient, but this often reduces their fitness. To understand how to fix this, researchers studied the bacterium Acinetobacter bayi AD1x with deletions of 22-42 kilobases and 70-293 kilobases. They let the bacteria evolve for 300 generations in simple and complex media and sequenced their genomes at the end. Fitness improved in most cases, except two that failed in one environment. Mutations in genes and RNAs were associated with fitness in certain deletions. The global regulators ribonuclease D, csrA, and hfq were frequently mutated, but effects varied with deletion and environment. Mutations in this network likely compensate for earlier deletion in AD1x ancestor. Results show that lost fitness can be regained through evolution, often through specific and global adjustments.
Researchers have developed a new tool to control gene expression in zebraf, a vertebrate model organism. They used a self-caving ribyme, a type of enzyme that cuts RNA, to reduce expression of a target gene. The ribyme was inserted in the intron of a gene, a non-coding region of DNA, and cut the RNA, reducing expression by up to 20-fold. This ribyme was more efficient than others tested. The researchers also inserted the ribyme in the gene that causes albinism, a genetic disorder, and observed a similar phenotype to the mutant. By inactivating the ribyme, they showed the effect was reversible. They created a new version of the ribyme, called RFlip, that can be activated by Cre, a protein, and used it to reduce expression of the albin gene. RFlip also caused the albin phenotype. Additionally, they showed that RFlip can be used to label cells expressing a specific gene. This new tool, called RFlip, is a flexible way to control gene expression in vertebrates and an alternative to existing methods.
Researchers have developed a new software called "aiSEG" that can identify and segment cells in microscopic images without the need for fluorescent labeling. This approach eliminates the need for dyes, reduces phototoxicity, and speeds up imaging. The software uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect cell structures in transmitted light images. It is user-friendly and accessible to non-experts, requiring only 32 images for retraining. aiSEG is available as a command line and graphical user interface and is agnostic to computational environments. The software was evaluated on 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images from different cell types and imaging modalities. It accurately segments nuclei even in challenging images, similar to manual segmentation. aiSEG retains biologically relevant information, such as quantification of biosensors signaling activity. The software is adaptable to new cases and can be used in various imaging conditions, including low magnification and live imaging of primary cells like hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.
Researchers investigated how humans address the challenge of identifying relevant features in novel environments by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change, as behaviorally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. They tested whether humans are biased to learn when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast by having 295 participants learn rewards of two-dimensional bandits with either slowly or quickly changing features. Across two experiments and preregister replication, participants accrued more reward when the band's relevant feature changed slowly and irrelevant quickly compared to the opposite. No difference was found in ability to generalise to unseen values between conditions. Testing feature speed with a set of function approximation Kalman models revealed participants had higher learning rate for slow feature and adjusted to relevance and speed. Larger improvement in performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more they adjusted learning rates. Results suggest human learning favors slower features, a bias in how humans approach reward.

A decision-making task was developed where participants learned which of two features predicted reward. Speed of change was manipulated and whether participants learned faster when relevant changed slowly versus quickly. Two experiments and preregister, as well as model comparison, indicate they learned values faster when reward-predict feature changed and irrelevant quickly compared opposite. After learning, generalised equally well in both conditions. Models with different learning rates showed participants adjusted to speed of features.
Researchers have found that patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER) breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes, often experiencing rapid progression to metastatic disease after diagnosis. Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, so understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention. A previous study identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility using a mouse genetics approach. This study extends those findings to identify Res1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis gene in ER breast cancer. Res1 is a large, unstructured protein with evolutionarily conserved intron structure, but poor amino acid conservation. Mouse models showed that reducing Res1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and more lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Analysis of primary and metastatic tissues revealed loss of wild-type Res1, suggesting Res1 is a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed Res1 role in transcription control through association with G-quadruplex sequences, particularly ribosomal biogenesis. Results suggest Res1 loss enhances progression in ER breast cancer through transcriptional and translational control.
Researchers studied the role of two proteins, Mec1 and Rad24, in meiotic recombination, a process that occurs during reproduction in yeast cells. Meiotic recombination is crucial for genetic diversity and proper chromosome segregation. Mec and Rad are part of the DNA damage response pathway, which is activated when DNA breaks occur. The study found that loss of Mec and Rad affects meiotic recombination, but in different ways. Loss of Rad24 reduced recombination frequency and spore viability, while loss of Mec increased recombination frequency but had less effect on spore viability. However, complex recombination events between closely spaced DNA breaks were more frequent without Rad or Mec, suggesting loss of regulation at the level of DNA break formation. Both Mec and Rad also regulate crossovers, which are recombination events between homologous chromosomes. Without Mec or Rad, crosso distributions became more random, indicating reduced interference. This is similar to, but less extreme, the phenotype of mutants like zip3. The study highlights shared roles of Mec and Rad in crosso regulation and distinct roles of Rad as a pro-crossover factor and Mec as regulator of recombination frequency. Loss of Mec helps suppress broader defects in crosso regulation caused by damage response abrogation.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the growth and metabolism of Pneumocyst jirovec, a fungus that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. The fungus is difficult to culture in a lab, hindering research. The model, called a genome-scale metabolic model, identifies requirements and imbalances that prevent growth in vitro. It was created using published data and bioinformatics tools. The model predicts metabolic flux and critical components of Pneumyst growth, offering insights into its biology and a strategy to culture the pathogen in vitro. 

The model was tested by comparing growth in vitro and vivo in a mouse pathogen, Pocystina. Predictions were made regarding Pyst growth and metabolism, including medium components and supplements to enhance growth. The model replicated gene experiments, showing potential in developing antifungal targets. The lack of vitro methods is a major obstacle in Pyst research, with diagnosis relying on microscopic detection in specimens. The combination of computational and experimental methods opens opportunities to overcome this bottleneck. However, the inability to culture Pyst has led to a lack of data on its composition, characteristics, nutrient uptake, and enzymatic activities, hindering a comprehensive model development.
Researchers studied how a protein called YAP/TA affects cell growth in normal and cancer cells. They found that at low cell density, Y/TA helps cells grow, but at high density, a different pathway called Hippo stops Y/TA, moving it to the cytoplasm and stopping growth. Cancer cells have more YTA than normal cells, but it's unclear if more YTA is enough to keep growing at high density. The team created a 3D model of cell growth that includes the Hipp-YTA pathway and cell interactions. They simulated various YTA levels to see how much is needed for cancer cells to keep growing at high density. Results showed a small increase in YTA is enough for cancer cells to keep growing while normal cells stop. This model can help evaluate cancer based on YTA levels, develop drugs to stop cancer growth, and find right dosages.
Researchers have discovered that certain proteins and RNAs with low-complex domains (LCDs) have a tendency to form molecular condensates, which are complex structures that separate from the rest of the cell. Mutations in LCDs can cause these condates to become solid-like, leading to disease. To understand how LCDs work, scientists created an energy framework that looks at how "stickiness" rather than specific sequences. They compared sequences to random ones and found that periodic patterns make condates elastic, while random ones make them viscous. The team found that minimum periodicity is key to keeping condates fluid, preventing them from becoming solid. They also showed that this framework explains recent findings on prion domains and predicts changes in condate viscoelasticity. This study provides a new perspective on how sequences affect condate properties, with key features being conserved while sequences vary.
Researchers studied how the development of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesyme. They found that signaling molecules are crucial for epithelial morphogenesis, but how they lead to cell rearrangement and shape changes is unclear. Using the mouse dentition as a model, they discovered that non-mus myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the supasal layer. Sh signaling controls these processes by activating myos II via AKT. Inducing AK and my II can also rescue defects caused by inhibiting Sh. Results support a model where Sh signals through my II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination.

In the mouse placode, Sh is required for narrowing the epithelium at the neck and invagination. The study shows Sh does this through promotion of My II activity. Results support a model where Sh signals through PIK/AKT and II in the epithelium to maintain celladhesion and promote convergent movement that drives invagination. This is done by strengthening adhesion at adherens junctions and enabling convergent movement in the supasal, where cells at the periphery move towards the mid. Sh acts through PI/A to activate II. The Sh-PI/A-II axis promotes adhesion and movement to propel invagination.

Myos II acts to generate forces and maintain adhesion, perturbations in II impede convergent narrowing and invagination. Results show importance of II in maintaining adhesion in stratified epithelium. This is consistent with findings that II-generated forces are essential for adherence in cultured cells and deletion results in mislocalized and defective in embryos.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze large-scale single-cell RNA and chromatin data, which provides a deeper understanding of complex biological mechanisms. They used a technique called transfer learning to move data from one type of data to another. However, current methods have limitations in preserving cell variations and differences between datasets. A new model called scGCN was created to address this issue, achieving high performance and low memory usage. It was tested on mouse data from two different methods, APS-seq and C-seq, showing high accuracy and effective transfer across types. 

To improve robustness, more powerful transfer methods and generative models are needed. A single-cell graph convolutional network scGC was proposed, treating transfer from RNA-se to AT-se as a domain adaptation problem. It integrated gene and chromatin data into a unified mouse atlas. The model is a black box, making it hard to understand how it arrives at predictions. scGC is a novel approach combining different measurements, even unpaired data. It formulates cell relationships and expression with a graph network, based on regulatory mechanisms between RNA and AT-seq. MK-MD-based adaptation was used to leverage domain effects. Multiple kernels were explored for adapting representations, enhancing effectiveness between RNA-se and AT-se. It was shown that scGC can transfer annotations across datasets, tissues, species, and layers, RNA-se and AT-se.
Researchers have identified a specific sequence in the protein Mc3 subunit of the replicative helicase that is essential for its transport into the cell nucleus. This sequence, known as the nuclear localization signal (NLS), interacts with importin proteins to facilitate transport. The researchers used mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 modeling to demonstrate that precise positioning of basic residues within the N is critical for nuclear transport of Mc3 through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs nuclear import of Mc, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the M complex and poor cell growth. The study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting monopart NLS, which lack a universally conserved sequence but share key characteristics with Ns of Mc3 and SV40 large antigen. Further characterization of Mc's N will help elucidate its cell-dependent nuclear import and loading, and refine predictions of other putative Ns in nuclear proteins. Mutations of Mc at positions 2 and 3 result in defective import, chromatin association, and cell growth. Unexpectedly, the Mc3SV-NLS mutant fails to support nuclear import, despite Alpha3 predicting contacts with Kap at 2 and 3. Constitutive localization is observed in full-length and C-terminal fragments of Mc lacking this NES. Defective import may compromise MCM loading, leading to growth defects. Researchers used Alpha3 to model interaction between importin and Mc's N variants, demonstrating similar contacts with Kap at 2 and 3.
Ataxin-2, a protein implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinsonism, plays a crucial role in translational activation, translational repression, and mRNA stability, and the assembly of RNP granules, mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Research has shown that the LSm-like domain of At2 can stimulate translation and antagonize RNP assembly. This study advances previous findings through experiments on Drosophila and human Atin-2 proteins. Results indicate that the poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 motif of Atin-2 is a major determinant of mRNA and protein content in Atin-2 R granules. Experiments with transgenic Dophila show that the At-LS domain may protect against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions support At- induced cytotoxicity. The data suggest howin interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute to specificity and efficiency of R gran condensation as well as neurodegeneration.
Researchers investigated the role of specific genes in the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells in different parts of the body. They used genetically modified mice to study the function of two genes, Pit2 and Pax7, in extraocular muscles (EOM) and limb muscles. They found that Pit2 is essential for the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells in EOM, but not in limb muscles. In contrast, Pax7 is important for muscle stem cell maintenance in both EOM and limb. The study suggests a relay between Pit2, Pax7, and My5 for stem cell maintenance in EOM. Muscle stem cells in E adopt a quiescent state earlier than in limb muscles and do not proliferate in adults, but E have more stem cells per area. In a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, fewer stem cells were present in E than limb muscles and did not proliferate. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of stem cell heterogeneity along the body axis and sheds light on why E muscles are spared in muscular dystrophy.
Researchers have identified several variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since 2020, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron lineage, and others. These variants show different levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, requiring specific defense measures. To study the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among humans, a new infectious disease model was proposed, combining epidemic data with physical neural networks (PINs) to create VOC-informed network (VOC-IN). Experiments showed VOC-IN accurately fit data from British Columbia, Canada, and simulated unobserved dynamics, time-dependent parameters, and short-term predictions. Results also revealed variations in control strategies across regions. VOC-IN performed well in fitting and forecasting long-term multi-wave data.

A new VOC-IN algorithm was introduced, integrating epidemiological data, deep learning, and models to estimate COVID-19 transmission. It emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data for optimization and accurate fitting. Variants differ in transmissibility, disease, severity, immune evasion, and treatments. The World Health Organization defines VOCs as major evolutionary, necessitating public measures. Simulating transmission and time-dependent SARS-2 variants is crucial.

VOC-IN leverages observational data and physical principles to capture time-vary parameters. Studies have shown PINs accurately fit compartment models and estimate timeary parameters. A VOC-IN method fits data, infers timeary parameters by encoding VOC infection, epidemiology, and ODE into networks.
Researchers have developed a new tool called CytoNet, a deep learning-based approach that improves the accuracy of image-based cell profiling by 30-68% compared to the traditional method of averaging cells. This method, called CytoNet, uses self-supervised contrastive learning, a technique that groups similar cells together and pushes apart those that are different. This helps to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations, which is lost when cells are averaged. CyNet requires only perturbation labels, which are available in most cell profiling datasets, and offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles to boost performance on image-based datasets.

CytoNet learns an aggregation strategy by receiving single-cell morphological feature data and providing an aggregated profile as output. The model achieves this by filtering out noisy cells, such as mitotic or debris, and prioritizing crowded cells. This makes it a better-performing and easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell data compared to previously published strategies and average baseline. The approach can be applied to genetic perturbations, expanding its utility in functional genomics.

CytoNet uses contrastive learning, a method that brings similar data points together and pushes apart in a space. Here, it is applied to already-extracted single-cell features, making it applicable to most image profiling datasets. The data is treated as a collection of sets, where each sample corresponds to a set. The Deep Sets formulation learns a model that aggregates single data into a profile, outperforming population-averaged profiles in predicting a compound's mechanism of action.
Researchers have found that the brain's ability to solve complex tasks relies on changes in how brain activity is organized in space and time. When these changes are altered, it can lead to difficulties in paying attention, ignoring distractions, and adapting, resulting in decreased efficiency and increased effort in completing tasks. To understand this, a new method was developed to measure effort using electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. The method identifies discrete brain states and uses optimal theory. It was tested on a dataset from a spatial Stro task, a test where participants respond to one part of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting part. Results showed increased cost linked to effort, confirming the method's effectiveness in quantifying transitions. This opens new perspectives for describing effort in the brain.

The study highlights the importance of characterizing brain transitions and costs in understanding cognitive processes and the relationship between activity, effort, and performance. A stochastic framework was used to measure brain cost in an existing EEG dataset, confirming a correlation between cost and demand during the Stro task. This is the first application to EEG, providing a pipeline to quantify demand in experiments. The method was generalized to EEG signals, which measure activity more directly than fMRI. An EEG dataset was analyzed from participants performing the Stro task. A similar approach was applied to fMRI of participants performing tasks, showing cost varies between conditions. However, tasks were different and difficult to compare, making it hard to predict difficulty and demand.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to malaria, a disease caused by the Plasmodium vivax parasite. They found that people infected with malaria develop a type of immune cell called atypical B cells (aBC) that can produce antibodies to fight the parasite. To understand how these cells work, they created a tool to detect and study aBC that target a specific part of the parasite called PvPII. They found that aBC were present during illness and after recovery from malaria and produced antibodies that can neutralize the parasite. Some aBC produced high levels of antibodies similar to those made by classical B cells, which are known to fight infections. Two aBC clones, AF12 and B11, produced antibodies that blocked the parasite from entering human red blood cells. The study suggests that aBC play a role in protecting against malaria by producing antibodies. Identifying which aBC types are important could lead to better vaccines. The researchers also found that people infected with malaria for the first time developed aBC, not those with repeated exposure. This is consistent with previous findings that aBC are part of the immune response to some diseases.
Researchers have developed a new method called MR-MASHS, an extension of the MR-MASH model, to predict complex traits using genetic data. MRASH requires individual-level data, which is often not publicly available due to privacy concerns, and doesn't scale well with large datasets. MRASHS uses summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel, making it more accessible and scalable. Simulations show MRASHS is competitive and outperforms current methods for single and multi-phenotype prediction in various scenarios. A real analysis of 16 blood traits in the UK Biobank shows MRASH achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for most traits, especially with smaller sample sizes.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, by taking into account the differences in how people's susceptibility to infection in different areas and over time. This is a challenge in traditional models, which assume everyone is equally susceptible. The new model, called Universal Differential Equation (U), uses a neural network to approximate the rate at which people become infected. It was trained on data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai and compared to a traditional model. The new model predicted 80.06% of the population would be infected and a peak of 3.17%, while the traditional model predicted 99.97% and 32.78%. This is an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. The new model also showed that heterogeneity in susceptibility decreases herd immunity by 37.36% and prolongs the outbreak by 30-70 days, matching real data. This study lays the groundwork for a new class of models and insights on heterogeneity.
Researchers have found that synapses in the brain are noisy, which is surprising given their high energy consumption levels. They propose that synapses use this noise to represent uncertainty about the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework shows that the synapse interacts with the postsyn neuron like an agent in an uncertain environment. This suggests synapses use an internal model of somatic dynamics updated by a learning rule similar to established LTP/LTD mechanisms. Synapses also use noise to encode uncertainty about somatic potential. Each syn tries to predict postsyn dynamics, but emergent network dynamics solve problems like classification and control in dynamic environments. Synapses coordinate to represent and utilize network uncertainties in ambiguous situations.

The study shows synapses can exploit noise to encode uncertainty about somatic potential. A model predicts synapses should be stochastic to encode somatic potential and makes precise predictions about synaptic plasticity and weight changes. The model applies to individual synapses, considering dynamics as interacting with environment and deriving a learning rule to minimize surprise. This rule enables synapses to adapt efficacy to predict postsyn spikes, registered by backpropagating action potentials. Synaptic variability can reflect uncertainty in firing. Postsyn learns to fire according to Gaussian distributions with different spreads. Variability in firing is reflected in neuron spiking during stochastic phase.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scup to reconstruct cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. This method is useful for studying how cells develop and differentiate, and how cancer progresses. Single-cell sequencing allows for more detailed analysis with higher resolution. Scup is designed to handle challenges of single-cell sequencing, such as missing genetic information and errors. It uses a neighbor-joining algorithm to compute distances between cells and reconstruct the tree. Scup is faster and more accurate than current methods, thanks to its parallel design. The method's performance was tested on synthetic and biological data of 18 cells. 

Single-cell DNA sequencing enables detailed analysis of cell development and differentiation. Scup is a probabilistic framework that reconstructs cell trees from single cells using whole-genome DNA sequencing data. It addresses challenges of single-cell sequencing, such as missing genetic information and errors. Scup obtains better accuracy by leveraging sequencing data. Reconstructing cell trees from single cells is a fundamental problem with potential for studies of development and differentiation. There are two related problems: reconstructing cancer trees and tumor phylogenies from single cells. Several data types, such as bulk, single DNA, and single RNA, have been used for these problems. However, mutations are scarce when reconstructing trees for healthy tissues, implying sophisticated models and methods are needed. Single DNA sequencing reveals more mutations than other data, but comes with challenges. 

Scup is a distance-based method that reconstructs cell trees from single DNA data produced by amplifying cells' genomes. It distinguishes mutations from sequencing errors caused by amplification. The dataset consists of single DNA for 18 cells with a common origin and known tree. These cells are closely related, making it hard to reconstruct the true tree.
Researchers have developed a new tool to help low-income countries like Malawi make the most of their limited healthcare resources and improve population health outcomes. This tool, called the Thanzi Lae On (TLO) model, simulates the impact of different healthcare packages (HBPs) on the country's health system, taking into account realistic constraints such as available resources, disease incidence, and health-seeking behavior, and healthcare capacity. The model was tested with Malawi-specific data and found that a healthcare package prioritizing high-impact treatments achieved the largest health gains, an 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023 and 204. However, this approach incurred excess DALs in the first years of implementation. Other prioritization methods, such as focusing on patient characteristics rather than service type, showed consistent gains over time and a 5% reduction in DALs over the period, suggesting this approach might be beneficial. The TLO model provides a detailed evaluation of health gains from prioritizing services under realistic constraints, addressing limitations of other methods used to weigh evidence for interventions.
Researchers studied the process of meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation in the holocentric moth Plodia interpella, a species that diverged from the silkworm moth Bomby mor over 100 million years ago. They used a technique called Oligaint FISH to visualize chromosomes at high resolution and found that meiotic pairing in both species starts at gene-rich chromosome ends. Both species form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bomby, Plodia can orient bival in multiple ways at metaphase. Kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the center of chromosomes, regardless of where they are located in the bivalent. Sister kinchores are not paired, but four distinct kinchores are observed at metaphase. Microtubule attachments hold these kinres together. These findings challenge the idea that paired pole-facing kinchores are needed for accurate homolog separation in meiosis. The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model organisms, which can lead to novel discoveries.
Researchers studied the median eminence (ME), a part of the brain that connects the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. They found that mutations in the SOX3 gene cause hypopituitarism, a condition where the pituit gland doesn't produce enough hormones. They discovered that SO3 affects the median eminence, not the pit gland itself, and that the problem starts early in development. The study found that NG2-glia cells in the medianence are mostly affected by SO3 loss and that low-dose aspirin treatment can fix the problem. NG-glia cells help the pit gland mature as the animal becomes independent. The study shows NG-glia play a role in postnatal development and are sensitive to external signals. 

The researchers treated SO3 mutants with low-dose aspirin and saw restored NG-glia and pit hormone levels, but not myelination. They also found changes in the gut microbiome can fix hypopuitar. They used gene deletion to show that SO3 loss in the nervous system causes hypopuitar, which starts at weaning. The pit gland's endocrine cells don't mature. SO3 is in hypothalamic stem cells and affects their growth. In mice, SO3 is in the developing and mature hypothalamus, but not the pit. The study aimed to understand SO3's role in the hypothalamus and hypopuitar.
Researchers studied how a protein called F-act, which is important for cell movement and development, is regulated in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that a protein called CED-10/Rac activates F-act, but needed to identify the protein that activates C-10. Another protein, C-5/C-12, is known to activate C-10 and promote cell movement, but surprisingly, it also inhibits F-act in migrating cells. To understand this, they looked at C-12's ability to act as a GAP, a protein that turns off Gases. They found that C-12 has a GAP region that is separate from its activating region and mutating it affects cell migration, not corpse engulfment. Interfering with C-5's ability to bind to Rac1/C-10 also resulted in loss of both functions. Studies suggest that C-5/C-12 uses different domains to promote and inhibit F-act formation. To promote cell engulfment, C-5/C-12 activates C-10 as a GEF, but for migration, a different GEF must activate C-10. Other GEFs in C. elegans regulate development, mainly CDC-42 or RHO. C-5/C-12 is a bipart GEF that activates C-10 during programmed cell death. C-10 also promotes tissue migration, ventral enclosure, but its GEF is unknown.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes information across different timescales in the visual system. They used recordings from the rodent visual system and found that information and correlation timescales of spiking activity increased along the anatomical hierarchy under stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreased. Intrinsic times for spontaneous activity showed a similar hierarchy, but predictability was stimulus-dependent. A model with correlated sensory input reproduced these observations. The findings suggest the rodent visual system uses intrinsic mechanisms for longer integration in higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient code.

The study used predict and timescales to understand the neural code, quantifying the amount and times of redundancy in spiking. They found a gradual increase in times following the anatomical hierarchy had more predictive power for correlation and times, indicating hierarchical processing in visual cortex. An alternative hypothesis is that recurrence enables longer information integration, causing long times in primates. Testing this, feedforward processing predicted higher times and hierarchy under stimulation with a movie compared to spontaneous activity without a stimulus.

Modeling results suggest decrease in predict can be caused by increase recurrent, as stronger coupling reduces temporal correlations from stimuli. Decrease in predict can also reflect efficient coding, where stages remove more redundancy in spike trains. Results indicate intrinsic mechanisms, such as increase recurrent, shape processing hierarchy.
Researchers used epidural recordings from the spine to study how the brain responds to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive treatment for neuropsych disorders. They developed a computational model of the motor cortex to understand the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves. Analysis identified important pathways and used machine learning to identify common features among them. Sensitivity analysis found neuron types that contribute to corticospinal waves, with single wave predicted by connection probability to pyramidal tract neurons. Conduction delay to these neurons determined wave latency. Multiple neuron types modulate corticosp waves, with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons involved. Activation of afferents to motor cortex and specific neurons initiate different waves. The study proposes origins of afferents giving rise to waves. A method for computationally analyzing complex models and relating to network structure was developed to understand response to acute stimulation.

The corticosp waves represent activity of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons sending axons to the spinal cord. Direct wave is direct activation of these neurons. Intrinsic mechanisms allow PTNs to behave as oscillators, causing waves from repeated spiking due to initial excitation by T. Computational models integrate anatomy and electrophysiology to investigate T-induced cortosp waves. A model was developed by Esser et al. The most feature affecting cortosp wave was conduction delay between neuron and PT, with 81.6% accuracy. Sensitivity analysis identified important mechanisms.
Cell-free placental DNA (cDNA) is present in the mother's circulation throughout pregnancy. It has been detected as early as the fourth week of gestation and makes up about 40% of total plasma-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cDNA has been used in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal genetic abnormalities, such as chromosomal aneuploies. However, the biology of cDNA is not well understood, limiting its research and clinical use. This review examines current knowledge of cDNA, its origins and characteristics, gaps in knowledge, and future directions.

cDNA is shed from the placenta into the mother's circulation throughout pregnancy. It has been used in NIPT to screen for fetal genetic issues, like chromosomal aneupies. Studying cDNA can improve understanding of placental processes, its role in pregnancy, and how it can be used to monitor placental health and disease. Fetal and placental genomes are usually identical, but placentalosa can occur, where they do not match. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between "free-fetal" and "placental DNA, especially in cDNA clinical applications.

cDNA represents the placental genome, allowing non-invasive genome characterization. NI has been used to screen for common anupies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21, by assessing overrepresentation of affected chromosomes in plasma-free. Its effectiveness has been reviewed elsewhere. c can be a tool for studying placental development and disease, currently hindered by ethical and availability of early-midestation samples. This opens avenues for more cDNA applications beyond current NI, limited to genetic screening the fetus.
Researchers have found that hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast, endometrial, and ovarian, and prostate cancer, share common genetic risk factors, suggesting a common underlying cause. Genome-wide studies identified clusters of risk variants across these cancers, contrasting with unrelated traits. The study pinpointed 44 regions across the genome where multiple cancers overlap, with some containing risk variants for all three or four cancers. Integrating data from diverse cell models, they annotated 53 candidate genes at these regions, many of which had no known roles in cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were also identified as potential targets and some regions altered transcription factors, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were overrepresented among candidate genes, implying some may be targets for new treatments or repurposing existing drugs. The study provides a framework for identifying genes driving complex traits and understanding susceptibility.
Researchers investigated the genetic cause of polymyositis in the Kiker dog breed, a disease characterized by muscle weakness and inflammation. They conducted a genome-wide association study of 33 affected dogs and 106 controls and found a significant link to a region on chromosome 19. Further analysis revealed a 2.9 megabase deletion upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2, present in 81% of affected dogs and 25% in a random sample of the breed. Dogs homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL21 and IL when stimulated with mitogens. The study suggests elements 10-49 kilobases upstream of IL21/IL play a role in regulating the genes and deletion is a risk factor for polymositis in Kiker dogs. The penetrance of the disease was estimated 10-20% for homozygous and 0.5-2% for heterozygous dogs. The results indicate variants may be found at least 10 kilobases upstream of the IL gene. The study demonstrates involvement of the IL/IL locus in polymositis in Kiker, but the responsible element and function in inflammatory processes are unknown. A PCR assay to genotype the deletion provides a tool for breeders to prevent high-risk dogs and reduce incidence in the breed.
Researchers have developed a new language model called ESMm that can predict the stability of proteins, which is crucial for various applications such as food processing, therapeutics, and identifying disease-causing mutations. The model was trained on a large dataset of 528 natural and artificially created protein sequences from 461 domains and can handle insertions, deletions, and multiple mutations. The study shows that ESM can be fine-tuned to predict protein stability and performs reasonably well on small domains and generalizes to sequences not in the training set. However, its performance on longer proteins lags behind state-of-the-art methods. Training on multiple domains instead of a single domain improves ESM's performance for folding prediction. The study highlights the need for large-scale stability measurements on diverse sequences like those found in nature.
Researchers studied the role of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (iIR) in autoimmunity, specifically in the context of Type 1 diabetes (T1), a disease where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the pancreas. iRs are a family of receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. They regulate immune responses by binding to Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules. The researchers hypothesized that in autoimmunity, where an enhanced immune response is detrimental, iRs would have an opposite effect. They analyzed a dataset of 11,961 individuals with T1 and found that iR genes, in the presence of their ligands, have a significant and consistent effect on HLA class II genetic associations. This suggests iRs decrease protective HLA II associations and regulate CD4 T cell responses in T1. The study supports the idea that iRs modulate immune responses in autoimm, similar to their role in chronic infections.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FE) is a leading cause of age-related vision loss and the most common repeat-mediated disease in humans. Up to 80% of FE cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat (CT18.1) within the ubiquitously expressed gene TCF. The non-coding nature of the repeat and transcript complexity of T4 have made it challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. This study comprehensively describes CT18.1-driven components of disease in primary-derived corneal endothelial cells from a large cohort of individuals with CT18-expanded and CT-independent FE. Long-read, short, and spatial transcript techniques were used to interrogate expansion-specific transcript biomarkers. Long-read sequencing and alternative splicing of short transcript data revealed altered splicing in FE and transcripts associated with CT18 expansions. Differential expression highlighted transcript consequences of FE within cells. Exon usage, pathway, and spatial transcriptomics revealed T4 isoform skewing in FE with potential consequences. Exome data from 134 FE cases identified rare and potentially deleterious T4 variants, suggesting T4 independent of CT18 may increase FE risk. This study supports two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and T4 iso-specific dysregulation, underlying FE pathophysiology.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LT) in rice varieties used for direct seeding in cold climates. They identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) called qLT11 in the Arroz Terra variety, which germinates seeds at lower temperatures. The QTL was mapped to a 52-kb region containing the REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, expressed during seed germination. The Arroz Terra allele encodes functional GFh, while Japanese variety Hitome has a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line (NIL) with the Ar Terra allele decreased LT, while overexpressing GFh in Hitomeore increased LT, indicating GFh is the causal gene behind q11. Analysis of Japanese accessions revealed the functionalh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding. A NIL in the Hitome background with a 172b genomic fragment from Ar Terra including GFh showed superior LT to Hitome with comparable agronomic traits. The functionalh from Ar Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Researchers studied how the hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates its genetic material. They focused on the 8-nucleotide-long terminal redundancy (TR) at the end of the negative DNA strand, which is formed during the reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA. They wanted to know if this TR forms a 5' or 3' flap on the DNA and if it's removed during the formation of covalently closed DNA. To answer these questions, they created a mutant HBV cell line with a specific mutation in the pregen RNA sequence, altering the 3' TR. The production of HB DNA and coval closed DNA in these cells was similar to normal levels. Next-generation sequencing showed that the positive DNA of the DNA and both strands of coval DNA carried the normal residue, indicating the 5 TR serves as the template for DNA replication and the 3 forms a flap which is removed during co DNA formation. They found that the enzyme Mus81 plays a role in co DNA formation in normal HB replicating cells, alongside the enzyme F1. They mapped the sites of these enzymes on the TR using sequencing. The results show that the 5 and 3 flaps are interchangeable on the DNA precursor. This sheds light on HB DNA and co formation, contributing to understanding the HB cycle.
Researchers studied the efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in treating wastewater from a canned food factory and found that the community of microorganisms plays a crucial role in their performance. The team developed a model, called microbe-micro interaction genome metabolic (mmEM), to understand how microorganisms adapt to changing conditions. The model included three main groups: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). They found that as organic loading rates increased, the community shifted from SO-domin to METomin, with a decline in FC performance. The model accurately predicted microbial abundance at low and high loading rates. Simulations showed SO growth was limited at high rates due to reduced sulfate-sulf cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, making them dominant. The study highlights the role of crossfeeding in shaping community response to high loading. The findings will inform strategies for implementing FC technology in real-world environments.
Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) to guide biological discoveries in medicine, such as identifying promising molecules for new drugs. In this process, ML models predict properties of biological systems and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates for experimental validation. However, when applied to new situations, these models can be overconfident and produce many false positives. To address this issue, a solution is to quantify the model's uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) specified by researchers. A new framework, called CPEC, is proposed to achieve this. It integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool called conform prediction, providing accurate and DR-controlled predictions for a protein function. Conform prediction gives statistical guarantees that the expected DR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Experiments show C achieves reliable DR control, better or comparable performance at lower DR than existing methods, and accurate for enzymes not in the training data. CPEC is expected to be useful for discoveries where many experiments are desired but budget is limited.

CPEC is a machine learning framework that leverages conform prediction to achieve DR-controlled functions. It uses a deep model called Pen2 as the base model. Without uncertainty quantification, ML models are susceptible to overconf predictions, misdirecting efforts to false hypotheses. C addresses this challenge to ensure efficiency and reliability of ML-assisted discoveries. It allows users to specify DR tolerance, tailored to goals and makes predictions with DR. Effectiveness is demonstrated using enzyme annotation as a case, simulating functions of less-character enzymes.
Researchers have found that inclusions of hyperphosphorylated T-43 protein are a hallmark of most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in the TARDB gene, which codes for T-43, can cause some cases of inherited ALS, indicating dysfunction of T-43 drives disease. Aggregated, phosphorylated T-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes, or T-43 aggregation may be a protective response sequestering protein from the rest of the cell. The heat shock chaper H90 interacts with T-43 and stabilizes its conformation, but its role in neurotoxicity is unknown. Using a C. elegans model of ALS T-43 proteinopathy, researchers found that loss of H90 protects against T- neuroxicity and neurogeneration in adult animals. This is accompanied by decrease in total and phosphorylated T-43 protein. H90 also upregulates stress responsive heat pathway genes, including H70 and H16.1, and normal levels of H16.1 are required for H90 effects on T43. The neuroprotective effect of H90 does not involve regulation of proteome activity in C. elegans. This study demonstrates H90 chaper activity contributes to outcomes in T- proteinopathies in a whole animal model of ALS.

In this study, researchers explored the role of C. elegans H90 chaper in a model of T-43 proteinopathy that expresses human T-43 with ALS-causing mutations. Disrupting H90 genetically or with small inhibitors protected against T- dysfunction and neurogeneration. C eleg models express human ALS T-43 (MV, AT, GA, or GA) panuron, exhibiting progressive motility defects, degeneration of motor neurons, and accumulation phosphorylated-43. RNA-binding proteins, including T43 and Fus, may be cleared by chaper-mediated autagy. H70 and H90 induce overexpression of another heat protein, alpha crystallin, which sequesters with minimal chaper activity. H90 has a role in modulating T misfolding and toxicity, so researchers asked if H90 loss affected accumulation of total or disease phosphorylated T-43 in C. eleg.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the reproductive system of the Artemia franciscana, a type of crustacean, using a technique called single-nucle RNA sequencing. This allowed them to identify the different types of cells present in the ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and muscle cells. They compared their findings to the reproductive system of the fruit fly, Drosophila, and found that many of the programs that control cell identity and function are conserved between the two species. This suggests that these programs have been in place for over 500 million years.

The researchers used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to study the changes in gene expression and epigenetics of germ cells during oogenesis. They found unique dynamics in the regulation of the chromosome during meiosis, which is the process of cell division that leads to the formation of gametes. They also found evidence of meiotic sex silencing in this group, which is the suppression of sex chromosomes during meiosis.

The study highlights the use of single-nucle RNA sequencing as a tool for studying meiotic sex regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate meiotic cells. It also shows that many of the pathways that define cellular identity in the ovary are conserved between distantly related species. The research provides a foundation for further study of the reproductive system of Artemia and its evolution.
Chronic pain is a widespread and debilitating condition that costs the United States around $600 billion annually. A common symptom of chronic pain is allodynia, where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. The mechanisms are unclear, but allody is hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Researchers analyzed biophysically-motcircuit structures in laminae-II of the dorsal horn, hypothesized to be part of pathways mediating two types of allody: static and dynamic. They used neural rate models to describe activity of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. A sensitivity analysis identified mechanisms likely to cause allody-producing dysregulation of subc's E signaling. Disruption of E balance occurs due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling or upregulation of excitatory responses, depending on subc structure and components involved. These results suggest diverse mechanisms may be responsible for allody, offering predictions for interindividual variability and targets for experimental studies.

The dorsal horn's multiple excitatory and inhibitory interneurons suggest dysreg may occur through multiple mechanisms dependent on the injury. Modeling interactions among interuron populations for E balance in healthy and disruption allody is a step. Painful stimuli activate excitatory cells and downstream neurons, gated by inhib populations under healthy conditions. Allody occurs when E balance is disrupted, non-pain input causes excitatory firing, activating downstream neurons. Understanding chronic pain requires underlying causes. Dysreg of E balance is a cause supported by preclinical studies, but understanding circuit complexity leaves questions how dysreg occurs.

Researchers describe subcircuits mediating static and dynamic allody (evoked by von Fre device). Including spiking in rate network allows analysis of interactions with structure maintaining or disrupting E balance in dorsal circuits. Studies show static and dynamic allody are mediated afferent inputs.
Researchers studied the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones in the translation of a protein called eukary elongation factor 2 (EF2), which is essential for ribosome function. They found that Hsp and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF function. Mutations in Hsp or cochones reduced EF levels, and some Hsp mutants were affected by deletion of the gene H1 cochone. Mutations in EF that mimic human disease-causing mutations were impacted by loss of H1 and one was partially rescued by overexpression of H1. In contrast, different Hsp or cochone mutations affected sensitivity to diphther toxin, a post-translational modification of EF. The results suggest H90 contributes to protein homeostasis not just by folding but also by enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins. The study also found defects in Hsp mutants are linked to subsets of cochones, indicating distinct H90 pathways for different clients. Understanding these differences may lead to selective inhibitors with fewer effects. H90 has roles in elongation in addition to initiation, and H1 bridges EF interaction with C1 and H90 or TR cochone. Further studies are needed to understand interaction of H1 and EF with TRC and H90. The study monitored EF folding by levels and susceptibility to dther toxin, showing H and cochones have distinct roles in mediating EF function. EF folding is dependent on H1, C7, and C1 cochones and sensitive to H90 mutants.
Researchers investigated how people make decisions in social situations when their personal preferences are disrupted, such as when they have a brain injury or are faced with new options. They used a gambling task where participants made choices alone and after seeing others' choices. People with brain damage to the insula or anterior cingulate cortex, areas involved in decision-making, showed disrupted use of standard calculations about risk. For social decisions, they relied more on others' choices, separate from personal calculations. This suggests that in social situations, others' choices can be a shortcut for decision-making when personal risk processing is impaired. 

The study focused on how social information affects choices in relation to personal risk. It examined how decisions in social contexts are made when risk preferences are inaccessible, as in individuals with certain conditions or new options. Participants with insula or dACC lesions showed disrupted utility-based risk processing and used social info from others to guide decisions. These findings suggest conformity can be an alternative to utility-based info in social decision-making when risk processing is disrupted. 

A relationship was found between degree of impairment and use of others' choices as a heuristic. Those most disrupted in utility-based decision-making conformed most with others' choices. This was replicated in an independent sample, providing evidence for a trade-off between utility and cognitively demanding heuristics in social decision-making.
Researchers have re-examined Richard Dawkins' iconic model of morphological evolution, known as biomorphs, to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating order from random mutations. However, they found that biomorphs can also illustrate how developmental biases shape evolutionary outcomes. The study shows that biomorph exhibit a type of bias called phenotypic bias, where certain phenotypes are much more likely to appear through random mutations than others. This bias favors simpler phenotypes with low complexity. An information-theoretic principle explains this bias as evolution searching in a space of algorithms. Simulations demonstrate that adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biom phenotypes that are less frequent. Results resemble patterns in molecular-genotype maps, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness. An analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained genome explains these patterns. The study suggests that bias towards simplicity and other biom patterns may hold in developmental systems.
Researchers investigated whether humans can intuitively tune into the dynamics of nonlinear systems and excite their resonant motions. They used a virtual double pendulum with a haptic joystick, where participants had to hit targets aligned with or offset from the nonlinear modes (N) of the system. The results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite and stabilize the pendulum's motion close to the N, even when targets were far from it. This was achieved by adjusting arm stiffness to align resonant motions with the task. The study extends existing research on human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems, highlighting the ability to control and shape dynamics through muscle changes. 

A numerical tool was used to compute nonlinear modes (N) of energy-conservative systems. The study consisted of three experiments with participants controlling the double pendulum through a joystick. In the first two experiments, targets were aligned with N, and in the third, they were offset. Participants excite and stabilized the pendulum's motion close to N, even when targets were far from it, by adjusting stiffness to align resonant motions. The findings support human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems and ability to control and shape dynamics through muscle changes.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a group of transcription factors called transition regulators (TSRs) play a crucial role in developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. However, the extent of their influence on bacterial physiology is not fully understood. Researchers found that two TS regulators, Sco and Abr, along with the Mar-family factor PR, negatively regulate the production of the iron chelator pulcherrin in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis showed that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerr production during exponential phase and influence the rate and amount of pulerr produced. Expression of the pulerr biosynthesis gene yC was found to be under control of Sco, Abr, and PR, and correlated with the amount of pulerr produced in each background. In vitro data indicate a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. The regulation by two distinct systems highlights the importance of pulerr in B. subtilis physiology. Biochemical analysis showed regulators of the pul biosynthesis operon and TS Sco and Abr bind the yC promoter with different affinities. Results indicate pulerr regulation in B. subtilis is under tight repression during exponential growth by two regulatory systems. TS Sco and Abr have been studied for diverse roles in Bacillus physiology, including sporulation, competence, protease production, and biofilm. Microarray analysis of effect of Sco on global expression was carried out in cells at different growth points in media. Further roles of PR and Abr in regulation were established using DNA assays and evidence Sco can bind to yC in vitro. Together, a model where biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during transition to stationary phase and input from PR linking phase with extracellular sequestration.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how spinal cord injuries (SCI) affect bladder control and how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can improve it. The model shows that SCI can cause detrusor-sphinct dyssyria (DSD) or incontinence, depending on the injury level, due to loss of neural control between the detrusor muscle, bladder, urethral sphincter, and pelvic muscles. T applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced D and inence. The model replicated the minimum elements necessary for neural dysfunction after SCI and added features to replicate improvements in bladder function with lumbar T in patients. It created a neural circuit of mictition based on Hodgkin-Hux equations and added interneurons and complexity to reproduce dysfunctional mictition after SCI. The model reproduced the re-emergence of a voiding reflex after SCI. Low-frequency TMS (1Hz) normalized voiding after SCI, while high-frequency T (30Hz) enhanced urine storage. The model showed that increased interactions among lumbar interneurons are necessary to replicate effects of SCI on mition and network modifications are essential to understand T effects on bladder after SCI. A framework was developed to analyze neural circuits controlling mition after SCI and effects of T on the spinal cord as a therapeutic to alleviate dysfunction. The model was built on a state-of-the-art to capture normal and disorders of the bladder after SCI. The effect of T on the spinal was modeled based on recent findings from patch-clamp and extracellular recordings. The dysfunctional patterns after SCI derive from interactions among interneurons, plasticity, and reorganization that foster a latent void reflex. When SCI occurs above T10, communication between brain and mition circuits is blocked or attenuated. The model provides a mechanism to explore how SCI alters mition and how T may improve bladder function.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model to estimate the growth rate of fungi, specifically Aspergillus fumatus, a type of filamentous fungus, using optical density (OD) data. Current methods require collecting time-course data on fungal morphology, such as hyphal length, which is not feasible for most clinical microbiology labs. The new model treats OD as an indirect measure of true fungal growth, accounting for the relationship between OD and true growth. This eliminates the need for new calibration data, making it accessible to all labs that collect OD data. The model outperformed reference models in fitting and predicting growth curves and corrected discrepancies between morphology rates inferred from OD and directly measured data. The study demonstrated the model's ability to fit and predict OD using time-course data for A. fumatus and estimated morphology growth using directly measured data. This model provides a biologically interpretable and morphology-specific growth rate from indirect OD data without calibration, making it available to all labs that collect OD data, not just specialized ones.
Beetles are the most diverse group of animals, with over 400,000 known species, and a wide range of sex chromosome types. Most beetles have XY sex chromosomes, but some have X0 sex determination. Researchers created a complete chromosome map of the beetle Tribolium confus, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and used 11 other beetle genomes to study sex chromosome evolution across Coleoptera. They found ancestral groups of genes that are shared across beetles, while the ancestral chromosome is maintained, but autosomes are added to the sex chromosomes. These neo-chromosomes evolved typical sex properties, including dosage compensation and non-random gene expression. Beetles provide a new model to understand diverse sex evolution forces.

Beetles are a promising to study kary evolution and forces on chromosomes. Ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing study at the molecular level. The ancestral is conserved in Coleoptera, but multiple neo-chromosomes formed in closely related species. Comparative analysis is needed to address patterns and forces across species. Researchers used genomic approaches to reconstruct sex and kary evolution in beet. A new chromosome assembly was created for Tribium confus and published assemblies from 11 species across the phylogeny.

Chromosomal sex is conserved across beet but unclear if identity is conserved. For example, Dipt have XY chromosomes but genomic revealed diversity in kary among flies with sex transitions and autos incorporations. Abundance of beet and tools make Cole a valuable system to study mechanisms and forces of sex differentiation across taxa.
Researchers studied the role of histone variant H2 (HA) in regulating gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. HA is an evolutionarily conserved histone variant that is incorporated into chromatin by the SWR-complex (SW-C). While HA has been implicated in transcription regulation, mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, growth defects of mutants are alleviated by deletion of SW-C subunits, suggesting SW-C may cause deleterious effects when missing HA substrate. HA mutants display significant growth defects in genotoxic conditions, suggesting a role in gene regulation may be uncovered under stress. To explore this, researchers generated mRNA profiles for wild-type, mutants, and before and after exposure to hydroxyurea (H), which induces DNA stress. Data showed HA played a prominent role in activation during H exposure and was important for upregulation of several H-induced genes. Also, SW-C contributed to defects in mutants, particularly genes involved in phosphate homeostasis. Mapping HA incorporation before and after H treatment revealed decreases at transcription sites correlated with upregulation during H exposure. This study characterized the effects of HA incorporation during transcriptional response H.
Researchers have been using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data to advance our understanding of developmental biology, but classifying transcriptomic profiles from scRNA experiments into cell types and identifying individual cell lineages has become challenging due to the accumulation of large datasets and high dimensionality of data. To overcome this, automated classification methods are needed, but classical approaches rely on supervised training with fully annotated data, which is difficult to obtain at single-cell resolution. Instead, the authors propose using partial learning, where a set of candidate labels is given for each data point, a simpler setting than fully supervised. They extend state-of-the-art multi-classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype, logistic regression, and ensemble to partial learning, and study the effect of label structure on methods, focusing on hierarchical labels in developmental processes. On simulated and real datasets, these methods enable learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly prototype-based. Performance with partially annotated data reaches fully supervised. The authors study uncertainty in partially annotated data and derive prescriptive results on effect on accuracy of partial learning. Hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies help automated single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying on less stringent annotated data than fully learning.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (P2) in the formation of nuclear compartments such as speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipidlets. They found that P2 is involved in RNA polymerase II transcription and its localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA. Using mass spectrometry, they identified the RNA-dependent P2-associated (RD) proteome in human cells and found that intrinsically disordered regions (ID) with basic P2-binding motifs are prevalent in RD proteins. These ID regions are also enriched for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. The study showed that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) associates with P2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and altered P2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BR4. The researchers propose that P2 orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins, affecting their ability to form foci via phase separation. This suggests a pivotal role for P2 in establishing a functional nuclear architecture for gene expression.
Scientists have long believed that the ability of organisms to change their traits in response to their environment, known as phenotypic plasticity, plays a key role in their adaptation and diversification. However, the genetic mechanisms behind this process are not well understood. A group of insects called dung beetles, or Scarabinae, are known for their diverse development in response to nutrition, including the growth of horns, which are secondary sexual weapons that show significant variation within and between species. Researchers investigated the evolutionary basis of these horns and other traits in dung beetles through genomic and developmental studies. They created chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the Onthagini tribe, including Onophagus taurus, O. sagarius, and Digitophagusella, and compared them to seven other beetle species. The study found changes in coding sequences associated with metabolic regulation of development and metamorphosis. They also looked at chromatin in developing horn tissues of high and low-nutrition males and females and found distinct regulatory architectures underlying nutrition compared to sex development, including many recently evolved elements sensitive to horn determination. The study highlights the importance of chromatin regulation in development and evolution of traits and shows gene networks are highly responsive to environmental and genetic signals.
Researchers used a monkey model to study Lassa fever, a disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV), to understand why some infected people recover while others die. They found that lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and spleen, are early reservoirs for the virus in all infected animals, regardless of disease severity. However, the virus spreads differently in fatal and non-fatal cases. In fatal cases, it spreads to many organs and causes inflammation, while in non-fatal cases it's limited to lymphoid organs and immune cells. This study provides new insights into how the virus and host interact during infection, leading to different outcomes. 

A monkey model was developed to mimic fatal and non-fatal Lassa fever, showing that lymphoid organs are crucial for virus replication in all animals, regardless of disease severity. Two strains of LASV, Josiah and AV, were used to infect monkeys, resulting in fatal and non-severe disease, respectively. The study analyzed the dynamics of these strains to understand the disease and immune response. Animal models are essential to understand Lassa fever and why some patients recover while others die due to the virus. 

In fatal cases, LASV spreads to almost all organs, while in non-fatal cases it's limited to a few organs. Previous studies showed some LASV strains cause less severe disease than Josiah in monkeys.
Researchers have found that disruptions in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) play a key role in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal dementia, and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's Related Dementia (AD/AD). However, it was unclear whether these disruptions were a primary cause or consequence of the disease, and what factors led to them. The study used two mouse models of neurodegeneration, Nemf86 and NemRg, which mimic cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, and found that Import-β nuclear import was blocked. This led to cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in ALS/FT and AD/AD, including TDP, Import-β, Ran1, and Ran. The study also found a pathological interaction between Import-β and the Nem86 protein in cytoplasm accumulations and similar transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurogenerative disease. Inhibiting Importβ in mouse and human neuronal cells induced proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in the models. The study suggests that many mislocalized and dysregulated events in neurogenerative diseases may arise from a primary defect in Importβ import. This has implications for investigating sporadic forms of neurogeneration from unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importβ function.
Scientists have been studying bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria, for their potential medical and biotechnological applications. To understand how they work, researchers use CRISPR-Cas, a tool that edits DNA. However, phages can resist this editing by modifying their DNA, making it hard to edit. A new study used an enzyme, NgET, to temporarily remove these modifications, making it easier to edit phage DNA. This allowed for precise targeting and seamless mutations, shown by disabling two enzymes crucial for ph infection. By removing modifications, researchers saw how they affect ph infection without deleting genes. This approach helps study phage functions and engineer phages with modified DNA. Temporarily modulating the phage epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and understanding infection mechanisms.

In the study, NgET was used to reduce 5-methylcytosine in T4 phage DNA, making it easier to edit with CRPR-Cas. This introduced point mutations in a scarless manner, shown for two enzymes crucial for infection. Modifications protect T4 from Cas12 cleavage, enabling lysis. Analyzing NgET-treated T4 showed a 250-minute delay in lysis compared to WT. The study presents a new approach for precise ph mutagenesis by reducing modifications, making DNA accessible for nucleases, boosting efficiency. The scarless nature allows studying mutations' impact on infection without deletion effects. Findings propose a strategy for introducing mutations in phages with cytosine DNA.

Two T4-encoded genes, Alt and Mod, were targeted for mutations. They are AD-ribosyltransferases involved in takeover control over E. coli by T4, but mechanisms are unclear.
Researchers have found that a protein called histone H2A Z plays a crucial role in fixing DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light in yeast cells. When UV light damages DNA, it can interfere with the cell's ability to transcribe and replicate, or copy, its genetic information. To fix this damage, cells use a process called transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCER), but this process is not fully understood. A genetic screening in yeast identified histone H2 Z as a key player in this process. Without H2 Z, the cell's ability to fix UV damage is severely impaired, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks, a major threat to the cell's stability. This highlights the importance of a healthy DNA-chromatin environment in maintaining genome stability.
Researchers studied gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpian tub as well as microbiome in the gut of two Drosoph melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from divergent populations. They found extensive tissue and genetic-specific effects, with genetic background effects on overall tissue specificity. Tissue-specific effects were stronger than genetic-specific, but the gut was more similar to Malian tub than to each other. Examination of allele expression revealed cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in differentially expressed between populations than conserved genes, with trans effects more tissue-specific than cis. Despite variable architecture, this was robust across tissues and backgrounds, suggesting trans variation can be fine-tuned as well as cis during population divergence. Transcript data from parental and F1 D melanogaster from ancestral and derived populations showed genetic and mode of variation highly tissue and background-specific. Gene expression was similar between Malian tub and midut, despite being part excret and digestive system, while gut was part alimentary canal. Overall, findings demonstrate functionally interconnected tissues can show divergent architecture among and backgrounds. Gene expression was most between Malian tub and midut.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the date of the first COVID-19 outbreak by analyzing early reported cases, rather than relying on genomic data. They tested their approach on simulated data and applied it to two real-world examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in 2019. The model estimated the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wu occurred on November 28, 2019, with a 95% confidence range of November 2-December 9, 2019. This falls within previously estimated dates based on genomic data. The researchers also estimated the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK on August 21, 2020, with a 95% range of July 23-September 5, 2020. Their method uses population dynamics and can be applied to other outbreaks beyond COVID-19. By comparing simulated and actual data, the model can also estimate the proportion of the epidemic that remains undetected.
Researchers have developed a computer model to study how chromosomes pair up during meiosis, a process necessary for sexual reproduction. Meiosis involves pairing of homologous chromosomes (homologs) to form haploid gametes from diploid cells. In the presence of non-homous chromosomes, mechanisms ensuring stable homolog alignment have been unclear. The model simulates chromosome movements and interactions, including attractive and repulsive forces between homolog and non-homous chromosomes. Key factors are chromosome number, size, movement, and repulsive forces in kinetics and efficiency of homolog pairing. Dissociation between non-homous chromosomes contributes to pairing by crowding homolog into a limited area, creating conditions for close homolog attraction. The model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of hom pairing in wild-type and mutant meiosis in yeast and can be adapted to other organisms.
Li-Fumi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, is caused by mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. MicroRNA miR-34, a target of p53, has a modifier role. In mice lacking miR-34 exhibit normal p53 responses and no cancer, but promote tumorigenesis in cancer-prone backgrounds. mi-34 genes are conserved between zebraf and humans. Zebraf mi-34 and mi-34/c have similar expression timing, but mi-34 is more abundant. DNA damage leads to p53 induction of mi-34 genes, while mi-34 mutants are viable with normal damage-induced apoptosis. However, mi-34- with gain-function tp53R217/217 or tp- mutants are more cancer-prone than tp mutants alone, confirming tumor-suppressive of mi-34. Transcript comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization (h) characterized DNA-induced transcription, and 28 and 72h determined mi-34-regulated genes. At 72h, loss mi-34 enhances erythrocyte levels and upregulates my-positive hematietic stem cells. Overexpression mi-34 suppresses reporter, not p53 induction and sensitizes embryos to camothin but not γ-irradiation.

In zraf, mi-34 and mi-34/c are primarily p-dependent on p for induction under damage and partially on p for baseline expression. Residual mi-34 induction is due to other factors activated by damage. mi-34 tumor-suppressive functions were provided by earlier onset in mi-34 and tp mutants compared to tp mutants. Overexpression mi-34 induces sensitivity to camothin (C) but not γirradiation. C is a DNA-inducing topoisomerase inhibitor activating p in zraf. Despite mi-34 not affecting p genes, mi- effects on tp mutant zraf were evaluated given epigen silencing M34 in humans with TP mutant alleles contributes cancer. tp- and tpR217/RH mutants were used as controls and mi-34-; tp- and mi34-; tpR217/RH compound lines were generated. Expression mi-34 is partially on p under conditions and by damage is fully p-dependent. mi34 has small transcript effects 28h zraf embryos under control and damage.
In the nematode C. elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator OL-1 during embryogenesis. The expression of OL-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO). In hermaphrodites, OL-1 is highly expressed, while in males OL-1 is expressed at low levels. OL-1 is known to be critical for proper C. elegans male development, but its low expression was thought to be minimal in hermrodite development. This study reveals OL- plays a role as a regulator of developmental timing in hermrodogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics, hermrod embryos were found to have an accelerated cell division rate and developmentally advanced transcription program when OL-1 is lost. Further analysis shows OL- regulates initiation of dosage compensation on X chromosomes and sex-based transcription programs in hermrod. OL- mutant embryos overexpress the H3 methyltransferase MET-2 and altered H3me landscape. Some effects of OL- loss were reversed by MET-2 loss. These findings demonstrate OL plays a role as a regulator in embryos of both sexes and MET- as a downstream of OL activity in hermrod.
Researchers have developed a computational framework called MGSurveillance (Mosquito Gene Surveillance) to optimize the placement of mosquito traps for genetic surveillance in the field. This is crucial for monitoring the spread of gene drive mosquitoes, which can lead to significant costs, and the emergence of resistant alleles, such as drive or non-functional genes, within intervention sites. MGSurveillance accounts for biological features of mosquitoes and landscapes, such as food sources, breeding sites, movement, and trap attractiveness. It minimizes the time to detect an allele of interest, allowing for remediation when possible. The framework was applied to Anopheles gambia on the island of São Tomé, Tom and Princ, and Aedes aegypt in Queensland, Australia. Results showed optimal trap placement for each population. MGSurveillance is a resource for field and computational researchers interested in mosquito surveillance. Early detection is critical for minimizing impact, preserving elimination, and cost-effectiveness of programs, as seen in studies of invasive species.
Researchers studied the tiny microorganism Symbonas scillans, a 1.4 micrometer in size, which was previously thought to have endosymbiotic bacteria living inside its cells. However, they found no evidence of these bacteria using amplification-free metagenomics and whole genome sequencing data from two strains of S. scillans. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis also showed no bacterial presence. Instead, they found contigs in the data related to viruses infecting green algae, such as Ostreococcus lucarin, Bathoccus prinos, and Micromonas pus. Using one of these virus genomes as a reference, they assembled a nearly complete 190-kilobase genome with hallmark virus genes and two incomplete assemblies of similar viruses from the other strains. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190-nanometer virus particle similar to the original endosymbion. The researchers conclude that S. scill does not have endosymb bacteria but is associated with viruses.
Researchers have identified a key role for the leiomodin (L) family of actin-binding proteins in muscle function, as mutations in three family members (L1, 2, and 3) cause human myopathies. Mutations in the predominant cardiac isoform, L2, lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the L gene are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases, little to no L protein is expressed. Scientists found that nonsense-mediated decay, a cellular mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two L2 disease-causing mutations. They generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides that obstruct the exon complex, preventing decay of mutant L2 transcripts, restoring protein expression. This study lays groundwork for potential intervention in L-linked myopathies.

Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in L3, the isoform in skeletal, result in nemal myopathy, a muscle disorder by weakness. Disease mutations found in cardiac-predant iso, L2. First case of mutation L2 (W*) results severe neon dilated cardiomy. Patient with described disease-causing L2 (W*) L2 not detected via western blot, RT-qPCR revealed decrease L2 levels, no preRNA. Hypothesized nonsense decay underlies loss mutant expression. Two L2 disease-causing mutations (R* and LV*) associated dilated cardiopathy lack L2 expression.

Multiple L2 mutations dilated cardiopathy lead lack L2 protein through decay. Developed steric oligonucleides inhibit decay L2, increasing mutant-truncated. Most L muscle diseases have common pathophysiology thin filaments, reduced contractility weakness. Mutations L family genes nonsense frameshift predicted truncated. However, most little no expressed. Degradation mutant containing termination by decay limit effectiveness stop-read drugs. Treatment with oligonucleides inhibits decay combination promotes full protein result rescue function patients mutations L2.
Researchers studied how different versions of the apolipoprotein E (Apo) gene affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease. They found that one version, Apo4, increases the risk and another, Ap2, decreases it. To understand how this works, they looked at how proteins are made and broken down in the brain and liver of mice with human Apo genes. They found that Ap4 and Ap2 change how proteins are made and broken down in the brain, but not in the liver. In the brain, Ap4 makes it harder for mitochondria to work properly and Ap2 makes them work better. Mitochondria are important for energy in cells. Ap4 also makes it harder for cells to get rid of old or broken mitochondria. Ap2 helps cells get rid of old or broken mitochondria. This study shows that looking at how proteins are made and broken can help understand how diseases work. It also shows that Ap affects brain more than other parts of the body. Previous studies found that Ap4 increases Alzheimer's risk and Ap2 decreases it. This study found that Ap4 makes it harder for mitochond to work and Ap2 makes them work better. More study is needed to understand how Ap affects cells.
Researchers have developed a new tool called CRISPRiTRM to knock out genes in specific cells of the fruit fly's nervous system, including motor neurons, muscles, and glial cells. This tool, called CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRPRTRM), allows scientists to study the function of genes in these cells without affecting the rest of the body. The researchers tested CRPRTRM by knocking out multiple genes in each type of cell and showed it works well with another system called Gal/UAS. They used CRTRM to discover that a group of proteins called SNARE is important for maintaining the connection between motor neurons and muscles. They also found that a pathway called ESC suppresses the growth of these connections by reducing a signal called retrograde. Furthermore, they found that motor neurons rely on ESC to release small particles called extracellular vesicles at the connection. This new tool, CRTRM, helps scientists understand how the connection between motor neurons and muscles works. The connection, called neuromuscular junction (NM), is a model for studying many biological processes like development, synapse formation, function, and movement.
In Drosophila larvae, the lymph gland contains a pool of progenitor cells that accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) during larval stages, which is essential for their differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of JNK (c-Jun Kinase) and upregulates fatty acid oxidation (FA) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Researchers found that the Drosila NF-κ transcription factor Rel shields the progenitor pool from metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing JNK activation. ROS serves as a metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, but its input is monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Rel. This circuit ensures the stock of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted. The study reveals how NFκ-like factors integrate with metabolic pathways to regulate cell fate transition during development. 

In Drosila, Rel is present in embryonic lymph, but its expression is restricted to larval progenitor. Overexpressing Rel in progenitors leads to downregulation of FA. Negative regulation of NF-κ signaling on fatty oxidation has been reported in diseases. The progenitor population within gland is intercepted from precocious differentiation. ROS in Dila blood cells elicit JNK to facilitate differentiation. The J-FA axis is essential for progenitor differentiation. The study shows Dila NF-κ factor Rel expresses in ROS-rich progenitors and decreases as they move towards differentiation. Loss of Rel leads to activation of J-FA, coaxing differentiation. Rel expression decreases in MZ, inhibition of T1 is lost. Absence restrains T1 results in sustained J activation, impinging FA and progenitor differentiation.
Researchers identified a patient with Tay-Linder syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, growth retardation, and bone abnormalities, but no pathogenic variants in the RNUAT gene were found. Instead, a homozygous RTTN c.295A variant was detected through whole-exome sequencing. Studies in patient fibroblasts, engineered cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells revealed cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell arrest, and death. In cortical organoids, an additional function of RT in self-organisation of neural stem cells into roset was observed, with delayed apical polarization. These defects contributed to delayed roset formation and overall growth, shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly.

Further study of the RT c.295A variant in cellular models provided insights into disease mechanisms. The variant alters splicing site of intron 23, confirmed by RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, and RNA sequencing. Patient fibroblasts, RPE cells, and CRISPR-edited pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into neural stem cells and corticaloids to analyze the impact of RT isoforms from the mutated allele. Results showed RT-mutated NS accumulated in G-M phase due to mitotic abnormalities, likely aneuplo, arrest or apoptosis. Mitotic defects were associated with misorientation of mitotic spindles, favoring premature differentiation of NS into neurons.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Escherichia coli adapts to survive long periods without resources by entering a state called long-term stationary phase (LT). They allowed E. coli populations to grow on rich media, then stopped providing new resources for six years. By analyzing genetic data from hundreds of samples, they found several key aspects of adaptation. E. coli adapts genetically through convergent mutations for up to six years, establishing long-lasting lineages with similar across populations. These lineages arise independently, showing parallel adaptations under LT. This structure enables identifying pairs of loci with significant mutation associations, suggesting historical contingency. Frequent associations were found, with a third of mutated loci involved in at least one. Results show LT adaptation is characterized by high parallelism and frequent contingency.
Researchers have re-examined the function of the iab-8 transcript, a non-coding RNA found in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which is expressed in the central nervous system. They found that it does not produce a protein, unlike its male-specific version, MSA, which codes for a microptide that helps determine sperm usage in mated females. The i-8 transcript shares a promoter with another transcript, iab-8nc, which is produced in both sexes. However, the i-8 does not produce a protein due to a mechanism involving its 5 exons. These exons contain upstream reading frames that prevent protein production from downstream frames. This was shown through cell culture and transgenic analysis. The i-8 is expressed in the central nervous system and its loss leads to male and female sterility due to loss of microRNA within its sequences. A shorter version of i-8, called MSA, is found in males and codes for a microptide that helps sperm usage in females. The difference between M and i-8 lies in their first exons.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CD) are a group of rare, multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays. They can affect most systems in the body due to mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and GPI synthesis. Because symptoms are similar, it's likely that modifier genes influence phenotypes. Researchers used evolution to identify common modifiers between CD and glycosylation genes. Glycosylation is conserved from yeast to mammals, and evolutionary covariation (ERC) identifies proteins with similar rates indicate shared functions. ERC between N-glycosylation and GPI synthesis showed strong signatures with ncRNA and DNA repair proteins. Analysis revealed patterns based on cellular localization of GPI synthesis enzymes. Testing top candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel modifiers of CD genes. ERC of disease and pathways allows prioritization of potential modifiers, understanding disease pathophysiology and therapeutic targets.
Researchers have discovered a crucial step in the life cycle of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) that helps it package its genetic material into new virus particles. The HB virus has a protein called HBc that plays a key role in this process. HBc has two parts: an N-terminal (NTD) that helps assemble the virus capsid and C-terminal (CTD) that wraps around the genetic material called pgRNA. Phosphorylation of the CTD, especially at Ser and Ser, is necessary for the virus to start packaging pgRNA. As the virus matures, the C undergoes deosphorylation, suggesting a phosphatase is involved in the late stage of packaging. Using a specific antibody, researchers observed a transition from phosphorylated to dephorylated state during pg packaging. The deory of HB-Ser was confirmed by substituting one amino acid in the polymerase domain, which abolished deory. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry showed that the phosphatase PP is recruited by the polymerase domain. This recruitment does not require HB but via RNA signal, suggesting the polymer-pRNA complex plays a role in PP recruitment. The-pRNA-PP deory of HB-S is essential for completing pg packaging and is associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. The virus may play a dual role by bringing pg to phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion of packaging. This study deciphers the mechanism of polymer-mediated deory of HB and reveals PP as a potential target for antiviral development.
Researchers studied the role of bacterial symbionts in helping marine organisms adapt to environmental changes. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created different conditions in the Tropical Pacific and Caribbean, offering a natural experiment to study how closely related animals evolve and adapt. The researchers sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivalves from the genera Codia and Cten, collected on either side of the Isth, to see how environmental conditions influenced the selection of symbts and their metabolic capabilities. They found that lucid sister species hosted Candidatus Thiazropha symbts, but only those from the Caribbean had genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Pacific did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbt phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution under nutrient-poor conditions.

The researchers reconstructed the evolutionary history of the nifDK operon, including lucid symbt genomes from around the world, and found that the common ancestor lacked n genes, but populations in oligotrophic habitats acquired the operon through horizontal gene transfer from Sedimentola symbt lineage. The study suggests HGT of n operon facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazpha enducida clade. Nitrogen availability drove ecological diversification of chemynthetic symbt species and highlights the role of symbts in adaptation to changing conditions.
Researchers have studied the TAS2 family of protein-coupled receptors, which are responsible for detecting bitter taste in vertebrates. While most attention has focused on mammalian TASRs, the study of TASRs in other vertebrates has been less explored. The researchers analyzed 661 vertebrate genomes and found that frogs and salamanders have a high number of TASR genes, unlike other vertebrates. Most TASRs are found in clusters, but amphibians have more clusters and genes per cluster. They found that TASRs have one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, but total TASR count is stable in most lineages. Interestingly, TASR count is proportional to receptors expressed in extraoral tissues. In vitro assays, many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors detecting ecologically important xeniotics.

The study of taste is associated with a suite of receptors, with bitterness detected by TASRs. Previous studies showed vertebrates have a wide TASR repertoire varying across lineages, from zero in cetans to two in frogs. The varying levels suggest different mechanisms driving the evolution of the TASR repertoire in vertebrates. Phylogen and genomic relationships suggest recombination plays a role in creating TASR variation through copy and conversion. The number of expressed receptors not in the tongue is proportional to TASRs in the genome, suggesting increases allowed acquisition of tissue-specific functions.

Researchers mined 600 vertebrates and found TASRs in frogs and salanders experienced a rapid expansion, wider repertoire than other vertebrates. To study TASRs in amphibians, they quantified expression across ecologically diverse species. Transcript analysis of seven tissues showed extraoral TASR expression, the first in amphibians.
Researchers studied how a protein complex made of NICD, RBP, and MAML binds to DNA to regulate Notch gene expression. They found that Notch-deficient mice are more sensitive to environmental insults but develop normally otherwise. Analyzing colon cells, they found no evidence of Notch-dependent gene regulation, impaired stem cell maintenance, and an elevated epithelial immune response. They also found an unbalanced interactome in human colon cancer cells expressing Notch-deficient Notch2, with reduced interaction with transcription machinery but preserved with HD2 interactome. Using a HDAC inhibitor, valpro acid, they prevented intestinal consequences of Notch-deficiency and gamma-secretase inhibitors in mice, suggesting synergy between HD activity and differentiation in stem cells. 

To identify changes in Notchimer vs monomer interactome, they analyzed human colon cells using TurboID and mass spectrometry. Notchimer in mammals is less about transcriptional regulation and more about proteome environment and innate immunity. HD3 interacts with NIC, regulating stability and activity. Notch expands stem niche at expense of goblet and entero cells. Notch-deficient mice are more susceptible to DSS and decrease colonic cells, but mechanism unknown. This study used Not-deficient mice to investigate Notch role in intestinal stem cells. Not-def mice lose colonic cells with 1% DSS, tolerated by wild type controls. To test cell-autonomous mechanism, colon spher cultures without immune components were passaged in vitro.
Researchers have developed a new theory to explain how genetic diversity in populations is affected by "background selection", a type of natural selection that acts on harmful genetic mutations. Background selection can reduce genetic diversity and make populations more similar, but its effects are not fully understood. The new theory predicts how migration, or movement of individuals between populations, affects background selection and genetic diversity. Simulations show the theory accurately predicts genetic diversity and similarity between populations. However, background selection can still reduce diversity, especially in larger populations. The research extends understanding of background selection in populations and suggests it can confuse genetic scans of diversity. 

Background selection is when natural selection acts on genetic mutations that harm individuals. It can reduce genetic diversity and make populations similar. Previous research focused on selection when selection is strong and mutations are rare. This study looks at when selection is weak and mutations are common. Migration can reduce effects of background on genetic similarity between populations. The new theory predicts how migration affects background in populations and genetic diversity. Simulations show it accurately predicts genetic diversity and similarity between populations. However, background can still reduce diversity, especially in larger populations. The research extends understanding of background in populations and suggests it can confuse genetic scans of diversity. 

The theory was developed by extending previous models of background selection to account for migration in an island model. Migration, in addition to selection and recombination, breaks cross-gener association between neutral and deleterious alleles. When migration is strong, deleterious alleles leave populations before being removed by selection. This weakens background effects on genetic similarity between populations. The new theory provides a step in applying background to complex populations.
Researchers need large amounts of genetic and phenotypic data to understand the causes of diseases. However, sharing data among institutions is difficult due to methodological barriers and privacy concerns. To address this, a new tool called FedGAT was developed, which uses a federated statistical approach to test for genetic associations while correcting for confounding and polygenic effects. Data is not shared among sites, and statistics are protected by encryption. FedAT was tested on simulated and real datasets and shown to achieve the same results as pooled analysis while preserving privacy.

Currently, federated studies have challenges, such as designing and collecting harmonized data ahead of time. Sites may choose to share summary statistics, which requires less computational burden and privacy concerns. Previous research has focused on secure GWAS using federated methods, mainly χ2 tests, PCA, and logistic regression. However, there is a lack of correcting confounding by polygenic effects due to complexity.

FedAT is a federated genetic testing algorithm that integrates random effects and can be used in different designs without changes. This is an advantage from the formulation of efficient testing GAT. A new privacy-preserving feder GWAS algorithm, FedAT, was proposed using generalized mixed models, adopting a two-step testing. Fed integrates homomorphic encryption and OTP encryption to protect statistics while aggregated in the feder setting.
Researchers have developed polygenic risk scores (PRS) to predict the likelihood of developing certain diseases, including prostate cancer. However, these scores may not work equally well for all populations, particularly African and Asian individuals. To address this issue, scientists tested six widely used PRS algorithms, four of which account for ancestry, on prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biob and All of Us cohorts. They found modest improvement in accuracy compared to a simpler method that prioritizes variants and polygenic scores. The study highlights the importance of refining risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts.

Advances in genetics have improved cross-ance PR disease prediction, but these models have not been tested for prostate cancer. The researchers analyzed two large datasets and benchmarked six algorithms, finding improvement over traditional methods. These algorithms use variant prioritization, shrinkage, joint statistics, annotation, mapping, and population heritability estimates. This is the first study to assess panance polygenic risk for prostate in the All Us cohort. They found hierarchical clustering stratifies poly scores by ancestry.

PRS-strat prostate antigen screening may reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with PSA screening alone. However, given ancestry-associated incidence and outcome biases, scores must work equally well across populations to limit disparities. The study evaluated published polygenic scores in the UKob cohort. No differences in cancer or risk factors like year, BMI, smoking, or alcohol were found. Public polygenic scores were tested on the dataset. Models were trained on allelic scoring and first 10 genetic components, regardless of population. Predictive performance improved with age and poly score addition. Similar to UKob, family and BMI did not increase power. The study demonstrates utility of scores from UKob and genetic with age predicts cancer.
Researchers have identified a potential treatments for DPAG1CD, a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-glycosylation. They used a Drosophila model of DP1CD with an improperly developed, small eye and performed a drug repurposing screen on 1,520 FDA-approved drugs, finding 42 that improved the model. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine 2 receptor partially rescued the DP1 model, suggesting dopaminergic signaling is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. This links dopamine to N-glycosylation and represents a new therapeutic target for DP1CD. The study also validated other drug categories, including acetylcholine, CO inhibitors, and NK1, revealing novel biology in DP1 mechanisms and potential new options for DP1CD.

The Dophila model was created by knocking down DP1, resulting in a small, improperly developed eye with 10-50% protein activity. A drug repur screen in Doph for DP1CD could find new therapeutics. The study screened 1,520 molecules, identifying 42 that suppressed DP1CD and confirmed many interactions. The findings were verified using pharmac and genetic manipulation, aligning with known mechanisms. New connections were established between DP1 and DA, NK1, and prostagland synthesis.

Multiple drugs improved the Doph model, with 8/21 (38%) validated in further analysis and 6/16 (38%) improved DP1. Most were genetically validated by manipulating targets in Doph. Heterozygous mutations in Dop1 and Dop2 were crossed into DP1, showing opposite effects on eye size. DP1 flies with heterozygous null Dop1 mutation had worse eyes than DP1 alone.
Researchers have been trying to understand how the sense of proprioception, which is essential for controlling movement, works. Specifically, they wanted to know how the brain represents the position of limbs in the somatosensory cortex, a part of the brain that processes sensory information from the body. To answer this, they created a model called topoVA, a type of autoencoder that can learn from large amounts of movement data. The model was not trained on actual neural data, but still reproduced two key findings from monkey studies: how the shape and speed of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, without knowing arm or hand systems, and the distribution of preferred directions of neurons from multi-electrode arrays. The model made predictions: the cortex has a blob-pinwheel geometry of preferred directions and few neurons encode single joints. This model provides a basis for understanding sensorimotor representations and neural manifolds, with applications in brain-computer interfaces and robot control. 

In the context of proprioception, the model should translate body movements into a representation of proprioception, which is read as neural firing. The model should learn efficiently and have minimal bias towards a particular modality to generalize to other sensory regions. Proprioceptive areas are crucial for goal-directed behavior, but it's unclear what properties facilitate this. The model relates kinematics to proprio encoding and compares to single-unit recordings from monkeys. A novel model predicts neural coding and spatial organization across cortex. The topoVA model predicts function and structure, trained, validated, and tested on human movement data. The emergent proprio representations in its layer were explored. Understanding further constraints will help elucidate brain principles. The model's organizational principles based on human kinematics may extend to monkeys.
Researchers have explored the role of ethylene, a hormone involved in plant growth and stress responses, in plant-micro interactions from the plant's perspective. However, few studies have examined its role in microbes. This study found that Azospirillum brasil, a plant-associated bacterium, contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospillum Eth Response 1 (AE1), which directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and root colonization. RNA sequencing and metabolomics showed ethylene causes widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, leading to polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation. The data suggest a model where ethylene from plants alters A. brasil's colonization density and metabolism, indicating the bacterium adapts to ethylene sensing. This provides potential targets to regulate beneficial plant-micro interactions.
Researchers studied the role of the IN80 protein in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. IN80 localizes to the XY body in pachene spermatocytes, suggesting it plays a role in the meiotic body. Deleting IN80 led to high expression of sex-linked genes, and active RNA polymerase II on sex chromosomes in IN80-null pene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex genes. IN80 facilitates recruitment of DNA repair factors for silencing sex genes, independent of histone variant H2A. Without IN80, chromatin becomes less accessible at DNA repair sites on sex chromosomes. This suggests IN80's role in DNA factor localization, facilitating silencing sex genes during pachema.

 IN80 interacts and regulates sex gene silencing in pene spermatocytes, promoting chromatin opening during zyema-to-pachema transition at DSB regions. IN80 regulates chromosome accessibility during meiotic progression. Chromatin accessibility is crucial for DNA repair and transcription. IN80 also silences autosomal genes in spermatocytes by promoting H3me3 modification, while H4 remains unaffected. IN80 silencing sex genes in meiotic is independent of direct transcriptional regulation by DNA factor recruitment.

IN80 regulates chromatin at DSB sex regions, independent of H2. It interacts with DNA factors ATR and MDC, facilitating MDC recruitment at sex during pachema. IN80 also interacts with A and M in meiotic spermatocytes. γ2 X at D sites zema remained in IN80KO spermatocytes. Initial γ2 X deposition at sex axis initiates IN-facitated M1 recruitment. This amplifies γ2 in INacitated ATR fashion.
Researchers have identified a protein called SV-1 that plays a crucial role in axon regeneration in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. SV-1 is a dual-function protein that acts as a growth factor to promote axon regeneration and a protease to regulate development. To understand how SV-1 changes from a protease to growth factor for axon regeneration, scientists investigated the enzyme cytidine deaminase CDD-2. They found that C-2 is necessary for axon regeneration by converting SV-1 from protease to growth factor. A specific change in the SV-1 protein, replacing His with Tyr at position 755, suppressed the C-2 defect in axon regeneration. Additionally, a hairpin structure around the His site in SV-1 mRNA is required for axon activation by SV-1. These results suggest C-2 promotes axon regeneration by modifying SV-1 from protease to growth through SV-1 mRNA.
Scientists have used zebraf fish to study how physical and mental states change with age, disease, and genetics, and drug effects. Zeb fish behavior can be represented by simple models where individuals are abstracted as self-propelling agents. These agents' behavior depends on parameters like physical systems. Researchers modified zeb fish genetically to control behavior at the individual level, not externally. They studied zeb with a lack of col2 gene, causing early osteoarthritis. Col2- zeb fish had bent vertebrae, swam less, and took longer to change direction. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutants swam more orderly than wild type. A model captured wild and col- zeb behavior with self-prop agents with higher orientational noise. This shows changing biological systems can be tuned with simple models.

 Researchers used zeb to change characteristics from bottom-up, like colloids and proteins. Zeb behavior can be compared to active matter models with fish properties, interactions, and environment. They studied col- zeb with a homozygous mutation, both parents had the same. By modeling zeb as active matter, physiological behaviors were revealed related to skeletal changes.

A study compared wild and col- zeb, whose col2 gene was knocked out. The modification caused vertebral defects, less swimming, slower reorientation. Compromised development and bending likely prevented mutants from changing direction, longer orientational time. Col- zeb had less orientational noise, modeled as self-prop agents aligning. Group reduced noise was captured by increased persistence.
Researchers have developed a computer model to simulate the growth of capillary networks in the lab, a crucial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines mechanical and chemical signals to understand how capillaries form. The model shows that capillary networks develop when mechanical and chemical cues work together, with cell movement and shape driven by soluble and bound forms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Soluble VEG in the culture medium changes cell shape, while bound VEG on the surface provides signals, both important for capillary formation.

The model covers how VEG affects endothelial cells. Soluble VEG induces shape changes and bound VEG provides signals. Capillary development relies on biodeformation, enough bound VEG, and VEG gradient for spatial cues. The network forms well when mechanical and chemical work together.

The model was compared to experiments and showed good agreement. However, some issues remain, such as omitting bound VEG and not fully reproducing biel experiments. The study shows how mechanical and chemical cues work together in capillary development. Another study used a mechanical model to simulate cell networks and sprouts, showing cap-like structures via stress and strain between cells and substrates.
Researchers have studied the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) family of proteins in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a simple organism with only five TGFβ ligands compared to the many in vertebrates. They found that all five Tβ ligands play a role in the worm's survival against bacterial pathogens, and that multiple Tβ ligand pairs work together in this response. Two Tβ-like ligands, DB-1 and T-2, function independently, while T-2 and T-3 work together. Structural analysis suggests that T-2 and T-3 can form heterodimers. T-2 and T-3 lack a conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking dimers, a rare feature among Tβ ligands. The researchers also found that DB-1/BMP receptor and Smad transducers are involved in the response to pathogens, but components of the D- T-β/Activ signaling pathway are not. This study shows that BMP and Tβ/Activ subfamily ligands can interact, providing a mechanism for distinguishing their developmental and homeostatic functions from acute responses like the immune response to pathogens.
Researchers have identified a new role for the enzyme N-terminal acetylase 4 (Nat4) in protecting the integrity of the genome by responding to DNA damage in yeast cells. Nat4 acetylates the amino group on histones H4 and H2, which are crucial for chromatin structure. Without Nat, yeast cells are more sensitive to DNA damage and accumulate more breaks than normal cells. When DNA is damaged, Nat4 expression increases and the enzyme is recruited to double-strand breaks. The study found that Nat-deleted cells have lower levels of damage-induced H2ASph (H2) and reduced binding of the checkpoint protein Rad9 to double-strand breaks. Additionally, Mec1 kinase recruitment to double-strand breaks, necessary for H2ph deposition and Rad retention, is impaired in Nat-deleted cells. This leads to reduced Mec-dependent phosphorylation of downstream kinase Rad53, a sign of damage activation. Importantly, Nat's effects on the damage cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetylase activity on histone H4. This study reveals a novel link between histone N-terminalase Nat and the DNA damage response, highlighting a new hist-modifying activity in genome maintenance.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cells within a tumor, known as a phylogeny. This is useful for understanding how cancer develops and treating it. Current methods can't accurately reconstruct phylogenies with more than 30 mutations or sometimes fail. Orchard can reconstruct phylogen with up to 1000 mutations. It does this by approximating the distribution of possible phylogenies and optimizing each step by step. Evaluations show Orchard outperforms other methods in reconstructing phylogen in 90 cancers and 14 types of leukemia. It also accurately reconstructs phylogen with 1,000 mutations. Large phylogen can identify patterns of mutations in cancer subpopulations. 

Cancer studies generate large amounts of data with hundreds of mutations and samples. Until now, algorithms couldn't reliably reconstruct trees with more than 30 mutations. Orchard solves this by not needing to pre-cluster mutations. It reconstructs problems with 100 mutations and 100 samples. Benchmarking shows Orchard against other methods on 14 types of leukemia and 90 cancers. Results show Orchard matches or beats baselines on reconstruction with up to 300 mutations and 100 samples. It recovers larger trees on simulated data. Orchard can reconstruct 100-node trees in 26 hours.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Immugen to predict how the body's immune system reacts to cancer cells. This is important for creating personalized medicines that target specific cancer cells. The challenge is that the immune system doesn't always react as expected, making it hard to predict. Immugen is a modular model that uses language to predict how the immune system reacts to cancer cells. It's made of three parts: one that predicts how the immune system binds to cancer cells, another that uses information from the immune cells themselves, and a third that predicts how likely the immune system will react. Immugen performed as well as or better than other models on predicting how the immune binds to cancer cells and how stable it is. It outperformed others on predicting how the immune reacts to cancer, with a 7% increase in accuracy. Adding information from the immune cells improved its performance. The model's performance was analyzed to understand its strengths and weaknesses and biases in the data used. Immugen is a framework for predicting how the immune reacts to cancer using a language model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on available data.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genes related to meat color in fast-growing white-feather chickens. They found a 6.24-kilobase region on chromosome 15 associated with lightness and redness. The protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPP1) was linked to meat color, with a strong association (p-value of 8.65E-08. Mendelian randomization analysis confirmed the relationship between PPP1 expression and lightness. Skeletal muscle-specific PPP knockout mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin, with a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed decreased slow-twitch myofiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. A plasm reporter assay showed a SNP in the PPP1 intron regulated gene activity. Differences in meat phenotypes, myoglobin, and fastwitch marker genes were found between fast-growing and local chickens. The study identified PPP1 as the causative gene for color and a novel variant for meat improvement.

The researchers used genome-wide association and gene-based analysis to find genes related to meat color in chickens. They found a 6.24-kilase region on chromosome 15 associated with lightness and redness. The protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPP) was linked to meat, with a strong association (p-value 8.65-08. Mendelian analysis confirmed the relationship between PPP expression and light. Skeletal PPP knockout mice showed increased light and decreased myoglobin, with a shift from slow-t to fast myofib. Transcript and metabolome showed decreased slow and enhanced glycol. A pl reporter showed a SNP in the PPP intron regulated activity. Differences in meat, myoglobin, and fast marker were found between fast and local.
Researchers have developed a new technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the structure of retinal ganglion cells in the retina. These cells receive signals from bipolar cells, which form subunits within the ganglion's receptive field. By identifying these subunits, scientists can better understand the retina's architecture. The new method combines super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to efficiently locate subunits. Simulations show it can find subunits across various models and real recordings of primate ganglion cells validate its feasibility. STR can reveal sub layouts in a few minutes, making it ideal for online investigations.

The technique, STR, uses the center-surround structure of Ricker stripes to sharpen subunit responses and tomographically reconstruct sub. It combines principles of stimulated emission microscopy and computed tomography. The authors tested STR on a realistic gang cell model and electrophysiological recordings from primate retinal ganglion cells. Rapid sub identification leaves time for in-depth studies of retinal circuitry. Knowing sub locations, stimuli can be made to characterize spatiemporal properties, nonlinearities, and synaptic weights of each sub, and evaluate across sub within gang cell field.

To test STR, electrophys recordings were made of ganglion cells in isolated marmet retina using multielectrode while projecting stimuli onto retinal photoreceptors. The method identifies sub layout of sub composing gang cell field using targeted characteristics and reduces required time.
Researchers have developed a new method called CRISPR-DR to identify genes that interact with antibiotics in bacteria. This method uses a technique called CRISPR (CRIS interference) to study how genes respond to antibiotics. CRPRDR combines data from multiple small RNAs (sgRNAs) that target the same gene, which vary in strength and efficiency. Efficiency of these RNAs is measured by how much they slow down bacterial growth. The goal is to find RNs that interact with antibiotics in a specific way, called synergistic, where depletion of a protein increases abundance of mutants in the presence of a drug. This effect depends on concentration of drug and strength of RN. A new statistical model, CRPRDR, incorporates both RN efficiency and drug concentration in a dose-response equation. It analyzes data from a study on Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify interacting genes with antibiotics. This method can be applied to other datasets, as shown with a study on E. coli growth on different carbon sources. CRPRDR performs well compared to other methods, but some generate more interactions, likely false positives, while CRDR maintains precision in both real and simulated data. The method extends previous work by including effects of drug and RN efficiency in one model. Ideally, genes interact with drugs in a synergistic way, where depletion of protein increases abundance of mutants in presence of inhibitor. Requirements for CRDR are multiple RNAs for each target, varying strength, and actual efficiency of RNs quantified in control conditions. Primary use is identifying chemical-genetic interactions with drug as covariate.
Researchers have developed a new method to find communities in gene-expression networks without assuming they are organized in modules, or groups of genes that work together more with each other than with other groups. This is different from previous methods that assume modules exist and ignore other possible organizations. The new method, called the weighted corrected stochastic block model (SBM), uses all information in the network to separate genes into hierarchically organized blocks. Using data from fruit flies, the SBM found 10 times more groups than other methods, and some groups were not modular. These non-modular groups were as important as modular ones, showing the transcriptome is more complex than thought. This challenges the idea that modularity is the main driver of gene-expression structure. The study also found that non-modular groups are common in networks and as important as modular ones, highlighting the need to consider other factors beyond modularity. The researchers suggest using methods that don't rely on modularity, like graphical lasso, to explore networks. They also propose combining community detection with network inference, using community structure to inform inference. To address alternative organizations, they used a measure that finds meaningful non-assortative groups with biological interpretation, the weighted nested corrected stochastic block model.
Researchers studied the role of cytoplasmic poly (A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) in yeast, a protein involved in post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. To understand its direct and indirect roles, they used mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and RiboSeq to analyze yeast cells lacking the P1 gene. They found drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, and defects in translation initiation and termination in P1 cells. The defects in initiation and stabilization of specific mRNAs in P cells appear to be partly due to reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and deadenylation complex components, in addition to P1's direct role. Cells without P1 showed a nonsense readthrough phenotype, indicating a defect in termination. The results indicate that P1's loss is pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous post-transcription regulation aspects.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that can cause slow brain rhythms, such as those seen during sleep or seizures, in neurons. These rhythms occur when the brain cells fire at a lower frequency than normal and are thought to be caused by interactions between cells and delays in signals. However, a new study suggests an alternative explanation that applies to all types of neurons. It involves the interaction between fast electrical signals and slow changes in the concentration of potassium outside the cell, controlled by the sodium-potassium pump. Analysis of the system shows that this interaction can create a stable state where the cell can either burst or be silent. The strength of the pump determines whether the cell bursts or is silenced. The study suggests that disturbances in potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia, can cause transitions between these states. A model outlining the pump's role in burst dynamics can help understand pathologies like epilepsy and inform treatments.
Researchers have developed a new software package called COPS to evaluate and compare different methods for grouping patients with complex diseases based on multiple types of data, such as genetic and molecular information. Current methods often focus on one type of data, like genetic or molecular, and do not consider how stable the groups are or how well they predict patient outcomes. COPS can handle multiple types of data and assess how stable the groups are and how well they predict outcomes. It was tested on seven types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and lung, using different types of data. Unlike previous studies, COPS compared data-driven and knowledge-driven methods and used sampling to ensure robust results.

COPS offers advanced methods, including network, dimension reduction, and pathway integration, some not available in other software, and new approaches. It was applied to seven cancer types of cancer, including breast, prostate, and lung, using mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and methylation data. Unlike previous studies, COPS compared data and knowledge-driven multi-view methods and incorporated cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival analysis via regression including covariates, and stability of results. While standard metrics vary across methods and datasets, it's essential to assess multi-clustering using multiple criteria, from stability to prognostic relevance.

The study used Pareto concept to evaluate metrics in each cancer case. Affinity Fusion, Integrative Non-Matrix Factor, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with linear Pathway Kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different outcomes in several studies. COPS demonstrated effectiveness in benchmarking multi-clustering to categorize patients based on multi-profiles. It also evaluated new pathway kernels, BW and RWK, which may be better suited for clustering than previous kernels. Unlike previous studies, survival analysis was based on multi-clustering to provide predictive value beyond clinical information. Findings provide insights into multi-clustering for cancer subtyping and implications for patient stratification and treatment.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the SoxC protein SEM-2 plays a crucial role in embryonic development and specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage. Researchers have identified a novel loss-of-function SEM-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain. Analysis of mutant animals harboring this mutation revealed new functions of SEM-2 in the lineage. SEM-2 functions antagonizes LET-381, the C elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage. Additionally, SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of SM. SEM- also regulates the expression of hl-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for patterning the lineage. The study suggests an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. The research uncovers new interactions in the regulatory network underlying C elegans postembry development, adding to the understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.
