Researchers have discovered a new role for the Notch signaling pathway in reprogramming cells in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. This pathway is surprising because Notch is typically known for maintaining undifferentiated stem cells in the germline. The team found that Notch promotes reprogramming by activating genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and identified the histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial Notch target in this process. This finding has implications for development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.

In C. elegans, the Notch pathway is essential for maintaining undifferentiated stem cells in the germl. However, the researchers found an unexpected role in reprogramming these cells into somatic cells. To understand this, they combined genetics, tissue-specific transcript analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes. They identified genes activated by increased Notch signaling and found an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PR2. The C. elegans PR2 consists of MES-2, -3, and -6, and levels of these transcripts were not altered by Notch signaling.

When analyzing genes with higher germline expression, the proportion of Not-activated genes was striking. In C. elegans, genes are largely silenced by PR2. The team found genes regulated by Notch, including those maintaining gerine stem cells. They also found genes activated by Not were repressed by the fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PR2. Not and PR2 have an antagonistic effect on cell fate decisions and co-regulate common target UTX-1.
Researchers have identified a protein called SK2 as essential for the body's defense against Klebsiella pneumoniae, a bacterium that causes respiratory, blood, and bladder infections. They found that mice lacking SK2 had 100 times more bacteria in their lungs compared to those with normal SK2, and that SK2 expression in immune cells controlled the infection. SK2 neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, were present in the lungs and responded normally to the infection, but failed to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that kill the bacteria. The ROS production required activity of several proteins, including Syk, Btk, PLC2, and PK, and SK2 loss hindered the bacteria's phosphorylation of these proteins, indicating SK2's role in signaling pathways.

The study supports previous findings that bacteria are sensitive to ROS, as seen in increased burden in mice lacking ROS-producing cells and in patients. Neutrophils with SK2 required full phosphorylation of Sy, Sy, and Py2, critical for ROS production. Experiments revealed SK2's role in host defense against Klei pneumonia in a lung infection model. SK2 was indispensable for neutil ROS, but not degranulation or phagocytosis, suggesting increased burden in SK- mice was due to loss of ROS sensitivity. Results indicate Kle pneumonia strain is resistant to neutil phagocytosis regardless of SK expression, but elicits SK-independent degranulation during infection.

ROS is crucial for protection against pneumonia as mice lacking NAD oxidase component were more susceptible. A murine model of Kle pneumonia infection characterized SK's role in host defense. SK-expressing neutils contributed to containment in lungs independent of monocytes. Neutils show SK- are defective in triggering cascade for ROS after pneumonia binding. To investigate SK's mediation of ROS, several proteins critical for receptor production were evaluated.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how a type of malaria parasite, Plasmod vivax, is transmitted from person to person. This parasite stays dormant in the liver for weeks or months after initial infection and then causes new infections. The model shows that many people have few or no parasites in their liver, while some have many. Those with more parasites are more likely to get sick again and spread the disease. The model predicts that treating people with a certain drug, primaquine, can reduce transmission as it targets those with many parasites. 

The parasite's dormant stage in liver is a third reservoir, along with blood and mosquito reservoirs. Relapses can be added to malaria models to account for this stage. Without a way to detect liver parasites, models help estimate effectiveness of treatments targeting this stage. Most malaria models don't account for liver reservoir, but some P viv models include it as a state to denote infection or up to two stages. 

The model shows that many epidemiological patterns of relapses can be explained by parasites activating and dying at a constant rate. It's integrated into Ross-Macald models to account for P viv relapses. This can provide insights into impact of interventions on parasite reservoirs in vector, blood, and liver.
Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging, releasing over 90 tons of carbon (C) into the atmosphere each year. However, this carbon is balanced by forest regrowth. Researchers used a network of 133 forest plots (175 hectares) across Amazonia to study regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass to predict post-logging carbon recovery. They found that above-ground carbon recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield (21.3 Mg/ha) than in the south (12.3 Mg/ha) where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality). Surviving trees play a key role in regrowth and a comprehensive map of post-disturbance recovery in Amazonia was created.

The study analyzed data from 13 long-term (8-30 year) experimental sites in Amazon and Guiana. Sites met criteria: located in tropical forests with annual rainfall above 100mm, total area above 1ha, at least one pre-logging census, and at least two post-logging cens. Focus was on selective logging, a common human disturbance in tropical forests. Data from the TFO network are unique in duration and extent. Results give clues on regional differences in Amazon response to carbon loss from other disturbances.

Maps of carbon, climate, and soil were used to upscale results to Amazon and create predictive maps of changes over 10 years. A 40% loss is a common intensity after logging in Amazon. Climate change draws attention to human impacts on carbon cycles, particularly 2.1 Pg/yr of loss from various disturbances in tropical forests. Selective logging causes 1.1 Pg/yr loss.
Researchers have identified two distinct types of stem cells in the adult mouse brain's lateral ventricle-subventricular zone (SVZ): neuro-initiating cells (NICs) and neural stem cells (NSCs). NICs are highly mitotic and short-lived, forming neurospheres that can differentiate into multiple cell types, while pre-NSCs are quiescent and long-lived, expressing stem cell markers. NICs were isolated by flow cytometry as GlastEGhighPlexBhighCD24/lowO/PS-AM/Ter/CD- cells, accounting for 3.2% of SVZ cells. They formed neuropheres in 36% of the time and 74% of those underwent multilineage differentiation. In contrast, pre-NS lacked neurosphere formation ability and were long-lived, expressing stem markers Slc1-CERT, GF-CERT, Sox2ERT, and GliERT. Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 protein depleted both NIC and pre-NS, but pre-NS were more dependent on Bmi for Cdk2 repression. The study distinguishes quies NSCs from NIC, enabling their study in vivo.
Researchers have discovered that Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel, can sense forces in various cells and tissues. Using cryo-electron microscopy, they found that Pie1 has a bowl-shaped structure that can curve the membrane, suggesting it may influence the distribution and function of other Pie1 channels. To study this, they used cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp to examine membrane patches from cells with low and high levels of Pie1 expression. Their data, combined with simulations of Pie1 distribution, showed that at normal and high densities, Pie1 channels overlap, but density does not affect sensitivity or open probability without tension. This suggests Pie channels at normal levels function independently as mechanotrans, allowing cells to sense forces evenly across the membrane. This is important as it shows Pie channels don't concentrate or modulate each other's sensitivity, ideal for cells to sense forces homogeneously.

Pie1 is a mechanically gated ion channel that senses tension with high sensitivity. To understand its spatial and functional interactions, researchers used electrophysiology and simulations. They found Pie channels at normal levels function independently, enabling cells to sense forces homogeneously. This is significant as it shows Pie channels don't spatially concentrate or functionally modulate each other's sensitivity, ideal for cells to sense forces homogeneously.

Cells are exposed to forces and have mechanisms to detect them. Rapid sensing occurs through force-gated channels converting energy into signals. Pie1 is a mechanically gated cation that senses tension with high sensitivity. Here, researchers investigated Pie's spatial and functional interactions at various densities. They used electrophys to quantify number and function, including single current, probability, and sensitivity. They sought to characterize Pie's ability to spatially modulate each other's function. Cell-attached-clamp electrophys was used, with limitations. Spatial resolution is limited by pipette size.

Researchers studied how people and monkeys make decisions when faced with uncertain information. They tested a theory that decisions are made by adding up evidence until a certain point. The theory predicts that adding noise to the evidence should make decisions faster, less accurate, but more confident. To test this, they created a way to add noise to the brain's visual processing of motion. They recorded brain activity in monkeys' visual cortex while they made decisions. The results showed that adding noise made decisions faster and more confident, but didn't affect accuracy much. This matches the theory's predictions.

The researchers used a motion task that's well-studied in the brain. They recorded from brain cells in the macaque's visual cortex, areas MT and MST, which process motion. These cells represent the momentary evidence in the task. They tested the effect of noise on decision speed and confidence with a random-dot motion task. Three humans did 663 trials each, and one monkey 14,137. The task started with a central spot, then two targets appeared, and subjects chose which moved. They used the noise manipulation to test its effect on accuracy, reaction time, and confidence in humans and monkeys.

The study found that adding noise to the evidence made decisions faster and more confident, but not less accurate. This matches the theory's predictions. The researchers verified the noise's effect by recording brain activity in monkeys' visual cortex. They used a motion task that's well-stud in the brain, and recorded from cells in areas that process motion. The results agree with the theory that adding noise makes decisions faster and more confident, but not less accurate.
Researchers have found that two proteins, UNC-43 and TAX-6B-1, play a crucial role in regulating the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, by controlling the activity of a transcription factor called DAF-16. DAF-16 is a part of the insulin signaling pathway, which normally keeps the worm's lifespan short. However, UNC-43 and TAX-6-1 have opposing effects on D-16. UNC-43 activates D-16, allowing it to enter the cell's nucleus, while TAX-6-1 deactivates it by removing a phosphate group. This balance between the two proteins determines the worm's lifespan. When both are present, their opposing effects cancel each other out, and insulin signaling dominates. Insulin signaling pathway is one of several that regulates aging in C. elegans, including germline, mitochondrial, and dietary restriction pathways. The insulin pathway includes the receptor DAF-2 and the transcription factor D-16.
Researchers studied how fruit flies groom their bodies using a series of movements. They found that the nervous system organizes these movements into a hierarchy, where earlier movements suppress later ones. This means that cleaning one part of the body reduces the drive for the next movement, allowing the sequence to progress down the hierarchy. They created a model that shows how this hierarchy works, with movements activated in parallel but selected serially through suppression. This is the first example of an innate sequence generated by a model for human actions.

Fruit flies have different motor programs for cleaning five body parts that progress in series. By targeting specific neural subsets, researchers controlled each program to show they are organized in a hierarchy. A computational model demonstrates how suppression mediates the selection of cleaning programs. The ability to select behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided infrastructure for actions in sequence.

The study looked at the organization of neural control in an innate behavior common to many animals - grooming. Animals have mechanisms for selecting favorable options and suppressing others. A key finding is that hierarchical suppression among behaviors leads to a sequence. The researchers anticipate that identifying neural circuits for each module and how they interact will reveal how behavior is encoded in the system through suppression.
Researchers have identified a protein called Shugoshin 2 (Sg2) that plays a crucial role in the process of meiosis, a type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells. Meiosis involves the separation of chromosomes, which are thread-like structures that carry genetic information, into two daughter cells. Accurate separation depends on several processes, including cohesion, which holds chromosomes together, kinetochore-microtule (K-fib) interactions, and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). The study found that S2 protects cohesion and helps turn off the SAC, allowing chromosomes to congress and bi-orient on meiosis spind, and form K-fib. It also limits bivalent stretching. S2's ability to protect cohesion depends on interaction with protein PP2, silencing SAC is mediated by binding to Mad2. However, its effect on bivalent and Kib formation is independent of PP2 and mediated by MCA and Aurora kinase inhibition respectively.

S2 helps turn off SAC by binding PP2 and Mad2, moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting MCA, and promotes Kib by downregulating Aurora/B at kineto. Meiosis is a complex process dependent on multiple biochemical events. Depletion of S2 in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences during meiosis, including SAC silencing, bivalent stretching, and alterations in K-f attachments. S silences SAC by binding Mad using a motif common to Mad's partners Cdc20 and Mad1. Delayed bival on meind, increased bivalent, and Aurora/B ateto, accompanied by increase in lateral and decrease in K attachments. S2 deficiency delayed APC/CC20 activation, required to shut SAC.

A single protein regulates cohesion, traction, SAC, and Aurora/Cases. Different mutations alter some but not others, proving pleiotropy in S2/ oocytes not due to secondary effects. S2 defective PP binding fails to protect centrom cohes, found S1 in yeast. However, this S's sole function, chromosome behavior me should be unaffected. Surprisingly, S deficiency caused changes chromosome and microtule dynamics.
Researchers have discovered a new way in which the brain cells called neurons can change and adapt in response to experiences. This process, called synaptic plasticity, is crucial for learning and memory. Previous studies have shown that neurons can make new proteins at the site of connections between cells, called synapses, to change and strengthen or weaken them. Now, scientists have found that in addition to making new proteins, neurons also transport RNA, the blueprint for proteins, from the cell's nucleus to synapses. This transport is triggered by a signal called netrin-1, which is released when synapses are stimulated.

In a study on sensory neurons, researchers used imaging to track RNA and protein synthesis. They found that RNA was delivered throughout the neuron's branches, but proteins were made only at synapses and stimulated synapses. Investigating how this process, they found that netrin-1 and its receptor, DCC, play a key role in triggering protein synthesis at synapses. By regulating translation, rather than delivering RNA to synapses, neurons can quickly respond to local cues.

Previous studies have shown that activity can control RNA localization within neurons. This, combined with the new findings, suggests a signal promotes translation of localized RNAs. The researchers identified netrin-1/DCC signaling as this signal. They found that specific RNAs, proteins, and translation factors were delivered to synapses and non-synaptic sites, but synthesis was enriched at synapses. This indicates that gene expression in sensory neurons is primarily regulated at translation, not RNA targeting from the nucleus.

The team tested netrin-1's role by incubating neurons with recombinant netrin-1. They found it triggered synthesis at synapses but not nonynaptic contacts. This suggests netrin regulates localized transcripts during synapse formation and plasticity. Further analysis of more transcripts is needed to confirm this mechanism.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how cells interact and organize into complex patterns in the early stages of development. They used a technique called CRISPR interference to turn off specific genes in human pluripotent stem cells, which are cells that can become any type of cell in the body. The genes controlled cell adhesion and tension, which is how cells stick to each other. By turning off these genes, the cells organized into different patterns, but still kept their ability to become any cell type. This method allows scientists to study how cells interact and form patterns, which is important for understanding how tissues and organs develop.

The researchers used a system that can turn on and off genes in specific groups of cells. They created groups of cells with and without the system, then turned off the genes in some of them. They found that turning off genes for cell adhesion and tension led to patterns in the cells. This is similar to what happens in early development, where cells stick together and form patterns. The study shows that turning off genes in specific cells can control how cells organize and form patterns. This is important for understanding how tissues and organs develop.

The method allows scientists to study how cells interact and form patterns, which is key to understanding how tissues and organs develop. It can also help create models to study how tissues and organs form, which is important for understanding human development. The study shows a new way to control how cells organize and form patterns, which is important for understanding how tissues and organs develop.
Researchers have proposed a new theory to explain why our brains' ability to hold and recall visual information in short-term memory decreases as the number of items increases. The theory suggests that the brain balances the cost of making mistakes with the cost of processing information. A model based on this idea predicts the decrease in memory performance with more items. Notably, this effect is influenced by the likelihood of being asked to recall, matching previous findings. The model also accounts for how both the number of items and likelihood affect accuracy in delayed recall tasks. Furthermore, it shows that the amount of effort invested in remembering can increase or decrease with the number of items. The theory suggests it's sometimes optimal to remember only some or none of the items in a task. This raises the possibility that cognitive limitations come from balancing costs rather than physical constraints.

 Current models of short-term memory have improved, but still can't fully explain why performance worsens with more items. The idea that memory precision depends on the number of items lacks a clear explanation. A new proposal is that performance is traded against the cost of processing. This theory may apply to other cognitive tasks, such as attention. It suggests selectivity in attention comes from balancing performance against the cost of neural activity. The theory provides a framework to test this idea and explain size effects in attention tasks. It was tested on data from nine delayed recall experiments and accounts for effects of both number and likelihood, with few parameters. It also explains a non-monotonic relationship between number and total effort invested in remembering. The model predicts a nonotonic between neural activity and number at the population level. This can be tested with neuroimaging experiments. The study focused on number and likelihood, but the theory also predicts effects of incentives on precision, as they affect the cost function.
Researchers have discovered that a protein from the Irish potato pathogen Phytophthora infest, called PRD54, interferes with a plant's natural defense mechanism to fight off diseases. This mechanism, called autophagy, helps plants get rid of damaged or infected cells and recycle nutrients. PRD54 binds to a protein called ATG8, which stimulates the formation of autagosomes, and removes another protein called J2 from AT8 complexes. J2 is important for plant defense against pathogens. By doing so, PRD54 helps the pathogen counteract the plant's defense. This is the first time a pathogen has been shown to use autagy for its own benefit, not just to harm the plant. 

The study found that PRD54 has a specific site to bind to AT8 and stimulate autosome formation. Unlike other pathogens, PR54 activates autagy to get rid of defense-related compounds and recycle nutrients. Researchers used a family of proteins, called RXLR effectors, to understand how pathogens invade plants. PR54 is part of this family and binds to AT8 to stimulate autosome. It also removes J2 from AT8 complexes, making the plant more susceptible to disease. The study shows pathogens can activate autagy for their own benefit, not just harm the plant.

Researchers have developed a new model to study how human cardiac fibroblasts (CF) respond to changes in their environment, such as those that occur during a heart attack. Cardiac fibroblasts play a key role in heart tissue repair, but can also contribute to scarring and inflammation. The team used a device to apply both mechanical strain and oxygen changes to human CF in the lab. They found that a combination of low oxygen and reduced contractility triggered inflammation and scarring, while individual stimuli caused cell growth and collagen production. This study provides new insights into how CF respond to injury and may lead to new treatments for heart disease.

Researchers have identified two isoforms of the DOM chromatin regulator, DOM-A and DOM-B, which form distinct multi-subunit complexes in Drosophila. Both complexes are necessary for transcription regulation, but through different mechanisms. DOM-B incorporates H2.V, the fly ortholog of H2.Z, genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR complex. DOM-A, however, functions as an ATP-independent histone acetylase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, similar to yeast Nu4. This work shows how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functions. In yeast and humans, nucleosome and histone acetylase complexes originate from duplication and paralog specification, while Dophila generates diversity through alternative splicing of a single gene.

The DOM complex is an example of how evolution can take different routes to achieve similar functions. In yeast, SW1 and Nu4 are separate entities, while in humans, genomes underwent duplication, paralog SRC and EP protein organize different complexes that serve conserved functions. This suggests T60 resides in the DOM complex in Doph cells. Both SW-1 and Nu4 are implicated in transcription. The researchers explored functional differences of the two isoforms on transcription by RNAseq, including knockdowns of H2.V and T60. Knockdown of either DOM, DOM, T60, or H2 showed similar effects on transcription.

DOM-A has similar domains, but separated by the ATPase domain, raising the question if it serves as central subunit of Nu4 complex in Doph. The existence of such complex with functional and structural similarity to yeast has not been reported. Surprisingly, data suggest ATP activity of-A is dispensable for H12 acylation by-A, a principle conserved across metazoa. This work shows alternative splicing generates diversity amongst chromatin regulators. H2 is found at promoters and enhancers, regulating initiation and elongation. In yeast, H is introduced by SW complex, a multiunit ATP-dependent remodeler with IN80 at core.
Researchers have long known that a protein called β-caten (Ctnb1) in muscle cells is crucial for the development of nerve-mus junctions, where nerve cells connect with muscles. However, it was unclear how muscle cells send signals back to nerve cells to help form these connections. Scientists used a genetic approach to study the role of tn1 in muscle and found that its ability to turn on genes is necessary for nerveus junction formation. They also found that its ability to stick to other cells is not important. They looked for proteins that tn1 sends signals to nerve cells and identified Slit2, a protein that repels nerve growth. Overexpressing Sl2 in muscle in mice improved nerve junctions in mice lacking tn1. Sl2 also induced nerve growth in spinal cord explants. These results suggest Sl2 is a signal from muscle to nerve to help form nerveus junction.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how forces are transmitted between cells in clusters of epithelial cells, which are a type of cell that make up tissues and organs. They used this method to study how forces are passed between cells in a group of epithelial cells that stick together and form a cluster. They found that the forces between cells are not constant, but change over time and depend on the position of the cell in the cluster. The forces are also affected by the cell's connection to its neighbors and the surrounding tissue.

The researchers focused on a protein called E-cadherin, which is important for cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells. They found that the forces between cells are related to Eadherin's location at the junctions between cells. They also found that forces can be passed through cells by the cell's connection to the surrounding tissue and actin, a protein that helps cells move and change shape.

The study showed that forces are short-ranged, meaning they don't travel far between cells. This is because cells are anchored to the tissue and each other through adhesion and actin. This is different from longer-range forces that are needed for some tissue movements, like cell migration. The method can be used to study how forces are passed between cells in different types of tissues and how they change over time.

The researchers used a technique to measure forces between cells in real time and space. They used a protein that glows to Eadher, which is important for cell adhesion in epithelial cells. This allowed them to measure forces between cells at any point in time. They found that forces are not constant, but change over time and depend on the cell's position in the cluster. They also found that forces are affected by the cell's connection to its neighbors and the tissue.

The study provides new insights into how forces are passed between cells in tissues and how they are controlled. This can help understand how tissues develop and change over time. The method can be used to study other types of tissues and how forces are passed between cells.
Researchers have investigated the structure and function of the huntingtin protein, which is affected by a polyglutamine expansion that causes Huntington's disease. They used various biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle microscopy, and cross-link mass spectrometry to study the protein. The results show that huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and has a spherical α-helical soloid structure with the amino and carbox-terminal regions forming a central cavity. The polyglut expansion increases α-hical properties and affects intramolecular interactions among domains. This study provides insight into the characteristics of full-length huntingtin affected by polyglut expansion and solves the puzzle of how the amino-terminal polyut tract confers a property on hunting causing disease.

The researchers used biophysical and biochemical analyses of purified recombinant huntingins with varied polyut tracts to understand the impact of the polyut on hunting's basic features. They found that hunting may undergo conformation change upon interaction with partners. Single-particle microscopy of recombin humanins with polyut lengths 23-78 showed that hunting's shape may enable structural impact of the amino polyut tract.

The study provides a solution to the mystery of how the amino polyut may modulate hunting structure and function. Biophysical analyses of native recombin humanins show that the polyut tract is in a position to modulate hunting structure and function. The results suggest that hunting's α-hical structure is affected by polyut length, with an increase in polyut leading to more α-hical properties.
Ferritinophagy, the process by which cells break down and recycle ferritin, a protein that stores iron, is crucial for regulating intracellular iron levels. However, how ferritinagy is controlled and the role of a protein called NCO4 in this process was not well understood. Researchers studied the interaction between N4 and ferritin and found that a specific part of N4 binds to ferritin, allowing it to be delivered to lysosomes, where it is broken down. N4 levels are controlled by two systems: autophagy, which breaks down and recycles cellular components, and the ubiquitin-proteome, which tags proteins for destruction. When iron levels are high, N4 is broken down, allowing ferritin to accumulate and store iron. When iron is low, N4 levels increase, promoting ferritin breakdown. A protein called HER2 helps break down N under high iron conditions, reducing N levels and allowing ferritin to capture iron. In zebraf fish and human cells, N plays a key role in red blood cell development. This study reveals how N4 and ferritin interact and how iron levels control N4-mediated ferragy in cells.
Researchers have long understood that the lateral prefrontal cortex (LP) plays a crucial role in higher-level cognition, but its organization has remained unclear. A theory suggests that the LP is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing more abstract information for efficient and flexible cognition. However, support for this theory has been limited. Recent human MRI data revealed rostral-caudal gradients in the LP, indicating hierarchical processing. Dynamic modeling showed asymmetrical interactions between LP regions, contrary to assumptions, the strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned midLP as the apex of the hierarchy. Cognitive demands modulated connectivity towards LP, consistent with a role in integrating information for control. Strengths of these dynamics related to higher-level cognitive ability, suggesting the LP is hierarchically organized with midLP synthesizing abstract and concrete to control behavior.

 Studies confirmed the rostral-caud axis of LP operates according to abstraction principles by examining gradients of stimulus domain-specificity and control. Interactions among LP sub-regions showed how cognitive demands elicited asymmetrical influences of hierarchical processing. Hierarchical orientation of midLP in connectivity and top-down influences from rostral to midLP during control were related to higher-level ability. The organization of LP is tied to cognitive capacity. Debate is whether processing in LP is hierarchical, data suggest top-down within LP is important for higher function. Strongly asymmetrical projections from midLP to other regions related better-level ability, suggesting a beneficial hierarchy with midLP at apex.

Interactions within LP were examined by varying demands on domain and control. Collectively, demands engaged LP for a comprehensive account of function. Found progressively rostral processed abstract levels of control with Feature, Contextual, and Temporal eliciting rostral activations. Dynamic modeling showed hierarchical strongest in midLP. Demands elicited top-down from ro to mid and bottom-up from caud to mid. Analyses connectivity and modulations suggest LP forms where information converges to action.
Researchers have discovered a gene called TBCD3 that plays a crucial role in the development of the brain's outer layer in mice. This gene is specific to humans and great apes, and its role in brain development was not well understood until now. The study found that expressing TBCD3 in mouse brain cells in the womb led to the creation of new brain cells that are similar to those found in great apes. These cells are called outer radial glia and are important for brain growth and development. When TBC3 was turned off in human brain cells, fewer of these cells were made. When TBC3 was expressed in specific areas of the brain, it led to the formation of folds in the brain's outer layer, similar to what is seen in great apes. This suggests that TBC3 is important for brain growth and folding.

The study found that T3 promotes the creation of outer glial cells in mice, which are similar to those found in great apes. These cells are important for brain growth and development. The researchers also found that when T3 was expressed in specific areas of the brain, it led to the formation of folds in the brain's outer layer, similar to what is seen in apes. This suggests that T3 is important for brain growth and folding.

The study provides evidence that brain development can be controlled by genes that evolved in humans and great apes. The researchers found that expressing T3 in mouse brain cells in the womb led to the creation of new cells that are similar to those found in apes. These cells are called outer glial and are important for brain growth and development. When T3 was turned off in human cells, fewer of these cells were made. When T was expressed in specific areas of brain, it led to formation of folds in brain's outer, similar to what seen in apes. This suggests T is important for growth and folding.

The study found that T3 promotes creation of glial in mice, which are similar to those in apes. These are important for growth and development. Researchers also found that when T was expressed in areas, led to formation of in brain's outer, similar to what in apes. This suggests T is for growth and folding.
Researchers have investigated the role of ubiquitination in the activity of NPR1, a protein that helps plants activate their immune response to pathogens. They found that initial ubiquitination by a specific enzyme, Cullin-RING E3 (CRL), allows NPR to associate with chromatin and activate target genes. However, further ubiquitination by another enzyme, U4 (UBE), marks NPR for degradation by the proteasome. Two other enzymes, UBP/7, counteract this process by removing ubiquitin from NPR, extending its lifespan. The study shows that sequential actions of these enzymes fine-tune NPR's activity without requiring its destruction. 

Loss of UBE, the enzyme that adds ubiquitin to NPR, uncouples target gene expression from proteome activity, highlighting the importance of initial ubiquination for NPR's activity. CRL-mediated ubiquination is necessary for NPR's full transcriptional activity, while UBE-mediated ubiquitination leads to its degradation. Initial ubiquination boosts NPR's coactivator activity by enhancing promoter occupancy and genomic mobility. The study suggests that ubiquitination acts as a signal for NPR to activate genes before its degradation. 

The researchers also explored the role of E4 enzymes, which extend existing ubiquitin chains, in NPR's activity. Unlike E3 enzymes, E4 do not initiate ubiquination but add to existing chains. In Arabidopsis, E4 enzyme UBE/M3 is involved in NLR receptor degradation. The study found that prior to degradation, ubiquination itself can act as a transcription signal, allowing NPR to activate genes. Chains of four or more ubiquitin are needed for proteasome recognition, suggesting processive ubiquination provides a window for NPR to activate genes. The study indicates that ubiqu chain extension and trimming can fine-tune outputs of unstable activators without sacrificial turnover.
Researchers have identified the precursors of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide DNA methylation and silencing in Arabidopsis thalian plants. These siRNAs are 24 nucleotides long and are crucial for silencing transposons and a subset of genes. They are generated by RNA polymerase IV (Pol) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (R2) and DICER-like 3 (D3). However, the precursors of these siRNAs were previously undefined. The study found Pol and R2-dependent RNAs (PR RNAs) that accumulate in D3 mutants and are diced into siRNAs by D3 in vitro. PR RNAs are mostly 26-45 nucleotides long and start with a purine adjacent to pyrimidine, similar to Pol transcripts generated in vitro. R2 terminal transfer activity, demonstrated in vitro, may account for occasional non-templated nucleides at PR RNA 3 termini. The siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5 or 3 ends of PR RN, suggesting a model where siRN are generated from ends of PR duplexes by single dicing events.

The study found that PR RNs are dependent on both Pol and R2. They are essential for siRNA biogenesis and physically associate in Arabidopsis and maize. PRs can overlap at a given locus, but represent individual Pol-R2 transcription units. Data indicate short-stranded PRs in D mutants are immediate siRNA precursors, as D3 can cut them into siRN in vitro. This is consistent with previous findings. siRN are mostly double-stranded, as they are reduced by ribonuclease1 but not ribonuclease. PRs in D mutants are substrates for D3, which cuts them into si in vitro.
Researchers have long believed that the emergence of complex neural networks in the brain is a gradual process that develops over time. However, a new study reveals that a brief period of quietness in neural activity precedes the emergence of mature networks in the brain. This period, called the "quiescent period", occurs at the beginning of the second week after birth in rodents and is also seen in humans. During this time, neural activity is less coordinated and synchronized, but after this period, precise and organized activity emerges.

The study used high-resolution recordings in vivo electrophysiology in mice to track the development of large-scale and cellular patterns in the brain. They found that the transition from immature to mature networks was marked by a decrease in activity at the start of the second week, followed by a rapid emergence of synchronized and oscillatory patterns in space and time. This is similar to what happens in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism.

Cognitive functions, such as memory and learning, rely on precise coordination of synaptic and cellular activity in the brain. However, how immature networks develop into mature form for complex computations is not well understood. The study shows that maturation of networks is preceded by a discrete, evolutionarily conserved period in early development. During this time, oscillations and spiking display a shift from local, loosely correlated patterns to organized, spatially distributed and temporally activity.

The researchers hypothesize that emergence of advanced network properties is heralded by disappearance of immature patterns. Cortical circuits are undergoing changes in anatomical connectivity and functional during this time, with an increase in synapses in superficial layers. Neural spiking is more efficient with oscillatory, phase-locking, and temporal precision, characteristic of adult networks processing information. A transient period of perturbation may be an indicator of substantial shift in network operations.
Researchers have developed a new model to understand how the Plasmodium falcum parasite, which causes malaria, evolves and adapts to evade the human immune system. The parasite has multiple copies of genes that change its surface proteins, making it hard to fight. The model shows that even when the parasite mixes with other strains, it creates a few dominant groups of genes that are good at evading the immune system. This is because the parasite competes with other strains for space in the body, and the immune system selects the best ones that are good at evading.

The parasite has many genes that change its surface proteins, making it hard to fight. The model looks at all possible combinations of these genes and how they compete for space in the body. It shows that even when parasite mixes with other strains, it creates few groups of genes that are good at evading the immune system. This is because parasite competes with other strains for space in body and immune selects best ones that are good evading.

The model is based on earlier work that showed immune system can keep parasite in check by making it hard for it to change. The new model adds that parasite has many genes that change its surface, making it hard to fight. It shows that even when parasite mixes with other strains, creates few groups of genes that are good at evading immune. This is parasite competes with other for space in body and immune selects best that are good evading.

The model is tested with real data and shows it works. The parasite has many genes that change its surface, making hard to fight. It looks at all combinations and how they compete for space.

Researchers have discovered that a protein modification called deamidation disrupts the interaction between two proteins, UBC and TRAF6, which are crucial for the inflammatory response in the body. UBC is an enzyme that attaches ubiquitin to proteins, marking them for destruction, while TRAF is a protein that activates the NF-κ pathway, leading to inflammation. Deidation changes a glutamine in UBC to glutamate, preventing it from working with TRAF. The study found that deid disrupts the interaction between UBC and TRAF in three ways: it creates a new salt bridge within UBC that competes with a bridge between UBC and TRAF, prevents transient interactions necessary for a stable complex, and repels the negatively charged parts of U and TRAF. This shows how a post-translational modification can change the shape and stability of complexes to prevent protein-protein association. 

The bacteria Shigella flexner secretes an effector OI that deidates UBC, suppressing the inflammatory response. Deid inhibits the synthesis of K-linked ubiquitin chains by UBC TRAF, preventing activation of NFκ pathway. U is near the UAF interface but does not contact TR. Chains bring together TAK and IK kinases, leading to phosphorylation and activation of IK, degradation of Iκ and translocation of NF. To stop NF signaling, Shella secretes OI, a deidase that targets glutamine in U and converts to glutamate. Deid inhibits binding of U to TR and dimeric TR3, showing secondary interactions cannot compensate for loss of primary. The interface has many residues, but a few significantly contribute to binding. Unlike RK, deid does not change U fold, but creates competition between interm and intramolecular. Electrostatic substitutions near the interface increase protein association and affinity, shifting between native and transient.
Researchers investigated the effects of activating and inactivating specific types of cortical interneurons in the auditory cortex of awake mice to understand their computational roles. They used optogenetics to manipulate somatostatin-positive (S+) and parvalbum-positive (Pb+) interneurons while recording responses to tones and found that inactivating S+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivating P+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer. However, activating S+ and P interneurons showed no differences. This challenges the assumption that activation and inactivation would produce consistent insights into interneurons' functions. A model was used to understand this asymmetry, showing that small changes in parameters like spontaneous activity or light strength determined whether activation or inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions about interne functions.

The study found that inactivating S interneurons increased response, while inactivating P interne weakened and decreased information, implying these neurons support separate functions in the cortex. However, activating S and P interneurons showed no differences. To test this assumption, the researchers manipulated two main interneuron families, S+ and P+, while recording responses to tones in the auditory cortex of mice. To evaluate interne suppression of auditory responses, a framework was applied to 59 units from S mice and 57 from P mice whose responses were tuned and suppressed by interne activation. Units suppressed by more than 80% were excluded to avoid floor effects, including narrow-spiking and broad-spiking units. Stimulus preferences of interne themselves are important for output. For example, in cortex, P+ cells are activated by broad tones, while S inter respond to narrower tones.

In optogenetically manipulating interne, a neuron's FTC in light-on versus light conditions would reveal if change is fit a model, and to what extent transformation multiplicative, additive, or combination.
Researchers investigated how externally induced frontopetal synchronization affects working memory (WM) performance. They used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate oscillatory activity in the right frontopetal network, which supports WM. Results showed that externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed that ACS effects depended on the phase of stimulation and internal processing. Specifically, synchronous ACS during WM increased parietal activity, which correlated with performance. Functional connectivity indicated that phase of frontopetal stimulation influenced information flow within WM.

The study aimed to provide evidence for the role of oscillatory synchronization in WM and investigate underlying mechanisms of frontopetal phase influence on WM. Two experiments used tACS to entrain endogenous rhythms. Findings showed a link between WM performance and large-scale brain synchronization across the frontop network activated by the task. Manipulations ofACS modulated underlying activity and influenced long-range connectivity in phase and state-dependent manner.

The study tested four hypotheses: (1) WM performance is enhanced by entraining activity in the frontop network; (2) regional activity is modulated in phase-dependent; (3) BOLD changes induced by phase stimulation correlate with performance; (4) connectivity across regions is modulated phase-dependent. Frontal interactions increased with synchronous stimulation, while posterior increased with desynchronous, suggesting information flow through WM regions can be affected by phase.

Results showed synchronous stimulation improved performance and increased frontop activity when demands were high. This demonstrates the role of phase in WM processes and neural correlates.
Researchers have long known that the polarity of an embryo in in invertebrates and amphibians and fish is determined by maternal factors present in the egg. However, in amni vertebrates like birds and mammals, the embryo remains plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. The question is how polarity is determined in these embryos. In chick embryos, the first known factor is cV1, a growth factor similar to mammalian growth factor 1, expressed before gastrulation. A search for upstream regulators of c1 in normal and manipulated embryos reveals Pit2 as a candidate. Pit2 is essential for axis formation and directly regulates c1 expression by binding to nearby genes. Pit, c1, and Nodal are also key in left-right asymmetry, suggesting the same mechanism has been used for different functions in evolution.

A screen was done to find new genes involved in early polarity. Bioinformatics and experiments identified Pit2 as a direct regulator of c1 in normal and induced twinning. In invertebrates and amni vertebrates, polarity is established by maternal factors in the egg. This creates differences between cells that form from the egg, specifying the axis. Higher vertebrates retain regulative development until late, suggesting maternal determinants not essential for polarity.

Pit2 is the first gene to regulate axis and twinning. Results implicate Pit2 as upstream of c1: it's a factor, expressed with c in embryos and bisected zone, and before c. Time-course of Pit2 in whole and isolated halves compared to c.
Researchers studied how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) use their sense of smell to navigate their environment. They found that the flies can detect changes in the concentration of odors over time, not just the concentration itself. To understand how this works, they looked at the activity of two types of brain cells: olfactory sensory neurons (OS) and projection neurons (PN). They found that PNs signal the rate of change of odor concentration to the brain, not just the concentration. A simple model showed that PNs depend on the rate of change of OS input to determine their output. This allows flies to detect the start of an odor before moving away from it.

PNs send information to higher brain centers like the mushroom body and lateral horn. Previous studies showed OS also signal the rate of change of odor over time. This study built on that to see how PNs contribute to dynamic odor representation. They tested PNs with varying odor concentrations and created a simple model to process olfactory information. The model showed PNs depend on the rate of change of OS input, not just concentration. This is important for flies to detect odors before moving away from them. The study found that Dophila's olfactory system signals acceleration of odor to brain, allowing early detection of onsets.

Other studies have looked at how dynamic stimuli are processed in early olfactory systems, observing temporal processing of signals. This study hypothesized that acceleration in Doph antennal lobe allows higher centers to respond to onsets of rising stimuli. A model showed a cascade of rate-change leads to rapid detection of stimulus.
In flowering plants, seed development begins with the fusion of the egg and sperm cells, resulting in the formation of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilized products are surrounded by a maternally-derived seed coat, whose development is regulated by epigenetically by the Polycomb (Pc) protein family before fertilization. Research shows that fertilization triggers auxin production in the endosperm, which is likely exported to the maternal tissues, driving coat development and removing Pc function. Mutants of the MADS transcription factor AGL62 have impaired auxin transport from endperm to integuments, leading to seed abortion. AGL is proposed to regulate auxin transport from endperm to integuments, lifting the Pc block on coat development.

 Studies suggest auxin production in developing endperm is the trigger for coat development. To test this, plants were investigated for MADS transcription factor A62. ag62 seeds abort after fertilization around 3-4 days after pollination, correlating with endperm cellularization and failure to develop coat. A dual role for post-fertilization auxin is proposed, driving endperm and seed development. ag62 has defects in coat development in fertilized ovules and endperm in autonomous seeds, suggesting A62 and aux are involved in mediating endperm and coat pathways.

Multiple evidence supports this hypothesis: aux accumulates in integuments after fertilization, impaired biosynthesis but not signaling in endperm causes coat defects, ovules transgenic producing aux ectopically in central initiate coat without fertilization, and ag62 failure correlates with coat development. Seed initiation is generated in fertilized central/endperm. Coat development requires aux production in fertilized endperm and likely transport to ovule in A62-dependent manner. Fertilization results in aux production exported to integ, lifting P2 block on coat and allowing elongation differentiation. This is dependent on A62 activity, since ag62 fails to export aux from endperm, leading to accumulation and coat failure.
Researchers have mapped the functional landscape of the receptor domain of a bacteriophage T7, a virus that infects bacteria, to understand how it interacts with its host. The bacteriophage's receptor protein (RBP) plays a crucial role in governing its activity and host range, but the molecular rules of its function were unclear. To address this, scientists developed a high-throughput method, locus-specific phage engineering called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library) to create a large library of phage variants at a targeted gene. They comprehensively mutated the domain by making single amino acid substitutions at every site (166 variants) and quantified the functional role of each on multiple hosts.

The study revealed high-resolution maps of regions with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific patterns, many of which were previously unknown. They discovered T variants with greater virulence than the wild-type T7, showing even natural phages adapted to a host can be engineered for higher efficacy. This indicates ORACLE can generate ph variants superior to wild-type that could be starting points for therapeutic ph engineering. Experiments will assess the in vivo efficacy of T7 variants. Most phages are specialists targeting a narrow hosts but unable to infect closely related hosts, suggesting directionality in ph-bacterial interactions and orientational bias of the domain with respect to bacterial surface.
Individuals with congenital amusia, a lifelong condition characterized by unreliable pitch processing, rely on other dimensions such as duration during speech perception. Researchers investigated the neural basis of this strategy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 15 individuals with amus and 15 controls. Participants read sentences with indicated grammatical boundaries, then heard sentences differing in pitch and/or duration, and selected the best match for the written sentence. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amia group between left frontal language regions and right pitch-related areas, reflecting between-group differences in cue weights. These connectivity differences were not present during a control task.

The study found individuals with amia, who rely less on pitch than controls to process language, exhibited decreased connectivity between frontal and right pitch regions. In the task, participants matched sentences with visually presented based on pitch, duration, or both dimensions. The reliability of auditory dimensions in speech perception is linked to connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism.

Results are consistent with an account that right auditory areas are abnormally connected to frontal as during tonal tasks, but less integrated with left regions when processing speech and language. No differences in activation during processing are consistent with reports amics and controls not differing in pitch within sensory regions. Pitch representations within auditory cortex are similar in amia and controls. Brain encoding pitch in speech and musical stimuli unimpaired in individuals amia.

The study suggests amics neglect pitch because they learned their memory is unreliable, down-weighting pitch reflected in decreased connectivity between auditory and areas integrating information from percept regions.
Researchers have discovered a new type of cancer in Tasmanian devils called Devil Tum 2 (D2), which is contagious and spreads between individuals. This is different from Devilum 1 (D1), another contagious cancer in the same species, which does not express major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules. However, D2 cells do express MHC I, but the most common alleles are non-polymorphic and shared among devils, making them less recognizable to the immune system. In contrast to D1, which lost MHC I, D2 may be mimicking its evolutionary path. This suggests that contagious cancers can exploit partial histocompatibility between tumor and host, and loss of allogenic antigens can facilitate transmission of D2.

 Studies show that D2 cells can pass between individuals without immune response from host, and conditions for emergence of contagious cancers in this species are unknown. Unlike D1, D2 cells express M class I in vitro and in vivo, with non-polorphic non-class M I (SahaUK) reducing immunogenicity. Classical M I with highest expression in D2 is shared with devils. M I varies among D2 tumors, suggesting subclones could emerge as D transmits more. Results demonstrate D2 express M I, unlike D1 and contagious in dogs, CTV.

 Further analysis is needed to define immune response D2 and its role in tumor evolution. D1 cells in population are M I negative, but it's possible D1 regulated I after transmissible and initial events among shared M alleles. Similarity of I between D2 and devils may reflect shared range and genotype founder (Stnitz et al). Frequency among population may impact D2 spread. Heterogenic I in D biopsies suggests I not fixed and lost in D2.
Researchers have long known that the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) plays a crucial role in both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. A new study used optogenetic mapping in mice to reveal that parallel circuits in the superficial layer of RSG process different types of information. The thalamus and subiculum, sources of spatial information, selectively recruit low-rase (LR) pyramidal cells in R, while neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are controlled by clastral and cingulate inputs, sources of nonpatial information. This is due to precise subaminar and dendritic arbor within R layer 1, which allows parallel processing. Thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable LR neurons to compute speed of rotation, despite receiving direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed.

The study highlights a superficial retrosial circuit enabled by precise subamin organization of principal subtypes and axonal afferents. LR receive directional and spatial inputs from thalam and subulum. Synaptic dynamics of thamic inputs to cells give rise to rate coding of angular speed in LR cells. Determining how these parallel streams are integrated in downstream neurons is key to understanding retrosial computations. Thalam and subulum preferentially control LR, while clastr and culate control RS. Synaptic dynamics of thamic allow robust encoding of angular by LR models, though inputs only contain direction, not speed.

Layer 3 of R contains two types of pyramidal neurons: low-r (LR) and regular-sp (RS). LR integrate direction from thalam and spatial from hippocamp via subulum, making them suited to integrate direction and distance. This integration is key function of retrosial as whole.
Researchers have identified a potential link between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the development of tauopathies, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). They found that seizures play a key role in the spread of tau pathology after TBI. To study this, they created a zebraf model expressing a fluorescent biosensor that reports accumulation of human tau when seeded in the brain. Zebraf larvae subjected to a novel TBI paradigm showed features of T, including cell death, seizures, and tau inclusions. Inhibiting dynamin or anticonvulsant drugs rescued T-induced tauopathy and cell death. This suggests seizures contribute to prion seeding and spreading of tau following TBI. Further research is needed on anticonvulsants to dampen post-traumatic seizures as a way to moderate tauopathy.

 Zebraf larvae offer a complement to rodent models of T and cellular models of tauopathy. They allowed researchers to reveal postumatic seizures as a link between T and prion progression of tauopathy. A burst of neural activity occurs during T, and zraf exposed to T exhibit a higher propensity for seizures. A novel Tau biosensor model in zraf visualizes pathological spreading and accumulation within the CNS. Data show a strong correlation between postumatic seizures and tau pathology following T. Manipulating seizure activity mitigated Tau aggregation, revealing a role for endocyt in prion spread of seeds in vivo T. Results implicate seizures and endocyt in spread of Tau, offering potential targets.
Researchers investigated how the relationship between the spatial arrangement of brain regions and measures of brain connectivity. They found that the shape and location of brain regions strongly interact with measures of brain connectivity, and that the arrangement of regions is predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. This suggests that variations in the spatial configuration of brain regions may be interpreted as changes in connectivity. Understanding these effects is important when interpreting functional imaging data and cognitive traits.

The study focused on two aspects: interactions between neural populations (coupling) and spatial organisation of regions (topography). They aimed to identify how these aspects of MRI data influence measures connectivity and relate to trait variability in behavior and lifestyle across individuals. Misalignment of brain regions is a significant issue in studies, so it's essential to disambiguate the influence of topography to estimate measures that reflect strength between neural populations.

Functional MRI has been used to investigate large-scale brain networks over two decades. Spontaneous fluctuations in regions show correlations, revealing patterns of connectivity (Biswal et al, 199; Frist 1994,201). The study found that network matrices contain unique information not reflected in spatial organisation of regions. The conceptualisation of brain organisation is relevant to interpreting findings.

The implication is that cross-sub information in adopted 'connectivity' reflects variability in location of regions rather than coupling strength, at least methods map-level parations onto data.
Researchers investigated the role of TBP and TBP2 in the activation of MyoD genes in skeletal muscle cells. They found that TBP, not TBP2, is essential for muscle gene expression in differentiated muscles. TBP is expressed in myotubes from C2C12 myoblast and primary mouse MuSC, while T2 is not. TBP deficient mice have intact regeneration potential and MuSC from T deficient muscles differentiate into myubes as efficiently as wild type MuSC. The researchers compared RNA profiles of Tbp and Tbp2 genes in MuSC from wild type mouse and C2 myogenic cell line. Tbp was detected in Mu-derived myubes and C2 myubes. The study ruled out the possibility that T2 promotes muscle expression in MuSC, the effectors of postnatal and adult myogenesis. The TID complex may be present in myogenic cells and drive muscle transcription during mylast to myubes. The researchers detected T subunits of TID in C2 and Mu mylast myubes at RNA and protein levels. No defects in Muogenesis in absence T2 expression. Comparable Mu in muscles of WT and T2 mice 12 days after injury, indicating intact capacity Mu to proliferate, self-renew and differentiate during regeneration.
Researchers used a technique called optogenetics to stimulate the brains of non-human primates, specifically macaques, to study how it affects the excitability of neural circuits and neuroplasticity. They used a large-scale optogen interface to stimulate excitatory neurons and record electrocortic activity across the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M) cortex. The goal was to investigate the effects on large networks, which have been largely unexplored.

The study found that stimulation significantly strengthened the functional connectivity between S1 and M within minutes. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous changes across the network, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. This means that stimulation-evoked activity introduced new connections between neurons. The study extends Hebb plastic models to large circuits, with implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.

The researchers also investigated how stimulation impacts connectivity between and within areas. They tested whether stimulation-ev activity drives large network plasticity in a Hebb manner. The goal was to understand large-scale reorganization following stimulation, which will inform future neurorehab strategies. The study used a large optogen interface to stimulate populations of excit neurons while recording μ-ECo activity across S and M. They established two measures of functional connectivity that provide complementary views of plasticity.

Hebb rules have been used to explain synaptic plasticity, so the researchers wanted to see if large stimulation changes are consistent with Hebb plastic. The strongest test of Hebb is to compare correlations induced by stimulation with changes in network after conditioning. They could record artifact-free signals during stimulation to perform this test. Both appear to support a role for Hebb in sensorimotor plasticity, but a deeper understanding requires study of intermediate timeframes and cortical mapping.

The large interface enabled robust estimation of functional and stimulation-evoked correlations.
Researchers studied a rhesus macaque monkey born without primary visual cortex (V1) to understand how the brain compensates for damage to this area. The monkey's behavior was normal, but it struggled with visual tasks. MRI scans showed that areas outside the damaged V1 were intact and normal. When shown visual stimuli, the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvin were activated, but V5 was sparse and patchy. Functional analysis showed a network of dorsal areas, including V5/MT, correlated with V, even without V1. Despite strong subcortical responses, there was little evidence of strengthened subort input to V/MT for residual vision or blindsight.

The monkey's visual structures, both cortical and subort, outside the V1 lesion were intact with little atrophy, suggesting a role in residual function. An intact network of extrastate areas was comparable to controls. Connectivity between subort regions and V/MT was weak, but microstructure intact. Enlarged ventricles within the lesion may have affected anesthesia pattern. Figure 6 showed no V/MT activation to checkerboard or dots, so analysis was performed. Weakened tract between V/MT and subort nuclei indicated little strengthening of connections underlies residual vision. Residual vision can manifest in face information, as in patient TN (Bur et al, 2013), suggested surviving V1 loss. For motion, monkey showed V/ activation in dorsal STS, possibly subthreshold. Without strong V/ responses, a network of areas showed similar BOLD response to V/MT. Retinal information may reach dorsal areas via LG and pul, but lack activation due to anesthesia makes difficult. Lack of differences between S and controls in LG-V/ and pul-V/ suggests either could support residual abilities.
The innate immune system's ability to recognize foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA in the intracellular environment is crucial for defense against pathogens. However, the mechanism to distinguish between foreign and host DNA in the nucleus has been unclear. Researchers used biochemical and single-molecule techniques to study the innate sensor IF16 and found that it scans long stretches of exposed dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular platforms. Nucleosomes block IF16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with its one-dimensional movement. This unique scanning mechanism allows IF16 to distinguish and assemble on foreign DNA efficiently.

 IF16 is a key immune sensor that detects dsDNA and assembles signaling platforms in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It plays a role in defense against several pathogens, including herpes virus. Researchers observed a unifying mechanism explaining IF16's foreign-dsensing pathways. They found IF16 assembles faster on longer dsDNA and propose one-dimensional diffusion regulates its immune responses. Chromatin is thought to allow IF16 to distinguish host from DNA in the nucleus.

The study used time-resolved and single-molecule fluorescence to demonstrate IF16 scans dsDNA and assembles into clusters. Chromatin inhibits IF16 from targeting hostDNA assembly. In vivo, one-dimensional scanning allows limited IF16 to assemble on large pathogens. IF16 is composed of three domains with unstructured linkers, one pyrin and two DNA-binding domains. Researchers propose one-dimensional assembly regulates IF16 immune responses.
Researchers have developed a new technique called spatially targeted microproteomics (ST) to study the composition of tiny deposits in the brain associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. This method, called STOMP, doesn't require genetic manipulation of the tissue and can be used on formalin or methanol-fixed specimens. It involves staining the area of interest with fluorescent dyes or antibodies, soaking in a solution containing a photo-tag, and then using confocal imaging with two-photon excitation to couple the tag to proteins. The tagged proteins are then isolated and identified by mass spectrometry.

In a test, ST was used to examine amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and a post-mortem case, confirming known constituents and discovering new ones. The technique can be applied to various samples, including cell lines, primary cultures, ex vivo, biopsy, and post-mort tissue. Gel electrophoresis of the indiscrimately tagged proteins showed a different pattern compared to when amyloid plaques were specifically targeted. The amount of tissue needed for analysis depends on sensitivity, fixation method, sample complexity, and other factors.

ST combines two-photon laser microscopy with photochemical labeling and mass spectrometry. Two-ph excitation has been used for microscopic 3D-resolved photochemistry. The predominant protein tagged in ST is Aβ, not visible in non-plaque due to low abundance. The photo-tag procedure uses two-ph microscopy, not conventional confocal. ST is the first application of this to affinity labeling, offering single-mic three-dimensional resolution better than current LCM. This technique provides clues to neurode disease etiology and advances research in biology by yielding small features not amenable purification.

ST uses microscope light to image and photochemically crosslink affinity ligands to pathological components. The photo-affinity or photo used is a peptide: benzylbenyl-G-His-His-His-His-His-HisCON2. Benzylbenyl forms coval bonds with C and N upon excitation.
Researchers have studied the role of Frizzled3 (F3) in the development of axons in cranial and spinal motor neurons. They found that disrupting the F3 gene leads to defects in axon growth in the seventh and twelfth cranial nerves, the phrenic nerve, and the motor nerves in the fore and hindlimbs. In mice without F3, axons stall at a specific location in the plexus and do not reroute to other trajectories. Motor neurons with stalled axons die two days before the normal developmental cell death, which coincides with muscle innervation in vivo. This suggests that neurons with long axons are programmed to die if they do not arrive at targets on schedule.

In the limb, F3 absence leads to stalling of axons that is different from other ax guidance mutants. Motor neurons die after axons stall, providing evidence that axons receive survival signals from targets. The researchers asked if the cause of ax deficiency in F mice is defective neuron differentiation, excessive death, or growth/guidance. Most F3 axons do not follow erroneous trajectories, so pathfinding is unlikely. Ax growth is active and independent of target at 5.5. A model suggests survival factors from targets along axon trajectory, as in vitro experiments with spinal cord and floor tissue. A wave of neuron death is observed in F controls. In F mice, a subset exhibits ax growth and death at 11-12.5. Controlling growth may be F function in motor neurons.
Researchers studied the role of transposable elements (TEs) in regulating gene expression in mouse embryonic and trophlast stem cells. Transposable elements are DNA sequences that can jump from one location to another in the genome, and are thought to have helped establish gene networks in the early embryo. However, it was unclear if they play a significant role in gene regulation. The study tested a set of long repeat families as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophlast stem cells. Epigen and transcript data showed that many TEs helped establish tissue-specific gene programs. Editing individual TEs confirmed a subset of these relationships. But a wider survey of CRISPR interference of RL13 elements in embryonic cells revealed only a minority play significant roles in regulation. Results suggest a subset T are important for gene in early development and highlight the importance of functional experiments evaluating regulatory T roles.

The study found that other T play minor or no role in regulation, despite strong evidence at chromatin composition and conformation. To test regulatory roles of multiple enhancers in ESCs, researchers performed CRIS interference at RL13 elements. Data aligned with chrom accessibility suggest T may support specific expression of subset genes in development. However, correlations may emerge without causal links T and expression. To test functional role of enhancers in regulation, researchers performed CR-mediated excision of T. To validate small effect of enhancers on expression, genetic experiments were performed. Two RL13 elements displayed 2-fold H3ac levels but little effect neighboring expression.

Researchers tested regulatory of specific families in ESCs and TSC using genetic and epetic approaches and compared with predictions analyses epomic and transcript data. Identified T that drive expression lineage genes. Further work necessary to evaluate proportion act redundant with other elements.
Scientists have studied how a complex trait called C4 photosynthesis evolved in plants, which allows them to make food from sunlight more efficiently. This trait appeared in at least 60 different plant lineages, but how it evolved is unclear. Researchers analyzed 18 lineages with C3, C, and intermediate C-C forms of photosynthesis and created a 16-dimensional map of their characteristics. They developed a new method to predict how C4 photosynthesis evolved using a hidden Markov model and experimentally verified it. The results show that C4 photosynthesis evolved in different ways in different lineages and was driven by non-photosynthetic factors, not just photosynthesis. This flexibility allowed the trait to evolve multiple times in different lineages.

The researchers created a new method to predict evolutionary paths from limited data and used it to study C photosynthesis, one of the most complex traits to evolve. C photosynthesis can't be fully studied experimentally, so it's a good for modeling complex trait evolution on a landscape. The different types of C photosynthesis evolved due to different histories in response to non-photosynthetic pressures. Early events determined the downstream traits of C types by restricting lineages to paths in space.

The study suggests that diversity in mechanisms generating C photos may help it evolve in different lineages. This could aid in engineering C photosynthesis in other species, expanding the tools to create C traits in different backgrounds. Early traits acquired in C photosynthesis were predicted, consistent with previous studies. Including these traits in analysis didn't change the order of original traits, showing the results are robust.

The study shows that C photosynthesis evolved in different ways and was driven by non-photosynthetic factors, not just photosynthesis. This flexibility allowed it to evolve in multiple lineages. The new method can predict evolutionary paths from limited data and was used to study photosynthesis, a complex trait.
Researchers studied a bacterial protein called SpoIVA, which breaks down ATP to form polymers during a process called sporulation. SpoIVA is thought to have evolved from a GTPase enzyme, but the reason for this change is unclear. To understand this, they modified the protein to mimic its ancestral GTP activity and found that it worked as a Gase but couldn't form a necessary intermediate for polymerization. Adding ATP didn't help, showing that the nucleotide base, not just energy, is important for function. They also found that during sporulation, ATP levels are higher than GTP, which may have driven the change in SpoIVA's preference. 

SpoIVAGase, a version of SpoIVA, worked in cells and could use either ATP or GTP to change shape after breaking down, but only polymerized with ATP. This suggests the nucleotide base, not just energy, is needed for its function. At the start of sporulation, SpoIVA assembles the spore coat, which may have driven the switch from GTP to ATP. Physiological levels of ATP, not GTP, caused Spo and SpoAGase to change shape. Both Spo and SpoAG failed to change shape with low GTP but did with high ATP. However, with different ATP levels, neither Spo nor SpoAG polymerized at low but did at high.
A study investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life. Leptin is a hormone that regulates energy balance and has neurotrophic effects during development. However, its role in development is not fully understood. Researchers restored leptin signaling in mice that lacked the leptin receptor gene at 4 or 10 weeks of age. They found that some defects caused by early leptin deficiency, such as poor neural development, were recovered by reactivating leptin in adulthood. However, early leptin deficiency led to irreversible obesity by suppressing energy expenditure. Reactivating leptin in adulthood also reduced hypothalamic gene expression and caused reproductive and growth problems. The study revealed that early leptin defects cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems.

Lept signaling during development may affect neural circuits that regulate energy homeostasis, leading to metabolic diseases later in life. Lept may be involved in developmental programming. Early lept blockage in rats leads to long-term lept resistance and diet-induced obesity. The importance of lept signaling during development for long energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by lept is not fully understood. To uncover its role, researchers studied mice without lept effects. Lept or Lep deficiency reduces brain mass, disrupts projections from neurons to the hypothalamus, and causes behavioral problems. They evaluated consequences of lept absence in life on brain development. Lept affects developmental processes, especially in brain. Rodents have a postnatal lept surge associated with changes in mass or intake. Findings contribute to understanding metabolic programming of metabolic, neuroocrine, and developmental consequences from lept absence in life, especially in context of childhood obesity.
Arabidopsis plants have a complex system to defend against bacterial infections, which involves a receptor called FLS that recognizes a bacterial flagellin epitope called flg22. This receptor works with a kinase called B1 to activate defenses. A group of proteins called heterotrimer G, composed of XL2, A1, and G1/2, are required for FLS-mediated responses, but their mechanism was unknown. Researchers found that XL2 directly interacts with FLS and B1 before fl22 activation, and works with A1 and G1/2 to prevent degradation of B1, allowing optimal activation. After fl22 stimulation, XL2 dissociates from A1 and is phosphorylated by B1, enhancing reactive oxygen species production. The study shows that G proteins are directly coupled to F2 receptor and regulate signaling through pre- and post-activation mechanisms.

The proteins XL, A1, and G/2 modulate fl22-triggered immunity by coupling to F2-B1 receptor. Before fl22, they prevent degradation of B1, ensuring signaling competence. After fl22, XL2 dissociates from A, indicating ligand-induced dissociation of G from G. Introducing a B1 copy restored fl22 responses and resistance in XL and A mutants, showing G's major function is to maintain F2-B1 competence. Additionally, fl22 induces XL2 phosphorylation in the terminus. Results show G interact with F2-B1 during F2 signaling and are consistent with defects in fl22 responses and RboD phosphorylation in G mutants.
Researchers have studied the internal biological clock of the plant Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant, to understand how it regulates its daily activities over a 24-hour cycle. They found that individual cells within the plant have their own internal clocks, but these clocks are not perfectly synchronized with each other. The team observed two waves of gene expression, or activity, moving up and down the root of the plant. They also found that cells near the tip of the root communicate with each other more strongly than other parts of the plant. A simple model suggests that these interactions and differences in clock speed between cells can create the observed patterns of gene expression. The study reveals the plant's internal clock is more complex than previously thought, with multiple points of coordination rather than a single central one. 

The researchers used a reporter gene to track the clock's activity in individual cells across the plant over several days. They estimated the strength of communication between cells and found it's stronger near the root tip. A model showed that differences in clock speed and cell-to-cell interaction can generate the observed waves of gene expression. However, this model doesn't fully explain short oscillations in the root or wave of gene expression from the root. The study supports a decentralized model of plant clock coordination, unlike the centralized one in mammals. Previous research on Arabidopsis found cells' oscillations are uncoupled or focused on specific parts of the plant for short periods. This study examines the whole plant at single-cell level over days.
Researchers studied how the brain processes speech in noisy environments where multiple speakers are talking at the same time. Normally, the brain separates the intended speech from background noise using a combination of fast processing and attention mechanisms. However, about 10% of adults with normal hearing visit clinics because they struggle with communication, despite normal hearing tests. The study found that speech understanding multiple speakers varied widely in normal adults, but could be predicted by brain's response to frequency modulation (FM) cues measured in ear recordings. Combining fast processing, listening effort, and FM accounted for 78% of variability in speech understanding. The study identified bottom-up and top-down markers of poor speech perception could inform new clinical tests for hearing disorders.

The researchers used behavioral and physiological tests to identify neural markers of poor speech in adults with normal hearing. New measures are needed for those who struggle in noisy environments and avoid seeking care. A battery of tests accounted for nearly 80% of variability in speech understanding without linguistic cues. Individuals with clinically normal hearing showed variability in measures, but none related to speech thresholds. Those with steeper pupil functions had difficulty in speech, a correlation between pupil change and threshold. The study aimed to develop objective markers for complaints of poor communication with normal hearing. Data suggest association between FM detection and speech-noise can be attributed to early processing. The correlation between low FM and intelligibility might reflect fast processing and speech.
Researchers have developed a new imaging technique to visualize and measure the flow of individual blood cells in the smallest to largest blood vessels of the retina, a part of the central nervous system, in living mice. The retina is relatively transparent, but imperfections in the eye's optics make it difficult to see the tiny blood vessels and cells inside. This limits the ability to study and diagnose diseases that start in these small blood vessels. To overcome this, the researchers used a high-speed imaging technology called adaptive optics to non-invasively measure single-cell flow in the C57/BL6 mouse, a widely used research animal model. They measured flow rates four orders of magnitude, from 0.0001 to 0.55 microliters per minute, across a range of vessel diameters from 3.2 to 45.8 micrometers, without surgery or contrast agents.

The study achieved this by combining adaptive optics with an ultra-fast camera to image blood cells without foreign agents. Pairing this with an automated analysis, they measured hundreds of thousands of cells per second. This approach can be applied to clinical studies using the same instrumentation. The researchers also developed strategies and algorithms to image single cells non-invas in the smallest to largest vessels of the retinal circulation, diameters 3.2 to 45.8 micrometers, without contrast agents. They showed that label-free adaptive optics improved contrast of blood cells in the retina compared to dye techniques, especially in high flow conditions. This method may serve as a window to understand microcirculation in the central nervous system and systemic health.
Researchers have identified a key player in the decision-making process between two types of symbiotic relationships between plants and microorganisms: arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing nodule symbiosis. They found that a receptor-like kinase called Symbiosis Receptor Kin (SYK) is crucial for both types of symbiosis, but how it distinguishes between them has been unclear. The study shows that ectopic expression of three receptor-like genes, Nod Factor Receptor 1 (N1), N5, and SYK, triggers spontaneous nodule formation and nodule-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Overexpression of N1 or N5 with endogenous SYK in the legume Lotus japonicus revealed that SYK initiates signaling independently of N1 or N5 and a set of genes required for calcium-spiking in both symbiosis. SYK but not N overexpression triggered AM-related genes, indicating SYK plays a key role in deciding between AM or nodule symbiosis development.

In experiments, researchers overexpressed N, N, or the unrelated EF receptor kinase EFR in Lotus japonicus. EFR did not interfere with nodulation in wild-type plants. Endogenous SYK was co-enriched with N and N, but not E, showing SY and N association. SYK-mediated specificity may be due to complex formation with N and N and Lys-kinases that recognize signals from the fungus, resulting in release of negative mechanisms or unbalanced stoichiometry of SY and regulators of AM and nodule symbiosis. A subset of genes required for both AM and nodule symbiosis encodes the RL Symbiosis Receptor Kin (SYK). Under conditions, SYK-N was detected in absence of nod factor. Ligand-induced receptor dimerization is critical in signal initiation. The discovery that expression of three RL constructs from the Ubiquitin promoter leads to spontaneous nodule formation in transgenic L.
Researchers have developed a new software called DeepKit, a toolkit for quickly and accurately estimating the position of an animal's body parts from images or videos. This is important for various scientific fields, including neuroscience and ecology, where precise measurements are needed to answer questions. Current methods have limitations in speed and reliability. DeepKit addresses these issues with an efficient deep-learning model called StackedNet and a fast peak-detection algorithm. This improves speed by 2 times with no loss in accuracy compared to existing methods. The toolkit is demonstrated with challenging tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of animals interacting. It reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across sciences.

DeepKit is built on state-of-the-art individual estimation using convolutional neural networks for fast inference without losing accuracy or generalization. The new model, StackedNet, offers improvements over existing models. Code, documentation, and examples are available at https://github.com/graving/deepose under an open-source license. The goal is fast estimation while maintaining predictive power of models like DeepLab. Together, these advances could lead to higher-resolution, reliable datasets revolutionizing understanding behavior, brain, and environment relationships. DeepKit automatically measures posture from images, achieving fast using CNNs relies on GPU processing large batches or downsampling, increasing error. Stacked model runs at 30-110 Hz, depending on resolution. In contrast, computer vision methods, deep-learning can achieve human accuracy by annotating data and training a CNN to estimate body parts directly from images.
When immune cells, such as macrophages, are exposed to stress or infection, they trigger the formation of protein complexes called inflamomes that initiate inflammatory responses and a type of cell death called pyroptosis. Researchers have identified a trigger for NLR3-mediated signaling, IL-1 production, and pyptosis in murine bone-derived macrophages that is caused by disruption of glycolytic flux. This results from a drop in NAD levels and increase in mitochondrial ROS production, which can be rescued by adding products that restore NAD production. This signaling is also important for the host response to intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhim, which disrupts host glucose metabolism.

Typhim infection impairs NAD production, leading to mitochondrial ROS that activate NLR3 inflamome. Disruption of glycol flux is a relevant trigger for NLR3 inflamome activation, mediated by redox changes, linking metabolism to inflammation initiation. Immune cells sense metabolite production and flux through glycol, activating N3 to initiate responses. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and tyim limit glycol through distinct mechanisms, resulting in N3-mediated inflamome and pyptosis.

NAD consumption increases upon pyruate treatment, indicating productive metabolism downstream glycol in infected BMDs. Data indicate glycol perturbation is a mechanism for immune cells to sense homeostasis during tyim infection and induce pro-inflammatory via N3 inflamome and pypt death. Functionally, immune cells sense metabolic perturbation as danger, resulting inflamome, caspase activation, and cytokine secretion. Results using inhibitors suggest disrupting flux serves as trigger for inflammation and death in macroages. Disturbance flux by intracellular pathogen S.
Researchers have discovered a new function of the PALB2 protein, a tumor suppressor linked to various cancers, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. PAL2 binds to DNA and plays a crucial role in homologous-directed repair (HDR) and interacts with chromatin proteins. A specific DNA-binding site of PAL2 was identified, which reduces RAD51 formation and HDR efficiency by 50% in cells. PAL2's N-terminal DNA-binding domain (NDB) stimulates RAD51 recombinase and surprisingly, possesses strand exchange activity without RAD51. Moreover, NDB stimulates inverse exchange and uses RNA substrates.

 PAL2 is a scaffold protein that links BRCA1 and BR2 during HDR and interacts with many chromatin proteins. However, a truncation with preserved BR1 and BR2 binding but without DB does not support BR2 and RAD recruitment to DSBs. Mutations of four amino acids reduce RAD51 formation and HDR efficiency in a cell system. PAL2-DB itself stimulates RAD strand reactions. PAL2DB supports forward and inverse exchange in absence RAD51 and uses RNA as substrate. Data reveal novel PAL2 activity and importance of PAL2 binding in chromosome maintenance.

 PAL2 interaction with DNA is critical for BR2 and RAD recruitment to DSB and efficient repair in cells. PAL2 complemented with PAL-AAAA display defect in HR at 8hr post-IR. Mutant fails to repair subset DSB due to defective binding. PAL interaction with DNA is essential for BR2 and RAD51 to D sites and DNA repair in cells. PAL2DB stimulates RAD-mediated exchange in vitro.
Researchers have discovered that a bacterial protein called Mre, found in the bacterium Caulobacter cresus, forms filaments in a unique way that is different from all other known actin proteins. Unlike other actin filaments, which are made of pairs of protofilaments arranged in parallel, Mre forms pairs of protoaments in an antiparallel fashion. This means that the two protoaments are lined up in opposite directions, rather than side by side. The researchers used crystallography and electron microscopy to study the structure of Mre filaments and found that the antipar arrangement allows each subunit to interact with the membrane and membrane components of the cell. This is important for the protein's function in cell shape maintenance.

The researchers also found that the antipar arrangement of protoaments explains the assembly and disassembly of filaments at both ends. They used crystallography to study how M forms filaments and found that the process is similar to other actin proteins, with a typical domain closure upon polymerization. Additionally, they studied how the protein interacts with antimicrobial agents and found that they bind to the nucleotide, preventing hydrolysis and destabilizing the filaments.

The antipar arrangement of protoaments is unprecedented in the actin family, which includes both eukaryotic and proary proteins. It ensures the amphipathic helix of each protoament can bind to the membrane and both protoaments can interact with bitopic proteins. Deleting the amphathic helix or mutating residues in the hydroobic loop made the protein less prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of M revealed the typical act fold with two domains on either side of the nucleotide cleft, separated into subdomains A and B.
Researchers studied the difference in petal number between two plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta. Arabidopsis thalian has a consistent number of four petals, while Cardamine hirs has variable petal number. They found that a gene called APETALA1 (AP1) is responsible for this difference. AP1 is a regulator of flower development and affects petal number. In Arabidopsis, AP1 masks the effect of other genes that control petal number, making it consistent. In Cardamine, AP1 fails to do this, resulting in variable pet number. The researchers also found that changes in AP1 regulatory regions contribute to this difference. Despite genetic variation in Cardamine, most plants have four-pet flowers. They showed that AP1 is important in Arabid flower development, initiating and specifying organs. They identified AP as a major gene in the transition from consistent to variable petal number. However, AP polymorphisms do not contribute to within-species variation in Cardamine petal. Instead, the uniformity of Arabid petal reflects robustness to genetic variation. They changed Arabid petal to variable by complementing AP mutants with Card AP genomic locus. Flowers mimicked Cardamine pet number, suggesting hidden variability in regulatory network controlling petal in Arabid.
Researchers have found that misfolding of proinsulin, a precursor to insulin, is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes. Insulin synthesis begins with the folding of proinsulin, including the formation of three conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. In normal pancreatic islets, a subset of proins molecules have at least one free cysteine. However, in islets with perturbed endoplasmic reticulum environment, non proins enters intermolecular disulf-linked complexes. In obese mice with wild-type islets, disulf-linked proins are more abundant, and in leptin-deficient mice, such complexes increase with onset of islet deficiency and diabetes. Proins-Cys 19 and Cys20 are necessary and sufficient for proins disulf-linked complexes; pro-Cys 19-Cys19 coval homimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting basis for aberrant proins formation. Increased proins misolding via disulf complexes is early associated with prediabetes and wors β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.

 Studies show that proins misolding includes inability to complete internal disulf bonds, a fraction of proins in ER bearing unpaired cystine. This improperly folded pro enters aberrant disulf partnerships with pro in ER, misfold pro complexes first identified in human islets. In leptin-deficient mice, hyperphagic, glucose intolerant animals, islets demonstrated increased disulf proins complexes with 90 of pro in such. Rodent islets also show aberrant disulf proins complexes in β-cells. Human islets and models with altered ER environment and T2 progression prior β-cell dedifferentiation or death.

In prediabetic Lepdb mice, islet lysates contain large pro with 90 molecules in disulf-linked dimers and higher complexes. In young normoglycemic Lepdb mice destined for diabetes, proins disulf complexes increased and insulin levels.
Researchers studied the role of Suvh39, a protein that adds methyl groups to histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9), in forming heterochromatin. Heterochrom is a type of chromatin that keeps genes silent. Suv39 recognizes and methylated H3K9 (H3me3) through its chromodomain (CD). However, how it targets chrom without pre-existing H3me3 is not well understood. The study found that Suvh-CD binds nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, and this is important for its function in heterochatin assembly. Suv-CD has higher affinity for RNA than DNA and binds nucleic independently of H3me recognition. Suv bound major satellite RNAs in vivo and knocking down major RN lowered Suv retention on pericentrom. Mutational studies showed that nucleic-binding and Hme-binding of S-CD were crucial for perentric heterochatin assembly. These results suggest chrom-bound RN contribute to Suvh's specificity.

Suv-CD's nucleic-binding integrates with Hme recognition to establish and maintain perentric heterochatin, such as Hme formation, HP accumulation, and repressive status. Suv bound major RNA in vivo dependent on nucleic activity and knocking down major RN lowered S retention on perentric. Data suggest chrom-bound RN contribute to targeting and retention of S at specific regions. In addition to Hme,uv-CD's RNA activity contributes touv's association with Hme-rich per regions. Knocking major transcripts further supports thatuv's RNA binding contributes to stability on. Intriguingly,uv-YA interacted partially with major RN, not fitting model thatuv-CD's RNA and Hme activities cooperatively function inuv's targeting. However,uv-YA loosely bound chrom. This suggestsuv-Y interact RN without stable binding chrom.

uv's N-terminal region contributeduv's HP and chrom-binding activities touv-mediated per Hme formation. Collectively,uv's different activities other than lysine transferase cooperatively regulateuv-mediated perentricochatin.
Researchers have found that cells in the entorhinal cortex, a region of the brain involved in navigation and spatial awareness, can be activated by attention without physical movement. In an experiment, monkeys were trained to focus on a small dot moving on a screen while keeping their eyes still. Among 141 neurons recorded, 20% had spatially structured fields, similar to those found in grid cells that help with navigation. This contrasts with the hippocampus, where similar representations were not observed. The study suggests that entorinal cells do not rely on physical movement to function. 

The researchers tested the hypothesis that grid cells in the entorinal cortex are involved in cognitive processes beyond navigation, such as attention. They recorded neurons in monkeys performing a task that required focusing on a moving dot without moving their eyes. The monkeys performed the task with high accuracy, with most errors due to eye movements outside the target. To examine spatial representations in entorinal cells, the standard measure of gridness was used. The results provide evidence that entor cells can be activated by attention without physical movement, contradicting previous findings that grid cells can be activated by eye movements while exploring scenes.
Researchers have developed a standardized task to measure decision-making in mice that produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. The task, called perceptual value-based decision-making, was tested in 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries. The mice learned the task at different rates, but after training, their behavior was comparable across laboratories. The mice relied on visual stimuli, past successes, and failures, and estimates of prior probability to guide their choices. This shows that complex behavior can be reproduced across laboratories, establishing a standard for rodent behavior and providing an open dataset to study decision-making in mice. The study suggests a path to achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through open-science approaches.

The researchers implemented identical equipment and protocols to study mouse behavior across laboratories. Mice learned the task in all laboratories and performed comparably after learning. They adopted a comparable reliance on visual stimuli, past, successes, and estimates of prior probability. To facilitate reproducibility, the team adopted an open science approach, sharing hardware, software, and protocols. Data and techniques should be made available to the community (Bdo et al, 2019; Charles et al). The study presents a large cohort of mice trained in the task, demonstrating reproducible methods and results across laboratories. Most mice learned the task, although at different rates, and performed comparably after, with no differences.

Physiological studies of decision are carried out in mice to access genetic, imaging, and physiological tools for brains (Carini and Church, 201; Glick et al,2014; O'Connor et,2009). The collaboration aims to explore the neural basis of behavior in multiple laboratories. Results can be compared, knowing differences are unlikely due to behavior. The resources will catalyze new adaptations and variations, accelerating high-quality studies of neural correlates of decision.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the genes and cell types in the intestine of a planarian flatworm, Schmidtea mediterrane, which can regenerate its organs, including the gut. They used a technique called laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA sequencing to identify hundreds of genes that were not previously unknown to be expressed in the intestine. The study found that the planarian's digestive system is similar to that of other animals, including humans, including genes involved in metabolism, nutrient transport, and immunity. They also discovered that certain genes are specific to goblet cells, a type of cell in the intestine, and found that these cells are crucial for the worm's ability to eat and survive.

The researchers identified 22 genes that are specific to the intestine, including some that help create or maintain goblet cells, setting the stage for further study of this cell type. The planarian's intestinal map is a resource for investigating various aspects of regeneration and gut function. They found that two genes, gli-1 and RE2, play distinct roles in goblet cell differentiation and maintenance, and that removing goblet cells affects the worm's ability to eat and survive, but not its ability to regenerate other cells or tissues.

The researchers developed a method to use laser-capture microsection on planarian tissue to define gene and cell types in the intestine. They found the intestine expresses genes involved in metabolism, storage, transport, immunity, and other functions, showing similarity with digestive systems of other animals, including humans. A detailed description of intestinal cell types will aid further study of digestive cells. The study found two transcription factors, gli-1 and RE2, whose RNA phenotypes suggest distinct mechanisms govern goblet cell differentiation and maintenance.
Scientists have discovered a new way that some weakly electric fish perceive their environment. These fish, called mormyrids, can detect subtle changes in electric signals sent by other fish. They do this by using two types of receptors: spiking and oscillating. Spiking receptors respond to individual fish signals, while oscillating receptors respond to signals from groups of fish. When oscillating receptors receive a signal, they reset their timing, creating synchrony among the receptors. This synchrony encodes the timing and location of the signal, not the signal's waveform. This is different from how spiking receptors, which can't detect the signal's waveform.

The researchers found that oscillating receptors are sensitive to specific frequencies found in signals from groups of conspecifics, or fish of the same species. This is linked to increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. This suggests that different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies. The team hypothesizes that these divergent mechanisms are adaptations for different social environments.

The study describes a novel mechanism of sensory coding where receptors with oscillatory activity respond to stimuli with phase resets, resulting in synchrony across the population. The degree of synchrony provides information about timing and polarity, but not waveform. This is consistent with the inability of fish to behaviorally detect EOD waveform variation. The researchers investigated how divergence in perception relates to differences in sensory coding. Mormrid fish communicate by producing a species-specific electric discharge (EOD) at variable interpulse (I) intervals.

Oscillating receptors are tuned to lower frequencies than peak frequencies of conspecific EOD. These oscillations confer sensitivity to IPs that can only be produced by groups. Spiking receptors detect signals from individuals, while oscillating detect signals from groups. Playback experiments showed a species with oscillating responded strongly to subsecond IPs within receptor sensitivity range. This mechanism may be an adaptation for detecting signals from groups. Oscillatory activity is widespread in neural networks.

Behavioral experiments presented a fish with a train of conspecific E at constant IPs. Species with oscillating showed selective responses to subsecond IPs, while spiking did not. This supports the hypothesis that oscillating facilitate detection of signals from groups.
Researchers have determined the three-dimensional structure of the bacteriophage BPP-1 at 3.5 Å resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. BPP-1 infects and kills Bordetella species, which cause whooping cough in humans and respiratory diseases in mammals. The virus has a T=7 icosahedral capsid with a diameter of approximately 670 Å. The structure reveals two major protein folds: jellyroll for the capsid protein (CP) and HK-like for the major capsid protein (MCP). Notably, the topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted from the Johnson fold previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. The new topology is likely the only feasible alternative to the old. Beta-sheet and electrostatic interactions contribute to the non-covalent chain in BPP, unlike coval interprotein linkages in HK97. The termini of both CP and MCP are positioned for DGR-based phage engineering.

The atomic description of BPP head will enhance bioengineering efforts, non-coval molecular interactions of bacteri caps formation and clarify relationships B- MCP and CP with other viruses. The study reports 3D structure of BPP at 3.5 resolution by single-p cryoEM and atomic model. BPP CP and MCP adopt two major folds: jelly and HK/Johnson. The Johnson fold in B MCP is non-circular permuted compared to known topology. The fold has been observed in Siphiridae and Myiridae families, exemplified by gp of HK97. The BPP and HK topologies represent only feasible of Johnson fold. All known structures with Johnson adopt HK topology, including gp of HK in Siphiridae.

BPP is a short-tailed ds virus and member of Podiridae. It infects and kills Bordella that cause whooping in humans and mammals. A 7 resolution cryEM showed caps has HK-like but an additional component.
Researchers studied how the deng virus (DENV) adapts to different environments by growing it in human and mosquito cells. They used a technique called ultra-deep sequencing to measure the effects of single nucleotide changes in the virus population. This allowed them to see how beneficial and harmful mutations contribute to the virus's fitness. The study found that a large number of harmful mutations balance out the effect of rare beneficial mutations that help the virus adapt to its host. Beneficial mutations are more likely to be in parts of the virus that don't have a fixed structure and are in certain areas of the genome. These mutations may help the virus adapt to specific hosts. The study's findings are similar to what is seen in other deng and Zika viruses, showing common constraints that shape long-term evolution.

The researchers looked at the cost of harmful mutations across the deng genome and how negative selection shapes diversity in virus populations. They want to know how specific and structural features contribute to patterns and overall fitness. They used a technique to recapitulate and identify shifts in the virus to understand mechanisms of selection and adaptation in cells and populations. Clusters of mutations in specific areas of the deng suggest elements are targeted by selection in each host. The study found adaptation relies on beneficial mutations in specific areas of the genome and enriched in flexible regions of the proteome.

The researchers used CirSeq to track the fitness of DENV in human and mosquito cells by tracing individual trajectories of all possible nucleotide variants. This shows the influence of positive and negative selection on the virus's evolutionary paths. Many beneficial mutations were at specific locations in the genome, suggesting adaptation relies on hotspots of host selection. They mapped fitness on the three-dimensional structure of deng protein, a well-studied transmembrane protein, to analyze these hotspots.
Researchers used a technique called single-particle tracking microscopy to study how a protein called KRas12 moves on the surface of cells. KR12 is a version of a protein called Ras, which is involved in sending signals inside cells. The study found that KR12 moves in three different ways on the cell surface. It stays still in some areas, moves slowly in others, and quickly in the rest. The areas where KR12 stays still are about 70 nanometers across, and the areas where it moves slowly are 200 nanometers. The rest of the surface lets KR12 move quickly. KR12 is also removed from the surface and put back on, like it's being recycled. This process happens even when there's a lot or little KR12 on the surface. The study shows how the surface areas on the cell dictate how KR12 moves and sends signals. This helps understand how signals are formed and sent inside cells.
Researchers have long sought to understand how Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling patterns the dorsal-ventral axis in embryos of vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevailing view in vertebrates is that BMP gradient formation occurs through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists and ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. However, a new study in zebraf fish reveals a different mechanism. By precisely quantifying BMP activity in wild-type and mutant embryos and combining data with a mathematical model, the researchers tested hypotheses for gradient formation. Their analysis ruled out shuttling and transcription-formed mechanisms, instead supporting a source-sink model where a restricted antagonist acts as a sink to drive BMP dorsally and form the gradient.

The study used a robust imaging method to measure BMP signaling in zraf embryos, integrating results with a modeling approach to inform model selection. The model provided key parameters to identify the mechanism forming the BMP gradient. Contrary to the hypothesis that BMP gradient reflects BMP expression, results showed otherwise. Quantification and modeling presented a new view of how antagonists and ligand establish BMP patterning the DV axis in zraf.

BMPs act as morphogens in development, including patterning the embryonic axis, neural tube, and Drosila wing. Their systems are established by extracellular regulators. In vertebrates, the mechanism shaping BMP ligand antagon is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include an inverse antagon gradient, shuttling ligand, and others. This study in zraf supports a source-sink mechanism, where a restricted antagonist drives BMP dorsally and forms the gradient. Bmp2 diffusion supports this model, suggesting a new mechanism shaping BMP gradients during development.
Researchers have identified a protein called MF1, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, which plays a crucial role in the breakdown and recycling of cellular waste in lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells where proteins and other cellular waste are broken down and recycled. MF1 is not previously uncharacterized and its function was unknown. The study found that MF1 is not glycosylated, meaning it does not have a sugar molecule attached to it, and has a specific sequence of amino acids that helps it be transported to lysosomes. Mice without MF1 developed severe liver disease and spleen problems. Analysis of lysosomes from these mice revealed a protein called GL as essential for MF1 function. GL and MF1 physically interact and are necessary for each other's presence in lysosomes. Mice without GL developed similar problems to those without MF1. The study shows that MF1 and GL form a complex on the lysosomal membrane.
Researchers have gained insight into the process of how kines motors, powered by ATP hydrolysis, transport microtubules in eukaryotes by developing atomic models of nucleotide and ATP states of the moneric kines motor domain microtule from cry-EM reconstructions at 5-Å resolution. By comparing these models with X-ray structures of AD-bound kines, they inferred a mechanistic scheme where microtule attachment, mediated by a conserved 'chpin' residue kines (N255), triggers clam opening of the nucleotide cleft and release of AD. Binding of ATP closes the cleft in a manner tightly coupled to translocation of cargo via kines' neck element. These transitions are reminiscent of analogous nucle-exchange steps in myosin and F-ATase motors and inform how two heads of kines dimer gate each other to promote stepping microtules.

This mechanism allows microtules to regulate kines' affinities for AD and ATP by modulating conformation of switch, providing a structural basis for kines' nucleotide behavior on microtules. Several sites in kines have been identified that uncouple motor's nucleotide from microt affinity, but basis of uncoupling remained unclear. To clarify kines' microtule cycle, researchers solved high-resolution cryoEM reconstructions of human moneric kines motor (K349) attached to microt in different states, representing before and after binding nucleotide in presence AD-aluminum. Nucleotide and ATP models of kines-microt complex are depicted, as well as X-ray structures of AD-bound kines construct. Cryo analysis of AD and ATP-bound states N255 mutant support hypothesis, revealing previously unidentified modes kines attaching to microt but rotationally.
Researchers have identified a quality control (QC) pathway for misfolded proteins at the outer membrane of mitochondria in yeast cells. This pathway recognizes and removes misfolded proteins to maintain the essential functions of mitochondria. Two temperature-sensitive (ts) peripheral outer membrane proteins, sam-2Hs and sen-1Hs, were found to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteome system. Ubiquination of sam-2Hs is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, while sen-1s is ubiquinated by San1. Mitochondrial degradation (MAD) of both substrates requires the heat shock protein family Hsp70 and HspS1, showing the first evidence of chaperone involvement. In addition, a role for the C48-N4-U1-ATPase complex and a mitochondrial transmembrane C48 adaptor U2 are implicated in degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors distinct from other cellular pathways.
Researchers have developed a way to visualize and study the activity of a key protein called extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the skin of living mice. They used a special tool called a FRET biosensor to track ER activity in individual cells in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. Under normal conditions, ER activity was found to burst and spread from cell to cell in a radial pattern, like a wave. This spreading of ER activity, called SPREAD, was linked to the rate of skin cell division and growth. SPs were also triggered by a substance called 12-tetradecanoyphol-13-acetate (PA) in a way that depended on growth factor receptors and their ligands. When the skin was wounded, ER activity spread as a wave along the edge of the wound, suggesting that ER activation can be superimposed. By studying the cell cycle, researchers found that SPs were associated with the G2 phase of cell progression. These findings provide new insights into how cell growth and ER activity are synchronized in a living tissue.
Scientists have studied the internal biological clock of cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria, to understand how it responds to daily light and dark cycles. In nature, these clocks don't run freely but are controlled by external cues that change with the seasons. Researchers found that the cyanobacterial clock follows a simple rule when exposed to light and dark cycles, regardless of the day length. The core of the clock, made of proteins called Kai, behaves the same way when driven by pulses in a lab dish, indicating this is an intrinsic property of the proteins. A mathematical framework was developed to describe how the clock changes with external cues, predicting behavior in different environments.

The clock's behavior can be described with a few parameters, guiding experiments to study its molecular basis. The cyanobacteria's defined clock is unique but the model is general, useful for other organisms too. The core of the clock can be made in a lab from purified proteins, raising the question if it can track day-night cycles alone or needs cell factors. Cyanobacteria help understand circadian biology as the core oscillator can be made from Kai proteins and studied in lab conditions.

In a lab, the Kai proteins were driven with pulses of nucleotides on a 24-hour cycle, simulating day and night. The system showed similar scaling with day length, indicating mechanisms for adaptation are in the proteins. The model predicts behavior in changing environments with minimal data, applicable to many clocks. The clock's biochemistry is complex but analysis shows entrainment is how the cycle is deformed by the environment.
Researchers have identified a gene called Meis as a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), a leading cause of premature death in many people. They found that inactivating Meis in the neural crest, a group of cells that forms the heart and nervous system, leads to abnormal heart rhythm and conduction problems, making the heart more susceptible to SCD. This is because Meis is crucial for the development of sympathetic neurons, nerve cells that control heart rate and rhythm. Without Meis, these neurons die early in development and fail to innervate, or connect to, the heart. This disrupts the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, leading to conduction defects and chronotropic incompetence.

Meis also regulates genes involved in endosomal traffic, the movement of molecules within cells. Without Me, this process is severely impaired in sympathetic neurons. The study suggests Meis interacts with various signaling pathways during neuron development and differentiation. 

Inactivating Meis in mice results in neurodevelopmental defects, leading to neuron apoptosis, or cell death. Meis is a novel actor in sympathetic neuron differentiation and target innervation. The genes regulated by Me include proteins for retrograde transport, endosome formation, and functioning. 

The study aimed to investigate Meis role in cardiac regulation by intervening in sympathetic neuron differentiation and how Me mutations could mediate unexplained SCD. Loss of Me function in sympathetic neurons leads to imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation in adult mice, increasing susceptibility to S. Inactivating Me in peripheral neurons impairs Rab+ endosome traffic and target innervation. This complements a study showing Meis function in neonatal cardiomyocytes following myocardial infarction. However, cardiac functions were not affected by Meis inactivation or overexpression in cardiomyocytes. The Me family participates in cardiogenesis.
Researchers have studied the formation of biofilms, which are communities of bacteria attached to a surface, and found that mechanical instabilities such as wrinkling and delamination play a key role in their development. They used Vibrio cholera, a type of bacteria, as a model and combined measurements, theory, simulation, image analysis, and surface characterization, and genetic modification to show that these instabilities drive the shape of the biofilm. They also found that the energy at the surface of the biofilm, called interfacial energy, is a driving force behind the creation and destruction of new and existing interfaces within the biofilm. Additionally, they discovered a feedback loop between the shape of the biofilm and its expansion, which affects its overall shape.

The researchers suggest that the principles they discovered in biofilms, which rely on mechanical instabilities and interfacial energy, can be applied to morphogenesis in higher organisms. They propose that biofilms are an interesting and accessible model to study the role of forces in morphogenesis and provide a system for morph-engineering.

The study found that biofilms can wrinkle and delaminate as they grow due to compressive stress, and that changing the distribution of stress can alter their topography. They tested this by inoculating Vibrio cholera on agar and allowing them to collide. They also speculate that another type of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, forms radial wrinkles and delamination due to the same mechanical instability.

The findings suggest that genes and compounds that alter biofilm morphology by changing mechanics could be discovered to address bio-related problems. Morphological patterns can involve gene regulation, but the researchers expect mechanical findings in Vibrio to be applicable to other organisms.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcription factor NRS in the development of epilepsy following severe seizures. They found that NRS levels increased in the hippocampus after seizures, but surprisingly, only a small subset of NRS target genes were repressed. These repressed genes were rescued when NRS binding to chromatin was blocked. The subset of repressed genes had moderate binding to NRS, making them sensitive to fluctuations in NRS levels. Genes regulated by NRS in epilepsy coded for ion channels, receptors, and other contributors to neuronal function. This selective regulation may influence neuronal properties in pathological and physiological contexts.

A subset of N-containing genes in the hippocampus were repressed by N in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy, as shown by rescue when NRS function was blocked. The basis of selective regulation includes moderate binding to NRS. A subpopulation of N-containing genes in the hippocampus were repressed by seizure-induced increase in NRS levels and rescued when NRS binding was prevented. These genes had moderate repressor binding in the naive state, increasing after seizures. N-regulated hippocal genes included ion channels, receptors, calcium molecules, and transcription factors governing function, suggesting their repression contributes to epilepsy pathogenesis.

The study used large-scale transcript arrays, qPCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gene enrichment to examine NRS-dependent expression during epileogenesis. A twofold to three increase NRS, induced by seizures, led to repression of a subset potentially regulated, and rescued by interfering NRS function.
In the mammalian olfactory system, sensory information is processed through two parallel pathways formed by mitral and tuft cells. These cells receive input from olfactory sensory neurons and send signals to the brain. To understand how these pathways maintain or enhance specific features of a stimulus, researchers investigated the circuitry between mitral and tuft cells. They found differences in activity-dependent inhibition between the two cell types, likely due to distinct activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations showed that these circuit differences allow mitral and tuft cells to distinguish odors in separate concentration ranges, suggesting segregation of information about intensity may be a function of parallel pathways.

 The olfactory system is one of many sensory systems with parallel pathways. However, how local circuitry creates selectivity in these pathways is not well understood. This is especially true for areas where distinct outputs come from homogeneous sources, like the olfactory. In the mammalian olfactory bulb, olfactory neurons excite two types of projection neurons: mitral and tuft cells. Similar to the visual system, mechanisms behind parallel processing may be shared. In the retina, selectivity in ganglion cells emerges from connectivity to bipolar and amacrine cells. Similarly, differences in odor responses in mit and tuft cells come from connectivity to olfactory neurons and tuft cells.

 The combination of activity-dependent inhibition at low and intermediate rates enables tuft and mitral cells to encode odors better than either alone, supporting computations unlikely with single neurons.
Researchers have studied the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allosteric effects in the M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allosteric GPCRs. They compared monomers and oligomers of the receptor to identify alloster properties gained in oligomers. Alloic interactions were monitored using a FRET sensor at the alloster site and pharmacological assays with mutants to exclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of alloster were examined in molecular simulations. Alloic effects in monomers were negative, primarily due to intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between alloster and orthost ligands. Allo effects in oligomers were positive or negative, depending on alloster-orth pair, and arose from interactions between constituent protomers.

The M2 muscarinic receptor has been understood in terms of monomer interactions, but its oligomeric nature is evident in allo effects on dissociation of orthost antagonists and binding equilibrium. To understand how oligomers account for alloster behavior, researchers compared positive and negative alloster modulators on oligomers and monomers. The M2 receptor has been a prototype for effects in GPCRs, with most studies based on modulation at the orthost site in native or detergent-solized receptors. Events may be measured in binding radiolabeled antagonists. Alloic effects were examined in dynamics at the atomic level, starting from the monomeric M receptor occupied by agonist ipxo (MQ). Ligands and proteins were removed, and receptor conformations sampled within 30ns.

The study found that alloic effects in monomers were negative, primarily due to intram electrostatic repulsion between alloster and orthost ligands. Allo effects in oligomers were positive or negative, depending on alloster-orth pair, and arose from interactions between protomers. The behavior of oligomers is characteristic of musinic receptors in myocardial preparations.
Researchers have found that an enzyme called SET2 plays a crucial role in how cells respond to DNA damage. SET2 is responsible for adding a specific chemical tag to histone H3, a protein that helps organize chromatin, the material that makes up chromosomes. This tag, called H3me3, is important for cells to fix double-strand breaks in DNA, breaks that can cause cancer. When SET2 is missing, cells have trouble fixing these breaks and activating a key protein called p53, which helps prevent cancer. p53 is often mutated in a type of cancer called clear cell carcinoma. Without SET2, these cells can't activate p53 and are more likely to die after DNA damage.

 Studies show that SET2 is necessary for cells to repair DNA breaks using a process called homologous recombination. SET2 also helps form a protein called RAD51, which is important for this process. Without SET2, cells can't form RAD51 and can't repair DNA breaks. Researchers found SET2 mutations in several cancers, including clear cell carcinoma. More studies are needed to understand how SET2 helps cells respond to DNA damage.

 SET2 is different from other histone modifications that help DNA repair. It doesn't increase H3me at damage sites or recruit SET to breaks. Instead, it prepares chromatin to respond to damage. Clear carcinoma is a cancer with many genetic changes, including SET2 mutations. This study links these changes and how cells maintain genome integrity. Whether SET2 affects cells' ability to fix breaks is unknown. Researchers investigated SET's role in DNA breaks. They found SET is necessary for cells to fix breaks. SET helps activate a protein called ATM, which responds to damage. Without SET, cells can't activate ATM and can't fix breaks.

SET2 is necessary for cells to fix breaks using homolog recombination. It helps protein RAD51, which is important for this process. Without SET, cells can't form RAD51 and can't fix breaks. Researchers found SET mutations in several cancers, including clear carcinoma. More studies are needed to understand how SET helps cells respond to damage. SET is different from other histone modifications that help repair. It doesn't increase Hme at damage or recruit to breaks. Instead, it prepares chromatin to respond. Clear is a cancer with many changes, including SET mutations. This study links these and how cells maintain genome.
Researchers have identified a new genetic mutation in the Rasgrp gene, called RasgrpAna, which leads to the production of autoantibodies and a specific type of immune cell called Helios+ PD-1+ CD4 T cells. This mutation is different from other known mutations in the Ras1 gene, as it does not affect the development of immune cells in the thymus, but instead causes the accumulation of these cells in the periphery. The mutation increases the activity of a signaling pathway called mTOR in naive CD4 T cells, leading to overexpression of the protein CD44 and accumulation of Helios CD4+ cells and autoantib.

 Studies show that reducing the activity of mTOR in RasgrpAna mice normalizes CD44 expression on naive CD4 T cells and eliminates the accumulation of Helios CD4 cells and autoantib. This suggests that increased mTOR activity is key to the immune dysregulation caused by RasgrpAna. The mutation does not affect T cell development in the thym, but increases CD44 on naive thymocytes and T cells in a cell-autonomous manner. The researchers found that CD44 is a reporter of tonic mTOR signaling through a novel strain with a reduction-function mutation in mTOR.

 The findings reveal a new role for Rasgrp in the intrinsic regulation of CD4 T cells, separate from its known function in thymic selection. The study used a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to identify overactive m signaling in naive CD4 cells as a component of RasgrpAna's effects, including constitutive increase in CD44 and accumulation of Helios CD4 cells and autoib. The mutation's effect on Ras-ER signaling in vivo was milder than expected from in vitro assays.
Researchers studied the role of Arida, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in the development of pancreatic cancer. They found that loss of Arida in adult cells with oncogenic Kras mutations led to rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous pancreatic cancer precursor lesions. However, when Arida was silenced during embryogenesis with Kras activation, acinar cell fate was retained. This suggests that Arida is a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and that timing and genetic context influence the effects of SW/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.

In adult acinar cells with oncogenic Kras, suppressing Arida accelerated acinar to ductal specification and mucinous cancer precursor lesions that could not be reversed by restoring endogenous Arida expression. Alcian blue staining confirmed retention of mucinous lesions in Ar1-restored mice. Arida loss enabled non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate dependent on cellular and genetic context.

The researchers sought to understand how Arida regulates pancreas cell identity. Disrupting the SW/S chromatin-remodel complex impacts expression of SW/S target genes. This implies genomic areas accessible by Arida involved in preventing ac to duct transdifferentiation in mutant K, a critical step in K driven neoplas. Transcription and chrom profiling data showed Arida disruption in oncogenic K reduces chromatin of TF to enhancers needed sustain ac cell.

Ar ability to stabilize ac identity may act barrier to cancer initiation, other factors necessary promote Pan-to-DAC transition. Data suggest loss Ar in setting pre-existing K rapidly perturb identity and function ac, enhancing sensitivity metlastic Pan-inducing from oncogenic K.
Researchers studied how social isolation affects the brain's response to stress in mice. They found that social isolation has different effects on the brain cells that respond to stress in males and females. Specifically, isolating pre-teen female mice from their littermates for 24 hours changed the properties of these cells, making them less responsive to stress. This was not seen in age-matched males. However, subjecting either males or females to physical stress increased the time it took for these cells to respond. The increase in response time was blocked by a stress hormone inhibitor and mimicked by a male hormone. The study shows that social isolation, but not physical stress, has sex-specific effects on these brain cells.

The researchers found that brief social isolation affects the properties of these cells in a sex-specific way. They saw an increase in response time and decrease in responsiveness in isolated females, but not males. In contrast, physical stress increased response in group-housed females and single-housed males. Social isolation blocked the effects of stress in females. They examined brain slices and found that social isolation changed the properties of these cells in females, but not males. Activation of these cells is necessary for the body's response to stress.

The researchers hypothesized that females, but not males, may see social isolation as stressful. They tested this by subjecting single-housed males to stress, which increased response in females. However, prior isolation blocked the effects of stress in females. They found that males and females react differently to some, but not all stressors. Social has hormone-dependent effects on cells in females, but not males. Both males and females show equal response to physical stress. Social blocks the effects of subsequent stress in females, but not males.
Scientists have long studied hemoglobin (H), a protein that carries oxygen in the blood, to understand how it adapts to different body sizes in mammals. While its ability to bind oxygen is crucial for delivering oxygen to tissues, its affinity was thought to be the main factor in these adaptations. However, a new research suggests that both affinity and cooperativity of H play a role in optimizing oxygen delivery to tissues. To test this, researchers analyzed the relationship between the Hill coefficient, a measure of cooperativity, and affinity, and conformation changes of the Monod-Wann-Change alloster model. They found that mammalian H cooperativity values lie on a curve that allows for fine-tuning oxygen delivery to meet distinct tissue needs. This reveals the mechanism behind body-size adaptation of mammalian H. The study's findings have implications for understanding how H adapts to different body sizes.

Hemoglobin's ability to bind oxygen affects how it delivers oxygen to tissues, but its affinity was thought to be the main factor in adapting to different body sizes. However, researchers found that both affinity and cooperativity play a role in optimizing oxygen delivery. They analyzed the relationship between the Hill coefficient, a measure of cooperativity, and affinity, and conformation changes of the Mon-Wannalloster model. Mammalian H cooperativity values lie on a curve that allows fine-tuning oxygen delivery to meet tissue needs. This reveals the mechanism behind body-size adaptation of mammalian H. The study's findings have implications for understanding how H adapts to body size.

The study found that different mammalian H exhibit different maximum Hill values, with higher values giving higher sensitivities to substrate unloading by M proteins. This led to the hypothesis that maximum cooperativity of H has been tuned to satisfy tissue oxygen needs. Small animals with high metabolic rates have lower affinity than large animals, reflecting adaptation of oxygen unloading by H. However, results support the hypothesis that changes in H binding and conformation have given rise to maximum cooperativity, with different values in each case. The human H dataset showed that higher metabolic rate, higher cooperativity of oxygen binding. An inverse correlation was found between metabolic rate and affinity.
Researchers have studied how Plasmodium sporozoites, the parasites that cause malaria, move and interact with blood vessels in the skin after being injected by an Anopheles mosquitoes. They used a special microscope to watch the parasites in mice and found two types of movement: fast and free movement in areas away from blood vessels, and slower movement near blood vessels. The parasites curved their tracks to touch the vessels and enter the smallest blood capillaries. The study also looked at parasites with missing key proteins and found that their speed and ability to change adhesion are important for exiting the skin.

The researchers measured the speed of the parasites in the lab and found 5 micrometers per second. In this study, they watched the parasites over time in the skin and saw changes in their movement over two hours. They found a new type of movement near blood vessels. They made some parasites fluorescent to study the role of proteins in movement and blood recognition and found that one type spent more time near vessels but couldn't enter blood. The other type moved slower and explored less area, making it harder to find vessels.

Parasite movement is important for infecting the body. Previous studies saw movement in the skin but not over time. This study watched over 120 minutes and found changes in movement. The data show movement changes in response to signals and two types: fast and free, and slower near blood. This study helps understand how parasites leave the skin. Mutant parasites with changed movement or speed had less ability to enter blood and infect.
Researchers studied how cells adapt to the loss of a key component that helps them polarize, or organize, their internal structures. They removed the gene BEM1 from yeast cells and let them evolve for 1,000 generations. Initially, the cells without BEM1 did better than their ancestors with B1, but then slowed down. The team sequenced the cells' genomes and found that they followed a common path of mutations that improved polarization. Each mutation inactivated proteins that hindered polarization. The results show that cells can recover from disruptions and adapt by inactivating genes, leading to changes in cell functions.

The study focused on the loss of a module that polarizes yeast cells. The cells recovered through a reproducible path due to interactions between mutated genes, leading to faster and more accurate polarization. Yeast lost 88 genes over 100 million years ago and gained new functions by adapting existing genes or creating new ones. The experiment created a set of rapid polarization mechanisms. BEM1 cells often had multiple polarity sites, suggesting positive feedback for a single site is weaker. Three mutations re-established efficient polarization.

B1 was deleted because it's a relatively new component in polarity and had a different role in ancestors. Deleting it revealed alternative, more ancient modules. B1 is an important polarity gene. The results show multiple regulation allows cells to polarize rapidly and adapt to disruptions. Under pressure, larger mutations that inactivate proteins favor trajectories that remove components over altering properties.
Researchers studied how people make economic decisions by choosing between options with lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. They found that the brain's rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmFC) encodes value when accepting or rejecting a prospect into the future, suggesting it integrates value over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes value when rejecting or accepting a prospect. ACC signals reflect two biases: deferring to later and weighing losses more than gains, paradoxically maximizing reward in this task. These findings provide new insights into pressures shaping economic decisions and value computation in the medial prefrontal cortex.

Previous studies examined neural mechanisms of economic behavior by offering independent gambles or choices. This study devised a task with commitment to an asset with financial consequences. The aim was to understand mechanisms of economic commitments and their neural implementation in medial prefrontal cortex. Commitments follow deliberation, items are considered, and acceptance or rejection deferred to later. However, it's unknown whether value coding depends on accepted or rejected stimuli when choosing between options. It's also unknown how encoding in medialfrontal cortex depends on economic or non-economic decisions.

This study investigated mechanisms of commitment, acceptance, rejection, and deferral using a multi-altern choice with financial ramifications. Participants chose between accepting or deferring a prospect in half of blocks. The dorsal cing cortex (ACC) encoded value when excluded, while rmFC encoded during deferral. Joint consideration of data and ACC allowed pinpointing two pressures: deferring and weighing unfavourable options.
Researchers studied the role of paraspeck bodies in controlling gene expression in pituitary cells. Parasck are nuclear bodies that form around long non-coding RNA and RNA-binding proteins. Their function is not fully understood, but they may control gene expression by retaining mRNA in the nucleus. The study found that components of parasck, including proteins and RNA, display a circadian pattern in pituit cells. Inserting a specific sequence (IRu) at the end of a gene led to rhythmic retention of the mRNA, which was lost when parasck were disrupted. Using a microscope, IRu drove circadian expression of a protein. This shows that parasck control gene expression at a post-transcription level due to their circadian pattern.

The study built on previous findings that two proteins in parasck, NON and SFP, display circadian pattern in pit cells. A few genes showed loss of rhythmic pattern when parasck were disrupted, suggesting parasck play a role in circadian expression. Post-transcriptional regulation plays a major role in mRNA oscillations, and parasck may retain RNAs in the nucleus leading to rhythmic expression. To test this, researchers characterized parasck in a pit cell line and found they were rhythmically expressed. They then inserted IRu at the end of a gene and observed rhythmic retention of mRNA, which was lost when parasck were disrupted. Using a microscope, IRu drove circadian expression of protein.

The study suggests parasck bodies rhythmically retain RNAs in the nucleus, leading to rhythmic expression of genes. This provides an additional layer of regulation by sequestering mRNAs within the nucleus. Parasck may play a role in circadian gene expression in pitary cells.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Munc13 plays a crucial role in controlling the function of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). These channels are essential for converting electrical signals into chemical signals in the brain. M13 is a protein that helps with exocytosis, the release of molecules from nerve terminals. The study found that M13 interacts with VGCC through a specific part of its structure called the C2 domain. This interaction affects how VG channels respond to electrical activity and calcium influx. Without M13, or with a mutated C2 domain, VG channels don't work as well during high-frequency bursts of activity or single action potentials.

The study shows that M13 has a significant influence on VG function and suggests a new way to control synaptic efficacy. The relationship between exocyt and calcium influx and VG function implies that synaptic activity can be controlled by VG-protein interactions. Many proteins interact with VGs, but this is the first time M13 has been shown to control VG on millisecond time scales. A specific site on M13's C2 domain was pinpointed as critical for the interaction.

M13 enhances calcium influx and modulates VG properties across different stimulation conditions. This has implications for understanding how transmission is controlled. Data suggests this is due to a direct VG-M13 interaction, but other interactions can't be ruled out. To test the significance of M13-VG interaction, the impact of removing M13 on action-driven calcium influx was examined. Expression of a gene targeting M13 led to 94% depletion and blocked exyt. Without M13, VG didn't reactivate in 1.2mM extracellular calcium, but with a mutated M13 did. This suggests the increase in exyt during paired pulses in mutated M13 is due to lack of M-VG interaction. Therefore, M13's C2 domain mediates VG reactivation in terminals.
Plant cells in the epidermis of many plant species have a complex, puzzle-like shape, but the purpose of this shape has been unclear. Researchers propose that this shape helps reduce stress in the cell wall of the epidermis when the tissue grows in all directions equally. They tested this idea by looking at data from various plant organs and species, including mutants where growth was disrupted. Using computer models, they showed a mechanism that regulates stress and reproduces the cell shape of epidermal cells. The results suggest that mechanical stress drives the shape of cells.

The researchers focused on the epidermis of plants that grow in all directions, like leaves and cotyledons. They found that cells with a large surface area experience high stress. To avoid this, they propose the puzzle shape with lobes and indentations helps. They tested this by analyzing stress in a model of the cotyled epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana. In stems and roots, growth is in one direction, but in broad leaves and cotyled, it's not. The puzzle-shaped cells in epider of broad plants match the prediction that they help cells grow in all directions but not elongate. The model predicts cells regulate shape to prevent stress from becoming too large.

Plant cells are like balloons with high pressure, up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaves and 50 in specialized cells like stomata. The researchers propose the puzzle shape is an adaptation to mechanical forces on cells in epider.
Scientists have long known that human genes contain multiple introns, or non-coding regions, and exons, coding regions that need to be properly connected by the spliceosome, a complex that removes introns and joins exons. However, how the spliceosome assembles is not fully understood. Researchers investigated how intron-exon and exon interactions contribute to this process. They used human cell extracts and fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subunits to study the dynamics of pre-mRNA splicing. They found that a subunit bound to the 5' end of an intron works with another sub bound to the 5 end of the next intron to increase the rate and efficiency of sub recruitment to the 3' end of the upstream intr. This synergy between introns and exons is crucial for correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron preRNAs.

 The study suggests an ordered pre-splice assembly pathway in humans, unlike yeast. In multi-in preRNAs, exons have 5' sites both upstream and downstream, or both can bind and recruit to the 3' site. Two subunits can act independently or together. The researchers developed a method to observe splice subunits on preRNA in human extracts and found that binding to the 5 site is not affected by the presence of sites downstream or upstream. Spliceosomes can form on multi-in preRNAs through two pathways: introns can be recognized via intron-exon interactions or exon-exon interactions, where exons are defined first, then intron-exon interactions lead to spliceosome assembly.

 Models suggest that once a functional pre-splice forms, interactions with bound to downstream 5 provide no additional binding or stimulation. However, the mechanisms behind this accuracy were unclear. The study shows that a major contributor to exon inclusion is collaboration between flanking 5 sites, which increases the rate of recruitment during splicing. This synergy is important for proper splicing of multi-in preRNAs.
Researchers have discovered a new way that proteins are folded in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum (ER) get help. This process, called ubiquitin-dependent folding, involves adding and removing a small protein called ubiquitin to a specific spot on the protein. The study focused on the Wnt signaling receptor LRP6, which is important for cell growth and development. When LRP6 is made, ubiquitin is added to it, helping it fold correctly. If it folds well, ubiquitin is removed and LRP is sent out of the ER. If not, LRP is marked for destruction. This system also helps other proteins, like CFTR and anthrax toxin receptor, which are involved in human diseases.
Researchers investigated sex differences in decision-making processes in mice using a classic value-based decision task, the restless two-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance through different patterns of exploration. Males made more exploratory choices overall, but got stuck in exploration once started, while females explored less but learned quickly. These results suggest sex influences decision-making during learning and exploration more than during stable choices. Exploration is altered in people with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing mechanisms as a translational avenue for sex-modulated vulnerability to psychiatric diagnoses.

A previous studies showed sex differences in exploration contribute to performance variability across tasks and species. To examine differences, male and female mice were trained on the restless-armed bandit task. Males showed higher exploration than females throughout. Computational tools were used to characterize sex differences in latent variables underlying behavior, a key process regulating reward-guided behaviors: balancing exploration and exploitation. In an uncertain world, balance rewarding options and exploring alternatives that could be more rewarding or provide information about the world.

Results of HMM and RL models revealed sex differences exploration, paralleled by differences in learning rate. How exploration-exploit, reward, and outcomes interact to influence animals' choices is unclear. Mechanisms biasing approaches during tasks are significant contributors to performance. A combination of modeling was used to characterize differences in explore-exploit. While males and females had similar performance, used different strategies to learn the environment.

Post-hoc win-lose analyses showed females displayed more win-st behaviors, repeating behaviors that produced reward on previous trial. This indicates females were more likely than males to repeat rewarding behaviors.
Researchers have been trying to understand how proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and sent to the proteasome for degradation. This process, called endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), involves proteins being ubiquinated, extracted from the membrane, and broken down by the proteasome. A key part of this process is how hydrophobic (water-repelling) transmembrane (TM) segments are moved from the phospholip bilayer into the cytosol, along with hydrophil (water-attracting) and folded ER luminal parts.

Using a reconstuted system with purified proteins from Saccharomy cerevisiae, researchers found that the ubiquitin ligase Do10 (also known as Te-4/MARCH in animals) is a membrane retrolocase that facilitates protein extraction. The TM segment of the substrate interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Do10 and passively moves into the aqueous phase. Luminal segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, and unfolding occurs on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasm C48 action.

This study allowed researchers to investigate protein extraction without relying on downstream reactions like proteomal degradation. They show Do10 is a membrane retroloc and how it cooperates with C48 in extraction of proteins with luminal domains.
Researchers have found that the protein Hedgehog (H) can act as a morphogen in the absence of regulated processing of the protein Ci protein in fruit flies. Normally, H proteins induce transcriptional changes in cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Ci or Gli proteins to transcription repressors and activating the full Ci or Gli proteins. To investigate the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent H signaling in fruit fly wing discs, the researchers expressed Ci variants at physiological levels. They found that Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded gene activation and development of adults with normal morphology when supplemented with constitutive Ci repressor, showing that H can signal in the absence of regulated processing. Processing-resistant Ci variants were also activated in the absence of H by elimination of Cos2, likely through binding the CORD of Ci or PK, revealing inhibitory roles of these components in addition to their established roles in promoting processing.

Hedgehog proteins guide development and maintain tissue homeostasis in in invertebrates and vertebrates. Aberrant H production, distribution, and responses are causes developmental defects and cancer, including holoprosphaly, limb, and digit abnormalities, medulloblast, and cell carcinoma. Processing-resistant Ci variants also supported development adults with normal patterning, provided constitutive Ci repressor was present to suppress ectopic dpp in anterior cells. Thus, can mediate normal H morph action discs in absence regulated.

In third instar fly wing discs, H is expressed posterior cells and Ci only anterior, so H signals band anterior-posterior (AP) with strength posterior-anterior. Results show pattering by H not require regulation repressor or full Ci by processing. Animals lacking kinase and develop normal, although discs lack anterior induction.
Researchers have identified a specific type of neuron in the spinal cord called calretinin (CR) positive interneurons that play a key role in transmitting pain signals. These interneurons form a network in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, an area critical for processing sensory information, and can amplify pain signals even without input from the periphery. The study used a technique called optogenetics to selectively activate these interneurons and found that they initiate and sustain excitatory signaling to lamina projection neurons. When activated, these interneurons caused significant pain behavior in mice, which was sensitive to morphine and caused a place aversion, and was enhanced by nerve injury. Inhibiting these interneurons with halorhodin increased sensory thresholds. The results suggest that excitatory interneurons in the dorsal horn are important for generating and amplifying pain and identify them as a potential target for pain relief.

The study confirms that CR interneurons form an excitatory network in the dorsal horn that contributes to pain signaling and can amplify signals in the absence of peripheral input. They are strongly connected and positioned to alter information before it reaches the brain. This is shown in the pain responses elicited by photostimulation. The study focused on characterizing these circuits and their roles in sensory experience using optogenetics. Future work will determine how they respond to peripheral sensory processing.

Other research has implicated distinct subpopulations of interneurons in pain perception, both acute and chronic. Historically, research on spinal circuits focused on inhibition. Current models place CRneurons in a polysynaptic circuit that signals through SOM to lamina and initiate pain. The data is compatible with this model since photostimulation evoked EPSC in dorsal neurons, including those superficial to the Y plexus. This extends the view of excit interneurons in sensory, ascribing a limited role in linking innocuous input to nocice.
Researchers studied the role of Ras-associated protein 23 (RAB23) in bone development, particularly in the formation of the skull. Mutations in the AB gene cause Carpenter syndrome, a condition characterized by extra fingers and toes and skull abnormalities. To understand how AB regulates bone formation, the researchers created mice without AB and studied their development. These mice had extra fingers and premature fusion of skull bones due to abnormal bone cell growth and formation. The researchers found that a signaling pathway, driven by growth factor 10 (FGF10), was elevated in AB-deficient mice, leading to an imbalance in other signaling pathways. Inhibiting this pathway restored normal bone cell growth and prevented skull fusion. The study suggests AB as a new regulator of FG and another pathway, as well as non-canonical regulation of a protein. 

The researchers generated AB-deficient mice that survived to 18.5 days, allowing study of bone formation. Similar to Carpenter patients, these mice had extra fingers and premature skull fusion. Disruption of AB led to upregulation of genes and downregulation of others. AB regulates a stem cell marker and inhibits expansion. AB also represses FG-driven signaling, affecting cell development and differentiation. AB coordinates bone formation by regulating FG and activity, as well as activation of. AB controls bone and patency through three mechanisms: FG signaling, repression of pathway, and repression of by. The contributes to regulation of stem cell niche. FG and signaling regulate cell proliferation. Overlapping phenotypes caused by mutations and AB suggest common mechanisms. FG and have roles in intramembrane bone formation. FG regulates stages, including condensation, proliferation, and activation of transcription factor. In addition, signaling was amplified with expression. In culture, inhibition of normalized proliferation, corrected expressions, and rescued fusion. The study a new role for AB as upstream of FG and, and regulation of, to initiate.
Researchers have long sought to understand how cells "remember" past events, such as environmental or developmental cues, by maintaining gene expression states. A key player in this process is the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants by modifying chromatin at its targets. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance is a long-term memory of gene states (cis) or dictated by concentrations of diffusible factors (trans). To address this, scientists studied the epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis, where prolonged cold exposure accelerates flowering by repressing the Poly target gene FLOW LOCUS C (FLC). By monitoring two copies of FLC in the same plants, one can be repressed while the other is active, and this "mixed" state is inherited through cell divisions as plants develop. This demonstrates epetic memory of FLC is stored in cis, not trans.

The study used an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of FLC states at single-cell level, crossing F-merry to F-Venus to generate hybrids with single copy each. In trans-based memory, only heritable states are ON/ON and OFF/OFF, as epetic information is stored as diffus signal. F repression requires P2 but is independent DNA methylation, making a system for studying cis-storage of Poly at single. Vernal plants FLC is bistable, with number cells repressed increasing with duration prior cold exposure.
BiP, a molecular chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), forms oligomers in response to changes in the physiological state of the cell. These oligomers are relatively inactive and serve as a storage form of the chaper that can be quickly accessed when needed. Research has shown that Bi oligomers consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate site of another, which attenuates the chaper function of Bi. The relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and Bi oligomers is rapidly modulated, while the equilibrium between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified Bi is slower.

Calcium depletion in the ER causes rapid oligomerization of mammalian Bi and a decrease in substrate binding, indicating the inertness of oligomers. The equilibrium between inactive oligomers and active monomeric Bi is poised to buffer fluctuations in unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale. This is not achieved by interconversion of active and covalently-modified Bi or the unfolded protein response.

Bi oligization is tuned to the physiological state of the cell and inactivates participating Bi protomers. The olig form is a relatively inactive chaper that is accessible on a short scale. The findings are consistent with a model where competition between oligization and binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in protein in both directions. The affinity of Hsp proteins for substrates is governed by J-protein non-equilibrium mechanisms, which could account for Bi favoring itself as a client over others as Ca2 ER declines. This would shift the equilibrium between unfolded and chaper in favor of the former.

Observations paint a picture of enhanced production of unfolded drawing the pool of inactive olig Bi to service its clientele. Reports of oligomers in stressed cells may reflect partition of chaper produced during the unfolded response or its cytoplasm counterpart, the shock, but redundant following resolution. The relationship between unfolded load and oligeric of Hsp is confounded by feedback that dominates unfolded responses and chone to levels of stress.
Researchers have determined the near-atomic structure of a filamentous plant virus called Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) at 3.9 Å resolution using electron microscopy. This virus is a representative of the Potexvirus family, which includes economically important plant pathogens. The structure reveals the arrangement of its coat protein (CP) and its interactions with viral RNA. The CP fold of PepMV is similar to that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the Phlebovirus family, a group of enveloped ssRNA viruses. The main difference between Potv and Phlev is their C-terminal extensions, which determine distinct multimer assemblies. The study suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic and ssRNA viruses.

 Flexible viruses are plant pathogens with significant impact on agriculture. Their particles are non-enveloped and rod-shaped, containing hundreds of CP in a helical fashion protecting ssRNA. High-resolution structures of flexuous plant viruses include Pep and previously reported structures of PapMV and BaMV. It is unclear if other flex families have similar CP folds. Researchers found structural homology between CP of flex and NPs of Phleviruses, enveloped with segmented ssRNA. NPs are associated with genome in ribonucleoproteins inside an envelope with glycoproteicosahedral shell.
Researchers have developed a new method, called Site, to accurately locate the binding sites of antibodies on the surface of cells. This is important for understanding how the immune system works and for developing treatments like vaccines and medicines. Current methods for finding these sites are time-consuming and not suitable for many types of cells. The new method, Site, uses imaging to measure the distance between the antibody and the cell surface with nanometer precision. This is done by averaging high-resolution images of the cell's surface. The team tested this method on bacteria and found it worked well, and it can be used for other types of cells too. The location of the binding site is crucial for understanding how the immune system works and developing treatments.

Researchers have found that the body's ability to adapt to low oxygen levels of oxygen, or hypoxia, is influenced by how peripheral tissues, such as the skin, respond to the lack of oxygen. They discovered that the skin plays a key role in regulating blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature in response to low oxygen levels. This is the first time scientists have shown that a peripheral tissue, like the skin, can directly affect how the body responds to low oxygen.

The study focused on how the skin, with a large blood vessel bed, senses low oxygen and how it affects the body's cardiovascular system. They found that the skin's ability to sense low oxygen is crucial for the body's response to hypox. To understand this, they looked at the role of HIF-1, a protein that responds to low oxygen, in skin cells. They found that mice without H-1 in skin cells had lower body temperature.

The researchers used a 10% oxygen challenge, a moderate level of hypox, to study the body's response. They found that mice without H-1, H-2, N2, and Arg1 in skin had changes in blood pressure and temperature compared to normal mice. They showed for the first time that H-1 and H-2 in skin cells affect the body's immediate and long-term response to low oxygen. Low oxygen increases sympathetic nerves in the skin to increase blood vessel resistance.

The study proposed a model of how the body responds to low oxygen, involving H- and nitric oxide in the skin. It suggests low oxygen leads to an increase in diameter and blood flow, followed by a decrease in intracellular arginine.
Researchers have developed a new method to map the connections between individual neurons in the brain with high precision. This method uses a technique called optogenetics, which involves using light to activate specific neurons. They used a protein called channelrhodin (ChR2) that responds to light to create electrical signals in neurons. By focusing the light on the cell body of the neuron and its closest branches, they were able to activate individual neurons and measure the connections between them. This is important because understanding how neurons talk to each other is key to understanding how the brain works and how we respond to the world.

The previous methods for using optogen had limitations. They could not target specific neurons well because the protein was expressed in many parts of the neuron, not just the cell body. This led to unintended activation of nearby fibers and branches. The new method overcomes this by restricting the protein to the cell body and closest branches. This allows researchers to map connections between neurons with single-cell resolution.

The brain is made up of many neurons that talk to each other in complex patterns. Understanding these patterns is key to understanding how the brain works and how we behave. Current methods to map connections were not precise enough. This new method provides a way to see how individual neurons talk to each other, which is crucial for understanding brain function.
Researchers have re-examined how two transcription factors, Sox2 and Oct4, interact with DNA in living cells. Previous studies suggested they assembled on DNA in a specific order, but new analysis shows they interact in a different way, called negative reciprocity. This means Sox2 increases Oct's ability to bind to DNA, but decreases Oct's ability to bind to Sox2. Models show this can happen through energy or a mix of positive and negative interactions at different locations on the genome. This is unexpected and suggests single-molecule methods can reveal new insights into how transcription factors interact with DNA.

The study found that Sox and Oct don't always help or hinder each other across the genome, contrary to previous findings. This is not surprising, as transcription factors like Sox and Oct can have different interactions at different locations. However, this means more research is needed to understand how they interact across the genome to interpret single-molecule data. The study's main finding is the possibility of energy driving Sox and Oct's action on DNA, which has not been seen before in living cells. Single-molecule methods can help unravel such mechanisms.

The study has implications for understanding how transcription factors work. The variation in their interactions across the genome is significant, suggesting single-molecule data provides more information than expected. A small number, -0.22, indicates both positive and negative interactions between Sox and Oct at different locations. This can be due to energy or mixed interactions, with Sox and Oct helping each other at some locations and hindering at others.
Researchers have discovered that fruit flies can detect and avoid bacterial toxins called lipopolysaccharides (LPS) before they cause infection. These toxins are important signals for the immune system to recognize infection, but it's unclear if animals can sense them before infection. The study found that fruit flies display strong aversive responses to L and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66 bitter receptors mediate avoidance of L in feeding and egg-laying assays. The expression of the chemosensory channel TR1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for L avoidance. L stimulates fruit neurons in a TR1-dependent manner and activates exogenous TR1 channels in human cells. This demonstrates that flies detect bacterial toxins via a gustatory pathway through TR1 activation, a conserved mechanism.

The study shows that L is avoided during feeding and oviposition and TR1 expression in gustatory neurons is necessary and sufficient for L avoidance. Data indicate a TR1 mechanism of L avoidance may prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Flies that lack TR1 preferred laying eggs on uncontaminated food over contaminated with E. coli. The channel TR1 mediates acute responses to L in mice and avoidance of bitter compounds in flies. Researchers tested if TR1 mediates gustatory L avoidance in flies. Blocking transmission in neurons by tetanus toxin abolished L avoidance, indicating flies detect L through a gustatory mechanism.

Data demonstrate fruit possess a gustatory underlying detection and avoidance of L. Avoiding L-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may prevent Gram bacterial infections, compensating for lack of immunity in animals. The sensory mechanism exploits TR1 suggests a principle where channels play a role in L detection by neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of modality.
Researchers have identified a zinc finger protein called Zfp335 that plays a crucial role in the formation of naive T cells, a type of immune cell essential for immune function. Mice with a mutation in Zfp show a lack of naive T cells due to a developmental defect that starts in the thymus and continues in the periphery. This defect affects T cells that have recently left the thymus. The effects of Zfp are widespread and cannot be attributed to altered thym selection, proliferation, or B2-dependent survival. Zfp binds to specific regions of DNA and targets genes related to metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcription regulation. Restoring one target gene, An2, partially rescues T maturation. These findings identify Zfp as a transcription factor and regulator of late-stage thym and post-thym T maturation.

A study analyzed mice with a hypomorphic mutation in Zfp and found a defect in accumulation of naive T cells due to maturation block in thymocytes and recent thymigrants. Zfp regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes. A set of Zfp targets in thym and evidence decreased Zfp occupancy alters gene expression in mutant thym. Together, findings show Zfp functions as a transcription factor and regulator of transcription program for T maturation.

A gene, An2, is a target of Zfp and its dysregulation by Z335 contributes to mat defect in bl/bl T cells. Analysis shows An2 transcript levels in thym and naïve T populations from bl/+ and bl/bl mice. Western blot for An2 protein in wild-type and mutant thym with actin as control. An2 is a functional target of Zfp and its dysregulation by Z335 contributes to mat defect in bl/bl T cells.
Researchers have found a new way to control protein levels in bacteria and archaea by avoiding interactions between messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA). This is important because mRNA and protein levels are not always perfectly correlated, and other factors like codon usage and mRNA structure can't fully explain the difference. The new factor, called mRNAnc avoidance, increases translational efficiency and is selected for across prokaryotes, and has a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or cod usage. By creating variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different interaction potential with ncRNAs, researchers found that GFP levels correlate with avoidance. This means that taking mRNAnc interactions into account can precisely modulate protein levels.

 Studies found that 97% of species have reduced interactions between native RNAs compared to controls. Variant GFP mRNAs with different interaction potential with ncRN showed that expression can be predicted and controlled. Results show strong selection for avoidance of mRNAnc interactions across proaryotes. This property, called intrinsic avoidance, may not identify genuine cases with extreme G content differences between RNAs. Measuring intrinsic using shuffled RN as controls, found interactions are underrepresented in 73% of proary phyla (p<0.05). Results establish a signature of selection minimizing mRNAnc interactions. However, with thousands of interacting RN in simple proary systems, complete avoidance is unlikely, suggesting a trade-off between avoidance and expression.

Avoidance is as good an explanation of protein variation as cod usage and structure. Results indicate cstalk between mRN and ncRN impact expression. Taking cstalk into account enables design of constructs with precise protein levels. Meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data showed correlation between GFP mRN and avoidance. mRN with low avoidance produce fewer proteins per transcript than high avoidance.
Researchers have studied the process of motor unit (MU) loss in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease. They used in vivo imaging to track single axons and neuromus junctions (NJs) over three months and found that motor units are dismantled asynchronously. Before complete axon degeneration, axonal branches are dismantled and new axons sprout, forming synapses on nearby NJs. Denervation events spread from the first NJ, suggesting factors outside the motor neuron contribute, with distal branches more susceptible. This shows NJ denervation in ALS is a dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation, not a sudden motor neuron degeneration.

The study reveals a previously unknown dynamic at the NJ in ALS. A window exists between branch dismantling and motor degeneration that could be therapeutically exploited. However, rescuing neurons in SOD mice does not improve NJ denervation, suggesting local events play a role. Local synaptic and molecular changes occur early at NJ in ALS. Researchers used repeated in vivo imaging to track motor axonal arbors and NJs to assess changes during progression. A MU-dependent degeneration would result in synchronous loss, while local changes result in asynchronous NJs within a MU.

ALS is characterized by upper and lower motor neuron loss. NJ loss is a key event in patients and models. Denervation is observed before onset. Researchers used in vivo imaging to track single axons and NJs over three months and found that motor units are dismantled asynchronously. Before axon degeneration, axonal branches are dismantled and new axons sprout, forming synapses on NJs. Den events spread from the first NJ, suggesting factors outside the neuron contribute, with distal branches more susceptible. This shows NJ denervation in ALS is a dynamic process of continuous denervation and innervation, not sudden motor degeneration.

The study reveals a previously unsuspected dynamic at the NJ in ALS. A window exists between branchling and degeneration that could be therapeutically exploited. However, rescuing neurons in SOD mice does not improve denervation, suggesting local events play a role. Local synaptic and molecular changes occur early at NJ in ALS. Researchers used repeated in vivo to track axonal arbors NJs to assess changes during progression. A-dependent degeneration would result in synchronous, local changes in asynchronous NJs within MU.
Researchers have found that the hormone estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) plays a key role in the negative side effects of tamoxifen, a medication used to treat breast cancer. Long-term tamifen treatment can cause hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue, but the cells and tissues responsible for these effects were unclear. Mice treated with tamifen showed changes in temperature, bone, and movement. Single-cell sequencing revealed tamifen induced gene changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-PO). These changes depended on ERα, as knocking out ER in the hypothalam-PO blocked or reversed tamifen gene expression. ER-deficient mice did not exhibit tamifen changes in temperature, bone, or movement. The study provides insight into tamifen's effects on the hypothalam-PO and that ER mediates several physiological effects of tamifen in mice. ER in the hypothalam-PO is necessary for tamifen changes in gene expression and effects on thermoregulation, bone, and movement. The findings suggest tamifen modulates ER signaling in the nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of health.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called IS15 in fighting off a bacterial infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes. IS15 is a type of protein that is produced in response to viral infections, but its role in bacterial infections was not well understood. The study found that IS15 is produced in large amounts in cells when they are infected with Lister, and surprisingly, this happens without the help of a type of protein called interferon. Instead, the production of IS15 is triggered by a different pathway in the cell that senses the presence of bacterial DNA. This pathway involves proteins called STING, TBK, IRF, and IR7. Importantly, the study showed that IS15 limits the growth of Lister in both in a lab dish and in animals. To understand how IS works, researchers used a technique called SILAC to identify proteins that are modified by IS. They found that IS modifies proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, which leads to increased production of proteins that help fight infection. The study reveals a new way that IS15 helps the body defend against Lister infection and highlights its importance in the immune response.
Researchers have developed a new software called DeepRET that can quickly and accurately analyze data from single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smRET) experiments. smRET is a method used to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the amount of data produced has outpaced the development of methods to analyze it. DeepRET uses deep learning to automatically classify the data, requiring only a user-adjustable threshold for image quality. It outputs common metrics like kinetic information and performs better than human operators, taking less than 1% of the time. It can quantify biomolecular dynamics and contribute to benchmarking smRET for structural biology.

DeepRET was trained with simulated or high-quality data and achieved accuracy over 95%. It's expected to enable fully automated analysis in biomolecular recognition, protein folding, and resolution. This will increase the impact of single-molecule studies in biology. The software is an all-inclusive with a pre-trained neural network for rapid, objective, and accurate assessment of smRET data. It operates with minimal human intervention, requiring a threshold on data quality, and outputs detailed quantification of dynamics from images.

DeepRET has advantages over other approaches: it recognizes patterns and learns from raw data, allowing routines without extensive preprocessing or rules, and reproducible evaluation. It's faster than human for large datasets and comes close to human performance. The classification was achieved without preprocessing or inspection, showing DeepRET's power to operate without interventions and benchmark reproducibility of smRET methods. A confusion matrix was used to display discord between truth and classified data by DeepRET.

DeepRET is a free, standalone executable for Windows and Mac, allowing users with limited skills to operate it. It's expected to be a paradigm shift in smRET analysis, enabling new methodologies in biomolecular recognition, folding, and resolution. This will increase the breadth of single-molecule studies in biology.
Researchers have identified a protein called SCML2 that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by working with a complex called Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). SC2 is a mammalian version of a protein found in fruit flies called SCM, which is part of the Polycomb group that associates with PR1. The study found that SC2A, an isoform of SC2 tightly associated with chromatin, contributes to PR1 localization and repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SC2 binds PR1 through its S domain and interacts with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) through a novel RNA-binding region (R). Targeting SC2 to chromatin involves the action of MB domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PR1 through the S domain. Deletion of R reduces SC2 occupancy at target genes and overexpression of mutant SC2 lacking R causes PR recruitment defects.

 SC2 appears to enforce repression at a subset of genes independent of PR1, through unknown mechanisms. The identification of SC2 as a Polycomb protein that binds and contributes to repression of Poly targets sheds light on the interplay between ncRN and epigenetic regulation and combinator factors that drive specificity of Poly complexes in different contexts. Results show RNA plays a role in SC function, required for localization to chromatin. In flies, interaction of SCM and PR relies on C-terminal S domain, and results show similar mechanism conserved in humans.

Data support a model where R contributes localization of SC2 to chrom, where interacts PR and creates chrom environment refractory to transcription. SC is a Poly protein and binds at least Poly target in flies. A novel R in SC contributes chrom localization with recognition of methylines by MB domain, RNA activity required to recruit or stabilize SC on chrom. SC is retained at genes through interaction with PR and contributes stabilizing PR. Experiments conclude SC recruited to subset through process requires RNA activity and presence mutant SC2R not chrom-bound causes release BMI and presumably PR from chrom.
Scientists have long known that the ribosome, a crucial component of gene expression, can be stalled by a protein called SecM in E. coli. coli. This stalling affects the Sec-dependent secretion pathway, but the exact mechanism was unclear. Researchers used cryo-electron microscopy to study Sec-stalled ribosomes at 3.3-3.7 angstrom resolution, revealing two stalling mechanisms at different elongation steps. The first, the ribosomal peptid-transfer center is inactivated, preventing peptide formation with incoming proly-tRNA. The second, peptid-RNA stays at the A site, blocking full tRNA translocation. These findings show how regulatory peptides control translation by reshaping the ribosome's functional center.

To understand Sec-dependent stalling, researchers purified Sec-stalled ribosome complexes from E. coli in vitro and analyzed using single cryo-EM. Their near-atomic analysis revealed two stalling mechanisms and SecM peptide's role in distinct steps. Previous studies showed ribosomes stalled through various ways, including antibiotics. This work provides new details on SecM's role in stalling translation.

Two Sec-stalled ribosome forms were found: post-state and hybrid. Interactions between Sec and the tunnel induced conformation changes, locking the pept-transfer center in an inactive state. This stalling peptide formation and tRNA translocation. Sec's tRNAas peptide position is similar to active ribosomes. Comparing st and active ribosomes, an alternative stalling mechanism was found in Sec-stalled ribosomes.
Researchers have used a new technology called Adaptive Optics Scanning Ophthalmoscopy to image the cone cells in the center of the eye, known as the fovea, in 28 eyes of 16 people. They measured the density of these cells and other metrics in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The study found that the fove cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fove, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite a decrease in cones per square millimeter, myopes have a higher angular density of cones per degree in the fove compared to emmetropes, suggesting better visual acuity. Reports of deficits in best-corrected fove vision in myopes compared to emmetes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during my progression.

The study aimed to investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density at the fove center. Two types of densities were discussed: angular and linear. Previous studies found myopic deficits implicated retinal stretching as a cause, but what happens structurally at the fove center during myopic progression was unknown. Myopes have higher fove photoreceptor sampling with potential for better performance on tasks compared to emmetes. The simplest explanation for visual deficits in myopes increased between cones caused by ret stretching would be ruled out.

Adaptive optics offers high-quality images of the fove photore mosaic in vivo. Despite advances, previous studies investigating packing and length did not measure at the fove center, the most important for vision but difficult to image due to small photore size. If enlargement matched stretching, eyes would sample the field similarly. In fact, myopes attain good acuity with correction.
Researchers have identified the genetic factors that contribute to the duration of pneumocococcal carriage in the nasopharynx, a prerequisite for invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. They developed a model to calculate carriage duration from longitudinal swab data and combined it with whole genome sequence data. The study found that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the variation, while host traits like age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The researchers partitioned heritability into lineage and locus effects and found that serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other locus (7%) were the largest sources of variation. A genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences associated with decreased carriage, independent of serotype, potentially disrupting the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and resistance.

The study found that genetic factors other than serotype affect carriage duration, consistent with previous work. They identified alleles in a natural population and candidates for loci that play this role, suggesting variants in the pneumoc genome alter carriage linked to antibiotic resistance. The pneumoc genome sequence explains most variability (63%), with ser and erythromycin resistance (19%) and prophage presence (7%) contributing. The study shows transmission pairs share carriage duration and differences between and within serotypes. Prophage effect on duration has implications for pneumoc genome diversification through frequent loss during carriage. The study estimates heritability may differ with environmental conditions like host status.
Researchers have investigated the stoichiometry of the slow rectifier current (IK) channel, which plays a crucial role in cardiac repolarization. The channel is composed of the α-subunit KCNQ and β-subunit KCNE. The number of β-subunits associated with the α-sub has been debated, with some studies suggesting a fixed 2:4 ratio and others a variable up to 4:4. To clarify this, the researchers created fusion proteins linking KCNE to one, two, or four KCN1 subunits. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings showed that two or four KCN1 subunits resulted in hyperpolar activation, reduced conductance, and shorter latency compared to one KC1. Additionally, using unnatural amino acid photo-crosslinking, they found that two or four KC1 sub crosslinking rates were slower than KC1, indicating no intrinsic limit to four β-sub association within the IK complex. This suggests flexibility in KC1 β-sub association allows for modulation of repolarization in the heart through changes in expression. In the heart, KC1 and KC1 conduct the slow rect current IK, primarily responsible for stabilizing repolar and shortening action potential at high rates. The stoichi can be regulated based on availability, altering the channel composition and overall kinetics. Other β-subunits, KC1-5, can be expressed in cardiomyocytes. This study aimed to clarify the issue using fusion channels with KC1 linked to one, two, or four KC1. The complexes were evaluated in mammalian cells using whole patch, single recordings and unnatural amino approaches.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called interleukin-1 beta (Ilb) plays a crucial role in the regeneration of zebraf fish fins after injury. They found that Ilb is produced by two types of cells: myoid cells and epithelial cells. Myoid cells were previously thought to be the main source of Ilb, but this study shows that epithelial cells also produce Ilb in response to tissue damage. The researchers also found that macrophages, a type of immune cell, are necessary to resolve Ilb and inflammation for regenerative cells to survive.

The study reveals that Ilb and inflammation act like a double-edged sword: they are needed for regeneration, but too much can harm it. Excessive Ilb and inflammation can lead to apoptosis, or cell death, of regenerative cells. The researchers showed that Ilb expression and inflammation are tuned by macroages to ensure proper regeneration. Macrophages have been shown to be important in tissue regeneration before, but their function was unknown. This study is the first to show their role in attenuating Ilb expression and inflammation during regeneration.

Ilb is produced by epithelial cells in response to tissue injury and is necessary for regenerative cells to survive. If Ilb action is prolonged, apoptosis occurs. Macrophages are responsible for Ilb attenuation and inflammation resolution. Data suggest normal Ilb expression and inflammatory response are necessary for regeneration to activate regeneration-induced genes. This supports the idea that excessive Ilb and inflammation cause apoptosis in mutants. Myoid cells are essential for survival of regenerative cells and have been shown to transiently migrate to injured fin.

Ilb plays a role in normal regeneration by activating regeneration-induced genes. This study highlights Ilb and inflammatory response in regeneration. Proper Ilb expression and response, tuned by macroages, are necessary for tissue progression.
Researchers studied how proteins move in the cytoplasm of three types of bacteria: Escheria coli, Lactoccus lactis, and Haloaxii. They found that proteins with a positive charge on their surface move much slower than those with a negative charge. This is because they interact with ribosomes, the cell's protein-making factories, which slows them down. This effect is stronger in E. coli than in L. lactis and H. volcanii due to less electrostatic screening. In E. coli, positive proteins diffuse up to 100 times slower than negative ones, while in L. lact and H. volcan, the difference is smaller. The interaction with ribosomes also affects protein synthesis, slowing it down the assembly or activity of the ribosomes. Many ribosomal proteins in E. coli have a positive charge, which would make them diffuse slower. The researchers analyzed the proteomes of these bacteria and four endosymbiotic bacteria to understand how proteins move in relation to their composition and how ribosomes affect their movement. They found that ribosome properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome, the set of proteins in the cell.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the ability of certain animals, such as planarians, to regenerate lost body parts. However, the mechanisms behind this process are not well understood. Planarians can regenerate entire bodies and respond differently to wounds depending on the amount of tissue lost. A key question is how these responses are triggered. Researchers have identified a protein, S-follatin, required for planarian regeneration. Sollatin blocks responses to missing tissue but not normal tissue turnover. Two activin proteins, S-activ-1 and Sactiv-2, are needed for Soll phenotype. Soll is induced and expressed at higher levels after injuries causing tissue loss. This suggests Soll inhibits activin to trigger regeneration following tissue loss and identifies a mechanism for initiation across the animal kingdom.

 Studies have shown that animals distinguish between injuries with varying tissue loss and regulate distinct responses. Researchers found Soll required for molecular and cellular missing-tissue responses during regeneration. Follatin inhibition of activin is needed for regeneration to occur, with Soll expression controlled by tissue absence following injury. A gene encoding a T-β inhibitor, follatin, is required for regeneration and regeneration-specific responses. Data suggest inhibition of activin by S is required for regenerative response following major injury. Soll is wound-induced, with high levels persisting longer after major injury.

Planarians are exceptional regenerative animals with distinct programs for simple and missing tissue injuries. In substantial tissue loss, they mount mitotic and apoptotic responses and extended gene expression. Researchers propose wound-induced Soll for regenerative responses as a consequence of tissue. Soll is the first required for regeneration-specific in planarians. Not all missing-t responses are abolished following inhibition. Neoblast migration to amputation occurred normally in S RNA animals, despite absence proliferative response.
Researchers have identified a unique genetic signature in tumors that are deficient in mismatch repair (MMR), a process that fixes DNA errors during replication. This signature is distinct from other tumor genomes but similar to normal human DNA, suggesting that many genetic variations arise from errors in MMR. They also found a set of recurring deletions that can detect microsatellite instability (MSI), a hallmark of MMR-deficient tumors. Using endometrial tumors with proven MMR deficiency, they developed a new marker that detects MSI with greater specificity and sensitivity than standard tests. Additionally, deletions are enriched in DNA repair by homologous recombination, which is reduced in M-deficient tumors, making them sensitive to double-strand break inducers.

Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing confirmed the MMR-deficient signature in 28 tumor-normal pairs, 22 of which were M-deficient. Indels were validated using orthogonal technologies. Focusing on clinical relevance of indel patterns to diagnose MSI, deletions affected hommer stretches, relevant to the Bethesda panel of microsat and hommer markers. Ex-sequencing tumor and normal DNA showed M-def tumors had 5 somatic events, 39 for M-prof (52 increase). Validation rates were 87 and 86 for substitutions and indels.

This study provides a comprehensive picture of mutations in M-def tumors and their clinical relevance to diagnosing and targeting. M-def.
Researchers have developed a new tool called "Magnets" that allows for precise control over biological processes in cells without harming them. Magnets are small modules made from a protein called Vivid that can be activated by light. They consist of two parts, nMag and pMag, which are well-tolerated and can be fused with other proteins. When exposed to light, they interact and form a dimer, allowing for precise control over where and when they work. However, previous versions of Magn required concatemerization and preincubation at 28°C to function.

To overcome these limitations, the researchers engineered a new pair of Magn, called eags, that don't need concatization or preincation. They tested eags by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, induce organel contacts, and reconstitute OS-VAP-ERgi tether involved in phosphatidyositol-4-phosphate transport. eags are a powerful tool for optogenetically manipulating physiological processes in cells or small subcell volumes.

The eags were made by introducing complementary charges to the Viv dimer, creating nMag and pMag. They are small, fast-associating and dissociating, and can be fused with various proteins. The eags have greater thermal stability, dimer efficiency, and faster association and dissociation kinetics. They were effective in recruiting proteins to different organelles, generating organel contacts, and reconstituting V-dependent organel tethers involved in lipid transport.

The researchers aimed to create a pair with greater dimer efficiency, allowing single copies to suffice. They screened for reconstitution using light-dependent protein accumulation at the mitochondrial membrane, visible and quantifiable. Then, they redesigned Magn by optimizing charge-complement amino acids at the Viv dimer interface, guided by the light-activated dimer structure. They tested on mitochondria as a testbed. Magn have rapid association and dissociation kinetics, making them suitable for optogen modulation of small and subcell organelles.
Researchers have discovered a new link between stalled ribosomes and neuron death in the brain. Ribosomes are the cellular machines that translate genetic code into proteins. When they stall, or get stuck, it can lead to neuron death. However, the signals that trigger this process were unknown. Scientists studied mice with a genetic mutation that causes ribosomes to stall. They found that a protein called GC2 is activated in these mice before neuron death. GC2 activates a pathway that helps cells respond to stress. This pathway is called the integrated stress response. The researchers found that this pathway reduces neuron death in the mice. They also found that GC2 is activated by stalled ribosomes in a way that doesn't need tRNA, a key component of ribosomes. This suggests a feedback loop between ribosome stalling and initiation of translation, the process of making proteins. The study suggests that stalled ribosomes can activate GC2 in other conditions, like amino acid deprivation, where tRNA levels are low. The exact mechanism of GC2 activation by stalled ribosomes is unclear.
Over the past century, adult height has changed unevenly across the world's countries, with no indication of convergence. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was approximately 19 cm for men and 20 cm for women a century ago, and remained the same for women, increasing for men later despite changes in country rankings. The largest gains in height occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (17.5-22.7) and 16.5 (13.3-19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in height in some sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia countries. The tallest men were born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, averaging 182.5 cm, while the shortest were born in Guatemala in 1896, 140.3 (135.8-144.8) cm. The gap between the tallest and shortest populations remained the same for women and increased for men despite changes in country rankings.
Researchers have identified two key areas in the brain that contribute to opioid-induced respiratory depression, a major cause of opioid overdose deaths in the US. Between 1999 and 2017, opioid overdose rates quadrupled, resulting in 130 deaths per day. The brain's breathing circuitry, specifically the brainstem, is responsible for this effect. By eliminating the µ-opioid receptor, researchers pinpointed the preBötzinger Complex, where breathing rhythm originates, and found 70-140 neurons in this region are sensitive to opioids. These neurons may lead to new therapies that prevent respiratory depression without analgesia.

 Studies show that Opr1 glutamatergic preöC neurons mediate this effect, with 70 glutamateric neurons sufficient to rescue opioid depression of preö rhythm. Given the importance of Db1 neurons in rhythm generation, researchers hypothesize opioids silence presynaptic release, removing these neurons from the network. Alternatively, a subset of preö excitatory neurons may generate inspiratory rhythm, with Opr1 enriched in this subgroup.

Opr1 is expressed in central and peripheral nervous systems, including brainstem, respiratory centers, motor neurons, and sensing afferents. Among two sites studied, one is dominant, driven by 140 neurons in vitro, not required for opioid-induced analgesia. Deleting µ-opi receptor from both sites eliminates opioid-induced respiratory depression, even at high doses of fentanyl. Targeting these sites rescues respiratory depression, with remaining effect due to incomplete transduction or minor sites.
Researchers have identified sodium taurochotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as a functional receptor for human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite virus (HDV). HBV and HDV infections are major public health concerns, and individuals co-infected with HDV have more severe disease. The viruses enter cells through HB envelope proteins, specifically the pre-S domain of the large protein. However, the identity of the receptor was unknown. Using near-distance photo-crosslinking and affinity purification, researchers found that pre-S interacts with NT, a transmembrane transporter mainly in the liver. Silencing NT inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NT expression made hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viruses. Replacing amino acids 157-165 of nonfunctional monkey NT with human counterpart conferred ability to support viral infections. Results show NT is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.
Sepsis leads to lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections. The impact of sepsis on memory CD8 cells has been studied, but the extent to which they recover after seps was unknown. Researchers found that memory CD8 cells from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. Using a mouse model of seps, they showed that this proliferation is linked to recovery of pathogen-specific memory CD8 cells after seps-induced lymphopenia. This leads to changes in the composition and localization of memory8 cells. Further, CD8 cells from seps survivors have an altered transcription profile and chromatin, indicating lasting cell changes. The seps-induced changes in the memory8 cell pool and transcription landscape result in altered cell function and reduced capacity to control infection.

The study found that seps leads to a lasting change in the composition of memory8 cells in seps survivors. This is due to proliferation in the lymphopen environment after seps, seen in patients and mice, where central memory cells have higher proliferative capacity than effector cells. This bias toward central cells alters localization of memory cells. The number of memory CD8 cells per blood was quantified, showing loss and recovery of CD cells in hosts, similar to prior reports of homeostatic proliferation after seps-induced lymphopen. Pre-existing cells numerically recover with time after seps, potentially due to increased response to seps-induced lymphopen environment.

The data demonstrate preferential proliferation by central cells alters composition and localization of pre-existing cells after seps. Pre-existing differences in biology central and effector cells are the mechanism by which central cells become overrepresented in pre populations after seps. This reinforces observation of seps accelerating time-dependent changes in composition of memory pool. The capacity of memory cells to undergo T-dependent adhesion and immunosynapse after seps was assessed. Using samples from septic and models, increased proliferation of cells, particularly central, was found. As a consequence, there is remodeling of memory pool.
Researchers have long known that the LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposon poses a threat to human genomes by causing mutations. To prevent this, cells have evolved strategies to regulate L1 retroposition. One such strategy involves the APOB3 (3) family of enzymes, which deaminate cytosine to uracil in single-strand DNA. Among these, APO3A (3) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retroposition in cell assays. However, previous studies did not detect deamination in L retroposition events with A3 present. The mechanism of A3 inhibition remained unclear. This study used in vitro and in vivo assays to show A3 inhibits L retroposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA during L integration. This explains how A3 cytosine deaminase inhibits L retroposition.

In cultured cells co-expressing A3 and uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (U), L retroposition events contained strand-specific A3-mediated C-to-U deamination. This indicates A3 can inhibit L retro by deaming transient exposed single-strand during L integration. Previous studies showed overexpressing wild-type (WT) APO3 cyine deaminase (3) inhibited L retro in cells, but not deamin-deficient A3 mutants. However, deamination was not detected in L events with WT3. The mechanism of WT3 inhibition remained a mystery. This study used the L Element Amplification Protocol (LEAP) to elucidate A3 inhibition. Degradation of deamin retrointermediates reduced L levels in cell assays, potentially eliminating A3 events in resultant L sequences. This could explain previous failure to detect A deamination in engineered L events.

Deamination of single-strand in pre-integration site leads to TSD in post-integration. Stable U expression alleviates A3 inhibition, reducing L retroposition.
Researchers have identified a molecule called Rem2 that plays a crucial role in how the brain's visual circuits adapt to changing sensory experiences. This molecule helps regulate the excitability of neurons, which is the ability of neurons to fire electrical signals. Without Rem2, the brain's ability to adapt to new visual experiences is impaired, specifically during a critical period of development. At the cellular level, Rem2 acts independently to control the excitability of a type of neurons called layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, before affecting how they connect with other neurons. This leads to increased spontaneous firing of these neurons in the absence of Rem2. The study suggests Rem2 is a key player in regulating excitability and circuit function in response to sensory experiences.

Rem2 is part of a network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity to maintain proper circuit function. Further research on Rem-dependent mechanisms will reveal how activity-dependent modifications of neural circuits. The findings raise the possibility Rem may regulate the responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation, such as through excitability or synaptic scaling. To understand the mechanisms behind observed plasticity deficits in Rem- mice, researchers examined adult plasticity. Rem functions as a regulator of experience-dependent plasticity at morphological, cellular, and circuit levels, connecting molecular regulators of morphology with broader function.

Rem expression is regulated by visual experience, so researchers investigated its role in activity-dependent processes in the cortex following sensory deprivation by ocular dominance plasticity. The activity-regulated Ras Gase Rem2 links neural activity with plasticity. Rem is a member of the Rad/Rem/Gem/K family, a subfamily of Gases regulated by activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated channels.
Researchers have been investigating how magnetic fields affect biological molecules and cells, following reports of magnetism in living systems. Studies have identified a protein that acts like a compass to guide animal orientation (Qin Qin et al, 2016) and magnetic control membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel and tugging it with a magnetic field (Stanley et al, 201; Wheeler et al 2016). However, these claims conflict with basic laws of physics, with discrepancies of 5-10 orders of magnitude. If true, they must have different causes. The paramagnetic nature of protein limits its utility for magnetically sensitive cells.

The forces or torques and temperatures produced are too small to affect molecular orientation or membrane channels. If true, rely on a different mechanism. Without new discoveries about matter, magnetetics based on pulling or heating ferritin with fields have no chance. A study designed a system to couple magnetic fields to current across the membrane, a protein with a mechano-sensitive channel (TR4) fused to ferritin. Results suggest neural activity can be modulated by magnetic fields, but evidence is scant. Ferritin is a large complex with 24 subunits, 12 nm in diameter.

There's interest in magnetic effects on cells. Magnetosensation, how organisms sense the Earth's field for navigation, is unresolved. Magnetetics, making cells responsive to fields for control, is promising. Magnetos in animals may rely on magnetite or magnetic molecules in reactions.
Researchers have studied how stem cells in fruit flies called neuroblasts switch between states of self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence. They found that a protein called Prospero is involved in this process. When neuroblasts enter quies, Prosper is detected in the nucleus for a short time, followed by changes in the cell's molecular profile that shows it's no longer a stem cell or differentiating. A low level of Prosper in the nucleus happens before neurobl enter quies, even if the timing of quies is changed. Losing Prosper prevents neuroblasts from entering quies, but a low level of Prosper can make proliferating neuroblasts enter quies. The researchers propose that Prosper levels of the protein determine the cell's fate: absent for self-renew, low for quies, or high for differentiation.

The study used fruit fly neuroblasts as a model to understand how cells switch between states. They found that nearly all quies neurobl at 12 hours after induction reactivated and expressed stem cell markers. A low level of Prosper can also advance the timing of quies. This suggests that low Prosper is enough to induce quies.

The researchers looked at how Prosper is involved in neuroblast quies. They found that a pulse of Prosper matches the timing of neuroblast quies, happening earlier in some mutants and later in others. This suggests a relationship between Prosper and neuroblast quies.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the process of HIV-1 capsid disassembly, a crucial step for the virus to release its genetic material into the host cell. They used single-molecule microscopy to observe the disassembly of hundreds of individual HIV-1 capsids after the viral membrane is removed. This allowed them to see the effects of different molecules binding to the capsid on the disassembly process.

The first step in disassembly is the opening of a defect in the lattice, which is the rate-limiting step. This is followed by a rapid collapse of the capsid. The molecule PF74 accelerates the opening of the caps but stabilizes the remaining lattice. In contrast, binding to a polyanion to a conserved arginine in the lattice delays disassembly but does not prevent it. This suggests that different stages of disassembly can be controlled by the interplay of different caps-binding molecules.

The researchers found that caps-binding molecules have different effects on the initiation and continuation of disassembly. The HIV-1 caps is structurally heterogeneous, with various shapes and defects. They developed an in vitro single-molecule imaging assay to follow the disassembly of individual caps. This type of analysis can resolve intermediates in the pathway that are averaged in traditional ensemble measurements. By observing individual caps, they can classify them according to their dis behaviors.

The majority of HIV-1 caps contain defects and disassemble immediately after membrane removal. In the absence of binders, disassembly is an all-or process that proceeds after a defect is created. The half-life of caps is long enough to use permeabilized particles as a platform to quantify binding of proteins to viral caps at single level. They demonstrated this by adding labeled to the caps and following fluorescence using dual-color microscopy.
Researchers have investigated the role of the JUN-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in breast cancer development. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and analysis of breast cancer DNA shows frequent loss-of-function mutations in J components of the J pathway. Unexpectedly, J signaling can promote cell growth by activating the AP transcription factor AP1. The study examined the effect of J deficiency in mouse breast epithelial cells. Loss of J caused genomic instability and cancer development. Moreover, J deficiency led to rapid tumor formation in a mouse model of breast cancer. This suppressive function was not due to J's role in tumor growth, but its requirement to prevent initiation. Data identify J pathway defects as driver mutations that promote instability and initiation.

Loss of J signaling in mammary cells caused breast cancer, and accelerated tumor formation in a mouse model. Effects of J deficiency to promote development were associated with presence of neoplas and instability. Show J plays a role in initiation of development. The significance of J pathway inactivation in cancer is unclear, but loss promotes murine cancer. Frequent J loss-function mutations in human cancer may represent driver mutations that promote development. Find that J plays a role at early stages of development by promoting gland neoplas. This likely accounts for effect of mutational inactivation to promote development.

The J pathway may be suppressed in many cancers. Association of cancer with reduced signaling is a correlation. The purpose was to test role J in development. J causes AP transcription activation, anticipated to promote growth.
Researchers have identified a crucial enzyme called peptidglycine-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) that plays a key role in the formation of cilia, tiny hair-like structures on the surface of cells. Cilia are essential for sensing the environment and movement of cells. The study found that P is required for normal assembly of motile cilia in Chlamdomonas, a single-celled organism, and mice. Without P, Chdomonas failed to form cilia beyond a certain point and had abnormal cell structures. Similar results were seen in planaria, a type of flatworm, and mouse embryos. P is also important for primary cilia on nerve cells in mice. The study suggests that P's activity and its role in moving proteins within cells contribute to cilia formation. This is a new link between P and cilia assembly in different types of cells. P may have been involved in signaling in early stages of cilia formation in ancient cells. The research shows that P's role in cilia is conserved, meaning it's important in multiple types of cells.
Myosin III (My3) and actin bundling protein Espin play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells, and defects in these proteins cause hereditary hearing impairments. My3 interacts with Espin through its tail homology motif (TH), but it was unclear how My3 acts through Espin to regulate actin assembly and stabilization. Researchers discovered that My3 TH contains a pair of sequences capable of strongly binding Espin's ankyrin repeats, revealing an unexpected My3-mediated crossing mechanism of Espin. The My3-Espin complex structures elucidate the binding mechanism and reveal My3-induced Espin autoinhibition release. My3 crossing also promotes actin bundling activity of Espin.

My3 can release Esp's autoinhibition and increase diameter of Esp-promoted actin bundles, according to previous research. My3 and Esp1 co-localize at stereilia hair cell tips, and co-expression of My3 and Esp1 stimulates stereilia elongation in cultured Corti cells. A key function of My3-Espin is to form thicker actin fibers in cellular structures like stereilia. The TH mediates My3 binding to Esp, allowing My to transport Esp to actin-based structures like filopodia and stereilia. Once localized, Esp promotes elongation of actin protrusions. However, the molecular basis of My3-Espin interaction was unclear.

Researchers found that My3's motor domain binds actin filaments, and the full My-Espin complex has higher actin bundling activity than the My-AR-Espin complex. This study reveals a direct myosin-induced bundling regulation mechanism of actin crosser protein Espin. Genetic findings point to Esp's roles in stereilia development and maintenance, promoting assembly and stabilization of actin bundles in stereilia. My3 and Myb contain similar sequences in TH, each capable of binding Espin with high affinity.
Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in the functioning of excitable cells, such as neurons and heart and skeletal muscles, by translating membrane depolarization into calcium influx. These channels contribute to cellular excitability and couple electrical activity to fundamental functions like muscle contraction, neurotransmitter secretion, and gene regulation. They form a structurally related channel superfamily with voltage-gated sodium channels, having a fourfold symmetry.

To understand how these channels sense voltage, researchers combined modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage sensing domains (VSD) of the eukotic calcium channel Ca1.1. Both SDs displayed features of the sliding helix model, but differed in ion-pair formation of outer charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced voltage of activation, while stabilization of resting slowed kinetics.

This mechanism explains how ionair formation in SDs can realize characteristic properties of voltageated cation channels. The study fills a gap in understanding the voltage mechanism of eukotic voltageated cation channels. Tested interactions suggested by the model showed predicted effects on channel when experimentally tested by mutagen and electrophys analysis. Alterations of kinetic properties recognized experimentally were reproduced and explained by the model. Structures of lowest energy states Ca1.1 SD display features of sliding helix model.

Researchers used Rosetta modeling to build a homology of human eukotic Ca1, based on the cry-EM of Ca1 (Wu et al, 2016; Wu et al,201). They generated a new model to study mechanisms determining specific properties of voltageated channel. The study used modeling, mutagen, and electrophys to analyze structures, free, energy, and kinetics of activated and resting states of Ca1 VSD.
Researchers studied the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the adult brain's ability to change and adapt, a process known as plasticity. This is important for recovery from injuries and learning. They found that MMPs are crucial for plasticity in the visual cortex, a part of the brain responsible for processing visual information. However, when the brain is injured, MMPs can promote the spread of damage and hinder recovery. To understand this, they examined the effect of MMP inhibition on plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected mice. In healthy mice, a 7-day MMP-inhibition prevented plasticity, while treatment with MMP-inhib once after stroke rescued lost plasticity. This suggests an optimal level of MMPactivity is necessary for adult plasticity to occur.

The study highlights MMP's critical role in adult plasticity and that upregulation of MMP after a lesion compromises visual plastic, which can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. Precise regulation of MMPactivity is essential for plastic in the adult brain, offering new treatment opportunities for recovery after stroke. A single treatment after stroke rescued plastic in both paradigms, while two treatments diminished plastic-promoting effect. These data reveal MMP's crucial role in adult plastic and suggest MMPactivity must be within a narrow window for plastic to occur.

The study aimed to determine if MMPs are crucial for adult plastic and if inhibition of upregulation after stroke is beneficial for rescuing plastic. Combination of in vivo imaging and behavioral tests showed an optimal MMPactivity is essential for plastic in healthy and stroke-affected brains. Data demonstrate MMP's vital role in adult cortex plastic, particularly for increased open responses in V1 after MD, expanding previous studies from juvenile rats. Under normal conditions, MMP supports brain development and function, yet different MMP action is described in diseased brain. Increased MMP was observed 24 hours after photothromically induced stroke, and broad MMP-inhib at stroke partially rescued impaired plastic. They tested if stroke-induced visual plastic can be rescued by inhibiting MMP after stroke.
Researchers have used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of AMPA receptors, a type of glutamate-gated ion channel found at excitatory synapses in vertebrates. These receptors are made up of four subunits that assemble as dimers. The study found that these dimers can move laterally during activation, opening up the extracellular layer along the twofold symmetry axis. To understand how this movement, researchers used bifunctional methaniosulfate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations of AMP receptors with and without the auxiliary subunit Stargin. They found that the extracellular layer of AMP receptors can get trapped in stable, opened conformations when exposed to glutamate, but Stargin limits this flexibility. This suggests that under synaptic conditions where glutamate is brief and auxiliary proteins present, the extracellular domains of AMP receptors stay compact during gating.

The researchers conclude that the extracellular domains of AMP receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural changes during synaptic transmission and instead work in a compact conformation unless exposed to glutamate in pathological conditions. They also found that the presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Starg, affects the conformation flexibility of AMP receptors. Cryo-EM structures of AMP receptors with auxiliary subunits have been acquired in resting, active, and desensitized states. However, the dynamics of their signaling are unclear. AMP receptors are tetrameric lig-gated ion channels, consisting of three layers from distinct domains. The extracellular layers are formed from amino-terminal and lig-binding domains, which adopt dimer in resting and active receptors.

The study suggests that AMP receptors at synapses exposed to brief glut and complex with auxiliary units are unlikely to undergo conformation changes. The researchers used bifunction methanulfate crossers to calibrate conformations of AMP with and without Starg, finding that the extracellular can get trapped in opened when exposed to glut. In contrast, Starg limits this flexibility.
Researchers have developed a new method to isolate and analyze individual immune cells from the intestines of mice infected with a type of parasitic worm called helmin. This was challenging due to the strong immune response triggered by the parasite, which causes mucus production, tissue changes, and immune cell infiltration. The team optimized a digestion protocol to isolate millions of immune cells from the infected duodenum, a part of the small intestine. They used a high-dimensional flow cytometry to analyze the cells and confirmed their findings with confocal microscopy. This allowed them to identify hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the infection and has potential for single-cell discoveries of local helmin immune responses previously unfeasible.

To validate the protocol, they used a 23-color flow cytometry panel to characterize cells with surface and intracellular markers associated with helmin infections. The isolation and analysis revealed hallmarks of innate and adaptive anti-parite responses throughout helmin infection. Confocal microscopy confirmed these changes and observed differences in cell ratios between naive and infected samples. Importantly, many changes were local, highlighting the need for good cell techniques to investigate helmin responses directly.

The team quantified B220, Sig F, CD, CD, CD, and CD cells using confocal and compared to flow data. Difficulties with digestion during helmin infection are associated with anti-parite type 2 response driving mucus production, epithelium changes, immune infiltration, and tissue remodeling. The new protocol provides an accurate representation of intestinal responses to helmin.
Researchers have developed a new model to understand how the proteasome, a key enzyme responsible for breaking down proteins, works. The proteome's activity changes over time due to interactions with its substrates and products and regulatory sites. The model predicts where these interactions occur and is supported by experiments. The study found that the rate-limiting step of protein breakdown is transporting substrates into the proteome. Efficiency varies between standard and immune proteomes, affecting total breakdown and cleavage site usage.

The researchers used a combination of experiments and modeling to create a comprehensive model of proteome structure and function. Previous attempts to model proteome dynamics were incomplete due to complexity of peptide hydrolysis. They used short peptides with a single proteas-catalyzed cleavage site to follow kinetics in real-time. Proteome dynamics were observed over time using purified proteome and homogenates, where proteomes are surrounded by regulatory molecules. The model describes core proteome features that reflect proteome dynamics in complex cellular environments.

Polyubiquitin tagging and peptide hydrolysis regulate protein half-life, affecting many cellular processes. Despite efforts, mechanisms of proteomal action and differences in substrate proteysis between proteome isoforms are not fully understood. The proteome is dynamic, with activity changing over time due to substrate and regulatory site interactions. Kinetics change over longer scales than structural dynamics, influenced by substrate and product interactions.
Researchers have identified a new protein called Bala, or β-alanine transporter, that plays a crucial role in visual transmission in the fruit fly Drosila. This protein helps recycle β-alanine, a key component of the neurotransmitter histamine, which is essential for sustained synaptic transmission. In Drosila, histamine is rapidly taken up by glial cells, converted to carcinine, and then delivered back to photoreceptors, where it is hydrolyzed to histamine and βanine. However, it was unclear how βanine was returned to glial cells. The study found that Bala mutants had lower levels of βanine and less accumulation in the retina, and that Bala was required in retinal cells for visual transmission and photaxis. This suggests that retinal cells play a critical role in visual transmission and that a Bala-dependent βanine pathway is necessary for histamine homeostasis and transmission.

The researchers propose that Bala functions in retinal cells to recycle βanine. Disrupting histamine and carcinine synthesis abolishes photoreceptor transmission. Transport of βanine is important as it is present in higher concentrations in Dila. βanine recycling is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photore transmission. Establishing and maintaining a βanine pool are key in sustaining transmission. Most pigment granules, which reduce light intensity, are formed in retinal cells of Dila compound eye. High βanine levels in retinal cells suggest cells may be critical for transport and storage in this system.

To investigate, researchers sought a βanine transporter for Dila transmission. Efficient βanine systems compensate for β loss in hist to carcin conversion. Mutations in Bala disrupted βanine storage in retina, resulting in reduced photoreceptor activity and behavior. This suggests conserved function in βanine trafficking in mammals andila. The study, with previous reports, provides a complete histamine pathway for sustaining photore transmission. In this pathway, carcin is synthesized in epithelial cells optic lamina, transported to photore via synaptic cleft.
Researchers have been trying to understand the role of oxidants in aging for a long time, but the exact process is still unclear. A new study on yeast cells found that as they age, they experience a sudden loss of redox balance, affecting 80% of proteins with thiol groups. This is not due to an increase in internal oxidants as previously thought, but a drop in NAD levels, which helps maintain redox balance. NAD levels decrease early in aging, triggering a cascade that slows down cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a known to extend lifespan, increases NAD and delays this cascade. The study shows a timeline of events leading to widespread protein oxidation before cell death.

Aging is a condition that stresses the redox capacity of proteins. Oxidation of some proteins might also contribute to beneficial downregulation of processes that shorten lifespan. Yeast was used as a model to study aging. Early in the aging process, cells lose redox balance, with massive oxidation of most thiol proteins in cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria. The decrease in NAD and increase in red potential is not specific to yeast, but might be in other organisms with changing metabolism. Yeast undergo same NAD decrease, oxidation, red collapse when grown in low glucose.

A study on yeast aging cells found a global red collapse leading to oxidation of 80% proteins before cell death. Almost 300 proteins were monitored for thiol status. The study aims to find targets of oxidation contributing to aging and establish correlation between stress and lifespan. Yeast aging is a model for postmit cells.
Researchers have discovered the mechanism behind a crucial process called proofreading during translation of the genetic code, which ensures that only the correct amino acids are used to build proteins. This process is essential for cell survival as it prevents incorrect amino acids from being incorporated into proteins. The study focused on an enzyme called D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacyase (DTD) from the parasite Plasmodium falcum, which removes mischarged amino acids from tRNAs. The crystal structure of DTD with a substrate-mim analog revealed how it captures the chiral center of D-amacylRNA using an invariant cross-unit Gly-Pro dipeptide. No protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, but a unique side-chain mode of substrate recognition explains DTD's ability to act on multiple amino acids. This strict chiral specificity explains how the enriched pool of L-amacy-tRNAs escapes this proof step. The study provides insights into a fundamental enantio process and elucidates a chiral mechanism crucial in preventing amino acid infiltration during translation.

 The mechanism involves a side-free recognition, allowing DTD to deal with D-tRNAs. Weak hydrogen bonds play a crucial role in chirality selection. If L-amino acid binds, it would have to do so in one of three possible conformations. The study corrects earlier models based on docking approaches or structures with non-cognate ligands. DTD removes mischarged amino acids from tRN to prevent incorporation into proteins. It likely operates by recapturing amino-tRNAs from EFu. The amino recognition site captures atoms attached to the chiral C and cross-unit interactions, particularly Gly-Pro motif, play a central role. The amino moiety interacts with residues from both monomers.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of how the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel opens and closes. CFTR is a chloride channel that is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. In normal CFTR, the channel opens when two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) bind to ATP and dimerize, and closes when ATP is hydrolyzed. However, in some CF mutants, the channel opens without ATP and is stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CF potentiator. The study found that spontaneous openings are also coupled to NBD dimer, which can occur without ATP. This means that NBD and pore movements are intrinsic to CFTR, and ATP changes the stability, not the structure, of open and closed conformations. This explains effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF and drug mechanisms.

The study used single CF channels to correlate energetic coupling residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous opening and closure. They found that the pore is likely closed in a high-energy transition state for spontaneous openings. The presence of ATP does not alter global conformations, but acts as a "molecular glue" to stabilize the transition and open state.

CFTR is a chloride channel in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Phosphorylation of the cytosolic regulatory domain by cAMP protein kinase gates CF channels. The strict coupling between N and pore movements, regardless of ATP, constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent gating and driving forces, conserved among ABC proteins. It also explains modulatory effects of mutations or regulators.

In CF, the ligand site is occluded in open channels, so open-state binding cannot be defined. Disruption of hydrolysis forces CF to gate, following a linear sequence, not subject to balance. Low-probability ATP-independent openings of a construct lacking NBD can be linked to N dimer, but results argue that remaining N-T machinery undergoes similar movements to dimer when truncated.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism for how transmembrane proteins assemble in lipid bilayers, called the "pre-transition" or "orderobic" effect. This phenomenon occurs when a protein with a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase is embedded in an ordered bilayer, stabilizing a microscopic order-disorder interface. The stiffness of this interface is finite, and when two such proteins approach each other, they assemble by reducing the interfacial energy. This effect is analogous to the hydrophobic effect, but mediated by proximity to the order-disorder transition and the protein's hydrophobic mismatch. The strength and range of forces from this effect are larger than those from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered.

The orderobic effect depends on the protein's ability to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity, which depends on its proximity to the membrane's transition and its hydroobic mismatch. For example, a protein with a hydroobic thickness of 2.6nm will favor the disordered phase, while a larger protein can melt the ordered phase and form an order-dis interface. This phenomenon is predicted to be testable by single-molecule techniques. Biological membranes and transmem proteins are more complex, with multiple components allowing multiple order-dis transitions, and a dual orderobic effect where a protein in the dis phase can nucleate an ordered region and order-dis interface.

The orderobic effect arises from the regular packing of lipids in the ordered phase having a larger hydroobic thickness than the dis phase. This results in a smaller area per lipid in the ordered phase than dis. The researchers used large-scale simulations to show this effect and predict enhanced lipid mobility around orderobic proteins.
Researchers investigated the relationship between action potentials (APs) and fluorescence signals in genetically encoded calcium indicators in mice. They used two types of indicators, GCaMP6 and GCa6f, to image layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex while simultaneously recording cell-attached from transgenic mice. Most APs were detected under optimal conditions, but only a minority of 1 and 2 AP events were detected (less than 10% and 20-30 respectively) under typical population imaging conditions. This highlights the limits of detection under realistic imaging conditions.

The researchers characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function by identifying isolated AP events and summing them over 250ms. They found that only a minority of APs were used to construct AP-fluorescence curves. For GCa6, events were separated by 100 and 500ms, and for GC6 by 300ms. This study facilitates interpretation of existing and future imaging studies using transgenic lines, such as the Allen's Brain Observatory dataset. Previous studies showed most APs can be detected with GC6 under near-optimal conditions.

The researchers tested several spike models detecting AP under optimal and less optimal conditions. Their results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity and fluorescence, aiding interpretation of existing and future imaging datasets. Genetically encoded indicators are used with two-photon microscopy to report activity within populations. This approach is minimally invasive, enabling measurement from hundreds or thousands of neurons at single resolution over sessions.
Researchers have discovered a unique biological valve in the female genitalia of a cave-dwelling insect, Neotla, that allows it to receive multiple seminal packages from males. This valve is made up of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in- and out canals. Females have a penis-like intromitt organ to anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, which is formed by seminal injection. This capsule is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotla to mate while one slot is occupied. In conjunction with the penis, this valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal in nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation and multiple injections.

 Studies show that females of Neotla use a mechanism to control the direction of seminal flow. This valve allows them to receive two packages (nutrition) from the same or different males within a short time. In particular, the valve allows to receive a seminal while the first is consumed. With the valve, Neotla can use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other empty. This enables females to receive an additional package from same or other males using the empty slot. The presence of sperhe plate with valve to control flow may refine understanding of causes and consequences of reversed selection in genus. Female-female competition for males (sex reversal) to receive seminal is considered most factor driving evolution of female penis.
Researchers have studied the process of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, which is the release of neurotransmitters from nerve cells, and the role of a protein called Munc-1 in this process. They used a technique called optical tweez to observe the assembly of a protein complex called SNARE, which is crucial for exocytosis. They found that SN has three parts: N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal, and linker domains (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD). These domains have different functions: NT and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, while MD regulates SN assembly and fusion. Munc-1 initiates SN assembly and stabilizes the complex, independent of another protein syntaxin's regulatory domain. Without M-1, SN assembly and exocyt are impaired.

 Experiments showed that M-1 holds the SN complex together when it's unfolded, allowing it to reassemble. M-1 has three activities: enhancing de novo assembly, stabilizing the complex, and regulating interactions between SNs and membranes. The researchers propose a model for M-1's role in SN assembly and membrane fusion, suggesting it acts on intermediates to facilitate assembly.
Researchers investigated how integrin adhesomes, the protein complexes that help cells attach to their surroundings, assemble at adhesion sites on the cell surface. They used techniques like fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and recovery after photobleaching to study integrin adh components in the cytosol and their exchange with adhesion sites. They found that integrin adh is already pre-assembled in the cyol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. These blocks are released from stationary adhesion sites, keeping the cyolic pool of building blocks spatially uniform. This suggests a model where multi-protein blocks enable rapid assembly of adhesion sites and symmetric exchange of blocks preserves their specifications.

Integrin adh is extensively preassembled in the cyol, forming multi-protein blocks that facilitate rapid assembly of adhesion. Associations between adhesion components are spatially uniform around stationary adhesions, indicating they exchange blocks with cyol without altering. In the cyol, blocks cannot form bigger structures due to protein interactions. The plasma membrane system can switch to self-assemble adhesion by inducing additional interactions in integrh.

The cyol building blocks are size-confined and correspond to functional layers of adhesion anchoring, regulation, and actin regulation. Symmetric exchange between adhesion and cyol ensures blocks enter and exit sites unaltered.
Researchers have identified a new electrophysiological marker that can track states of reduced arousal in humans, including sleep and anesthesia. This marker, known as the 1/f slope of the electrophys power spectrum, reflects the non-oscillatory, scale component of neural activity and distinguishes wakefulness from propof anesthesia, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye (REM) sleep. Unlike REM sleep, which has a desynchronized, "wake-like" electroencephalogram (EEG), NREM and propof anesthesia are associated with synchronized oscillations in the EEG. The researchers used intracran and surface recordings from four independent data sets to demonstrate that the 1/f slope can discriminate wakefulness from REM sleep solely based on neurophysiological brain state.

The study found that the 1/f slope becomes more negative, or steeper, in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness. They also showed that the slope can distinguish wake from NREM as well as REM sleep. The researchers examined if this state modulation generalized to other forms of decreased arousal, such as sleep, and found that the slope can discern wake from different sleep stages. They analyzed two datasets from a full night of sleep and found that the frequency range is suited to track arousal in anesthesia and sleep, including REM and NREM. The slope mirrored changes in excitability over the course of slow waves, providing a mechanistic link between the slope and synchrony during oscillations.

The non-oscill, aperiod part of power, devoid of low-frequency components, can be approximated by 1 decay of power from 30 to 45 Hz and differentiates wake from three states of reduced arousal, REM, N sleep, and propof anesthesia. The 1 dynamics are observed across various tasks. Collectively, results from four studies provide main advances: the slope tracks arousal in propof and sleep with high precision and on timescales from sub-epochs to full recordings, and correlates with all stages of arousal.
Researchers have discovered that tiny extensions of chloroplasts called stromules play a crucial role in the plant's immune response to infection. These extensions, called stromules, connect with the nucleus and help move chloroplasts to the nucleus during an immune response. The study found that microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AFs) are involved in this process. MTs help stabilize stromules and increase their length, while AFs provide anchor points for stromules to attach to. Interestingly, the direction of stromules from chloroplasts matches the direction of chloroplast movement. This movement was observed even without an immune response, suggesting it's a general function in plant cells. The research suggests that MTs and AFs help cluster chloroplasts near the nucleus during an immune response. A model proposes that stromules extend along MTs, attach to AF points, and guide chloroplast to the nucleus during immunity.

The study analyzed the mechanism of strom extension and movement in chloroplasts of leaf tissue during immune response. Results showed MTs are necessary for strom extension and movement, while depolymerization led to retraction and stabilization increased frequency. Future research will investigate molecular components of strom dynamics and importance of clustering during immunity. The cytoskeleton in plant cells supports various functions, including streaming, division, elongation, growth, trafficking, positioning, and morphogenesis. This study shows stromules extend along MTs and AFs stabilize chloroplast-nuclear connections during immune response. Results show MT-mediated extension and AF-anchoring are complementary during strom formation and movement, providing insights into interactions with the cytoskeleton and stabilizing stromules. A new type of organellar movement along MT is strom-directed, revealing a mechanism for peruclear clustering during immunity.
Researchers have developed a new method to predict which amino acid residues in proteins interact with each other across protein interfaces. They used a statistical approach called pseudo-likelihood to analyze 50 ribosomal and 28 bacterial protein complexes with known structures and found that pairs of residues that covary are almost always in contact in the complex when there are enough aligned sequences. They applied this method to 36 protein complexes with unknown structures and created models for four of them: the tripart ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate form lyase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC transporter. 

The study found that residue-residue covariance can accurately predict protein-protein interactions given enough aligned sequences. In 64 complexes with unknown structures, they predicted residue-residue pairs for each complex. The pseudo-likelihood method predicted contacts for 36 evolutionarily conserved complexes with unknown structures and presented models for four well-constrained by data. In a set of complexes with known structures, covarying pairs are almost always in 3D structure with sufficient aligned sequences. Residue-residue covariance occurs frequently between interacting pairs but rarely between non-interacting, making it useful for predicting protein interactions.

This study expands on previous work using statistical models for coevolution contact across interfaces, which was limited to histidine kinase-regulator system. The new method can contribute to determining structures of biologically important complexes. Predicted residue-residue interactions for 36 complexes without structure had at least one prediction with GREIN score 0.85.
Researchers investigated how people categorize visual scenes by gathering information from multiple locations in the scene. They used a novel paradigm where participants' eye movements were tracked while performing a categorization task, and found that their paths followed an active strategy that incorporates prior knowledge of the scene's structure and statistical patterns. Notably, categorization performance improved when locations were revealed by an optimal Bayesian algorithm. By combining a Bayesian observer with the algorithm, they estimated that most of the apparent optimality of fixations came from biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements, and the process of selecting locations was 70% efficient in the task. The results suggest that eye movements aim to maximize information about categories requiring integration from multiple locations.

The study extends active sensing to tasks with non-spatial features, such as categories, and provides the first fixation-by-fixation analysis of information gathering under eye movements by matching the observer to participants' performance. It dissociates eye movement process from perceptual and decision processes, identifies sources of suboptimality, and quantifies efficiency of each fixation throughout the scene. The approach is applicable to various perceptual tasks.

To study eye movements quantitatively, efficiency was estimated on a fixation-fixation basis in a high-level task. A pattern categorization task was used, different from search, where a single location has all information, and movements are described by inhibition. Participants' movements were more efficient than strategies using a subset of active sensing and 70% as optimal with prior, perception, noise, and saccadic inaccuracies. Inspired, an experiment was designed with controlled patterns and simple, ensuring foveal vision dominated by a gaze-conting task tracking eye and successively small parts of the image at each location.
Researchers have studied how large molecules, such as viruses, RNAs, and ribosomes, are transported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). These molecules are too big to fit through the pore, but still manage to pass through intact. The study looked at 30 cargo models of different sizes, from 17 to 36 nanometers, with varying numbers of nuclear localization sequences (NLS). They found that transport requirements scale with size and can be explained by a two-parameter model that correlates import with the energy needed for transport. For smaller molecules, biochemical and physical properties of the surface influence transport. The study's principles could help understand export of large molecules, like ribosomal subunits and RNA complexes. The model assumes caps don't interact with each other during transport. Cargoes with NLS and nuclear receptors can enter the nucleus quickly. Several studies have looked at N-mediated transport, focusing on one to five NLS, showing mono-exponential behavior. The study reconstituted nucleocytoplasmic transport by adding key components: Importβ, Importα, RanG, NTF, and GTP. Transport across the envelope is crucial for eukaryotic cells and viability, with 200 NPCs in a typical HeLa cell.
Researchers have long known that the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 is crucial for the activation of helper T cells, but its role in maintaining T cell responses after activation was unclear. To investigate this, a strain of mice was created where CD28 was removed from CD4 T cells after priming. The study found that continued CD28 expression is essential for effector CD4 T cells following infection, particularly for the expansion of Th1 cells and differentiation and maintenance of follicular helper cells during viral infection. Additionally, CD28 is required for clearance of the bacterium Citrobacterium from the gastrointestinal tract. This demonstrates that CD28 persistence is necessary for helper cell polarization in response to infection, revealing a new function distinct from its role in cell priming.

The study shows that CD28 is necessary for CD4 T cell differentiation into effector subsets and demonstrates a previously unknown role for CD28 after cell activation. CD28 expression is required for Th1 expansion and Tfh differentiation and maintenance. Maintained CD28 is also required for clearance of enteropathic bacteria Citrobacterium after oral infection. This indicates CD28 expression is necessary for intact effector CD4 T responses during infection.

To determine if CD28 is important for bacterial infection, not just viral, mice were infected with Citrobacterium, a mucosal pathogen eliciting robust humoral and cellular response. CD4 cells play a key role in immunity to C. CD28 is essential for multiple facets of CD4 activation, including proliferation, survival, metabolism, and migration. CD-deficient mice have reduced effector CD4 expansion and do not form Th1 and Tfh cells after infection or immunization. Tfh requires CD28 during primed interactions with B cells and differentiated Tfh need CD for survival. Th1 do not require CD for maintenance but for expansion following activation. Mice unable to clear Citacterium from tract following oral infection.
Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that causes stomach infections, has a unique helical shape that allows it to efficiently colonize the stomach. However, the mechanisms behind this shape are not well understood. Researchers investigated how Helicobacter pylori maintains its diameter while keeping its curved shape. They used special probes to study how the bacteria's cell wall grows and found that growth occurs at both at the curved and straight parts of the cell. Two proteins, Mre and C, play a key roles in this process. M is more abundant at the curved parts of the cell, while C is more at the straight parts. When these proteins are altered, the bacteria loses its helical shape. The researchers propose a model where M and C promote growth at curved and straight parts of the cell, respectively. This patterning is necessary for maintaining the helical shape.

To study this, they used high-resolution microscopy and 3D analysis to show that growth is enhanced at curved and straight parts of the cell. They also looked at the localization of proteins M and C. They suggest M promotes growth at curved parts due to its preference for this shape in Helobacter pyl and its role in other organisms. To maintain curved shape in presence of M-driven straight growth, they propose Helobacter augments default pattern by growth at major area independent of M. Helobacter uses protein C to promote growth at straight parts and supplements M-enhanced growth at curved parts. This allows it to maintain curv in presence of M-enhanced synthesis.

In straight-shaped E. coli, M is at curved, while C is at straight where growth is enhanced. Both M and C help maintain growth and patter is one mechanism for helical shape. Researchers also investigated if wall growth during growth remains at major axis. They used tools to show Helob must broader distribution of curved than curved-rod bacteria and uses distinct mechanisms to achieve curv.
Researchers have identified a new function of the protein Cdc48 in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. C48 is a ubiquitin-selective chaper that orchestrates the activities of E3 ligases and deubiquilases (DUBs). The study found that C48 integrates the activities of two DUBs, Ubp12 and U2, which have opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion. U12 stabilizes pro-fusion ubiqulation on F1, while U2 facilitates removal of ubiquitin chains on F1 inhibiting fusion. C48 synergistically regulates the ubiqulation status of F1, controlling the balance between activation and repression of mitochondrial fusion.

The researchers conclude that this cascade ensures tight control of F1 ubiqulation levels, allowing mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiqulation that targets F1 for proteasomal turnover. The cascade between U12 and U2 also revises recent results linking U2 and M30. M30 catalyzes the formation of pro-fusion forms on F1. The study identifies a role of C48 in mitochondrial fusion as part of a novel enzymatic cascade of C48, U12, and U2. C48 negatively regulates U12, which negatively regulates U2, explaining the two Ds opposite effects on targets and ubiquostasis.

The Ds U12 and U2 cleave different forms of F1 that promote or repress mitochondrial fusion. Given U12 regulates U2, the two ubiqulation pathways are connected. Consistently, F1 U12 ubiqulation precedes U2 ubiqulation. Unopposed antiusion, as in Δ2 cells, disrupts tubulation. U12 recognizes chains on F1 composed of few ubiquitin moieties, proposing it does not stabilize substrates due to short ubiquitin chains. Both U12 and U2 deubiqulate F1, but bind different forms of ubiqulated F1. U12 binds forms that stabilize F and promote fusion, while U2 chains target F for proteomal and inhibit.
Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study how the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VC) responds to sounds in people who are blind and those who can see. They found that VC encodes sound categories in both groups using a similar representational structure and connectivity to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group using a representational format closer to the one in vision. Crucially, VC in the blind represents category membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. This suggests that sounds trigger categorical responses in VC of congenitally blind and sighted people that match the topography and functional profile of the response, despite nuances in categorical organization between modalities.

 Studies have shown that in absence of vision, the occipital cortex enhances response to non-visual processing. This study demonstrates that categorical organization similar to vision can emerge in VC without visual experience, and that categorical to sounds is enhanced and stable in congenally blind. Representational analysis showed that membership predicts represent structure of sounds in VC in blind, rather than lower-level acoustic attributes of category in temporal cortex.

The study found VC encodes categorical membership of sounds in both groups using topography, represent format, and represent connectivity similar to observed in vision. However, representation of auditory stimuli in VC of blind and sight individuals exhibits nuances compared to organization by visual in sight people. Overlap between groups may come from VC represents visual attributes in sight and acoustic in blind due crossmodal plasticity. Congenitally blind studies have shown occital represent acoustic features, such as frequencies.
Researchers have discovered a fungal pathogen, Entomophthora muscae, that manipulates the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly, in the laboratory. The fungus infects the fly and causes it to climb upward, extend its proboscis, fix in place, and raise its wings, creating a path for spores to launch from its abdomen. The fungus invades the fly's nervous system, suggesting a direct means to induce behavioral changes. The researchers believe this new system will help understand how the fungus manipulates host behavior.

To study this, they isolated and characterized the Entom mus strain and its impact on D melanogaster in the lab. They found the fungus invades the nervous system, granting direct access to neurons, which may be key to behavioral manipulation. However, they caution against jumping to conclusions and consider all possible ways the fungus alters behavior. Four mechanisms are proposed to achieve manipulation.

To test if the fungus infects hosts outside Drosidae, they exposed flies to infected melanaster using a modified protocol. Flies died and sporulated, indicating they were killed by the fungus. To understand how the fungus progresses in melan at the molecular level, they measured changes in host and fungus over 5 days. Due to complications, infected and uninf animals are indistinguishable early on, they used a mix of infected and uninf animals in each vial.

Similar behaviors are induced in dipterans by distantly related Zygomete fungi within the Entom mus species.
Researchers have mapped the locations of 30 RNA degradation factors in yeast cells to understand how RNA is broken down and regulated. They used a technique called PAR-CL to identify where these factors bind to different types of RNA. The results show that some factors prefer certain types of RNA and locations on transcripts. Comparing these profiles with other RNA-binding factors reveals clusters that some factors bind together or near each other.

The study found that factors involved in deadenylation, decapping, and exosome degradation bind differently to mRNAs. Modeling suggests most factors bind intact mRNAs, while decapping factors are only recruited when degradation starts. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRN with non-optimal codons, indicating rapid degradation of inefficiently translated mRN.

The nuclear surveillance machinery, including Nrd1/N3 and TR4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and snoRNAs. The study provides a resource for future research on eukotic RNA pathways and metabolism.
Researchers have discovered a new type of chromatin, called "kairostat," that plays a crucial role in the rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis plants in response to pathogen signals. Camalexin is a potent defense compound that can be induced by bacterial and fungal infections. The study found that camin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications: trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3me3) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 (H3ac). These modifications have opposite effects on gene expression, with H3me repressing and Hac activating. Mutants with reduced H3me or Hac showed that both modifications are required for the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of stress response. The study suggests that Hme-Hac bivalent chromatin, or kstat, controls the timely induction of gene expression upon stress in plants.
Researchers have identified a key role for the protein EZ2 in adult brain cells called astrocytes that help create new neurons. These cells, called neurogenic astrocytes, are found in a region of the brain called the subventricular zone (SVZ). They express EZ2, a protein that helps control gene activity by adding methyl groups to histones. Without EZ2, these cells can't make new neurons, but they can still multiply. The protein represses a gene called olig2, which is needed for neurons to form. EZ also stops other genes from being active that are not needed for neurons. In the human brain, EZ2 is also found in astrocytes in the SVZ, where new neurons are made after birth. This suggests EZ is important for making new neurons in the adult brain. The study found distinct roles for EZ2 in making new neurons from stem cells, which is important for regenerative medicine and cancer research.
Scientists have long known that viruses play a crucial role in shaping microbial communities and ecosystems, but studying their interactions with certain microorganisms has been challenging due to difficulties in growing them in the lab. Researchers used a technique called single-cell genomics to study viruses infecting uncultivated SUP bacteria in a marine oxygen-poor zone. They found that about one-third of these bacteria were infected with viruses, with higher infection rates where oxygen levels were lowest. They also discovered new types of viruses that infect SUP bacteria and how they interact with their hosts. Analysis of microbial and viral genetic material showed that these viruses persisted in the area for years, but remained specific to the oxygen-poor zone. Notably, they found that viruses encoded an enzyme that allows them to reprogram their host's energy production, suggesting a key role in modulating biochemical cycles in these critical ecosystems.
Researchers studied the role of TTC26/DY13, a protein involved in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) process, which assembles and maintains cilia/flagella in cells. IFT is a conserved mechanism involving over 20 proteins, but the functions of individual proteins are unclear. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, they found TTC26/DY13 is an IFT complex protein in mammalian and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. Knocking down TTC26Y13 in zebraf embryos or mutating TTC26Y13 in C reinhardt resulted in short cilia with motility defects. Surprisingly, IFT assembly and speed were normal in dy13 mutant flagella, unlike other IFT complex mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analysis showed specific proteins involved in motility were depleted in dy13 mutant. This suggests different IFT proteins transport different subsets of cargo, explaining IFT complexity.

TTC26Y13 is not required for ciliogenesis or IFT particle movement, but transports specific motility-related proteins into cilia. Unlike other IFT proteins, dy13 mutants have flagella, indicating dy13 is not necessary for cili formation. However, flagella are shorter with motility defects. Similar phenotypes observed in zraf when TTC26 was depleted. IFT movement normal in dy13 flagella, but inner arm components reduced in dy13 flag, indicating TTC26 role in transporting specific proteins. Proteomic analysis of flagellar proteins in dy13 supports TTC26 function in transporting motility-related proteins.

IFT56 is conserved in most ciliated organisms, but its role unclear. Knocking down I56 in zraf embryos and reinhardt dy13 cells showed motility defects. Unlike other I proteins, TTC26 is not for cili or I assembly, but transports specific proteins into cilia.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) promote melanoma metastasis, or the spread of cancer cells to distant parts of the body. They found that when melanoma cells interact with LEC, they become more invasive and spread to other parts of the body. This is due to the activation of two proteins: matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14) and Notch3, and integrin β1. These proteins help melanoma cells grow and spread in three-dimensional matrices, or 3D, and are necessary for metastasis, or cancer spread, in mice and zebraf xenografts, a type of animal model.

In experiments, melanoma cells were co-cultured with LEC in 2D and 3D, allowing researchers to study molecular interactions between cells and LEC. They found that LEC increased metastasis of melanoma xenografts in mice, which was dependent on MP14 and Not3. In mouse model, dissemination of metastatic melanoma cells to distant organs was increased by L priming. Researchers also found that LEC induced Notch activation in metastatic melanoma cells, which is important for cancer progression.

Notch receptors 1 and 3 are activated in melanoma, but mutations have not been identified. Upregulation of MP dependent Not3 may be important in metastatic melanoma progression. LEC also induced β-integrin activation in metastatic melanoma cells, required for 3D sprouting. Upregulation of Not3 upon L priming supports that L-melan interaction can reveal clinically relevant molecules for cancer dissemination and has potential for identifying pathways contributing to lymphatic metastasis melanoma.
Researchers have identified a key role for microRNA-9 (miR-9) in the development of dendrites, the branching extensions of neurons that receive signals from other cells. Mi-9 is one of the most abundant microRNAs in the brain, but its function in dendritic development was not well understood. To study mi-9's role, scientists created a mouse model that allowed them to turn off mi-9 in specific brain cells at specific times. They found that mi-9 controls dendrite growth and synaptic transmission, the process of sending and receiving signals. The team also found that mi-9's effect is mediated by downregulating REST, a protein that represses gene expression.

 The study focused on postmitotic neurons, cells that have already differentiated from stem cells. They found that mi-9 is essential for proper dendrite growth and synaptic transmission. Other microRNAs have been shown to influence dendrite growth, but mi-9's role is unique. The researchers used a new mouse model to monitor mi-9 activity in single cells and another to study its loss of function. They found that mi-9 is a key regulator of dendrite growth and synaptic transmission in postmit neurons.

 The study suggests that mi-9/REST regulation plays a role in mature neurons, not just during development. The team created a mouse that allows them to turn off mi-9 in specific cells at specific times. Analysis of this mouse revealed mi-9's role in postmit neurons as a regulator of dendrite through REST expression. The results indicate that mi-9's effects are cell-intrinsic and it plays a key role in dendrite development. Synaptic transmission was also impaired in mi-9 expressing mice.
Researchers have found that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties with social engagement, which can be measured using eye-tracking methods. However, it is unclear how these difficulties are linked to brain organization in the brain. A study using resting brain scans in a large group of toddlers with and without ASD found that ASD has less connection between brain areas involved in social thinking and visual attention. A subgroup of ASD with early social difficulties was found to have less connection between brain areas involved in social thinking and visual. Less connection between these areas was linked to more social difficulties, but only in this subgroup. Early connection between social and visual brain areas is a key feature of this subgroup and may be important for future social development and new treatments.

A simple eye test can identify this subgroup with high accuracy in early development. Social connection between brain areas is a key feature of this subgroup and may be important for social development. Although social difficulties are early signs of ASD, the reasons are not well understood. The study found that in early development, brain areas involved in social thinking are less connected to visual and attention areas. This is important because social difficulties are early signs of ASD and common in most toddlers.

The study suggests that some, but not all, differences in brain connection in ASD are due to social engagement in early. This supports that ASD in toddlers is characterized by less connection between brain areas in social thinking, visual, and attention. A simple and easy test can identify this subgroup, making it useful for clinical use. The study aimed to find how connection between brain areas, measured by brain scans, is affected in ASD and if social engagement is a reason for differences.
Researchers have discovered that Drosophila melanogaster's larval blood cells, called hemocytes, have a unique ability to differentiate into two types: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. These cells work together to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in the body. Plasocytes are similar to vertebrate macrophages and can multiply, but it was unclear how crystal cells increase in number. Scientists found that crystal cells in third instar larvae come from plmatocytes through a process called transdifferentiation, which requires Notch signaling and specific structures called hemocyte clusters. This is the first evidence of a hematopoietic tissue, or blood-making organ, in Dophila that relies on structure and signaling for homeostasis. This discovery sheds new light on Doph hematopoies and its similarities with vertebrate systems. 

In vertebrates, macrophages, a type of blood cell, specialize based on their environment. Similarly, Doph larvae's hemocyte clusters induce crystal differentiation from plmat through cell contact and Notch signaling. Studying hematopoiet organs is key to understanding how blood cells form and their numbers are controlled. Doph produces two types of mature hemocytes: plmat and crystal. Plmat are phagocytic, like vertebrate macrophages. The study aimed to explain the increase of crystal cells in Doph larvae, which is puzzling since mature cells haven't been seen dividing during larval stages and gland cells don't enter circulation under homeostatic conditions. The discovery of this hematopoiet organ, attached to circulating hemocytes and relying on structure signaling, brings closer to understanding Doph hematies.
Scientists have long wondered how cells can tolerate the negative effects of aneuploidy, a condition where a cell has an abnormal number of chromosomes, long enough for new traits to evolve. Laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to anupidy, but surprisingly, researchers found that anupidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which have lower-than-expected expression of many genes. They created diploid panels with two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes to show that gene dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation have higher expression in wild populations but show elevated rates of amplification, suggesting that copy variation is buffered at these genes. Anupidy provides an advantage to strain YPS9 by amplifying a gene that escapes compensation.

Chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast, which are tolerant of anidy and have active dosage compensation at the transcript level for specific amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage are buffered against copy variation and show elevated amplification in isolates. New mutations or adaptation could reduce expression at amplified genes or strains downregulate in proportion to dose. Researchers generated isogenic anup-eup pairs for three wild strains to distinguish between possibilities.

Results show up to 40% of amplified genes in anup strains have lower-than-expected expression due to heritable polymorphisms that downregulate amplified genes, some of which may have been selected during adaptation to anidy. Expression of dosage-compensated genes is controlled in proportion to copy but many escape compensation in anup and contribute to variation. Whole and partial amplification is common in laboratory experiments.
Researchers have discovered a new type of light-sensing cells in a type of flatworm called Marig crozier. These cells, called xenops, were previously thought to be part of a different group of light-sensing proteins called ciliary opsins. However, they have now found that xenops diverged from ciliary ops in a long time before animals with backbones evolved. The scientists wanted to learn more about the cells that use xenops and how they work. They found that xenops are in two types of cells in the flatworm: in the eyes of the larva and around the brain of the adult. The extraocular cells have hundreds of tiny hair-like structures called cilia inside a special sac called a phagosome. The researchers tested xenops in human cells and found that it works by connecting to a protein called Gi. This is similar to how some lightensing cells in jawed vertebrates, like humans, work. They also found that xenops have a similar structure to these cells, with cilia inside their own membrane. This is a new type of lightensing cell that was not known before. The discovery changes our understanding of how lightensing evolved in animals.
Researchers have long known that spatial and temporal cues are necessary to specify the diversity of neurons in the brain, but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitor cells remains unclear. Drosophila neuroblasts, a type of neural progenitor cell, are a good model to study because they are individually identifiable and have known spatial and temporal factors. This study tested whether spatial and temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. The researchers used a technique called TargetID to identify the binding sites of the Hunch temporal factor in two neuroblasts (NB-5 and NB-4) that make different neurons. The results showed that Hback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct chromatin domains which correlated with H-bound loci in each neuro. Importantly, the G/P3 spatial factor, expressed in NB-6 but not NB-4, had binding sites correlated with chromatin in NB-6 but not NB-4. The data support a model where early spatial factors like G establish neuroblast-specific chromatin, leading to neuroblast temporal factor binding and production of different neurons in each lineage.

The study found over 100 loci that are differentially bound by H in NB-6 or NB-4, which are candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification. This research builds on decades of understanding of spatial and temporal patterning in Dophila neural cells. Doph is an excellent model to study how spatial and temporal are integrated during neurogenesis due to a deep understanding of neural progenitor lineages and mechanisms. The study aimed to determine H genomic targets in NB- versus NB- to discriminate between two models: independent and sequential. The independent model would result in identical T binding in all neuroasts, while the sequential model would result in T binding at different loci each neuro.
Scientists have long been trying to understand how a type of protein called P2 receptors work. These proteins open a pore in the cell membrane in response to a molecule called ATP, but the exact mechanism was unclear. Researchers used a new tool called photo-switch tweezers to measure the distance between parts of the protein during activation. They combined this with computer simulations to create detailed models of the open and closed states of the protein. The results show that the pore expands less than expected and the inner and outer parts of the protein move closer together through a bending motion. This provides new insight into how P2 receptors work and a new method to study other proteins.

Cell division, or cytokinesis, is the process by which one cell splits into two, is powered by the constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring. It has been assumed that all cells divide using the same molecular mechanism, but evidence suggests that cytokinesis regulation in individual cells has more variation than previously thought. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has distinct fate, specified by conserved pathways. Researchers used fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and drug to identify cell-type variation in cytokinesis requirement for forminK-1-dependent filament-actin (F-act) cytoskeleton in one cell (P2), whereas in another cell (EMS) variation is extrinsically regulated, dependent on Src-1 signaling and contact with neighbor cell P. Both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinesis variation in individual types and protect against division failure when contractile ring weakened.

Researchers used thermogenetics, drug, and embryo dissection to probe mechanisms cell-type variation in regulation among blastomeres within four-cell C. elegans. They found cell-specific differences in functional and temporal activity formin-1, but not myosin-2 during cytokinesis. In contrast, formin- (ts) embryos showed cell variation in temporal requirement among blastomeres. Analysis of one-cell embryo, cytokinesis failed 100% with formin inactivation by thermal shift at any time before mid-constriction. Researchers used fast-temperature-sensitive alleles in two proteins for contractile constriction one embryo: myos-II and diaphan formin. They identified cell-specific in four embryos requirement formin, but not myos. Data show both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute cytokinesis and promote robust when contractile weakened in specific within four.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the flagellar sheath, a membrane-like structure surrounding the flagella of some bacteria, in the release of a molecule that triggers an immune response in hosts. The flagellar sheath was previously thought to help bacteria evade the host's immune system, but this study shows it actually triggers an immune response. The study used a symbiotic relationship between a bacterium Vibrio fischer and the Hawaiian bobtail squid to investigate the flagellar sheath's function. They found that rotation of the sheathed flagella in both Vibrio fischer and its pathogenic relative Vibrio cholera releases a potent molecule called lipopolysaccharide, which is found in the flagellar sheath. This molecule triggers an immune response in the host. The study reveals a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering immune responses, rather than evading them. This finding has implications for understanding bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella and raises questions about the function of the flagellar sheath.

The researchers used the squid-vib symbiosis model to study the flagellar sheath's effect on host recognition. They found that rotation of the sheathed flagella in Vibrio fischer and its pathogenic relative Vib cholera releases the immunogenic lipyschar. The flag sheath has been difficult to study, with no mutations that result in loss of sheath in sheathed flagella. The role of the sheath, even in relation to motility, is poorly characterized. This study furthers understanding of the enigmatic structure and its contribution to virulence. Further work will build on these discoveries, including characterizing LPS released by Vibrio during flag rotation, identifying squid receptors that recognize Vibrio LPS, and determining flagellin's role in host responses.
Researchers have discovered a process called chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants, which occurs when two plants with different centromere histone H3 genes are hybridized. This leads to the formation of shattered chromosomes from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lagg chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucle. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining (NHE) or stalled repair. Mutation of NHE factor DNA ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. The findings suggest a potential for enduring genomic novelty and provide a tractable system for investigating causes and mechanisms of complex rearrangements similar to those associated with human disorders.

Chromosomal restructuring has never been described in Arabidopsis before, possibly because it would arise from meiotic defects resulting in nullis gametes, which are not viable. Aneupids from mitotic failure do not have these constraints. The altered CEN3G-tswap strain was hybridized to recessive glrous-1 mutant. Results provide evidence for occurrence of chromosome restructuring when diver individuals hybridize, identifying centrom-based mechanism for instability. This phenomenon depends on chimer CEN3, but similar effect observed when haploid strain expresses CEN of close species.

Results using DNAase-2 mutants suggest NHE plays role in repair of haploid chromosomes contributing diploid anup progeny. NHE inhibited, haploid frequency increased. In silico reconstruction suggests NHE involved in repairing breaks on shattered chromosomes. NHE contributes to anup and diploid progeny, unrepaired double-stranded breaks elimination haploid genome, similar human hybrid elimination. Misegregarded chromosomes enter degrad pathway initiated endonucle breaks. Occasionally, chromosomes rescued.
Epstein-Barr Virus Ensures Cell Survival by Modulating Apoptosis at Early and Late After Infection

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is linked to several human cancers, including Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The virus expresses proteins that promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis, or programmed cell death. One of these proteins, LMP1, is critical for the survival of EB-immortalized cells. However, during early infection, EBV induces rapid cell growth with low levels of LMP and little apoptosis. Researchers sought to understand how cells survive without LMP/NF early on. They used a technique called BH profiling to study regulation of apoptosis and found a change from uninfected to infected cells. This change is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of M-1 and B-1 by the viral protein EB3.

EB3 regulates the BH profile of EB-infected cells and suppresses apoptosis by promoting M-1 localization and increasing B-1 transcription. Transcription of B-1 is also regulated by the EB factor EB2 and L1-induced NF. The study found that human blood cells depend on B-2 for survival and EB upregulates additional proteins to suppress apoptosis. BH profiling predicted EB-infected cells are primed for apoptosis due to combined effects of M-1 and B-2, with additional protection by- in immortalized cells.

The viral protein L1 is thought to be responsible for apoptotic suppression in latently infected, proliferating cells. However, the initial burst of cell growth by EB is driven by EB transcription factors in absence of L1 or NF activity. The mechanism by which EB3 enhances M- function may provide insight into regulation during cell maturation and lymphogenesis. The phase of EB infection where EBAs are expressed with little L is known as latency II.
Researchers studied the genetic and environmental factors that influence the production of specialized chemicals in plants, called metabolites, in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana species across Europe. They found that a combination of geography, environmental conditions, demography, and genetic processes all contribute to the diversity of metabolites and their distribution. This suggests that new alleles, or genetic variations, controlling metabolite diversity arise independently within species and are shaped by ecological and demographic pressures. The study used 797 natural Arabidopsis accessions, or plant samples, to measure metabolite variation and found that genetic loci, or locations, in metabolism contain frequent alleles, or variations, suggesting within-species convergence. This provides new insight into the complexity of selective forces and mechanisms that shape generation and distribution of allelic variation influencing adaptation.

The study focused on the glucosinolate (GSL) pathway, a known biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis, and its causal loci for natural variation. The level of allelic diversity at these loci raises questions how pathways with this level of diversity and variation pass through speciation boundaries. Brassica species have genetic variation at GS-long and GS-OP creating same chemotyp variation in Arabid. Understanding genetic, demographic, and environmental factors shaping a trait in population is key to evolution. The study used Arabid GSL pathway as a model to query genetics, geography, environment, and demography intersecting to shape chemotyp variation across Europe. The intersection of environmental, demography, and genomic complexity gives rise to metabolic variation across plant species.
Apoptotic caspases, long thought to be tumor suppressors, can also promote tumor growth under certain conditions, but how they do so is unclear. Researchers studied a well-studied tumor model in fruit flies, Drosila, with oncogenic mutations in the proto-oncogene Ras. They found that caspases, instead of killing cells, promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which recruit immune cells that signal back to tumor cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK amplifies casp activity, creating a feedback loop. Interfering with this loop reduces tumor growth and improves survival.

In a previous study, oncogenic Ras suppressed casp activity, keeping cells in an 'und-like state. Caspases still induced apoptosis in some cells, but promoted ROS for growth and invasion. This work extends previous findings on E and J signaling switch from anti-tumor to pro-tumor by oncogenic Ras and identifies casases as key components. Apoptotic casases are usually tumor suppressors, but under oncogenic conditions, like Ras12 in scri mutant cells, they adopt tumor-promoting role.

Oncogenic Ras switches pro-apopt cas to tumor-prom and maintains cells in 'und-like state. Inhibiting casases blocks growth and invasion. Tumor function of casases depends on ROS for neoplastic behavior of clones. ROS are required for activation of immune cells and J signaling, promoting overgrowth, similar to another model. E and J have proliferation and growth functions in 'ead Ai model. Similarities prompted investigation of ROS and cas for growth of clones in Dila.
Researchers investigated how people perceive the duration of social interactions and found that it is influenced by oxytocin, a hormone involved in social behavior. They showed that people perceive social interactions as shorter than non-social ones, and this effect is stronger in those with lower autistic tendencies. Intranasal oxytocin administration restored this effect in less socially proficient individuals, while oxytoc antagonist diminished it in proficient ones. These findings suggest that time is not objective, but subjective and linked to personality, and oxyin plays a role in social cognition.

 Studies confirmed the influence of social interactions on perceived duration and tied it to a stable trait - social proficiency. Autistic traits are associated with lower oxyin levels, which can be improved with intranas oxyin administration. The link between autistic tendency and social interaction duration raises the question if oxyin is involved. To test this, socially proficient individuals were given oxy antagonist to see if it would diminish the compression effect. They found that less proficient are less susceptible to the effect than proficient.

The mechanism involves oxyin. Less proficient have lower endogenous oxyin levels. To test if oxyin promotes the effect in less proficient, they were given intranas oxyin. The same task as before was used.
Researchers studied how mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus's Spike protein affect its ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor on human cells. This interaction is necessary for the virus to infect cells. Mutations in the Spike's receptor binding domain (RBD) are present in SARS-CoV variants that have emerged worldwide. For example, the B.1.1.7 lineage has a mutation N501 in its RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE variants in humans with mutations in the R binding site. The researchers analyzed the effects of five RBD mutations (K417, K417, N501, E484, and S477) and two ACE mutations (S19 and K26) on the R/ACE interaction. They found that most of these mutations increased the R/ACE interaction, except for K417, which decreased it. The study suggests that N501 and S477 mutations enhance transmission by increasing binding, K417 facilitates immune escape, and E484 enhances both binding and escape.

The researchers also looked at combinations of R mutations in SARS-Co-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P) variants. They found that most of these increased the R/ACE interaction. The exceptions were K417, which decreased it. The study suggests that N501 and S477 mutations enhance transmission by increasing binding, K417 facilitates immune escape, and E484 enhances both binding and escape.

The researchers also examined the effect of ACE mutations on the R/ACE interaction. They found that the K and S mutants had less clear effects. The study suggests that carriers of these ACE variants are at risk of infection and severe disease. However, in contrast to SARS-2 R mutations, the effects of ACE are relevant to carriers of these mutations.

The researchers also looked at combinations of R mutations, including present in VOC-202-02, a subset of Alpha (501) with E484 mutation, and Beta and Gamma variants. They found that these increased the R/ interaction.
Scientists have created a detailed map of how genes interact with each other in a type of cell, called a metazoan cell. This map shows how genes work together to create specific traits and how changes in genes affect development and disease. The researchers used a method called RNA interference and single-cell imaging to study 21 traits in fruit fly cells. They found 136 genes involved in important processes like signaling, chromosome, cell cycle, and protein control. The map is the largest of its kind for metazoa cells to date.

The researchers used a method to combine gene interactions to show relationships between genes. They found that a pathway called Ras interacts with a complex that changes chromosome structure. This interaction is also found in human cancer cells. The study provides a way to understand how genes work together and how changes affect cells.

The team used a combination of RNA interference, high-throughput imaging, and modeling to create the map. They selected 136 genes involved in key processes like signaling, chromosome, cell cycle, and protein control. The map shows how genes interact to create traits and how changes affect development and disease. The researchers found an interaction between Ras signaling and a complex that changes chromosome structure. This is also found in human cancer cells.

The study shows how genes interact at a large scale and can be mapped to other data to understand relationships. The method is unbiased and automated, revealing a detailed diagram of regulatory and causal relationships during cell division. The map highlights an unexpected link between chromosome and signaling. The researchers found interactions between a complex and a chromatin remodeler.
Scientists have long studied the phenomenon of heterosty, a widespread adaptation that promotes outbreeding in plants, but its genetic and evolutionary origins remain unclear. In the Primula primrose, hetery is controlled by the S-locus supergene, which determines the arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes were unknown. Researchers identified the Primula CYP50 gene, a putative brassinoster-degrading enzyme, as the locus that determines style length dimorphism. CYP50 is present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, specifically expressed in S-m styles, and its loss leads to long styles. The gene arose by duplication in the Primulaceae lineage and shows accelerated molecular evolution. The study provides a mechanistic explanation for Prim style dimorphism and sheds light on the evolution of Sloc as a model for a plant supergene.

The researchers found that CYP50 represents the locus in the Prim hetery super, whose expression in S styles causes brassoster degradation, limiting cell expansion and elongation. Evolutionarily, C50 arose via lineage-specific duplication and gain of style-specific expression. The proposed duplication and gain of C50 in the ancestor of Prim likely represents the dominant-short mutation. C50 is an example of a causal locus in a super underlying adaptive polymorphism, opening the way for understanding the origin of the Sloc as a complex.

The study sequenced transcriptomes of distantly related species and found C50 presence/absence strictly cosegregates with morph in all heter species across the Prim phylogeny, and is absent in all cases of long. With V results, strongly supports that C50 is the locus of the heter super that determines length. Heter in Prim is controlled by the Sloc super, comprising tightly linked genes determining length, anther, pollen, and intra-incompatibility.
Researchers have found that high-frequency stimulation of kisspept neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (KissARH) leads to the release of two peptides, neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin, which synchronize the activity of these neurons. This synchronized activity then excites gonadotrop-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons through a mechanism involving glutamateric input to preoptic kisspe neurons from kissAR neurons. The study used optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular biology, and single-cell RT-PCR in mice to investigate the cellular basis of kissAR activity.

Kisspept and neurokin B are essential for pubert development and fertility. Kisspe neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus coexpress kiss, N, dynorph, and glutamate and are thought to provide an episodic excitatory drive to GRH neurons, the mechanisms of which are unknown. High-frequency photostimulation of kissAR neurons evoked local release of excitatory (N) and inhibitory (dyn) neuropeptides which were found to synchronize kissAR neuronal firing. The light-evoked activity caused robust excitation of GRH by synaptic mechanism also involved glutamateric input preoptic kiss neurons fromAR.

KissAR neurons play a dual role in driving epis secretion of GRH through differential release of peptide and amino neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function. Nerve fibers expressing kisspe or coexpressing kisspe are localized in the internal zone of median eminence in mice and rats. Activation of kissAR neurons with optogen stimulation generates release in vivo, which is thought to be kisspein depolarization GR terminals. High photostimulation ofAR induced N-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), modulated by co-released dynin, and synchronization ofAR neurons. ActivationAR coleased glutamate that excited rostral kissAV/Pe neurons. Combination of synchronization and excitationAVPe resulted in robust excitation GR.

KissAR communicate withAVPe via fast neurotransmitter glutamate which stimulates burstiringAVPe. Activation rostral kiss releasespein robustly excites GR via G54 signaling, stimulating release at preovulatory surge. Kisspein, G54, N, Tac3, and GR are required for normal fertility.
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and favoring mesodermal over neural fates during differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. Researchers found that BMP suppresses differentiation by downregulating Cdh, an event that accompanies earliest stages of neural and mesermal differentiation. Loss of Cdh is a requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells and suppressing Cdh activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. BMP acts prior and independently of Cdh to prime plurip cells for mesod differentiation, reinforcing the block to neural. Differentiation depends not only on extrinsic cues but also morphetic events that control receptivity to those cues. A key plurot signal, BMP, feeds into this mechanism.

BMP maintains pluripency by expressing Cdh, which interferes with neural and mesermal differentiation. Higher BMP levels impose posterior identity priming cells for mesod, incompatible with neural fate. Findings explain why BMP protects plurotency and promotes mesod differentiation. Loss of Cdh activity limits earliest stages of neural differentiation. BMP controls differentiation by maintaining Cdh expression. Changes in adhesion to transcription control fate specification used in development, coordinating morphogenesis. BMP target Id imposes proximal identity on undifferentiated, priming towards mesod. Id blocks neural differentiation by shifting plurotent identity in absence differentiation.

BMP protects plurotency and suppresses neural specification, but mechanisms unclear. Signaling required for mesoderm in vivo. BMP maintains plurotency and suppresses neural specification, but mechanisms unclear.
Researchers have discovered a protein called C120 that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of centrioles, which are essential components of the centrosome in quies cells. Centrioles are inherently asymmetric and differ in morphology and function, but how these properties are established and maintained during quiescence was unknown. The study found that depleting C120 in mouse and human cells leads to accumulation of pericentolar material (PCM) components, including pericin, C5ap2, ninein, and C170. This results in increased microtubule-nucleation at the centome, causing loss of C120 to lead to aberrant dyin-dependent trafficking of centomal proteins, dispersal of centolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. The results indicate that C120 helps maintain centome homeostasis by inhibiting untimature of the daughter centole and defines a new molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Thoracic Dystrophy and Joub syndrome.
Researchers investigated how neurons and glial cells called Müller cells (MCs) communicate in the developing retina. They found that retinal waves, or spontaneous electrical activity in the retina, induce calcium signals in MCs. The type of neurotransmitter released during retinal waves determines how MCs respond. During cholinergic waves, MC signals were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists, while glutamaterg waves were blocked by ionotropic glutamate antagonists. This suggests MCs change their responsiveness to match the neurotransmitter used in retinal waves. Using a glutamate sensor, researchers showed that the decline in MC signals is due to a decrease in glutamate reaching MC. These findings indicate that neurons and MC interact during a critical period of retinal maturation, enabled by neurotransmitter release from retinal synapses.

The study used whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells and two-photon imaging of calcium or glutamate sensors in MC to investigate neurotransmitters during retinal waves. They found that retinal waves induce calcium signals in a large proportion of MC, showing spontaneous activity in both neuronal and glial networks at this age. The mechanism of interaction between neurons and MC during cholin retinal waves is similar to previous findings in cortex and hippocampus, where cholin stimulation leads to astrocyte signals via musinic acetylcholine and IP3. However, the role of neuronal activity in MC development is unclear.

Physiological results show MCs express multiple neurotransmitter receptors, allowing control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal shifts from cholin to glutamg signaling. The proportion of MC responding to waves decreased from P9 to P11, despite retinal waves presence. MCs express various receptors, including glutam and cholin. Signals at different ages could be evoked by neurotrans released during retinal. Researchers explored which transmitters modulate neuron-MC at different ages.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the time of death, known as postmortem interval (PM), in a mouse model system using microbes. This is crucial in death investigations, as current methods can be inaccurate and biased. Forensic entomology, for example, can be off by days or months. Microbes may provide a solution to these limitations. The study found that postmortem microbial changes are significant, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model, allowing PM to be estimated within 3-48 days. The research provides insight into bacterial and fungal ecology within a decomposing body and suggests that microbial data can be used as a tool for PM estimation.

The study tested hypotheses about the role of microbes in decomposition and whether changes in communities are predictable over time, essential for using microbes as a "clock" for PM. The data not only understand decomposition ecology but also the feasibility of microbes as evidence. The researchers rigorously tested if microbial change is measurable and directional during decomposition to estimate past events like PM. A previous study showed skin and mouth bacterial communities changed consistently during swine decomposition over 5 days. This study expands on that by characterizing communities in three external and one internal sites in 40 mouse corpses over 48.

The approach differs from prior work which models were evaluated by explaining all data points. This study provided a proof-of-principle that microbial ecology has potential to be a forensic tool for PM estimation. An experiment was conducted to characterize microbial changes in mice as they decomposed on soil for 48. Bacteria, archaea, and fungi were analyzed using DNA sequencing for each sample.
Scientists have long known that despite the vast diversity of body forms in bilaterian animals, they share common developmental genes with conserved expression patterns in the embryo. Among these genes are the Hox, which define identities along the anterior-posterior axis. H proteins interact with TALE factors to exert their function. However, H and TALE are present in some but not all non-bilian phyla, raising the question of how Hox- TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. Researchers used proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages to show that these networks emerged from an ancestral motif in Hox and related families. H-T networks experienced additional innovations crucial for differentiating H functions along body plans.

Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of bilian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. Their patterning roles contributed to morphological diversification of bilian during evolution. These networks originated from an ancestral mode kept in other home gene families. The study describes the molecular underlying H- T patter system in Bilateria established during eary evolution. Developmental genes can display dissimilar patterns or be absent in nonilian lineages, showing embryonic mechanisms are not universal. The H gene family was considered highly conserved in the kingdom, but some nonilian phyla lack H. Cnidaria is the only nonilian with a H repertoire, while others lack H (Figure 1). This raises how H acquired axial functions during metan evolution. Bil H patter rely on P and Me proteins, also in nonilian (Figure 1).
Researchers used super-resolution microscopy to study the movement of AMPA receptors, a type of neurotransmitter receptor, at the synapses, the connections between brain cells. They found that most AMP receptors are confined to small areas within the synapses, called nanodomains, and stay there for at least 15 minutes. Less than 10% of the receptors were outside the synapses and highly mobile. This is different from previous findings that suggested AMP receptors were mostly outside the synapses. The researchers used tiny fluorescent probes, called quantum dots, to track the receptors for long periods of time, up to 60 minutes, and observed 126 synapses. They found similar results using different methods, including labeling live and fixed neurons with fluorescent dyes. AMP receptors were mostly in the synapses, with one nanomain per synapse, but multiple nanodomains exist. Factors like size and shape of the receptors and probes affected their movement. Larger probes, over 20 nanometers, were too big to enter the synapses, while smaller ones, 10 nanometers, were not. This suggests that AMP receptors enter the synapses quickly and don't accumulate outside.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which neurons respond to a lack of oxygen, or hypoxia, in the brain. They found that a pathway called SUMylation, which adds a small molecule called SUMO to a specific channels called Na1.2, increases the flow of sodium ions into the cell. This increase in sodium flow is crucial for the neuron's response to hypox.

The study used rat brain cells called cerebellar granule neurons and found that SUMylation of Na1.2 channels happens quickly, within 40 seconds, after hypox. The SUMylation changes the way the channel works, making it more likely to open and allow more sodium to flow in. Without SUMylation, the channel is less likely to open and less sodium flows in.

The researchers also found that a mutation in the Na1.2 channel or blocking the enzyme that removes SUM, called SEN1, prevents the increase in sodium flow. This shows that SUMylation is necessary for the response to hypox. They also found that blocking the channel with a toxin, CTX, prevented the increase in sodium flow.

The study suggests that the SUM pathway and Na1.2 channels could be targets for treatments to prevent damage from lack of oxygen in the brain. The brain is complex and has many challenges, but this finding could help reduce damage from acute lack of oxygen.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how temperature affects the spread of Ross River virus, a mosquito-borne disease found in Australia and the Pacific Islands, and potentially emerging worldwide. The model shows that the virus transmission peaks at moderate temperatures around 26.4°C and declines at temperatures below 17.0 and above 31.5°C. This means the disease is likely to be present year-round in tropical areas but seasonal in temperate regions, resulting in a seasonal peak in human cases. Climate change is expected to increase transmission in temperate areas where most people live, but decrease in tropical areas where temperatures are already near the optimal.

The study highlights the importance of understanding temperature's role in disease dynamics and predicting climate change. As the climate warms, it's crucial to know how temperature affects mosquito-borne diseases, especially new ones spreading globally. The researchers used data from two mosquito species to create a temperature-dependent model for Ross River virus transmission. The results show a general pattern of optimal transmission at intermediate temperatures, with optimal temperature driven by mosquito lifespan, but uncertain upper and lower limits varying by vector-pathogen systems.

The biggest impact of temperature on disease is seen in temperate regions where temperature varies along the rising part of the transmission curve (20-25°C). If temperatures are above or below the optimal, temperature's effect may be masked in models that assume linear responses. Upper limits of mosquito-borne transmission, a concern for climate change, are determined by vector traits like lifespan and thermal performance, not rate-based traits like biting or pathogen development.
Researchers studied how brain activity in the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls movement, relates to beta oscillations, a type of brain wave that has been observed for decades. They recorded brain activity from macaques while they performed a task that required them to bring their arm to a target. The macques were instructed to increase or decrease beta waves before moving their arm. Results showed that when beta waves decreased, arm movement started faster than when they increased. This suggests that beta waves are linked to neural patterns that slow down movement.

The study also found that brain activity shifted away from a movement state when beta waves were induced or occurred naturally during the task. This supports the idea that beta waves are a common signature of spiking patterns in different tasks. The study ties together previous findings on beta's role in movement with how the motor cortex encodes movement through population-level activity.

Increasing and decreasing beta with neurofeedback preceded slower and faster movement times, supporting the hypothesis that beta are linked to patterns that slow new movements. This matches previous findings of elevated power before and after trained movements. Surprisingly, individual unit responses during beta were different across tasks, but population-level analysis showed beta promote a movement-slow state in both tasks.

The study recorded units and showed different activity during induced beta compared to natural oscillations. Despite individual differences, population analysis showed beta promote a movement-slow state in both tasks, matching behavior.
Researchers studied the role of TRAF2, a component of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, in regulating cell survival and inflammation in the skin. TR2 deficient mice die at birth, so its role in adult tissues is not well understood. TR2 has a RING domain, which can act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, but requires sphingosine-1-phosphate, generated by sphingosine kinase 1, to function. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of TR2, but not sph1 deficiency, disrupted TN-mediated NF-κ and MAPK signaling, causing epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation was driven by TN, cell death, non-canonical NFκ, and adaptive immune system, representing a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TR2 has tissue-specific functions that do not overlap with sph1.

TR2 absence delayed TN-induced NF-κ and MAPK activation and increased sensitivity to killing by TN in cells. Absence TR in keratinocytes in vivo resulted in ps-like epidermal hyperasia and skin. Unlike TN-dependent inflammatory skin conditions, such as IK2 epider knock (Pasakis et al, 2002) and cp mutant (Gerach et, we reversed this phenotype by deleting both TN and NF2 genes. Our results highlight TR's role in protecting keratinocytes from death and downregulating responses, supporting intrinsic defects in keratin initiate psoriasis skin.

TR-deficient keratinocytes do not need bacteria to produce TN, and TN-induced sets a vicious cycle of inflammation. Conitant deletion of TN with TR-deficient keratin breaks this cycle and prevents apoptosis keratin and ps-like onset. Keratinocytes from wild-type, TR2KO, and sph1-mice were tested, TN signaling was delayed and weakened in TR-deficient, but not sph1-def. TR2, not sph1, keratin were sensitive to TN-induced death, associated with reduction in FLIP and caspase cleavage. In absence TN, TR-def keratin still produce inflammatory via non-canonical NF pathway, generating ps-like phenotype but slower. These cytokines recruit immune cells, including neutrophils and IF cells.
Synaptic vesicles (SVs) play a crucial role in storing and releasing neurotransmitters at synapses. After releasing SVs, their membranes are quickly captured by endocytosis and recycled to form new, fusion-competent SVs. Research suggests that clathrin-mediated endocyt (CME) is involved in this endytic traffic. However, a new study has found a pathway for SV formation that bypasses the need for clrin and dynamin 1/3 and operates during intense activity.

The study used synapses of dyn 1 and 3 knock-out neurons, where clrin-mediated endocyt is impaired, to understand this process. Surprisingly, massive endosome formation was not defective, but rather enhanced in the absence of dyn 1 and 3. The conversion of endosomes to SV was not accompanied by clrin-coated buds on their surface and proceeded even after clrin knock-down, indicating independence from clrin. These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV formation that does not require clrin and dyn 1/3.

Synaptic vesicles are organelles that store and release neurotransmitters at synapses. After exocyt, their membranes are recaptured by endyt and recycled for new SV generation. Clrin endyt (ME) plays a role in endytic traffic. However, this study found a new pathway for SV formation that does not need clrin and dyn 1/3. In synapses of dyn 1 and 3 knock-out, clrin endyt was impaired, but endosome formation was enhanced. Endosomes converted to SV without clrin-coated buds, even after clrin knock-down. This suggests a pathway for SV formation that bypasses clrin and dyn 1/3.

Synaptic vesicles store and release neurotransmitters at synapses. After exyt, their membranes are recaptured by endyt and recycled for new SV. Clrin endyt plays a role in endytic. This study found a new pathway for SV formation that does not need cl and dyn 1/3. In syn of dyn 1 and 3 knock, cl endyt was impaired, but end formation was enhanced. End converted to SV without cl-coated, even cl knock.
Researchers conducted a study to identify biomarkers of glucocorticoid (GC) action in the body. Glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed drugs, but there is no way to measure their effect. The study involved 10 people with primary adrenal insufficiency and no other endocrine disorders. They were admitted to the hospital and studied during glucocoid exposure and withdrawal. No serious side effects were seen. The researchers compared blood and tissue samples using multi-omics analysis. They found a profile of genes and metabolites that predicted glucoid exposure. A specific microRNA, miR-122p, was linked to genes and metabolites affected by glucoid. This was replicated in other studies with different glucoid exposure. The study provides a basis for developing a biomarker to measure glucoid effects, allowing for individualized therapy and understanding of glucoid-related diseases like cardiovascular and obesity.
Researchers have studied how the mTORC1 complex responds to amino acids in cells. They found that amino acids activate mTOR1 through a complex containing RAGTPase, RAG, and vacuolar ATPase. The sensing of amino acids causes mTOR1 to move to lysosomes, which is a necessary for activation. To understand this process, they used live imaging of m1 component RAP and a fluorescent analogue of leucine ester. They found that m1 moves to lysosomes within 2 minutes of amino addition and peaks at 5 minutes. This is timed with leuc appearance in lysosomes and is sustained compared to amino stimulation. Sestr2 and vacolar ATP are negative regulators of m1 in this system. Phosphorylation of canonical m1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting m1 passes through lys surface before targeting substrates.

The study focused on H-1 cells and used a fluorescent leuc analogue to image m translocation in response to leuc. Leuc activates m1 and leuc ester accumulates in lysosomes, activating m1 (Zcu et al, 2011). They tested leuc analogues for m1 activation and found lys is crucial for m activation, but dynamics may be more complicated. They expressed m subunits with GFP to follow localization in live cells. A leuc ester with a fluorescent moiety produced sustained translocation due to accumulation in lys lumen. This provides a dynamic view of m response to amino.

Data support that amino activate m1 in cell interior, possibly multiple types involved. Leuc is sensed by Sestr1/2 (Wolf et al,201) and arginine via SLC9 (Re et al,201; Wang et,201) are also important for m1 activation.
Researchers have found that modifying a protein antigen, Ovalbumin (OVA), with a specific sugar molecule called Lewis X (Le) changes how it is processed by immune cells called dendritic cells, leading to a stronger immune response. Normally, dendritic cells take in antigens and send them to specific compartments for processing, a process regulated by lectin receptors that recognize sugar structures. By adding Le to OVA, it directs it to the lectin M1 (M1), which favors a type of immune response called Th1 and enhances CD8 T cell priming. Unlike native OVA, which requires high doses and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, Le modification reduces the amount needed by 100 times and eliminates TLR dependence. Studies in mice lacking M1 showed reduced CD8 effector T cells, indicating M1 is crucial for this process. M1-mediated cross-presentation of LeVA does not require transporters or Cathepsin and occurs even after prolonged antigen storage in Rab+AMP+ compartments. The study suggests controlled glycosylation of antigens significantly influences intracellular routing, immune response strength, and should be considered for vaccine optimization.
Researchers have found that the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis uses its quorum sensing system to regulate hundreds of genes, including those involved in cell-to-cell communication. They discovered that the Type VI secretion system (TSS) is activated by quorum sensing in B. thailandensis and is necessary to control the growth of quorum mutants. In a study, they found that quorum mutants were outcompeted by their parent in broth culture because there was no cell contact and a cost associated with quorum gene activation. However, on agar, the wild type had a fitness advantage over the mutant due to intact TSS-1. Quorum sensing activates TSS-1 growth inhibition, which serves to police and constrain quorum mutants. This is a novel role for TSS in intraspecies control.

The researchers found that QS of TSS-mediated toxicity and immunity allows competent B. thensis to police against quorum mutants. During planktonic growth, where TSS does not function due to limited contact, mutants had a fitness advantage over wild-type because of the cost with quorum activities. They described a mechanism by which wild populations mitigate the cost of quorum regulation by hindering growth of mutants via cell-dependent toxin and immunity. This is a form of microbial policing where QS-competent outcompete populations of signal non-operators in absence of T-contact growth system.

In this study, they demonstrated that TSS-mediated killing does not occur in liquid cocultures. They found that the parent with intact QS expressed quorum-activated TSS toxin and proteins, while the mutant did not fully induce TSS effectors. Bacterial quorum often controls factors that benefit cells in groups, controlling cooperative activities. A well-studied type of QS in Proteobacteria is mediated by acylomine lactone (AHL) signals. AHLs are made by Lux family synthases and diffuse out of cells.
Researchers studied how the connection between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex develops in the brain of newborn mice. They found that the hippocampus drives the prefrontal cortex's activity through a specific type of brain wave called theta oscillations. Theta oscillations are important for learning and memory. The researchers used a technique called optogenetics to turn on or off specific neurons in the hippocampus to see how it affects the prefrontal cortex. They found that when they turned on neurons in the middle part of the hippocampus, it made the prefront cortex oscillate more. But when they turned on neurons in the top part of the hippocampus, it didn't. This shows that the middle part of the hippocampus drives the prefront cortex's activity. The researchers also found that the connection between the hippocampus and prefront cortex is strong and one-way, meaning the hippocampus sends signals to prefront but not the other way around. This suggests that the hippocampus plays a key role in developing the connection between the two areas. The study opens up new ways to study how the brain develops and matures.
RNA polymerase II (RNAPI) is a crucial for transcribing DNA into RNA in mammalian cells. Its activity is regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and methylation. Phosphorylation of serine residues at the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPI marks transcription initiation and elongation. In mammals, the CTD has a non-canonical substitution of serine to lysine at position 7, which can be acetylated (Kac). This study found mono and di-methylation of lysine 7 (Kme1 and K2) at the CTD. Kme1 and K2 occur early in transcription and precede or accompany phosphorylation of serine 5 and 7. In contrast, Kac is associated with elongation and ser phosphorylation of mRNA.

RNAPI binds to promoters in a hypophosphorylated state, then becomes phosphorylated at serine 5 and 7 during early transcription. Productive elongation is marked by phosphorylation of serine 2 throughout the gene body. New antibodies were made to detect C-Kme and C-K2, showing these modifications occur before phosphorylation of 5 and 7, and are present at promoters of productively transcribed genes. Biochemical and genome-wide approaches showed C-K methylation at promoters of productively transcribed genes. Mutation of C-K residues is compatible with mouse cell viability, and ser phosphorylation and RNAPI localization independent of K presence or absence.

Acetylation of C-K was previously found associated with inducible expression. This study found increased Kme and K2 with number of K residues in mammalian cells, each flanked by different amino acids. Mono and diethylation of C-K detected in hypophosphorylated forms of RNAPI suggests methylation with early transcription. Results suggest productive transcription at genes with RNAPI recruitment to promoters modulated by C-K modifications, methylation with less transcription and Kac at highest expressed genes.
Skeletal muscle satellite cells play a crucial role in muscle repair and regeneration by exiting quiescence, proliferating, and self-renewing to replenish the satellite cell population. To understand how they maintain quiescence, researchers studied gene expression changes in satellite cells after muscle injury. They found that transcripts encoding RNA-binding proteins, including Tristetrolin, were significantly changed. Tristrol promotes the decay of MyD mRNA, which encodes a transcription factor for myogenic commitment, by binding to MyD's 3' untranslated region. Upon activation, p38/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPK2 and inactivates Tristrol, stabilizing MyD mRNA. Knocking down Tristrol in satellite cells precociously activates them, enabling MyD accumulation and fusion into myofibers. Regulation by Tristrol appears to be a critical post-transcription mechanism controlling satellite homeostasis.

MyD upregulates its own transcription, triggering a rapid feed-forward loop driving myogenic commitment. Researchers propose that Trist may also downregulate MyD and other transcripts in myoblasts, forming a quiescent population or reacquiring qucence after injury. Trist is present in quiescent cells, rapidly inhibited by p/β MAP within minutes of activation, and reduces MyD half-life. Losing Tr from muscle precociously activates satellite cells, promoting MyD expression and aberrant cycle entry. p/β MAP-dependent phosphorylation of Tr suggests it maintains quies. Tr inactivating MyD is consistent with suppressing proogenic targets.
Infants with a defect in the interleukin-10 (IL-10) receptor develop a severe inflammatory bowel disease early in life. Researchers wanted to know if IL-10 regulates the function of a type of immune cell called macrophage in the intestines of infant mice and if macroage-intrinsic IL-10 signaling is necessary to prevent colitis in infancy. They found that IL-10 deficient mice did not show signs of colitis in the first two weeks of life, but developed inflammation and macrophage dysfunction in the third week of life, when they started weaning and their gut bacteria changed. IL-10 did not directly affect the type of bacteria in the gut. However, depleting macroage, a type of immune cell, prevented colitis in IL-10 deficient mice, while lacking IL-10 on macrophages made them more likely to develop colitis. These results show that IL-10 regulation of macroage function in early life is necessary to prevent colitis in mice.

The researchers studied IL-10 deficient mice and normal mice from birth to 14 weeks old to understand why colitis started in IL-10 deficient mice in the third week. They found that macroage depletion prevented colitis in IL-10 deficient mice, but IL-10 on macroages made them more likely to develop colitis. This suggests that IL-10 signaling in macroage is necessary during a critical period of development, important for understanding colitis in infants with IL-10 deficiency.
Researchers have identified a protein called SIM-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabitis elegans that plays a crucial role in the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from targeted mRNAs. siRNAs are involved in regulating transposons and germline genes. The process of siRNA production is mediated by the mut complex, which synthesizes high levels of siRN through an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the steps between siRNA recognition by the pathway and si amplification by the mut complex were unknown.

 SIM-1, a Tudor domain protein, acts downstream of si production and upstream of the mut complex. It localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, which are sites of si-dependent recognition and mut-dependent si amplification respectively. This suggests a role for multiple condensates in organizing the si pathway and promoting regulation by the mut complex.

The study shows SIM-1 bridges the gap between primary and secondary phases of the si silencing pathway in C elegans. It localizes to cytoplasmic foci near granules and Mutator foci, implicating distinct condates in regulation by si and mut. This identifies SIM-1 as a factor mediating secondary si production by the mut complex and suggests multiple condates promote regulation by si and mut.

The si pathway in C eleg is dependent on the mut complex, which synthesizes secondary si from si-targeted mRN to trigger heritable silencing. Several proteins localize or near gran, including GL-1-4, DDX-19, L-14, and VB-1. One could serve a function similar to DE-12, shuttling si-target mRN to SIM- and Mut foci.
Researchers have studied the behavior of Purkin neurons in zebraf larvae, which are crucial for cerebellar function, to determine if they exhibit bistability in awake animals. They recorded intracellularly from Purkin neurons in unanhetized larval zraf and found bistability in these neurons. Tonic firing was seen in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolar membrane potentials. Additionally, Purkin neurons could switch from one state to another spontaneously or with current injection. GABA or NMDA receptors were not required for bursting, but activation of AMP receptors by climbing fibers was sufficient to trigger bursts.

The researchers also recorded Purkin neuron membrane potential intracellular and motor spikes extracellular, showing initiation of motor spiking correlated with increased EPs and depolarization. Developmentally, bistability was observed after Purkin neuron specification and persisted until late larval stages. Two types of glutamateric excitation were observed: strong from climbing fibers and weak from parallel fibers, both mediated by AMP receptors. Bistability in Purkin neurons has been reported in vitro in mammals and in vivo under anesthesia, but not in awake animals.

Researchers recorded from Purkin neurons of larval zraf from 4 to 19 days post-fertilization, allowing study of intracellular dynamics in the context of fictive motor output. However, bist may be property of developing network and not present in adult cerebellum. They found zraf Purkin exhibit bist in vivo and state dependent on AMP-mediated inputs. Based on conservation of cerebellar properties, bist may be conserved from fish to mammals. Purkin can be in tonic or bursting mode and toggle between.
Researchers have discovered how the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process by which cells take in substances from their surroundings. They found that a branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endytic pits against membrane tension. Around 200 Arp/3 complexes are required for robust internalization. A new counting method showed ~200 Ar2/3 complexes assemble at clrin endocytic sites in human cells. Simulations predicted actin self-organizes into a branched array with ends towards the base of the pit. Actin filaments bend between the coat and base of the pit. Energy stored in bent filaments contributes to endytic internalization. Elevated tension directs filaments towards the base, increasing actin nucleation and force production.

The researchers used a multiscale model combining continuum mechanics and filament simulations to study actin polymerization and endytic internalization. They found a minimal actin network of actin, Ar2/3, and capping protein with attachments in the clath coat can generate force to internalize pits against mammalian membrane tension. The model showed a branched actin is sufficient for sustained internalization against physiological tension. Actin self-organization and bending allow the network to adapt to changing loads.

Experiments showed that cells with low tension can endocyt with low Ar2 activity, consistent with previous findings. The researchers hypothesized actin network from HipR distribution and bending might allow endytic network to change under loads. They integrated measurements to show a minimal actin network can generate force to internalize pits against tension. Actin self-organization and bending allow the network to adapt to changing loads.
Researchers have studied the process of macropocytosis, a mechanism by which cells take in extracellular liquid into large vesicles. They found that macropocytic cups in Dictyostelium are organized around patches of PIP3, active Ras, and active Rac signaling molecules. These patches are associated with a ring of active SCAR at the periphery, a structure also found in phagocytic cups and basal waves. The formation of these patches does not depend on the F-actin ring and becomes enlarged when RasGAP1 is mutated, showing Ras plays an instructive role. Macropocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. The researchers propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to the periphery.

Using 3D light microscopy, the researchers mapped the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SC and WAS with respect to signaling molecules P3 and Ras. This led to a new hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane. F-act in macinosomes is closely associated with signaling molecules, such as active Ras. Circular ruffles can persist on the cell surface for periods before closing or regressing into the body. Closure can be abrupt and involves the inward collapse of the rim. There is evidence that Ras stimulates macropocyt in mammalian and Dictostel cells, and macocytic cups are associated with intense P3 patches, essential for their function.
Researchers have discovered the structure of a protein called S4 that plays a crucial role in holding sister chromatids together during cell division. This protein, called cohesin, is essential for proper cell division and defects in its loading can lead to developmental problems in multicellular organisms. A complex called S2/S4 loads cohes onto DNA and determines its location across the genome. The study found that S4 has a specific patch on its surface that recruits S2 to the centromere and pericentere, where cohes is loaded. This is separate from its role in establishing sisterid cohesion across the genome. The structure of S4 bound to a fragment of S2 was determined, revealing how S4 targets cohes to a specific location. Experiments in yeast showed that a conserved patch on S4 is necessary for S2 localization to centere and pericere. This is consistent with genetic evidence of an S4-dependent cohes pathway. Disrupting this patch eliminates S2 localization to centere in mitotic cells and reduces cohes subunit S1 association with centere peric but not arms. This pattern is also seen in cells progressing through S phase, where cohes is initiated. The study suggests S4-dependent cohes targeting is a general feature of cohes loading control, consistent with previous reports.
Researchers studied the effects of being born late in the active season on growth, fattening, winter survival, and reproduction in garden dormice (Eliomys quinus). They compared early-born (EB) and late-born (LB) juvenile dormice. Results showed that LB juveniles grew and fattened twice as fast as EB individuals. During growth, torpor use was low, but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB showed higher tor use, reached similar sizes but lower fat content than EB before hibernation. LB showed similar hibernation patterns, but higher breeding proportion the following year than EB.

The study hypothesized that LB dormice grow and fatten faster due to higher tor use, reach similar preibern body size but lower fat, leading to differences in hibern patterns and losses compared to EB. LB and food availability (ad libitum vs intermittently fast) affected growth and preibern fattening, tor use, body size and fat prior hibern, subsequent hibern patterns and losses, and fecundity. This aligns with findings on dormice producing two litters per year, no differences in survival between EB and LB.

Preibern fat reserves of LB were sufficient to fuel shorter hibern due five-week delay. Extensive tor use seemed incompatible with growth but supports preibern fattening and fat preservation. EB reached higher reserves prior hibern compared to LB. LB delayed hibern onset by five weeks. LB grow twice as fast as EB, lower fat prior h (Stfel et al 2017). One strategy to lower energy and minimize challenges is daily tor use (Ruf et 199).
Researchers have been studying the role of ADAR proteins in animals, which alter gene expression by changing adenosine to inosine in RNA and binding to regulatory elements in RNAs. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, lacking ADARs have reduced chemotaxis, the ability to move towards or away from chemicals. However, the targets of ADAR responsible for this defect were unknown. To identify critical AD targets in C. elegans, researchers analyzed the effects of ADR-2, the only adenosine-to-inosine enzyme in C. elegans, on the neural transcriptome. They used software SAIL to identify 736 adenosine-to-inos events across the neural transcriptome and intersected it with ADR-2 associated gene changes. This revealed edited mRNA, cle-41, whose expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring cle-41 in ADR-2 deficient cells rescued chemaxis, providing evidence that phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered gene expression.

The study aimed to understand the neurobiological effects of RNA editing in worms by dissecting the gene role of ADR-2 in C. elegans. ADs play critical roles in editing codons of neuronal transcripts to generate proteomic diversity for proper function in mammals. However, data indicate aberrant phenotypes caused by lack C. elegans ADR are due to altered gene expression, not recoding events. This is the first study linking a phenotype with loss C eleg AD enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a gene.

The study provided analysis of tissue-specific ADR, adenos-to-inine in regulating gene in C. elegans. Combining neural isolation with RNA-sequencing and editing detection with SAIL, identified over 730 adenos-in sites in C. eleg neural transcript, including 104 novel genes. C eleg suggests changes not observed in whole worm analysis. Previous studies showed worms lacking ADR exhibit defects in chemaxis, yet mechanism unknown. To elucidate ADR target RNAs important for proper function, the editome was queried for genes in chemaxis locomotion.
Influenza A virus (IAV) uses a strategy called host shutoff to repress cellular mRNA translation and allow efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Researchers used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore how IAV induces host shutoff. They found that viral mRNAs are preferentially translated and cellular protein synthesis declines due to viral takeover of the mRNA pool. The study also showed variability in levels of cellular reduction, revealing short mRNAs are less affected by IAV. mRNAs refractory to IAV are enriched in maintenance processes like oxidative phosphorylation. Continuous phosphorylation is important for viral propagation. The study advances understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggests a mechanism for translation of genes with housekeeping functions.

The analysis shows viral translation efficiencies within host range, indicating viral mRN are preferentially translated during IAV. Co-opting of machinery does not play dominant role in gene shutoff. Instead, sh stems from viral dominance over mRNA. At 8 hours post-infection, viralRNAs take over 53% of translation activity, while 57% of mRNAs are viral. This shows reduction in cellular expression is main cause of sh during infection. Results consistent with NS not required for sh of cell production. To access host machinery, viruses use sh mechanisms that eliminate competition from transcripts. Sh can be achieved by two mechanisms: co-opt of machinery that forces viralRN better than host, or elimination of cellular transcripts. Poliovirus employs this strategy, with 8 hours viralRN take 53% of activity, 57% mRN in cells.
Researchers have long known that gradients of signaling proteins, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), play a crucial role in shaping tissues during development. However, how these gradients are formed has been unclear. A new study in fruit flies, Drosophila, sheds light on this mystery. The study found that the protein FGF, called Branchless (Bnl), moves from its source in the wing imaginal disc to the air sac-primord (ASP) through specialized structures called cytonemes that contain the FGF receptor FGFR. The number of these cyemes decreases with distance from the source, creating a specific F gradient. F acts as a morphogen in the ASP, activating gene expression at higher and lower levels. Two transcription factors, Pointed-P and Cut, regulate the formation of FG-containing cyemes, creating regions with higher and lower numbers of F-receiving cyemes. This mechanism shows how morphogens can self-generate precise tissue-specific contours through feedback regulation of cyeme-mediated dispersion.

The study aimed to understand how cyeme-mediated cell-to-cell communication creates long-range signals for tissue morphogenesis. Drosila B is the primary signal guiding branching of tracheal epithelial tubes. Traditionally, paracrine signals like F proteins are thought to diffuse and form a gradient by passive extracellular dispersion. However, this study found that Dila B moves through cyemes, not diffusing in the extracellular space. Instead, the shape of the B gradient adapts to tissue morphology through feedback regulation of cyemes. The study focused on the Dila larval ASP, where the wing source is separated from the recipient epithelium. The findings show an example of morphogenesis where cyeme signaling provides precision and adaptability in long-range gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.
Researchers have long understood the structure of α-helical coiled coils, a common protein fold, thanks to their ability to be described by parametric equations. This level of understanding has allowed for detailed manipulation and design of these proteins. Despite this, a new type of fiber has been discovered by inserting two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel trimeric coiled coil. This insertion strains the coil, causing the formation of short strands that move 120 degrees around the trimer axis. The result is an α/β coiled, retaining one backbone bond from the parent coil. The study shows a novel structure is possible within allowed regions of Ramachand space with minor mutations to known folds.

α-hel coiled coils are found in various structures and functions, first described in atomic detail in 1953. They are the only fold whose structure can be computed with parametric equations, making them a focus of design efforts. However, insertions of 2 and 6 residues, causing greatest strain on α-hical geometry, were not well understood. This study finds they break α-hices to form β strands, associating into a superstructure called β-layer. A minimal αβ coiled can be made by removing α-hical residues and one bond from parent, built of hexads with 3 in β and 3 in Ramand plot.

β-layers are found in coiled, forming fibers with α and β-structure, a new fold. The first β-layer is a 6-residue hex, after hept position, biased towards c. With alternating α and β-layers, αβ coiled is a new fiber based on superstructure.
Researchers have been trying to understand the role of a protein called epsin in the process of endocytosis, which is how cells take in substances from outside their environment. Epsin is a protein that works with another protein called clathrin, which forms a coat around the substance to be taken in. To study its function, scientists created mice without eps and looked at how their cells behaved. They found that without eps, cells had trouble dividing and taking in clrin-coated substances. This was due to a problem with the clrin coat and the cell's actin skeleton, which is like a framework inside the cell.

The researchers also found that eps helps the clrin coat invaginate, or fold inward, to form a pit. This is important for the pit to break off from the cell and become a vesicle. Eps does this by interacting with another protein called SNARE, which helps vesicles fuse with their target membranes. However, other proteins like clrin can also organize the actin skeleton, so it's not clear if eps is the only one responsible.

A previous study used RNA to knock down eps in cells and found a similar problem with clrin endocyt, but thought it was at the fission, or breaking off, stage. This new study shows eps is important earlier, at the invagination stage. Eps also interacts with a SNARE called synaptobrevin/VAMP2, which is needed for vesicles to fuse with membranes. The study suggests eps is critical at the transition from shallow to deep pits.
Researchers conducted a case-control study to investigate the risk factors for asthma among children aged 5-17 in urban Uganda. The study included 555 cases and 111 controls, with asthma diagnosed by clinicians. The main risk factors for asthma were:

* Tertiary education for fathers (adjusted OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.71-3.16) and mothers (1.85, 1.38-2.48)
* Area of residence at birth, with children born in small towns or cities having increased risk compared to those born in rural areas (2.16,1.60-2.92) and (2.79,1.79-4.35) respectively
Father and mother's history of asthma
Children's allergic conditions and atopy
Cooking with gas/electric

Asthma was associated with a strong rural-city risk gradient and higher socio-economic status and urbanicity. The study found that children born in towns and cities had a higher risk of asthma compared to those born in rural areas. This risk increased with other risk factors such as parental history of allergic disease, children's atopy, and higher socio-economic status and urbanicity.

Children with asthma were older and more likely to have parents with tertiary education and a history of asthma. Compared to those born in rural, children born in towns or cities had increased risk of asthma (2.16,1.60-2.92) and (2.79,1.79-4.35). Rapid urbanization in Africa and other low-income countries will likely increase asthma prevalence. This study provides basis for future investigating environmental and lifestyle factors increasing risk in urban areas.

Even without parental history of disease, being born in town (2.15,1.35-3.44) or city (3.33,1.61-6.90) increased asthma risk compared to rural. With parental history of disease, risk increased from rural (2.78,1.58-4.89) town (5.16,3.201).
In zebraf (Danio rerio) pattern formation requires interactions between three pigment cell types: melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. However, the molecular basis of these interactions is poorly understood. Mutations in the leopard (leo) gene, which encodes connexin 41.8 (Cx.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a series of spotted patterns. A new allele, leot3, leads to a complete loss of pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. A genetic screen identified this component as connex 39.4 (Cx.4). Loss-of-function alleles show Cx4 is required for stripe formation in zebraf, but fins are not affected. Double mutants and chimeras show leo and Cx are required in melanoph and xanthores, but not iridoph, suggesting both connex form heteromeric gap junctions. Phenotypes indicate these promote homotypic interactions between melanoph and xanthores, and instruct patterning of iridoph.

Fish homozygous for leot3 or trans-hetergous for leot overot show identical dissolved pattern. Individual melanoph cluster together, mostly with iridoph. Connexin 41.8 is depicted with mutation positions. Gap junctions of two hemi-channels in cells, each hem made of six connex subunits, can be identical (homomeric) or different (heteric). Heterom/heteric junction schematically shown. Amino acid alignment of zraf Cx.8 with human orthologue G5 shown, transmembrane shaded grey. Newly identified mutations Connex 41.8 highlighted: leNR:66, le:79, le022:85, le:152.

Homozyg leot3 phenotype stronger than, indicating mutant Cx.8 present leot has dominant effect on further component in pattern. Model additional factor could connex involved in formation heterom junction with C.8, notion previously suggested by leq (Watan et al, 2006). The mutant phenotype wild-type zraf show pattern on body and tail fins. At magnification, melan in regions and xanth in light regions. Mutants homo forot and heterg forot, stripes dissolved. Clusters melan visible. This indicates expansion iridoph associated mutant indirect, possibly xanth covering irid. Data suggest Cx and Cx interact formom gap and channels responsible interactions among chromat while pattern established.
Researchers studied the evolution of the sense of smell in insects, also known as olfaction, in three ancient insect species: the bristail Lepachilis signata, the firebrat Thermobia domestica, and the leaf insect Phyllium sifium. They found that these insects use different types of receptors to detect odor molecules, called olfactory (OR) and ionotropic (IR) receptors, and in some cases, gustatory (GR) receptors. OR receptors are found in the olfactory organs of all insects, but are thought to have evolved as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. However, the study suggests that OR did not evolve for this reason, but instead appeared later in insect evolution, with the coreceptor Orco present before OR.

The study focused on neopter insects, a group of insects that includes butterflies, beetles, and flies, and ants, and found that the identity of receptors involved in olfaction in ancient insects is unknown. Data suggests that the coreceptor Or evolved after the bristails split from their common ancestor with other insects. The olfactory system that uses both OR and Or evolved after the emergence of wings.

Insects have a unique olfactory system composed of at least one ligand-specific OR and coreceptor Or. The study selected insects at crucial positions of the phylogenetic tree with olfactory adapted to terrestrial conditions and detection of chemicals. The species provide a model to study the early evolution of the olfactory system. Researchers used several approaches to identify receptors involved in odor detection in insects and basal insects. Neopter insects recognize volatile by members of the olfactory family OR. OR are multitransmembrane proteins unrelated to vertebrate olfactory, displaying distinct topology.

The study found that Lepachilis lacks OR and Orco, Thermobia has three Orco candidates, and Phium has a fully developed OR/Or system. The results suggest that OR did not evolve for terrestrial lifestyle, but later in insect evolution, with Orco present before OR.
Researchers conducted a study in Myanmar to investigate the effectiveness of mass antimalarial drug administration (MDA) in reducing malaria cases of Plasmodium falciparum. The study took place in four villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border, where MDA was implemented to control the spread of the disease. The study found that areas with low adherence to MDA had 2.85 times the odds of malaria episodes post-M compared to areas with high adherence, suggesting a herd effect. This means that even if individuals did not participate in M, being in an area with low adherence increased their risk of getting malaria. High mosquito rates, living with someone with malaria, or having asymptomatic infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence in villages, even with high overall participation, may hinder elimination efforts.

The study aimed to examine the potential herd effect of MDA and its impact on non-adherence. It found a group effect from M adherence, providing protection evident from three lines of evidence. Clinical episodes decreased among all groups for longer than the prophylactic effect of antimal drugs. The study used data from a previous M trial in Myanmar and investigated associations between individual and group participation in M, subclinical infections, and clinical episodes post-M. This research provides evidence for further intervention and policy.

The study consisted of four villages in Kayin State, Myanmar, selected based on malaria prevalence using ultrasensitive PCR. The villages were part of a M pilot study. The study found a herd effect from M, with clinical episodes decreasing for longer than the prophactic effect of antimal drugs. Adjusting for individual M adherence and other predictors, having a clinical episode increased. This is the first documentation of a herd effect by M for P. falcipar malaria. The increase in episodes post-M corresponded to an increase in house biting rate.
Researchers studied the binding specificities of 242 transcription factors (TFs) in fruit flies and compared them to humans and mice. They found that the binding specificities of TFs are highly conserved between the two species, meaning they are very similar. This conservation extends to the level of subtle nucleotide preferences, suggesting that TF specificities are not subject to significant change over time. The study also found that TFs with divergent specificities in humans are not found in fruit flies, indicating that evolution of TF specificities contributes to the emergence of new cell types.

The researchers used a method called HT-LEX to determine TF specificities in fruit flies. They found that flies have almost as complex a repertoire of TF motifs as humans. The conservation of specificity extends to secondary modes of binding and subtle nucleotide preferences. This suggests that TF specificities are not subject to significant change over time. The study also found that TFs that belong to the same family bind similar sites, such as zinc finger and homeodomain proteins.

The study also found that ortholog TFs, which are genes that diverged over 600 million years ago, have almost identical DNA binding profiles, flanking sequences, and modes of binding. This suggests that TF specificities are conserved over long periods of time. The study extends the repertoire of fruit TF specificities by providing 122 high-resolution motifs and sheds light on new features of fruit DNA-binding TFs.
Researchers have developed a new way to grow human stem cells into both heart and lung tissue at the same time. This is important because the heart and lung develop together in the womb and need to work together properly. They used a type of stem cell called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that can become many different types of cells. They added special signals to the cells to make them become heart and lung cells at the same time. The cells grew in a special 3D shape and formed a small heart and lung together. When they removed the signal, the heart and lung separated and started to work on their own. This is a new way to study how heart and lung develop together in the womb and how they work together.

The researchers grew the cells in 3D shape and they separated into heart and lung. This is a new way to study how heart and lung work together in the womb. The heart and lung work together in the womb and need to work properly. The researchers used special signals to make the cells become heart and lung at same time. The cells grew in 3D and formed heart and lung together. When they removed signal, heart and lung separated and started work on own.

Scientists have long believed that the rate at which an organism's DNA changes, or mutates, is a slow and unchanging trait. However, a new research shows that this is not always the case. In certain situations, such as when an organism is exposed to a stressful environment, like high levels of ethanol, the mutation rate can quickly increase to help the organism adapt. This is known as hypermutation. The study found that in E. coli bacteria, a type of bacteria, when exposed to high levels of ethanol, the mutation rate increased to help the bacteria adapt to the stress. However, once the bacteria adapted to the stress, the mutation rate decreased. The researchers also found that the rate of cell death, or mortality, was the main driver of this quick change in mutation rate. This means that when cells are under stress, they are more likely to mutate to survive. The study sheds new light on how organisms balance between being robust and adaptable, and how this helps explain the prevalence of high mutation rates in various situations, such as the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapse during chemotherapy. The study used E. coli exposed to high ethanol as a model to understand the dynamics of hypermutation under stress. The researchers found that multiple mutations interacted and led to adaptation to high concentrations of ethanol. In addition to increased mutation rate, they found that hypermut states were temporary and rates decreased once cells adapted to the stressful environment. The study identified mortality as the major modulator of population rate.
Researchers have identified a key player in how plants respond to low energy conditions, a protein called bZIP63, which is regulated by a kinase called SnRK1. Sn1. When energy is low, Sn.1 phosphorylates b63, changing its ability to bind to other proteins, affecting gene expression and metabolism. Without b63, plants show signs of starvation, which can be fixed by adding normal b63, but not a version with mutations in Sn.1 target sites. Sn.1 is the main kinase responsible for phosphorylating b63, making it the first direct target in transcription response to low energy. b63 is important in regulating metabolism, especially under stress, and is phosphorylated in a sugar and energy-dependent manner. Sn1 is one of the kinases responsible for b63 phosphorylation, targeting three conserved serines in its N and C-terminus. Overexpressing b63 in plants shows Sn1 phosphorylates b63 in vivo. Phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for b63 dimerization and activity in planta. A model proposes phosphorylation-triggered switch of b63 dimer partners, regulating reprogramming.
Researchers have identified a new protein called Ring finger 10 (RNF10) that acts as a messenger between synapses, the connections between neurons, and the nucleus, the control center of a cell's genetic material. NF10 is activated by signals at the synapse, the connection between two neurons, and triggers changes in gene expression. NF is found at excitatory synapses, where it binds to a part of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) called Glu2. Activation of Glu2-containing NMD and long-term potentiation, a strengthening of neural connections, leads to NF moving from the synapse to the nucleus.

 NF dissociates from the NMD complex in an activity-dependent manner and is transported to the nucleus through a process called importin-dependent long-distance transport. The Gl2 subunit of NMD has sequences for signaling and scaffolding molecules. NF and CaM share the same Gl2 binding region. NF is a novel synapse-nuclear messenger for long-lasting changes in dendritic spines after synaptic stimuli and for post-synaptic modifications to induce long-term potentiation.

NF silencing prevents long-term potentiation and structural changes in dendritic spines. NF is highly expressed in nucleus and synapses where it is part of NMD complex and directly interacts with Gl2 subunit of NMDs. Activation of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDs increases NF nuclear localization. This study describes a synapse-nucle pathway linking Gl2-containing NMDs to gene expression. NF is highly expressed in nucleus and synapses where it is part of NMD complex and directly interacts with Gl subunit of Ns.
Researchers have determined the structure of the Mot1 protein bound to a complex of TATA-binding protein (TBP), DNA, and transcription regulator cofactor 2 (NC), providing insights into how Swi/Snf ATPases remodel DNA-protein complexes. Mot1, a single subunit remodeler, dissociates TBP:DNA:NC complexes, making it a useful system to study Swi/Snf ATPases. The structure shows Mot1 reduces DNA:NC interactions and unbends DNA compared to TBP:DNA:NC, suggesting Mot primes TBP:NC displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data reveal Mot's Swi/Snf domain associates with upstream DNA and histone of NC, similar to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a framework for Swi/Snf ATPase interaction with DNA-protein complex.

Swi/Snf-type ATPases regulate chromatin structure and epigenetic state during transcription, replication, and repair. Mot, an essential regulator, is a model for studying Sw/S enzymes. Binding Mot causes subtle conformation changes between proteins and DNA, priming for ATP disruption. The Mot and NC interface in the structure is small, but Mot's insertion could separate NC's TBP helix from DNA. Here, a pseudoatomic structure of Sw/S enzyme bound to protein-substrate and a framework for Mot with T:DNA:NC is provided. Sw/S enzymes remodel complexes by disrupting nucle-protein interfaces.

Researchers crystallized Mot1NT with TBP, NC, and TATA DNA and present the structure at 3.8 resolution with biochemical, microscopy, and cross studies. This is the first pseudo view of Sw/S ATPase with DNA-substrate. ATP hydrolysis translocation could provide force, but is binding remodel conformation changes in target. Association with T:NC results in conformation changes, implications for ATP-dependent dissociation.
Researchers have developed synthetic variants of a natural compound called ternatin, which is toxic to cancer cells and blocks cell growth. Ternatin's mode of action was unknown, but its structure was partially understood. The new variants are up to 500 times more potent than the original ternatin. A probe was used to identify the target of tern, which is the elongation factor-1 ternary complex (EF1·G·aminoacy-tRNA). Other natural products, didnin and cyrien, also bind to this complex and block tern's effects. Mutations in EF1's domain prevent tern binding and resistance to its effects, indicating a hydrophobic surface as a functional spot for EF modulation. The elongation factor-1 and its complex with G and amino-tRNA are common targets for cytotoxic natural products.

Ternatin and its variants inhibit protein synthesis, with compound 4 being the most potent. The elongation factor-1 tern complex (EF·G·amino-t) is a direct target of tern-related peptides. Tern's potency correlates with blocking cell proliferation and photo-tern identifies EF1 as a target. Surprisingly, photo-tern binds to purified EF1 only in its complex with G and amino-tRNA. This is the first report of a small molecule binding to the EF tern complex.

The study aimed to identify tern's target, a potent adipogenesis inhibitor. Inspired by its structure and activity, compounds 3 and 4 were designed, up to 500 times more potent than tern. Whether this blocks translation by a mechanism like kirromycin, suggested by tern's sensitivity, is a future question. Two unrelated products, didnin and ansenin, compete with tern for EF binding. Four natural products now identified as EF inhibitors, tern may be leads for medicinal chemistry due to simplicity and synthesis.
Researchers have found that mutations in the OCRL gene, which causes Lowe syndrome and Dent disease, affect clathrin-coated pit dynamics and endocytosis. Clrin is a protein that helps cells take in substances from outside the cell. OCRL is a partner of clrin, but its role was not well understood. The study shows that OCRL is important for clrin endocyt, the process of taking in substances from outside the cell. Without OCRL, cells have trouble with clrin endyt and endocytic vesicles accumulate. These vesicles fail to lose their coat and have many actin comets. Actin is a protein that helps with cell movement and shape. SN9, a protein that helps late endytic pits, binds to OCRL and stays with endytic vesicles. This suggests OCRL helps uncoat endytic vesicles, a step in endocyt. Without OCRL, endyt is delayed and actin comets form from endytic vesicles that don't uncoat.

The study found that SN9, a clrin protein with late endytic pits, binds OCRL. They looked at OCRL's role in clrin endyt in Lowe syndrome cells. Without OC, endytic clrin coat is impaired and endytic is defective. Cells have clrin vesicles that fail to uncoat. A model shows OCRL's impact on cl endyt in Lowe syndrome. OC's 5-phatase delays endyt by stalling pits, impairs unating, and triggers act com from endytic ves that don't uncoat. Cells have many actin com, previously seen in Lowe patients.

The study suggests OC helps uncoat and recycle endytic factors, needed for endyt. OC's lack affects endyt completion. Defects in clrin endyt not reported in Lowe cells. They looked at clrin pit dynamics in patient and control cells by time-lapse. Lowe cells have many act com driven by clrin ves, supporting link between endytic clrin and act.
Researchers have identified a new pathway that contributes to the development of colorectal cancer, a type of cancer that affects the colon and rectum. The pathway involves a protein called Wnt/β-caten, which is already known to be involved in cancer, but finding a way to stop it has been a challenge. The study found that a protein called FAK/PYK helps activate W/βaten by phosphorylating another protein called GSKβ, leading to more W/aten accumulation and cancer growth. This was seen in mice with a genetic mutation that makes them prone to cancer and in human cancer tissues. Inhibiting F/PYK stopped cancer growth in mice and reduced Waten levels. The study shows that F/PYK and GSK interaction is key to W/aten activation in cancer.
Researchers investigated how the vestibular system, which helps with balance and stability, controls transitions between different motor states such as standing and walking. They found that the vestibular system's influence on balance is suspended before transitioning from standing to walking and vice versa. This suggests a change in motor control policy, as predicted by optimal theory, where one control is disengaged before another is implemented. The study used electrical vestibular stimuli (EV) and measured ground reaction forces to quantify the relationship. Discontinuities in coherence were observed before movement initiation and termination.

The vestibular system encodes head motion in space and is crucial for balance during standing and walking. It influences muscle activation for posture control. To transition between motor states, balance responses are disrupted. Before transitions, vestibular influence on whole-body balance is suspended. Suspension of vestibular-evoked responses occurs at movement start while still standing upright, before onset. Suspension is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting a general process between standing and other motor states. Results show humans stop balancing before moving and moving before balancing again.

The suspension period of vestibular-evoked responses relates to different sensory gains for quiet and locomotor control. During standing, whole-body accelerations and oscillations are small. An adaptive controller is used. Vestibular control during locomotor-posture transitions can be monitored by quantifying vestib-evoked responses over the transition. A similar approach has been used to monitor engagement and disengagement of vestibular balance between self and externally-driven states.
Researchers have identified a key function of the circadian pathway in cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria that produces energy through photosynthesis. The pathway is controlled by a transcription factor called RPA, which regulates gene expression across the entire genome. In constant light conditions, deletion of RPA has no effect, but in alternating light and dark periods, cells become inviable. The study found that RPA- strain cannot maintain energy at night, does not accumulate carbon during day, and is defective in transcription of genes for carbohydrate utilization at night. Providing external carbon source restores energy and viability in RPA strain in light/dark conditions. This highlights the circadian pathway's role in coordinating carbon metabolism to maximize cell fitness in periodic energy limitations.

 The study found that accumulation and utilization of carbon reserves for energy during darkness are defective in RPA strain, and correcting these defects restores viability. Results show the circadian pathway's role in enhancing cyanobacteria fitness through coordination of central metabolism with environmental demands. Circadian output by RPA activity is required for anticipatory carbon accumulation during day and metabolic switching to catabolism at dusk. These adaptations allow cells to produce energy and sustain viability during dark periods that constrain resources for cyanobacterial growth.

 Exposure to darkness restricts energy, creating unique demands in cyanobacteria that depend on sunlight for production. The RPA strain exhibits defects in growth and viability in cyclic, not constant environments, suggesting circadian regulation in lightark cycles. The phosphorylated form of RPA, regulated by circadian, is critical for coordination of anabolism and catabism and viability in lightark. Deletion of RPA prevents glycogen accumulation and renders cells unable to utilize glycogen at dusk, leading to energy alterations and fitness reduction. However, glycogen degradation activity is low in RPA strain, making this scenario less likely. Data support a model where anticipation of dark resource limitation is a role of cyanobacterial circadian.
Transition metal ions, such as zinc, are essential for all living organisms but toxic in excess. Heavy metal-transporting P-type (P) ATPases are crucial for homeostasis, removing and redistributing these ions across cell membranes. However, little is known about P-4-ATPases, the subclass with the broadest scope, and their structure remains unclear. Researchers studied an archetypal P-4-ATPase, CoT from Sulfitacter sp. NAS-1, and found a new insights into heavy-metal transport. They discovered a novel P-ATP features, including a role in metal release and an internal counter ion, histidine. Also, P-ATase turnover is independent of potassium, unlike other P-ATPases. This opens up new avenues for drug discovery, as P-ATases are virulence factors in many pathogens.

P-ATases are subdivided into groups based on sequence and selectivity towards transition ions. Cu and Zn-transporting P-1 and P-2-ATPases are well-characterized, but little is known about P- proteins, the simplest within P-AT superfamily. Researchers used P- model CoT to shed light on structure and mechanism. The ion specificity of P-AT is wide, so activity was assessed in vitro using the Baginski assay with different metals. This represents leads for drug efforts to manipulate heavy-metal accumulation in plants.

The structure of P-AT reveals an eight-helix configuration and no heavy-binding domains, at least members without N-termin. P-ases are critical for heavy-metal homeostasis, effluxing copper, zinc, and cobalt from the cellular milieu. The ability to adapt to heavy levels is paramount, as essential for cellular processes yet toxic elevated.
Researchers have identified a unique chromatin signature that distinguishes genes with mitotically stable allelic expression (MA) in human cells. This signature is characterized by the simultaneous presence of active (H3K36me) and silencing (H3me) marks in the gene body. The MA signature is found in about 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among developmental genes with bivalent chromatin in pluripotent cells. The study opens a new approach to studying MA independent of polymorphisms and suggests MA is linked to cell differentiation.

Applying the approach to various cell types, up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed and over one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin of MA. Detection of MA does not rely on SNPs or sample clonality, making it feasible for analysis in primary samples, including comparisons of normal and diseased tissue. Among widely expressed genes, about 20% have chromatin characteristic MA in at least one tissue. Tissue-specific genes as a group, 39-48% have MA pattern. Genes with MA chromatin share features as a group.

MA in clones is reflected by chrom in polycl sample. To test the chromatin as predictor of MA state, genes with MA pattern were identified and allelic bias in monoclonal lines. Calculated gene-body signal for H3me and H3me for autosomal Ref genes on ENCODEIP data GM78 lymphoblast cells. A large fraction of bivalent genes acquire MA chromatin in differentiated types, higher than silent in ES. Upon activation, master genes preferentially resolve MA chromatin.
Researchers have discovered a new way to control the activity of a protein called Clp, which is essential for bacterial survival and resistance to stress. Clp is a type of AAA+ chaper, a protein that helps to unfold and remove damaged or misfolded proteins. However, its activity needs to be tightly regulated to avoid harming the cell. The team found that coiled-coil domains, a specific part of the Clp protein, play a crucial role in controlling its activity. In its resting state, Clp forms a large assembly with other Clp molecules through head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil domains. This prevents Clp from interacting with substrates and ATP, which is necessary for its activity. When an adaptor protein called MecA binds, it changes the structure of Clp, allowing it to interact with substrates and perform its function. Mutations in the coiled-coil region of Clp cause it to be always active, leading to cellular toxicity. This study shows that coiled-coil domains are a new way to control AAA+ protein activity, and could be a target for antimicrobials.
Researchers used the fruit fly Drosophila to study how stem cells called adult precursors (AMP) remain in a dormant state and how they are reactivated. They found that these cells send out thin extensions called filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles and keep this contact throughout their dormant state. This suggests that muscles may play a role in reactivating AMP. Genetic analysis showed that muscles send signals that turn on the insulin pathway in AMP, leading to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dyc. The study reveals that Dophila AMP interact with muscle niche and the niche-driven insulin-Not-dyc cascade plays a key role in reactivating AMP.

In Doph, muscle cells called adult precursors (AMP) emerge during embryonic development and express muscle-specific markers. They lie dormant during embryonic and most larval life but activate to proliferate and provide myoblast for adult growth and regeneration. Myc promotes myoblast proliferation during development and regeneration. Researchers tested if dyc was involved in AMP reactivation in Doph and found it is required for reactivation and proliferation. Genetic experiments show Not acts downstream insulin and dyc downstream Not.

Data suggest muscle behaves as AMP niche and plays role in reactivating AMP in larval life. A scheme illustrates muscle-induced insulin/Not/dyc cascade reactivating dormant AMP.
Scientists have long known that certain neurons in the brain fire at high rates, which is crucial for their function in brain circuits. One type of these neurons, the GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SN), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide tonic inhibition to downstream brain areas. To understand how SN neurons maintain this activity, researchers used single-cell sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual SN neurons. They found that SN neurons express the sodium channel NAL, and SN lacking NAL have impaired firing. NAL is also involved in modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The study suggests disruption of NAL could impair basal gang circuit, leading to severe motor deficits in humans with NAL mutations.

The researchers used single-cell sequencing to determine the gene profile of SN neurons and found that sodium channel NAL was the highest expressed. The molecular basis of this current is important to understand its properties and regulation in SN inhibition of basal gang targets. To address this, they performed transcript sequencing of SN neurons and detected several channels that could generate depolarizing current. They found SN express NAL, a prime candidate for carrying depolar current in cells. SN require NAL for tonic firing, suggesting NAL mutations contribute to basal gang related disorders. Disruption of normal firing by GABA agonists leads to muscle tension and dystonia, and hyperactivity in Parkinsonian animals. NAL is a promising candidate as it had highest expression of all channels and in top 20% of ion channels. SN also express Unc, Unc, and Fam, genes interacting with NAL.
Researchers have developed a new method to cultivate and identify bacteria that produce antibiotics, which could lead to the discovery of new medicines to combat antibiotic-resistant infections. Traditional methods to grow bacteria in a lab are limited and often fail to find new species. The new approach uses tiny droplets of liquid, each containing a single cell, to mimic natural environments where bacteria live. This allows for a large number of bacteria to be grown and tested at once, increasing the chances of finding new species. The droplets can be stored and incubated under controlled conditions, allowing for long-term growth. A reporter bacteria is added to the droplets to detect antibiotic production, making it easier to identify promising candidates.

The new method was tested on a soil sample and compared to traditional agar plate cultivation. One isolate showed antimicrobial activity in the droplets, and its secreted compounds were identified. The droplets provide a link between a bacteria's genetic makeup and what it produces, keeping compounds with the cell they originated from. A large number of droplets can be stored and incubated, making it possible to test many bacteria at once.

The combination of growing bacteria in droplets and screening for antibiotic production streamlines the process of finding new antibiotics. A modular platform was created to mimic environmental conditions, allowing long-term growth of 2 million cells in 1.5 mL. Reporter bacteria were added to detect antibiotic production in droplets. The approach was combined with a screening step to select droplets containing cells producing compounds with activity. New species isolated from droplets could not be maintained in traditional lab conditions, but provided high-quality genome information.
Researchers studied the link between a genetic variation in the leukotriene A hydrolase (LTAH) gene and survival in patients with tuberculous meningitis, a severe inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Tuberculous meningitis has a high mortality rate, but anti-inflammatory medication reduces mortality by only 30%, suggesting that inflammation is not the only cause of death. In Vietnam, patients with the C/T variant of the LH gene had better survival when given anti-inflammatory medication, while those with the TT variant had increased expression and benefited from the medication. However, a study in Indonesia did not find a survival benefit for the TT variant.

Using a statistical method called Bayesian analysis, researchers combined the two studies and found that the LH TT genotype gives a survival benefit that starts early and lasts long-term in both populations. However, this benefit is lost in the most severe cases with high mortality. The researchers suggest that testing the LH genotype with disease severity could target medication to those most likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.

A previous study supported the idea that mortality from tubulous meningitis is due to two types of inflammation, and LH might be a key to the response to anti-inflammatory treatment. If true, personalized treatment could be given to those with the TT variant. Another study found that the LH effect might be limited in severe patients because the cohort was skewed towards severe disease presentation, or the association was overridden by disease, a strong correlate of mortality. The beneficial effect of medication to the LH group may not have time to play in severe patients. A second possibility is that severe patients had dysregulated inflammation not revealed by standard metrics, making corticoids no longer beneficial.
Scientists have long known that axons, the long extensions of nerve cells that transmit signals, navigate their way through the brain and body in response to guidance cues. However, it was unclear how they translate these cues into movement. Researchers found that a protein called shootin plays a crucial role in this process. They discovered that mice without shoot, axons in the brain's forebrain region grow abnormally, similar to those without a protein called netrin, which guides axons. Netrin creates a gradient, or slope, that shootin responds to by changing its shape, or phosphorylation. This change allows shoot to interact with another protein, L-CAM, which helps axons move. The team found that this interaction is necessary for axons to turn in response to netrin's gradient. They also found that shoot's phosphorylation must be spatially regulated, or in the right place, for axons to turn correctly. This study reveals how netrin's signal is translated into movement and shows shoot's role in guiding axons.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the unique humming sound made by hummingbirds as they fly, known as their "humming." To understand this phenomenon, researchers studied six freely hovering hummingbirds using a 217 microphone array to record their acoustic field and a new aerodynamic platform to measure the forces on their wings. They found that the humming sound is created by the oscillating lift and drag forces on the wings. This is different from other birds and insects, which produce sound from higher harmonics in the forces that support their body weight.

The researchers used a new aerodynamic platform to measure the three-dimensional forces on the bird's wings, including steady and unsteady components up to three times the wingbeat frequency. They combined this data with microphone recordings to create a model that predicts the sound generated by the oscillating forces. The model assumes the wings are rigid, neglecting other factors like wing movement and feather dynamics.

The study found that hummingbirds generate a directional hum, with pressure oriented downward, and harmonics depending on frequency. The model was tested with recordings of six hummingbirds, confirming its accuracy. This suggests oscillating forces play a key role in creating the humming sound.

Comparing birds and insects, the researchers found that larger, more elongated birds are quieter, while smaller, more compact ones are louder. This is due to differences in aerodynamic forces and wing movement. The study clarifies complex acoustic behavior in birds and insects.
Scientists have long debated the roles of chance and necessity in the evolution of proteins, but have never studied them together on a timescale relevant to evolution. Researchers used a new technology to mutate and select proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family to acquire protein-protein interactions that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from ancestral proteins, they found that chance was not the primary cause of sequence variation, even under strong selection. Instead, contingency, or the outcome of historical events, was the main driver. This suggests that present-day B-2 proteins and others are unique products of their unpredictable histories, shaped by chance, physics, chemistry, and selection.

The study challenges the idea that selection, drift, and mutation are primary factors in evolution. Contingency generated sequence change over long timescales plays a role in B-2 protein evolution under selection for new functions. The researchers used human and NO as binding partners, but during evolution these proteins varied, introducing chance and contingency to affect outcomes. The study's design may have overestimated chance's historical role due to additional biological dimensions of B- function, imposing constraints on evolution.

The results show paths leading to protein interactions changed during B- history, even when profiles did not evolve. For chance to influence evolution, multiple paths to a phenotype must be accessible with similar probabilities.
Researchers have used a genome-wide haplotype analysis to study the genetic diversity and gene flow in 48 sub-Saharan African populations. They found that coastal populations have received Eurasian haplotypes over the last 700 years, and Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo groups share ancestry with Central Africans due to recent expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry from outside their region due to gene flow in the last 400 years. This study provides insight into haplotype sharing across ethno-linguistic groups and movement of alleles into new environments, relevant to genetic epidemiology.

The researchers also identified dominant events that shaped current diversity in sub-Saharan Africa and discussed relevance to genotype-phenotype associations. They found clear evidence of Eurasian ancestry moving into the continent through admixture over various timescales. A study of 18 ethnic groups from eight countries showed Eurasian and hunter-gather ancestry's influence on sub-Saharan population history and movement of alleles and haplotype into the continent. However, the extent and timing of events and impact on contemporary populations remain unclear.

The study reveals broad geographic patterns and finer scales, differentiating closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry. Gene flow between populations relates to historical movements into and within sub-Saharan. Admixture occurs when ancestral groups mix, a common in human populations globally. Genome analyses refine previous models of Africa's history and impact on diversity.
Researchers studied how the mitotic spindle, a structure that separates chromosomes during cell division, adapts to changing cell size during early development in the frog Xenopus lae embryo. They created an in vitro system using extracts from embryos that mimicked the spindle size differences between early and later stages of development. They found that a protein called kinesin-13, kif2, drives spindle scaling by destabilizing microtubules, but its activity is inhibited in early stages by importin α, a receptor, and activated in later when import α partitions to the membrane. Altering spindle size in embryos impaired metaphase orientation, but chromosome segregation remained robust. This suggests spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a mechanism controlling microtule destabilization.

The researchers reconstituted spindle formation in embryo extracts to elucidate a mechanism that coordinates spindle size with cell during X. lavis development through differential activation of kines-13 k2. They identified a physiological effector that operates to scale the spindle during embryogenesis. By modifying spindle size without perturbing function, they found an important role for spindle in maintaining orientation in large cells of Xenopus. This suggests physical changes in cells can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical redistribution and steady-state activities. This is consistent with changes in meiotic to mitotic morphology observed in early development and suggests physical changes in cells can impact biochemical reactions altering spindle architecture.

In extracts, import α phosphorylation is thought to liberate from membrane into cytoplasm, promoting transport. Correcting nonspecific binding, they found k2 could retrieve ~10 times import α from stage 3 than stage 8 extracts. This suggests sufficient import α partitioning to alter interaction with k2. The identification mechanism enabled testing its significance during development. Observations suggest changes and spindle pathways accompany size and influence size. To determine size during vertebrate, they created an extract assembling spind in cytoplasm at any stage up midblast transition when divisions become asynchronous.
Scientists have discovered a new way that riboswitches, a type of RNA molecule, can control the production of purine, a building block of DNA and RNA, in bacteria. Riboswitches can act like a logic gates, making decisions based on multiple signals. In this case, two riboswitches bind to two different molecules, guanine and phosphoribos pyrophosphate (PR), to turn on or off the production of purine. This is called an IMPLY logic gate, a type of two-input logic gate. The discovery shows that ancient RNA could have controlled its own metabolism without proteins, supporting the idea that RNA was the first life form of life on Earth. 

 Riboswitches can be single or paired, and in this case, the paired ones bind to guanine and PR separately or together to make the logic gate work. Experiments showed that the interaction between the paired ribos is what makes the gate work, not just the individual parts. This is the first example of two paired ribos with different targets on the same platform, allowing a new type of logic. Other RNA systems have been found to sense and control molecules, showing complexity in ancient life. More two-input logic gates might be found in modern cells. If RNA used purine building blocks, ancient ribos that bind it might still be used today. This discovery shows complex devices can be made from RNA alone.
Researchers have long known that the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential affects the reliability of synaptic transmission. However, the source of this variability is unclear. The prevailing view is that release of a single vesicle (unives release, UVR) or multiple vesicles (multives release, MVR) reflects variability in vesicle release probability, which is supported by the calcium dependence of release. A new study using mouse brain slices demonstrates that the number of vesicles is regulated by the size of the readily releasable pool, upstream of vesicle probability. This means that protein kinase A and its vesicle target, synapsin, dynamically control release occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles without altering probability. These findings define molecular mechanisms that control MVR and functional diversity of synaptic signaling.

 The study suggests that diversity in calcium homeostasis and protein kinase A may contribute to variability in A and synapsin regulation across synapses. Recent models propose that vesicles transition between states: from loose to tighter tethering with release followed by calcium-triggered fusion, which may be akin to transitions from sites to docking prior fusion. MVR is widespread in the rodent CNS and appears to be the dominant mode in cortex. However, some synapses are limited to release of a single vesicle per zone, termed unives release, while others switch modes in activity-dependent.

The number of vesicles released from an active zone is the product of ves release probability and number available. The simplest explanation is that the readily releasable pool is a measure of release-competent vesicles per zone, controlled by synins and constraining number released. Surprisingly, this fundamental parameter has not been explored, leading focus on probability as principal of UVRM. High probability synapses display UVR, while low can exhibit MVR, illustrating that probability alone is insufficient to dictate release, pointing to contribution availability.
HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, packages its genetic material in a specific way that is not fully understood. The virus selects its own RNA from a mix of cellular RNAs, but how it does so is unclear. Researchers created a simplified system to study this process using purified RNAs, a recombinant HIV-1 G protein, and giant vesicles. They found that HIV-1 G selectively packages its 5' untranslated region in the presence of excess RNA. Mutations in the CACT domain of G, which affects self-assembly, abrogated selectivity. They also found that tRNA suppresses G membrane binding when G has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 G to package its RNA and self-assembly on membranes are interdependent.

The study suggests a model for HIV-1 selection where the NC domain of G is necessary but not sufficient for selective packaging of HIV-1 RNA. Most plasma membrane-prox genomic RNAs are moneric in absence of HIV- G, but in cells expressing G, moneric RNAs coalesce to dimers on membrane. The study highlights importance of membrane-localized G assembly in HIV-1 selection and packaging. Current data do not explain how cytosolic G assembles into particles that package dimer viral genomes. The researchers reconstituted selective packaging of HIV-1 in a system using giant unilellar vesicles, recomant HIV-1 G and purified RN. Lattice contacts conferring G ability to multize on membrane are crucial for selective packaging. The 5'UT is recruited by multized G without changes. Association of G with tRNA inhibits assembly.
