Researchers have long known that nervous systems use two types of communication: chemical and electrical synapses. Chemical synapses have distinct structures, while electrical synapses are defined by gap junctions between cells. However, it's unclear if electrical synapses need additional structures to work. Scientists studied single synapses in zebraf fish, where gap junctions and neurotransmitter release coexist. Using expansion microscopy, they mapped proteins at these synapses and found multiple gap junctions of different sizes. Most of the synapse surface was gap junctions and adherens junction components, suggesting a close relationship between them. Glutamate receptors were in small parts of the synapse, indicating most is an electrical synapse. The study found that electrical synapses operate with multiple gap junctions and adherens structures, providing insight into syn organization and diversity.

 Electrical synapses are less understood than chemical synapses, which have distinct pre and post-synaptic components. Gap junctions mediate electrical synapses, but it's unclear if other structures are needed. Researchers expanded zeb fish synapses and found multiple gap junctions with variable channels. Most of the syn surface was gap junction and adherens, with glutamate in small parts. This suggests synapses operate with multiple gap junctions and adherens, providing insight into syn organization and diversity.

Researchers studied the role of the pre-Bötzinger complex (preötC), a key generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm, and its neurons that project to the facial nucleus (7) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasacial activity. To understand the identity of 7-projecting preöt neurons, they used a combination of optogenetic and viral approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects facial pad activity with minimal effects on breathing. The effects were altered by the type of anesthetic and anesthetized or conscious states. The population of 7-projecting preöt neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved in autonomic regulation. Modulation of subgroups preöt neurons based on axonal projections is a strategy to understand mechanisms that coordinate breathing with motor and physiological behaviors. This is important as abnormal autonomic and oracial behaviors are associated with disease development and progression.

The study raised the question whether preöt7 neurons are part of the pre respiratory network or a distinct group. The data suggest facial projecting preöt neurons transmit rhythm rather than generate it. Photoinhibiting these neurons on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals. Selective photoin of preöt projecting to nucleus 7 should modulate oracial with minimal respiratory impact. A combinatorial viral approach was used with virus providing cre-recombin expression and retroaxonal delivery. Selective transduction and photoin pre facial premotor neurons affected activity minimally breathing. There was a difference in selective pre7 photoin on breathing compared non-selective photoin, selective had small effects breathing under ketamine/etomidine and recovery. With selective, a smaller population transduced with restricted location.

Photoin preöt produces apnea, reduces sympathetic activity, respiratory modulation BP, increases parasympathetic HR, and respiratory arrhythm. Neurons preöt modulate oracial behaviors.
Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal an alarm to the brain. If CGRP neurons serve as a general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude of the threat. However, most research has focused on the role of CGRP in passive responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. To address this, researchers examined the role of CGRP in active behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Electrophysiological results revealed CGRP encodes the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP during chasing elevated responses in both conditioning and retention, presumably amplifying the perception of threat as more dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP exhibited reduced responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand understanding of CGRP in PBN as a critical system, capable of regulating active behaviors by amplifying threat and ensuring responses to varying danger.

CGRP activation amplifies perceived threat, promoting active behaviors. Optogenically inhibited CGRP in animals while being chased during conditioning showed less freezing and fleeing compared to control. CGRP, known for relaying US to forebrain and inducing freezing, were examined in active responses. Using naturalistic paradigm with robot and aversive stimuli varying levels, recorded activity found CG encode threat through variations in duration and amplitude. Results confirmed stimulating CGRP without stimuli rapid unconditioned freezing in mice. Tested manipulating CG activity during fear with robot promotes or amplifies behavior. To enhance alarm, activation CG was applied at 30 Hz during chasing. Optogen stimulation CG in absence induced robust freezing, and activation conventional further conditioned, demonstrating primary in passive responses. However, heightened threat, such as CG activation or robot speeds, strengthened active behaviors amplifying perceived. Employed ecologically relevant predator robot chase, incorporating imminent threat. Hypothesized CG modulate behaviors depending severity or type. Recorded CG response aversive, including robot to determine encode stimuli differentially.
Researchers studied the relationship between obesity and brain structure using data from over 30,000 participants in the UK Biobank study. They found that a higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was associated with differences in two distinct brain systems: the prefrontal/temporal/striatal system and medial/occipital/statal system. The prefrontal system was linked to isotropic volume fraction (ISO), a measure of water content, while the medial system was linked to intracellular fraction (IC), a measure of neurite density. The prefront system was also associated with genes related to immune functions, glial density, and opioid receptors, while the medial system was linked to G-protein receptors and decreased opioid receptors.

The researchers tested whether these brain systems differed in terms of shared genetics and inflammation. They found correlations between WHR and ISO (0.026, P=0.36) and IC (0.112, P9×10-4) as well as between WH maps and equivalent CRP for ISO and IC (P0.05). These results suggest a two-way mechanism: neurite density in the medial system may contribute to obesity, while water in the prefront reflects a consequence of obesity mediated by the immune system.

Previous studies have linked the prefrontal system to episodic memory and navigation. Maps of ISO and IC were negatively correlated (r-0.366, P2.3×10-13), indicating obesity is associated with distinct changes in brain water and neur density. The researchers tested each metric at each region for association with WHR and identified two anatomically and functionally distinct systems associated with obesity. They used gene expression, composition, and neurotransmitter density to refine characterization of each system.

Further analysis explored the direction of relationship between obesity and brain structure. Genome-wide association statistics for ISO and IC (War et al, 202) and WH (Pul et,201) estimated correlations between MRI and WH, testing the hypothesis WH would have tighter correlation with IC than ISO. They also used data on neurotransmitter distribution to investigate systems where obesity was strongly associated with microstructure by ISO or IC. Cortical maps of 37 neurotransmitters were tested for co-location with ISO and IC maps, controlling multiple comparisons.
Researchers have identified a group of cancer cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs) that undergo a process called epithelial-mesymal transition (EMT) to help spread cancer to other parts of the body in experimental models. However, these cells have not been seen in human tumour specimens, making it unclear if they play a role in human cancer. The researchers used markers EpCAM, CD, and Vimentin to identify these cells in human oral cancer lines and tested if they could find them in human tumours. They looked at 12,000 images from 74 tumours and found cells with all three markers were more likely to have spread to other parts of the body. They used a computer program to predict which tumours would spread with 87% accuracy. This study shows that these cells can spread in human tumours and are linked to cancer spreading.

Researchers have long known that apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death, and efferocytosis, the clearance of dead cells, play a crucial role in tissue repair. However, the mechanisms behind this process are not fully understood. A new study used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the dynamics of early inflammation in mouse wounds and found that apoptotic and efferyt pathways are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident macrophages during inflammation. In diabetic wounds, human upregulation of mRNAs for efferyt pathway and altered eyt signaling through receptor Axl and its ligand Gas were detected. Early in mouse wounds, upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR-independent mechanisms was observed. Inhibition in vivo studies in mice revealed Axl is required for repair but dispensable for efferyt. In contrast, inhibition of another eyt receptor, Tim4, in wounds decreased eyt and abated repair. The study highlights distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell coordinates repair and provides potential targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.
Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have greatly improved our understanding of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues, enabling the creation of transcriptomic cell atlases. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identifying cell types corresponding to gene clusters in single-cell sequencing sets remains a challenge. Researchers have developed a genetic barcoding approach called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplex (Ta-EM) to address this issue. This method involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-inducible UASFP construct, allowing the barcode to be read during single-cell sequencing. By creating multiple barcoded fly strains, Ta- enables identification of cell types in atlases, multiplet detection, and barcoding of experimental conditions and replicates. Ta- barcodes can also be read using next-generation sequencing for population-scale measurements. This approach has potential for large-scale behavioral screens and improving single-cell transcriptomic multiplexing and annotation.

A geneticcoding strategy called Ta- enables novel capabilities in various experimental contexts. It involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-indible UASFP, allowing the barcode to be read during single-cell sequencing. Ta- provides a means to label cells in vivo for detection in single sequencing and can be used to multip behavioral or phenotypic measurements. However, Ta- barcodes are not observed in all cells in single gene data, likely due to the strength of the Gal driver. Researchers also observed variable recovery of Ta- barcodes driven by the same Gal driver.

Researchers studied the evolution of defense mechanisms in poison frogs of the family Dendidae, which have developed the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for defense. However, previous studies focused on colorful species, ignoring inconspic ones assumed to be undefended. The team found that undefended frogs have measurable amounts of alkaloids and consume ants, a source of alkaloids, suggesting diet is not the only explanation for defense. They propose a new concept, "passive accumulation," where toxins are absorbed without transport or storage, resulting in low levels. This differs from sequestration, where toxins are stored and concentrated. The study suggests passive accumulation is an ancestral state in Dendidae and related taxa, with selection on toxin resistance leading to accumulation and defense. The team combined pharmacokinetic ideas with data to create a model explaining acquired defenses in frogs and other animals.
Epithelial-to-mesymal transition (EMT) plays a significant role in chemotherapy resistance and is a challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. Researchers have struggled to develop effective treatments due to the complexity of EMT, involving multiple signaling pathways and its reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET). A study used a Tri-PMT E lineage-tracing model and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze EMT status of tumor cells. Findings showed elevated ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) during EMT and MET phases. Ribi and subsequent protein synthesis by ER and mTOR signaling are essential for EMT completion. Inhibiting Ribi genetically or pharmacologically impaired EMT capability of tumor cells. Combining Ribi with chemotherapy reduced metastatic growth of epithelial and mesenchymal cells under chemotherapies. The study suggests targeting Ribi pathway a promising for treating advanced breast cancer.

Researchers used a unique E-lineageacing model to discover Ribi transiently elevated during EMT and MET phases. Lower Ribi activity observed in mesenchym cells than epithelial ones. Consistent with Triy model, combining with CT reduced metastatic tumor burden than mock or mono-treatment. Further analysis of human breast cancer cells showed Ribi association with E status. Targeting E for therapy challenging due to E complexity and MET controversies. E-lineacing model found upregulated Ribi at E and MET phases. Activation Ribi during E process reported previously. Results suggest Ribi needed for mesenchym cells MET outgrowth in lungs. Ribosome bi crucial in cancer pathogenesis. Signaling responsible for R upregulation E and MET investigated in sorted cells. Importantly, unwed Ribi during E and MET makes Ribi new target for E-related chemoresistance and metastasis. Targeting Ribi impaired E transitioning and synergized with chemotherap.
Pearl millet, a drought-tolerant cereal crop, is a vital food source in the sub-Saharan region. Its early root system features a fast-growing primary root, which is thought to be an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Researchers used modeling to show that drought is a major constraint in Sahelian agystems where pearl millet was domesticated. They found that increased millet primary root growth is linked to increased water tolerance in field conditions. A genetic study identified genomic regions controlling this trait and a gene, PgXC, encoding glutaredin, as a potential regulator of root growth. Characterization of its Arabidopsis homolog, AtXY, revealed a role in regulating cell elongation. The study suggests a conserved function of GR genes in root elongation and resilience in pearl to Sahelian environment.

Drought was observed in 57% of years, confirming drought is a major constraint in Sahelian agystems affecting crops during vegetative stage. To test if fast primary root growth after germination is an adaptation to drought, researchers phenotyped pearl millet lines representing genetic diversity. No roots are present in millet, only lateral roots at 6 days after germination. They hypothesized fast-growing root is adaptation to Sah environment, showing drought after germination is a major constraint and primary growth is linked to tolerance under field conditions.

Field experiments showed a strong relationship between primary growth and stay-green at vegetative, an indicator of drought tolerance (R=0.95, p<0.01). Rapid root growth is beneficial for millet to cope with drought episodes. Differences in growth are mainly regulated by elong. Genome-wide association and bulk segregant analysis identified a genomic region controlling trait. Resequencing and reannotation of this region identified PgXC, a glutaredin-encoding gene, as candidate. The effect of promoter polymorphisms on expression needs to be tested. To validate hypothesis, researchers studied its ortholog in Arabidopsis, functional studies not possible in pearl.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes language in complex, real-world situations where multiple elements like speech, faces, objects, and bodies are involved. They found that concrete and abstract concepts are stored in different brain regions, but these differences decrease when considering multiple elements together. When a word's meaning is related to the visual context, its pattern becomes more concrete-like, and when unrelated, it's more abstract. This suggests the brain's organization is not fixed, but changes based on available information.

The brain is skilled at combining sensory information to form concepts, essential for real-world experiences. The study highlights the role of context in abstract and concrete word processing, similar effects may be seen in other sensory contexts. The researchers tested if profiles change with objects in the context. They predicted abstract concepts in related contexts (e.g. "love" while watching people kissing) engage concrete processing regions and visual information.

First, they examined where concrete and abstract concepts are processed across contexts and the information they encode. They expected regions for typical experiences (e.g. learning) to activate across contexts. When concepts are out of context (e.g. "apple" in a house), they engage abstract regions for internal/interceptive/affective information. A second analysis looked at how representations change as a function of context. They found underlying processing changes as a function of visual context.
Researchers have found a way to overcome a major obstacle in cancer treatment by developing a new compound called KVS1 that blocks a cellular process called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which hides cancer-causing mutations from the immune system. NMD destroys RNA from genes with truncating mutations, making them invisible to the immune system. The team conducted a high-throughput screen to identify mediators of N in human cells and found SM1, a kinase that phosphorylates UP1, disrupting N. This led to the design of KVS1, which elevates expression of transcripts and proteins from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, K1 increases presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I peptides from N-downregulated proteins on the surface of cancer cells. This provides new opportunities to study N and diseases where N plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.

K1 inhibits N pathway at low concentrations, allowing equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts. Western blotting shows K1 decreases phosphorylated UP1, a target of SM1 activity, in three cell lines. Previous studies with non-specific N inhibitors showed increase in antigens from tumor mutations when N is inhibited. The team investigated whether K1 could alter surface presentation of proteins from genes with truncating mutations in cancer cells. Treatment with a reported SM1 small molecule, SMi11, increased transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating, as did LY341. However, SMi was insoluble. The screen offered unbiased assessment of targets for N disruption and concluded SM was ideal to inhibit. K was developed to improve properties of SMi through K1, which is specific, soluble, and can be administered to mice.
A new measure of biological aging, called Phenotypic Age (PhAge), was used to predict cancer risk in a study of 374,463 participants from the UK Biob. The study found that older participants had a higher risk of cancer, with hazard ratios of 1.22 (1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women, compared to biologically younger participants. The study also found a joint effect of genetic risk and biological age on cancer risk, with hazard ratios of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) for those with high genetic risk and older biological age compared to low risk and younger age. Biological age was negatively associated with healthy lifestyle factors in men (-0.01, p<0.001) and women (-0.98, p<0.001). Within genetic groups, older biological age was related to increased cancer risk, adjusted for chronological age. A healthy lifestyle could retard the aging process. The study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China and the Youth of Jiangsu Province.

The study calculated Phenotypic Acceleration (PhAgeAcc) to explore the effect of accelerated aging on cancer risk and found a positive association with increased risk after adjusting for chronological age in the Biobank. Older biological age was consistently associated with increased risk of incident cancer within genetic groups. Participants with high risk and older biological had the greatest cancer risk. The study showed accelerated aging, measured by PhAcc, was related to increased risk of site-specific and overall cancer, adjusted for age, and across risk groups.

Further analysis by genetic category with younger age as reference, older age was associated with higher cancer risk across groups. Standardized 5-year cancer rates were 5.78% and 4.58 for biologically men and women versus 6.9 and 5.17 for older. The study provided a cost-effective indicator for biological age and novel biomarker for cancer prediction. Associations between age and risk have been investigated by several studies. This study found different measures of age reflect aspects of aging and could be used in risk assessment. Recent studies confirmed associations between PhAcc and cancer.
A new mobile app called Biome has been launched in Japan to gather species observations from the public using identification and gamification elements. Since its launch in 2019, the app has amassed over 6 million observations. However, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. To address this, researchers investigated the quality of Bi data and its impact on species distribution models (SDMs). SDMs estimate species distribution while accommodating bias.

The study found that species identification accuracy exceeded 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed, mollusks, and fishes scored below 90. SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Bi data into traditional data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional data required over 200 records for accurate models (Boyce ≥ 0.9), while blending the two sources reduced this to around 300. The coverage of urban-natural gradients by Bi data compared to traditional biased towards natural areas may explain this improvement.

Combining multiple sources better estimates species distributions, aiding protected area and ecosystem assessment. Establishing a platform accumulating community-sourced data will contribute to conserving and monitoring ecosystems. The study suggests that SDMs can be improved by using Bi's rapidly accumulating species records if sampling efforts are controlled. The quality of community data gathered through the app was assessed by investigating non-wild and misidentified records.

Species models (SD) are effective for assessing biodiversity while accounting biases. SD use occurrence and conditions to estimate potential ranges and habitats (Booth et al, 2014; Box 198; Elith et al,201; Hutchinson 195; Phillips 2006). The inclusion of Bi data improved SD accuracy. The most accurate predictions were when data consisted 50-70 Bi (Appendix 1). Both surveys and observations are necessary for comprehensive understanding distributions (Miller et al,201; Pacifici et,201; Robinson 202).
Researchers investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1 (BMPRA) in the development of the lung, specifically in the mesenchymal cells, which are a type of connective tissue in the lung. They used mouse models to study the effects of deleting MPRA in mesenchymal cells and found that it disrupted normal lung development, leading to the formation of cysts in the airways. This is similar to a condition seen in human patients with congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CP). The study showed that mesymal MPRA is essential for lung development, particularly airway morphogenesis, or the formation of the airways.

The researchers found that deleting MPRA in mesymal cells at an early stage of development caused abnormal branching of the lung and cysts at a later stage in gestation in mice. They also found that congenital cysts are reported in human CP patients as a result of abnormal lung development. Aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to air cyst formation, as other studies have shown that loss of Sox2 or expansion of Sox9 in air epithelia are associated with altered differentiation and cyst pathology in fetal lungs.

The study found that MPRA is expressed in lung epithelial cells at early gestation, but also in mesym cells during mid-gestation. They specifically deleted MPRA in mesym cells, which resulted in abnormal air development and cyst formation. The relationship between MPRA deletion and MP ligand expression in mesym progenitor cells was confirmed by comparing MP expression in isolated mesym cells with MPRA genotypes. Alterations of other pathways, including FGF, Wnt, and Shh, were not detected by RNA-seq and RT-PCR analyzing related genes.

The phenotype resembles features observed in patients with CP. Investigating lung phenotypes caused by mes-specific MPRA knockout and underlying mechanisms will enhance understanding congenital lung diseases.
Researchers have investigated the role of anionic lipid molecules, specifically phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), in regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) activity in living cells. They used super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to visualize EG and PI(4,5)2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. Before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), EG and PI(4,5)2 nanodomains aggregated through transient visits of EG to PI(4,5)2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EG stimulation and depended on phospholipaseγ, EG effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)2. Artificial reduction in PI(4,5)2 content of the plasma membrane reduced dimer and autophosphorylation of EG after EG stimulation. Inhibition of PI(4,5)2 hydrolysis after EG decreased phosphorylation EG-Th654. Thus, EG kinase activity and density PI(4,5)2 around EG molecules were found to be mutually regulated.

The researchers examined dynamics and roles of PI(4,5)2 as boundary and neighboring lipid of EG in EG activation by EG stimulation. Super microscopy revealed EG and PI(4,5 form nanodom that overlap before EG stimulation. The nanodom also form clusters and extent coag of EG and PI4,5 molecules in higher structure decreases after EG stimulation. They found that PI(4,5 nanodom and EG nanocluster together before EG stimulation. After stimulation, degree coag decreases, depends on PLC but not phosphoinide 3-kinase PI3. Local PI4,5 around EG stabilizes EG dimers increase EG autophorylation upon EG. Subsequent hydroly PI4,5 by PLC plays role deactivation EG. Results suggest autoremodeling lipid regulates EG activity.
Researchers have identified a unique carrier protein in the parasite Blastocystis that transports glycol intermediates, such as dihydroacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. This carrier is specific to strameniles, a group of eukaryotic organisms including multicellular algae, fish, and plant pathogens like Phytophthora. In contrast, most eukotes, glycol is a cytosolic pathway that converts glucose to pyruate, producing NAD and ATP. Strameniles have branched glycol with enzymes in both cytos and mitochondrial matrix. The Blastocyst lacks key components of oxidative phosphorylation for ATP generation, such as complex III, IV, ATPase, and AD/ATP carriers. The glycol phase in the matrix generates ATP, powering processes like macromolecular synthesis and NAD used by complex I to drive import proteins and molecules. This carrier is a potential drug target for strile pathogens, which are economically important.
Researchers have proposed a new framework for genetic association studies called the Haplotype Score (HFS), which calculates a functional activity score for each haplotype in an individual. This score replaces the traditional genotype in association studies. The FS framework was applied to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank dataset, identifying 361 independent FS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10^(-8). Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, a median of 63 more than single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. FS-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with biological interpretability, including circadian rhythm and arachid acid intelligence. FS was integrated with SNP-based polygenic scores using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, showing an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. The study concludes that FS is a promising for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.

The Haplotype Score (FS) was analyzed for association with each trait, confirming FS offers improvement in biological and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods. An example is the ENTEX dataset, which aligns genomic peaks with specific haplotype. Results show FS represents functional genomic activities in genetic studies, improving interpretation and poly prediction of complex traits.

A new FS framework was designed for genetic analysis, improving classic SNP-based in loci and gene identification, biological interpretation, and polygenic prediction. FS is suggested as a strategy for future studies, but more algorithm and data are needed. FS compared to SNP, has several features. FS detected 11-334 more signals (median 63) per trait than methods Poly and SbayRC. FS was applied to 14 traits in UKB, identifying 16,597 FS-trait associations at p <5 × 10^(-8), 361 independent.
Researchers investigated the impact of three different types of mental training modules on the structure and function of the hippocampus, a brain region involved in stress regulation, behavior, and emotion. The study involved 332 healthy adults who received either a 3-month training in attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, or socio-cognitive skills. Changes in hippocampal subfield volume and functional connectivity were measured using MRI, and related to diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. Results showed that the socioffective training increased bilateral cornu ammonis (CA-3) volume and functional connectivity compared to socio-cognitive and wait-list groups. Changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with reduced cortisol output. A multivariate analysis found other subfields also contributed to cortisol changes. The study found a link between socio-emotional intervention, hippocal structure, and function, and reduced cortisol in healthy adults.
Researchers studied three species of sunflowers, Helianthus annu, Helthus argyll, and Helthus petolar, to understand how they adapt to their environments. These species have large inversions, which are areas of the genome where recombination is suppressed, and are often associated with adaptive traits. The study found that inversions facilitate adaptation, but some loci within them can still contribute to adaptation even without recombination suppression. This suggests that inversions are not the only reason for adaptation, but also other loci can play a role.

The study used genome-wide association to look at patterns of adaptation in the three species. They found significant repeatability in association with phenotypes and environments, particularly in regions with inversions. This shows that inversions help adaptation, but other loci can still contribute without recombination. Many regions show adaptation, but strongest associations are species-specific, indicating redundancy in adaptation.

The study estimated the number of regions that could contribute to adaptation for each phenotype, related to genic redundancy. Results show adaptation in sunflowers involves repeatability at few genes, often with inversions, and redundancy across many loci. The study explored repeatability of adaptation in the three species, which have large recombination-suppressed regions, often inversions, and adaptive traits. Most inversions are old, predate current adaptation, but not the underlying genes shared among species.

Results suggest some genome contributes adaptation with redundancy and repeility, enriched in regions with inversions, while the rest is driven by species-specific loci. Repeatability with inv supports the adaptation model for long-term persistence of inversions, not dominance or meiotic mechanisms.
Researchers have found that aging affects cells in different ways, but at the level of organs and tissues, changes tend to be similar. The breast tissue is made of two types of cells: luminal and myoepithelial. Luminal cells change with age in a predictable way, which is important because they can become cancer cells. The researchers think that aging affects that make it harder for these cells to stay the same, making them more likely to become cancer. They looked at gene expression in luminal and myepithelial cells from women under 30 and over 55 years old. They found age-related changes and increased variation in gene expression that made it harder for cells to stay the same. Both types of cells had age-related changes, but luminal cells had more changes in genes that control chromatin and genome. A protein that helps cells talk to each other, GJB6, increased with age and helped myepith cells make changes in luminal cells. The age-related changes in lum cells can be seen in tissue and cancer. A computer program that looked at lum cells could tell if it was cancer or not and was good at predicting cancer type. Researchers think luminal cells are where age changes happen and make them more likely to become cancer and a warning sign of cancer. 

 Studies show how aging affects breast tissue in older women. Increased variation in gene expression in breast cells is a result of aging and important for understanding why breast cancer increases with age. The study shows how age and variation in cells explain increased cancer. It's unclear how tissue changes in aging reflect cell and environment changes. Looking at specific cell types is needed to understand. The breast is made of two types: myepith and luminal cells. We show how variation with age can lead to differences in cancer, especially luminal type. Increased variation with age made it harder for cells to stay same.
Scientists have been trying to understand why some plants are more resistant to pests and diseases, but it's a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Researchers explored if non-target DNA reads from plant sequencing can be used as a shortcut to answer this question. They studied 207 lines of pennycress (Thlaspi arse) grown in a controlled environment with aphids, mildew, and other microbes. The number of non-target reads assigned to pests differed between populations, had heritability, and were linked to climate and glucosinolate content. Lines from cold and fluctuating habitats, less favorable to aphids, had higher aphid load, i.e., less resistance. Genome-wide analysis found genetic variants in defense genes and new regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were found, particularly in transposons and promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely by pathogens. This study provides insights into defense mechanisms of Thpi arse, a crop model species, and shows non-whole-gen sequencing can estimate plant-pathogen interactions. This approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research with increasing sequencing data worldwide.
Researchers are working to find new ways to combat malaria, a disease caused by Plasium falciparum parasite, which has become resistant to current treatments. One approach is using drug combinations that make parasite more sensitive to one drug when it's resistant to another. This study looked at compounds targeting Plas dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme crucial for parasite survival. They tested several DHH mutant lines against a panel of DHH inhibitors and found one, TDC-125, active against all, including DH C276, which emerged with clinical candidate DSM265. Most resistance to TDC-125 was due to extra copies of dhod gene, but one mutation, DHH263, resistant to TDC-125 but not DSM. Selecting DH276 with TDC-125 yielded additional changes in dhod, making double mutants less sensitive to TDC-125 and highly resistant DSM. Combining DSM and TDC-125 in treatment selected parasites with DHV mutation, resistant to both and as fit as wildtype in lab. This shows DH enzyme's mutational flexibility.
Researchers have found that the spread of antimal drug resistance varies greatly across different geographic regions, with most infections occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, but resistant strains emerging in low-transmission areas. Current models of resistance lack consensus on the relationship between transmission and resistance, possibly due to overlooking factors like antigen diversity, host immunity, and selection. A new model was developed to track resistant strains and host immunity, showing a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance or efficacy. Chloroquine-resistant data validated this trend. Resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, but decreases in high-divers, high-trans regions. The study highlights the role of strain diversity in geographic patterns of resistance.

The diversity of Plasium falcum parasites has not been considered in mathematical models of resistance, despite driving differences in antigen diversity among geographic zones and epidemiological features. The model shows diversity and strain-specific immunity predict the relationship between transmission and resistance. It implies control protocols should vary by region, with no one-size-fits cure for malaria worldwide. Including diversity provides a mechanistic explanation for Southeast Asia's resistance to antimal drugs, despite lower transmission than Africa. Regions with low diversity cannot reinfect hosts, immune hosts do not carry infections often.

The study presents a theoretical argument based on a mechanistic model for geographic variation in antimal drug resistance. The Malaria Project did not predict prevalence before 200, while antimal drugs started early 200 in Africa. Comparisons were restricted to studies between 1990 and 200, using 200 as proxy. Studies with less than 20 were excluded.
Cannabis, the most widely used illicit psychoactive substance, is increasingly consumed by pregnant women, despite the presence of cannabinoid receptors in the embryo. However, the impact of phytocannabinoids on early embryonic development is not well understood. Researchers used a step-by-step in vitro system to study the effects of the most abundant phytocannabinoid, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabin (Δ-THC) on early embryonic development. They found that Δ-TH increased the growth of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not their primed counterparts. Surprisingly, this growth was dependent on the CB1 receptor and associated with moderate changes in gene expression. Δ-TH also rewired ESCs' metabolism, increasing glycolytic and anabolic capabilities. This metabolic change was retained during differentiation to Prim Germ Cell-like Cells, even without exposure, and altered their transcription profile.

The study tested three developmental stages: exposure of ESCs, exposure Epi, and combined ESC+Epi exposure. Cells were exposed to vehicle or Δ-TH in a range of 0.1-100µM, corresponding to physiological concentrations in cannabis users. Results showed a moderate impact of Δ-TH on embryonic processes. The study highlights the importance of metabolic rewiring by Δ-TH and its role as a driver through differentiation.

Δ-TH increased ESC proliferation, which was dependent on CB1, but not associated with significant changes in gene expression. However, it rewired ESC metabolism, increasing glycolytic and anabolic capabilities. This change was retained during differentiation to Prim Germ-like Cells, even without exposure, and altered their transcription profile. The study is the first to characterize the impact of Δ-TH on early germline development.
Researchers studied the immune system of the zebraf fish, a species with hundreds of NLR genes, to understand how these genes evolve and function. They sequenced 93 fish from wild and laboratory populations and found 151 NLR genes, more than the previously known 400. Half of these genes were present in all populations, but only 4% were found in 80% of fish. Wild fish had up to twice as many NLR per individual and four times more per population than laboratory strains. Despite many copies, nucleotide diversity was low, with half monomorphic and few polymorphisms, suggesting purifying selection. This suggests NLR evolution is not neutral. Expression is often induced by pathogen exposure, but function unclear. A previous study showed reduced single nucleotide variation in laboratory strains compared to wild. Here, NLR copy numbers and variation were also reduced, likely due to recent population bottleneck. Zebraf has staggering copy variation, with individuals having genes not present in others, indicating active diversity-generating mechanisms. This study lays groundwork for investigating molecular and evolutionary mechanisms of large vertebrate gene families.
Scientists have discovered a new type of seed from the Famenn period, around 372-359 million years ago, during the Late Devonian era. This seed, called Alemenia, has three wing-like structures that extend outwards and inwards from its side, enclosing a part of the seed. Unlike other seeds from the same era, Alia does not have a protective cup around it. Researchers believe these wing-like structures helped the seed to photosynthesize and disperse through the wind. This suggests that seeds with wings evolved before other methods of dispersal, such as plumes and parachutes. Analysis shows that seeds with three wings are better suited for wind dispersal than those with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions.
Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is a type of blood cancer that is difficult to treat. Current treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved patient survival, but relapse and resistance remain issues. Researchers found a new mechanism in Ph+ leukemia where RSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur, and RSY mediates nedlation of B-ABL. This makes BABL more stable by competing with its degradation. RSY also phosphorylates RSY to activate its E3 ligase activity, promoting BABL and disease progression. In contrast, depleting RSY or its activity decreased BABL stability and inhibited tumor growth. These findings suggest an alternative to TK activity for oncoprotein and leukemic cells and a rationale for targeting RSY-mediated B- nedlation in Ph leukemia treatment.

 RSY is highly expressed with B- in Ph patients and promotes progression by stabilizing B via nedlation. Nedlation of B by RSY competes its degradation to increase B stability. A novel role of RSY in hematology was identified, and inhibition suppressed Ph leukemia survival. This was linked to E3 activity of RSY, which mediated B nedlation to enhance stability. Balanced synthesis and degradation are crucial for protein homeostasis and cellular function.

BCRABL generation is a characteristic of Ph (Klein et al, 1982). RSY in Ph patients was found, and B levels correlated with RSY, demonstrating specificity of RSY-mediated nedlation B. Work uncovered RSY's pivotal role in E3 activity nylating and stabilizing B in Ph pathogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target. Results shed light on future investigations to other types, broadening RSY's involvement in hematology and oncology. Tumor-bearing mice survival was prolonged by RSY knockout compared to controls. Findings indicate RSY is highly expressed with B in Ph and depletion inhibiting progression.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to discover enzymes called peptoglycan hydrolases that can break down peptoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls. These enzymes are promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics as they are less likely to develop resistance. The method uses antimicrobial peptides from bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, as a template to search for peoglycan hyrolases in bacterial proteomes. As a proof-of-concept, they found two potent peogcan hyrolases, PH10 and PH11, from the proteome of Acinetobacter baumannii. These enzymes killed multiple pathogens even after being heated at 100°C for 1 hour, while others were sensitive to heat. The structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 were solved, showing PH10 underwent a unique folding change due to a dimeromer transition, while PH8 formed a monomer. Mouse models of infection showed PH10 was safe and effective. This method provides a new way to discover promising antimicrobial drugs.
Researchers analyzed data from 6.9 million patients in the Danish National Patient Registry from 1994 to 2018, including 23,592 diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. They also used text mining to extract symptoms from clinical notes in electronic health records of 3,078 cancer patients and 30,780 controls. The study found that text mining clinical notes captured more symptoms before cancer diagnosis than registry codes alone. Symptoms like "blood pressure without diagnosis", "abnormal heartbeat", and "intestinal obstruction" were not found in registry analysis. Trajectories of symptoms showed two groups with lower survival: "Cough→jaundice→intestinal" and "pain→jaice→abnormal function". This study compared two types of pancreatic symptom trajectories, combining data to detect early risk factors for cancer. 

The study included known pancreatic symptoms in text and compared registry and EHR data to characterize symptom ordering across sources. It found significant symptoms before cancer that may be early risk factors for screening. Symptoms in EHR were more abundant than NPR. Future work could use AI and text mining to build trajectories for early cancer prediction in clinics. This could guide better screening and improve lives of cancer patients. The study showed registry and EHR data can detect patterns before cancer diagnosis. Early symptoms in EHR suggest using multi-modality trajectories from both EHR and registry.
Researchers studied how brain activity during sleep changes from childhood to adulthood. They focused on two types of brain waves: slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz) and fast spindles (12.5-16 Hz) that occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep. These waves are important for memory and learning. The study looked at children aged 5-6, 8, 11, 14, and 18, and adults 20-26 years old. They found that fast sples in the adult range (12.5-16 Hz) appeared in all age groups, but were less precise in children. Slow oscillations were linked to fast sples in the adult range in all groups, but less precise in children. Measures showed that fastles matured with age and were linked to stronger and more precise slow-oscillation coupling. The study suggests that ability to generate adult-like fast sples improves slow-osc coupling from childhood to young adulthood.
Despite the advancements in high-throughput technologies that have identified novel genes associated with biological processes and diseases since the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, many previously published genes continue to be featured in present-day publications. Researchers have proposed several hypotheses for the bias in selection of genes as research targets, but their explanatory powers have not been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-stud genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understud genes remain abandoned by studies that cite -omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understud genes even accrue a greater number of citations.

Among 45 biological factors proposed to affect genes being studied, 33 are associated with the choice of genes in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote understud genes, we condense insights into a tool, find understud genes (FM), allowing scientists to engage bias during selection. We demonstrate FM's utility through identification of underst genes in vertebrate aging. FM is developed and available for download at fm.amal.northwestern.edu as MacOS/Windows app.

Our findings reinforce that understud genes are abandoned between experiments and results rather than later. Abandonment could be driven by researchers' concern that less-invest genes yield lower impact. We sought to identify when underst genes are ignored using - experiments. A gene must travel pipeline from reality to results to results, extended by subsequent research. Lack of publications not explained by lack evidence. We evaluated possibility that underst genes found in high-through are not investigated. To promote understud, we combined insights to create FM. Literature revealed tools promoting understud by publicizing underst. There may be no incentive for authors to highlight understud. To illuminate abandonment, we reviewed factors proposed to limit underst (Supplementary). These range from evolutionary to chemical.
Researchers have created a zebraf model that mimics the excessive blood vessel growth seen in diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes. They used this model to study the effects of artificially sweetened beverages containing non-caloric monosacides on blood vessel development. The results showed that both glucose and non-caloric monacides caused excessive vessel growth, especially of small, branched vessels. This was due to the activation of resting endothelial cells into tip cells. Analysis of these cells revealed increased proliferation and upregulation of pro-angiogenic genes. Further study found that the fox1 mediated excessive vessel growth by upregulating marck1. This study provides new evidence of the negative effects of nonoric monacides on the vascular system and underlying mechanisms.

The researchers used a zraf model to study the effects of glucose and nonoric monacides on vessel development. They observed excessive vessel growth by glucose and nonoricacides, initiated by activating resting endothelial cells. The effects of nonacides on vessel growth were proved to be mediated by the fox-marck pathway. The results provide new insights into the roles of nonoricacides in health and mechanisms.

Several studies have investigated the effects of high glucose on vascular in zraf. However, the association between nonoricides and vascular dysfunctions, such as excessive vessel growth, has not been elucidated. The study found that knockdown of marck1 mitigated excessive vessel caused by high-glucose or high-glucose, similar to the effect with VEG inhibitor. This suggested nonac induced vessel through fox-mar pathway in zraf.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes and stores multiple sequences of information in working memory. They asked participants to memorize sequences of items with different colors and locations and then reproduce the colors and locations in order. The researchers manipulated the consistency between the location and color sequences. Results showed that sequences with consistent trajectories improved memory performance and a correlation between color and location sequences. Brain activity showed reactivation of shared trajectories during encoding and replay of color sequences when recalling locations. This suggests a common structure is used for storing multiple sequences through compressed and replay, facilitating organization in working memory.

EEG recordings provided evidence of the compressive strategy, reactivation of shared trajectories during encoding and replay of color sequences during recall. Brain activity related to behavior and replay. Shared structure enables storage of multiple sequences through encoding and replay, facilitating organization in working memory. When participants prepared to recall location, the relevant color sequence showed spontaneous replay, highlighting the connection between color and location when sharing a trajectory. With color-location correlation in behavior, findings suggest replay mechanisms in working memory mediate combinations based on common structures.

Behavioral and neural evidence support leveraging common structures for working memory. Sequences with aligned color trajectories showed enhanced memory and correlation between color and location trajectories. Replay has been proposed to represent structure (Huang et al, 2018; Liu et al 2019), structure inference (Liu et al 202b), and generalization (Barry and Love 202). When recalling sequences, replay occurs for color but not location, supporting spontaneous replay since features are not relevant now.
Researchers have identified mutations in the PUR gene as the cause of neurodevelopmental PUR syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. Unlike other genetic disorders, almost all mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the disease. A study found that mutations in PUR impair its localization to processing bodies, either destroying its integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization. The researchers solved the structures of the N and C-terminal domains of PUR and used molecular simulations and nuclear resonance measurements. They found high dynamics and promiscuity in PUR, making it susceptible to mutations. This explains why even conservative mutations in PUR result in full symptoms in patients with PUR syndrome.

The study aimed to understand how genetic variations in PUR syndrome affect the protein's structure and function. Over 270 pathogenic variants in PUR have been identified in 650 patients with syndrome. The researchers assessed the structure and function of PUR and the impact of syndrome-causing mutations on its integrity. They found that mutations affect folding, nucleic acid binding, unwinding, and subcell localization to granules. Some variants were predicted to have folding defects.

The study provides the first experimental assessment of PUR syndrome-causing variants on folding, nucleic binding, and unwinding, and subcell localization. Some variants were previously predicted to have defects. The researchers used crystal structures, simulations, and measurements to understand the effects of mutations on PUR. They found high dynamics and promuity in PUR, making it susceptible to mutations. This explains why conservative mutations in PUR result in full symptoms in patients with syndrome.

The study supports the idea that modest alterations in PUR result in functional impairment. The flexibility and promuity of PUR domains were found in the structure of a variant with a solvent-exposed chain. Molecular simulations showed high motions in the N-terminal domain. Unlike other disorders, such as Rett syndrome, pathogenic variations in PUR are found along the sequence. The study aims to understand the underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with syndrome.
Researchers have found that a protein called TRPV4 interacts with another protein called AN1 (AN1) in sweat glands in the feet of mice. This interaction may play a role in sweating, which helps keep the feet from slipping. The proteins TR4, AN1, and another protein called aquaporin-5 (AQP5) are found together in the same cells that produce sweat in the feet. When a chemical called menthol is applied, it blocks the interaction between TR4 and AN1, reducing sweating. In mice without the TR4 protein, sweating was not triggered by a chemical called acetylcholine, which normally stimulates sweating. Without acetylcholine, sweating was blocked by an inhibitor of AN1. Mice with TR4 protein climbed a slippery surface better than those without it, suggesting TR4 helps with friction. In people with a condition called acquired generalized anhidrosis, TR4 was more present in healthy skin than skin without sweat glands. This suggests TR4 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating and could be a target for new treatments.
Researchers have developed a new way to describe the shape of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain, across different species. They found that all cortices can be described as a series of nested folds of different sizes. As these folds merge, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common pattern that also seen in 70 other mammalian species. This suggests that all cortices are approximations of the same shape, with a fractal dimension of 2.5. This new understanding allows for a more precise measurement of brain shape as a function of scale. The researchers demonstrated the importance of this by showing a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology, with a fourfold increase in size from two to eight standard deviations at a scale of 2mm. This new understanding may lead to biomarkers for various conditions in the future.

The new method expresses cortical morphology as a function of scale, not just a list of measures or listing sulci and gyri. It provides a basis for characterizing brain and morphological changes. Biological processes may act on specific scales, leaving others untouched, as seen in ageing. This suggests a blueprint for mammalian brain shape and common mechanisms governing folding. The new method can differentiate subtle changes better than current metrics at a single scale, with comparable effect sizes for classification. Primate and mammalian brains share shape properties beyond fractal dimension, including fractal scaling.

The main result is a universal scaling equation for primate and mammalian cortices. Two aspects of this universality are that each cortex has same value for scales smaller than a length and fractal dimension 2.5. Fractal scaling has been postulated for morphology, with recent use of MRI data. Estimates for whole cortex are close to 2.5.
Researchers studied the role of the NF-κB transcription factor REL in pancreatic cancer cells, specifically in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors. They used live-cell imaging to observe the dynamics of REL in PDAC cells and found that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNα) induces rapid and sustained nuclear translocation of REL. Analysis of single-cell data showed that REL heterogeneity in PDAC cells depends on actin dynamics. RNA sequencing identified REL-regulated genes in PD cells, including TNα-induced upregulation of actin regulators NU2 and ARHG31. Knockdown of ARHG31 and NU2 altered TNα-stimulated REL dynamics in PD cells, revealing a negative feedback loop that regulates REL activation by TNα. The study also characterized the NF-κ pathway in PD cells, showing that NF-κ/Iκ proteins interact with REL in the presence or absence of TNα. The results provide evidence of interdependence between the actin network and NF-κ pathway with REL translocation in PDAC.

The researchers used RNA sequencing to identify genes with distinct expression patterns based on TNα and REL activation. Live imaging with knockdown of targets revealed novel mechanisms regulating REL dynamics in PD, including negative loops between REL and actin modulators NU2 and AR31, and between REL and non-canonical NFκ protein REL. The NFκ pathway was characterized in PD cells, and actin modulators AR31/2 were found to be both REL targets and regulators of nuclear REL with TNα, mediating the relationship between act and REL. In contrast, NF1 and NF2 showed increased interaction with REL TNα, forming NF-κ heteromers with REL, NF1 and NF2 in PD cells. The effect of siRNA knockdown of TN-regulated genes on TN-stimulated REL was evaluated, suggesting thatκ plays a role in suppressing TN induction of REL in PD cells. REL was found to be modulated by NFκ/I proteins in the absence of stress or inflammatory cues.
A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is crucial for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABA system, which alter this equilibrium, are common in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphase Tens Hom (PTEN), the main regulator of the phosphatidyositol 3-phosphate/Akt pathway, are associated with ASD. However, it is unclear if PTEN can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling.

Using Caenorhabdis elegans neuromus system, both excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABA) inputs regulate muscle activity, d-18/EN mutations impact GABA but not cholin development and function. This results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. Defects in the GABA system d-18EN mutants are due to reduced D-16 activity during development.

Ketogenic diets (KDs) have proven effective for disorders with E imbalances. However, mechanisms remain elusive. A diet with the ketone body-hydrobutyrate during development induces D- activity, improving GABA development in d-EN mutants. This study links PT mutations and neurodevelopment defects and delves mechanisms underlying KD effects.

In Caenorhabdis, impairments in GABA inhibitory due decreased D- activity during development. Cholinergic excitatory neurons unaffected. Targeted inhib signals an imbalance E in neuromus system. Likely, acts early to mitigate GABA defects d-EN. Findings demonstrate mutations d- lead to inhib GABA defects without affecting cholin signals. Results suggest decreased activity D- affects GABA development due downregulation D- activity. FOX family conserved throughout animal kingdom.

Mutations d- and D result in GABA defects, altered morphology and function while cholin neurons unaffected. Experiments suggest inhib transmission arise hyperactivation PI pathway, subsequent D- inhibition GABA dEN mutants. Conservation components PI/A pathway Caenor enhances applicability investigating role neurodevelopment. Mutations d- orth PT found.
Researchers have found that the body's innate immune response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays a crucial role in the development of COVID-19. They discovered that certain factors, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, help contain the virus. By using quantitative and qualitative models, they found that human monocytes secrete factors that inhibit SARS-CoV-induced cell fusion in infected cells. Through cytokine screening, they identified interleukin-1 (IL-1), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation by SARS-CoV strains. Mechanistically, IL-1 activates Rho/RO signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor pathway, enriching actin at cell junctions, preventing syncytia. In vivo experiments in mice confirmed IL-1 restricted SARSV-2 spread in lung epithelium. This study reveals the function and mechanism of IL-1 on SARS-CoV-induced cell fusion, highlighting an antiviral role for cytokines during viral infection.

The study demonstrated IL-1's function in inhibiting SARSV-2 syncytia formation and innate immune factors against coronavirus transmission, providing potential targets for control. Researchers explored innate factors against SARS-2 infection, finding IL-1 inhibited SARS-2 variants and other coronaviruses-induced cell fusion. IL-1, a key inflammatory factor, inhibited SARS-2-induced syncytia in cells by activating R/RO pathway to actin formation at cell interface SARS-2-infected and neighboring cells. IL-1 significantly reduced SARS-2 transmission in lung epithelial mice in vivo. Fluorescence showed SARS-2-infected epithelial fused with cells promoting transmission, while IL-1 induced actin bundles restricting syncia and transmission.

IL-1 activates R to cell junction SARS-2-infected and neighboring via IL- signal initiating actin, preventing cell fusion and spreading. Findings reveal pro-inflammatory control viral infection.
Researchers studied the role of insulin-producing cells in fruit flies, called IPCs, which are similar to human pancreatic beta cells that release insulin into the bloodstream. They used electrophysiological recordings to investigate how nutritional state affects IPC activity and found that IPC activity decreases with starvation and increases with feeding with glucose or fructose, but not with non-nutritive sugars. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, similar to the mammalian incretin effect where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous application. In contrast, a different neurons called DH44 in the brain responded to glucose perfusion. Functional experiments showed DH44s do not affect IPC, but other DHNs inhibit them, suggesting parallel sugar-sensing neurons work together to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Activating IPC had a satiety effect on food-search behavior and reduced starvation hyperactivity, while activating DHNs increased hyperactivity. The study shows IPC and DHNs are part of a network that regulates glucose homeostasis and behavior in response to metabolic shifts.
Researchers have developed a new tool to study proteins in living cells by tagging them with a fluorescent marker called mNeGreen. However, creating this marker in human cells is challenging due to low efficiency. A new protein called splitNeGreen was used to create a large library of tagged cells in a human cell line called HEK. This breakthrough opens the door to studying proteins in healthy cells and different types. Scientists engineered a human stem cell to express a part of the splitGreen protein and showed it efficiently tags proteins with another part. They also used this to study a cellular process called cytokinesis in stem cells. This is a step towards creating a library of tagged proteins in human cells.

A new method was used to image stem cells with high resolution to study cytokinesis, a dynamic process. This work provides a basis for a library of tagged proteins in stem cells to study their function in different types.

A human stem cell line was engineered to express a part of the splitGreen protein, called NG-10. This line was validated and named NG-P. As a proof, multiple genes were tagged with another part of the protein, NG, and several tagged cells were isolated. This provides a foundation for a library of tagged proteins in stem cells.

The splitGreen system is efficient and retains brightness of the original protein. It allows tagging in cells where the protein is expressed. A library of proteins in cells requires high-throughput. Self-complementing fluorescent proteins can be used for large tagging.
Researchers have developed a new method for creating lesions in the brain that allows for simultaneous recording of brain activity before and after the lesion. This technique, called electrolytic lesioning, uses a custom-built device to deliver a stable current through a microelectrode implanted in the brain, creating a controlled and repeatable lesion in awake animals. The method was tested and validated using histology, current and voltage measurements from the device, and recordings of spiking activity before and after the lesion. This technique provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and allows electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neurons after the lesion. It can be used in various areas of the cortex, in multiple species, and with any multielectrode probe, and is low-cost, making it easily adoptable into existing electrophysiology setups. This method is expected to enable future investigations of the neuronal population's role in circuit function while providing insight into reorganization after neuron loss.

The researchers built a custom source to ensure stable current delivery throughout the lesion, for repeated lesions, and across different electrode types and animals. A similar design can be used for intracortical electrodes optimized for electrophiology and electrolytic lesion. The technique was tested with a multielect probe in rabbit cortex, and there are no limitations that prevent it from working with any multielect probe. The method enables small, permanent inactivation while maintaining neuroelectrophys recordings. Selection of electrical pattern, amplitude, duration, and lesion shape, and location offers combinations for investigations into the role of cortical activity. The method was demonstrated spanning multie probes in rabbits, pigs, sheep, and macaques, and can be used in smaller species like rats with multielect probes.
Bees play a crucial role in pollinating crops, but their populations are at risk due to pesticide use. One of the main threats they face is poisoning from pesticides in nectar and pollen. Studies on neonicotinoids have shown mixed results on whether bees can taste these pesticides in sugar solutions and avoid them. This study used a combination of behavioral and electrophysiology tests to see if the mouthparts of the buffailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestr) detect pesticides in a solution mimicking nectar of oilseed (Brassica nap). Bees did not avoid solutions containing concentrations of imaclopr, thiamox, clothin, or sulfox spanning six orders of magnitude, even at lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations altered spiking in gustatory neurons, reducing firing rate or changing adaptation. This shows that bumblees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant pesticides using their mouthparts. Since bees rarely contact nectar with other parts, they are at risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

The ability to detect and avoid pesticides could be used to defend crops without harming bees. However, few have tested whether bees can taste neotin pesticides in nectar, with contradictory results. This study used a combination of behavioral and electrophys to test if bumble mouthparts can detect pesticides. Feeding assays with freely moving foragers allowed assessing if bees detect and avoid toxins in food. To test if bbe detect neotoids on mouth, the structure of feeding mouth of freely bumble (B impens) was quantified, similar to a previous study showing bees neither attracted nor deterred from sugar containing neotoids, suggesting they cannot detect.

Bees have specialized mechanisms for encoding sugars different from other insects. However, no evidence was found that neot pesticides elicited spikes in gal GRNs, including nutrient/sugar neurons. Therefore, bees cannot taste neot in nectar or water. This conclusion has been challenged by a study on free-flying B terre foragers.
Researchers studied the prevalence of Plasmodium knowlesi, a type of malaria parasite, in non-human primates (NHP) in Southeast Asia. This parasite is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans, and is a major obstacle to malaria elimination in the region. The study analyzed data from 632 NHP from 148 sites across Southeast Asia and found varying prevalence rates, with the highest in Malaysian Borneo. They discovered that areas with higher NHP prevalence overlap with human infection hotspots and transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation. Using remote sensing data and statistical models, they found a relationship between P. know in NHP and forest fragmentation, suggesting higher prevalence in more complex habitats. This study fills gaps in understanding P know epidemiology and indicates simian reservoirs may drive human spillo risk.

The study aimed to assemble a georeferenced dataset of P know in NHP, evaluate variation in N know prevalence by region, and assess environmental and spatial factors for know in NHP across Asia. Human P know infection has been associated with forest loss, agricultural activities, and fragmentation at local scales. Prevalence in hosts is a crucial factor in zoon spillo events. Researchers hypothesized P know in primate species is spatially heterogeneous and driven by forest loss and fragmentation, contributing to land use and know risk. This study is the first to assess know in NHP at regional scale and wide habitats. Prediction intervals indicate heterogeneity within regions, with high variability across sites. Forest plots for prevalence can be found in Appendix 2. Covariates and know data were used to explore relationships between landscape and N malaria.

The study highlights spatial heterogeneity and landscape driving know infection in NHP. Given intersection of epidemiology and ecology, infection in reservoirs should be considered in public interventions.
Scientists have reconstructed the evolutionary history of the beetle family Belidae, a group of insects that feed on plants, to understand how their interactions with plants changed over time. They combined fossil records and genetic data to create a family tree of ancient beetles and found that Belidae originated around 138 million years ago in Gondwana, associated with conifer plants. The beetles likely fed on dead or decaying branches of these plants. As Gwana broke apart, beetles followed their host plants to distant landmasses, some shifting to angiosperms and cycads when conifers declined. They formed new relationships, including brood parasitism with cycads and associations with chlorophyllous angperms. Some beetles radiated in Australia and Hawaii have recent origins.

Belidae originated in Gwana, with two subfamilies Belinae and Oxycninae in Australia and Neotropical regions. Their likely hosts were conifers or angiosperms. Belinae were associated with conifers, while Oxycinae with angiosperms. The two subfamilies diverged during Gwana's breakup and still use their original hosts. In the East Gana clade, Belinae diverged 44.7-34.5 million years ago, during South America and Australia's separation. Some beetles use plant organs opportunistically, while others are specific. Belidae originated 138 million years ago when South and Australia were connected via Antarctica.
Researchers have studied the growth and evolution of tumors by analyzing samples from multiple regions of the same tumor. They used data from hundreds of samples taken in two and three dimensions to understand how tumors grow and change over time. The study found that tumor cells grow mainly inside the tumor, not on the surface. They also discovered how mutations and cell death contribute to tumor growth. This research sheds light on how tumors develop in the body and can be applied to high-resolution data in the field of spatial biology.

The study used genetic data from liver cancer tumors at high resolution to analyze early tumor growth in the body. They linked tumor sampling with evolution on a larger scale, comparing primary and metastatic tumors to understand metastasis. Other studies have looked at dynamics of metastasis and population genetics in tumors. This study used high-resolution data on mutation distribution in tumors to understand spatio-temporal principles of tumor evolution.

The researchers used whole-genome data from liver cancer and previously published to infer how tumors grew earlier stages. They developed metrics of intra-tumor heterogeneity using spatial position of samples. This is different from surface growth, where dispersal mechanism was proposed for mutation distribution. They looked at number of mutations in limited samples to probe migration between tumor regions.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that helps an insect, Copsa chinensis, adapt to changing seasons by changing its physical appearance. This insect has two forms, summer-form and winter-form, with distinct features. Previous studies showed that temperature and a protein, CTR, regulate the change from summer to winter. However, the underlying process was not fully understood. A hormone, Bicon, responsible for hardening and darkening the insect's outer layer, was found to play a key role in this change. The study identified two subunits of Bicon, CBα and CBβ, which are regulated by low temperature and CTR. These subunits form a complex that affects the insect's outer layer, making it thicker and darker. A receptor, CB-R, was found to be the target of Bicon and plays a role in signaling pathway that regulates the change from summer to winter. MicroRNA, mi-2, was also found to target CB-R, affecting Bicon signaling. These findings reveal a new mechanism of how insects adapt to changing seasons and provide insights into the role of Bicon and its receptor.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DM) are aggressive and fatal tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatment. A mutation of the lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M) is a driver in DM, reshaping the epigenetic landscape to promote tumorigenesis. H-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. To find an effective treatment, researchers examined the potential of dual targeting histone deacetyl (HD) and MY in these tumors. Treatment of H-K27-derived cells with Sop, an inhibitor of MY-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HD inhibitor Vorin, resulted in substantial decrease in viability. Transcript and epigen profiling revealed a synergistic effect of this combination in downregulation of oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthopic xenograft showed significant tumor reduction in mice treated with the combination. These results highlight combined with HD and MY inhibitors as a promising approach for these aggressive tumors.

A novel strategy targeting epigen and transcriptional pathways in H-K27-mant DM is proposed. HD inhibition, with the MY inhibitor, inhibited oncogenic signatures and reduced growth in vivo. Findings emphasize ep dependencies of H27-driven gliomas and the potential of treatments for this malignancy. Histone acylation is a potential target for this cancer, with pan-deacetyl inhibitors such as Vor and Panin found to inhibit growth and restore expression in H27 malignantomas. H-K gliomas are characterized by dereg ep pathways affecting post-transl modifications of 27 methylation and acylation and 4 methylation on hist H Bender et al, Chan et al, Lewis et Kr et, Fur et Harun et. High amplification of MY is observed in pediatric gliomas Bucowicz et Mack. H-K show high of MY and MY genes due to ep and structural, resulting in viability on MY signaling Kr et Paj et Dubois.

The PIN inhibitor Sop was shown to down MY genes in vitro and block MY-driven in murine neuroblastoma models. To an effective therapy for H-K DM, dual of histone and MY activation using Vor and Sop was tested.
The white-footed deerm (Peromys leucopus) is a long-lived rodent that serves as a reservoir for several zoonotic diseases in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasis, and viral encephalitis. Despite being persistently infected with these pathogens, the deerm shows no apparent disability or diminished fitness. Researchers used lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens, to compare genome-wide transcription in blood of P. leuc, Musculus, and Rattus norveicus, and adjusted for white cell concentrations. Deerm were distinguished from mice and rats by LPS profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. L-treated P. leuc, in contrast to mice and rats, displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stim genes. These characteristics of P. leuc were noted in Borrelia herms infection model. The phenomenon was associated with reduced transcription of endogenous retroirus and cytoplasmic pattern receptors in deerm. Results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and other animal reservoirs for human disease.

The deerm and mice had differentially expressed genes (DE) in blood, spleen, and liver. Inflammation of deerm was consistent with 'alternatively' activated or M-type macrophage phenotype instead of expected 'classically' activated or M-type phenotype observed in mice. Mice activation and migration were down-regulated in mice. Distinct GO terms up-regulated in mice from deerm were response virus, interfer-beta, interfer-gamma, protoan, and type II interfer signaling. Transcription restrained in deerm was noted for M2. Greater foldanges from baseline in P leopus than mice for M8, Sl, S1009, and Ilb, gene interleukin-1.

The white-footed deerm continues to thrive while infected with diseases it serves as reservoir. Tick-borne pathogens and diseases for humans include extracellular Borre burgdorferi (Lyme), intracellular Anap phagtophil (anlas), protoan Babes micro (babes), and Powan flav (encephal). leuc and LPS mice had similar slopes, but y-intercept shifted towards higher ratio neutrophils lymphocytes blood from LPS deerm. Control mice and deerm had similar percentages ~5 monocytes blood; monocyte rose 10 in LPS deerm.
Caspases (CASP) are a family of proteases involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. In humans, CAS3 and CAS7 recognize the same consensus motif DD, present in gasder E (GME). However, GME is cleaved by CAS3 but not CAS7. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. This study identified pyrotic puffer GME that was cleaved by pfish CAS/ and human CAS. Domain swapping between pfish and human CAS and ME showed the ME C-terminus and CAS7 subunit determined cleavage of ME by CAS. CAS7 contains a key residue that governs CAS discrimination. This residue is conserved in vertebrate CAS and most vertebrate except mammalian CAS. In mammals, the residue is conserved in non-primates but not primates. However, CAS cleaved human ME but not ME. These findings revealed the mechanism of CAS discrimination and divergence of CAS-mediated ME activation in vertebrates. Results also suggested mutation-mediated alteration of CAS enabled divergence and specialization of CAS members in regulation of cellular activities in mammals.

A study found that puffer GME, belonging to teleost GME lineage, was cleaved by CAS and CAS at site DD to liberate pyropt-inducing fragment. Teleost exist two ME orthologs, MEa and MEb. Human CAS3 and CAS7 share consensus motif DD, but CAS cleaves ME at site MP, while CAS does not. Mechanism unknown. This study found puffer T. Results suggest independent evolution of ME and CAS in mice, distancing ME from CAS. Similarly, CAS and ME may have undergone evolution, leading to disengagement of ME from relationship CAS. Identified tele ME that can be cleaved fish and human CAS to trigger pyptosis. Mutation cleavage site inhibited pypt and decreased LD release and ME cleavage. Results indicated CAS/ cleavage required to activate ME-mediated pypt. Since ME is cleaved CAS but not CAS, observation that ME cleaved both human and CAS intrigued mechanism. In contrast, residue changed in CAS of mammals, especially primates, diverged CAS from CAS in recognition and cleavage.
Researchers conducted a study to better understand how ketamine, a promising treatment for treatment-resistant depression, affects the brain and why people respond differently to it. They gave 40 healthy participants a single dose of ketamine and measured how their brain activity and behavior changed. The study found that ketamine's effects on the brain and behavior are complex and vary from person to person. The researchers also found that ketamine's main effect on the brain is related to two specific genes, somatostatin and parvalbum, which are involved in mood regulation. However, this effect was not consistent across all participants. The study also showed that individual differences in behavior response to ketamine are linked to distinct patterns of brain activity, which can be measured at the individual level. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences in response to ketamine and have implications for developing personalized treatments. The study was supported by several grants from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and other organizations. 

Ketamine has emerged as a promising treatment for treatment-resistant depression over the past two decades. However, individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed in both healthy people and those with depression. For example, a single ketamine infusion results in a 65% response rate in people with depression, but individual differences in molecular effects have been found. Some studies failed to replicate in people with depression 48 hours after ketamine, suggesting a complex relationship between ketamine's acute and delayed effects. Brain imaging studies have shown ketamine induces a shift from cortical to subcortically-centered brain, particularly the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Limited studies have characterized ketamine's neural-level effects using whole-brain approaches, demonstrating ketamine results in brain-wide effects. For example, ketamine increased brain connectivity in the prefrontal cortex in healthy people, and normalized reduced connectivity in people with depression 24 hours after ketamine. Researchers hypothesized ketamine would result in multiple and behavioral axes, reflecting individual variability in response. They used a multi-dimensional approach to capture ketamine's effects to relate to molecular mechanisms, specifically somatostatin and parval gene maps. They also compared ketamine to other substances with different pharmacological profiles, psilocybin and LSD, which have shown clinical efficacy for depression but different mechanisms.
Researchers have proposed the RNA world hypothesis, which suggests that the first self-replicating units of life existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. However, this raises a problem: how did these units replicate without enzymes, and how did they maintain their information? To address this, the study investigates the growth of RNA-like replicators in a population under constant size and resource conditions. The results show that large populations with small differences in replication rates can coexist, alleviating the error problem of amplification. The study also finds that sequence properties and resource availability determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting that fluctuations favored cycles of exploration and exploitation.

The study models RNA replicators with parabolic growth as stochastic dynamics, considering individual sequences, copying, and energetic constraints. It shows that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation and enzyme-free replication, proposing a biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in RNA systems. To validate Darwinian selection, a chemostat model is used, showing that competition can induce a switch from coexistence to survival of the fittest.

The diversity-maint mechanism of par populations can be used to investigate coevolution of naked and encapsulated replicators. Besides the RNA world hypothesis, other concepts exist, such as metabolism or autotrophic origins. Replicating populations with parabolic growth are prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, promoting coexistence. Parabolic growth can sustain unlimited competing species in infinite size.
Researchers have discovered that the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, called Nsp, cleaves a human enzyme called TR1, which is necessary for modifying RNA in cells. When SARS-CoV infects human cells, TR1 levels decrease and RNA modifications are reduced, consistent with TR cleavage by Nsp. Nsp cleaves TR1 at a specific site matching the sequence of SARSV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a mutation in the sequence inhibits N5-dependent cleavage of TR1. TR1 cleavage fragments have altered RNA activity and cannot rescue RNA modification in TR1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type cells, TR1-deficient cells infected with SARSV-2 have reduced intracellular RNA levels. These findings show that N5 cleavage of TR1 and perturbation of RNA patterns contribute to the pathogenesis of SARSV-2 infection.

 Studies also found that SARS-2 infection correlates with decreased TR1 levels and reduced m2G-modified RNAs. Additionally, TR1 is required for efficient SARS-2 replication in human cells. These studies reveal TR1 as a novel cleavage target of N5 during SARS-2 infection and suggest mechanisms associated with perturbations in TR-catalyzed RNA.

The interaction between N5 and TR1 indicates S-2 infection could affect TR function with effects on RNA levels. However, the association between N5 and TR has not been characterized. Researchers found that TR1 is an endogenous cleavage of N resulting in methylase inactive products. Examination of human TR structure revealed an amino acid sequence between the transferase and zinc-finger matching the sequence of N cleavage in S-2 proteins. The cleavage in TR includes a glutamine residue conserved at position found in N cleavage of S-2 proteins.

In contrast to wild TR, the appearance of N-terminal TR cleavage was detectable when TR-Q mutant was coexpressed with N. These results demonstrate TR can be recognized and cleaved N in cells cle requiring sequence matching Navage in S- proteins.
Scientists have long wondered how some microbes become disease-causing pathogens, while others don't. A new research suggests that some microbes can become pathogens by chance, rather than being born that way. This idea is called "accidental virulence." The study tested this idea by making yeast, a type of microbe, stick to a plastic surface for many generations. Over time, the yeast became better at sticking to the surface and grew in groups. When injected into caterpillars, the sticky yeast caused more harm than non-sticky yeast. This shows that sticking to a surface can make a microbe more likely to cause disease. The research supports the idea that a helpful trait in the environment can make a microbe a pathogen by chance. 

To test this idea, scientists made yeast stick to a plastic and then tested how well it harmed caterpillars. The yeast became better at sticking and growing in groups. They tested if this made it more likely to harm caterars and found it did. The study used a caterpillar as a model to see how microbes cause disease. This is a common way to study how microbes cause disease in animals. The yeast was chosen because it's easy to study and found in many places. The study found that making yeast stick to plastic made it more likely to cause disease. This shows that a helpful trait in the environment can make a microbe a pathogen by chance. This is a common feature of evolution, where one trait leads to another. In this case, sticking to plastic led to growing in groups and causing disease. This is common in industrial and medical settings, where microbes stick to surfaces. The study shows that sticking to a surface can make a microbe more likely to cause disease.
Researchers have studied how changes in the amino acid sequence of proteins called prion-like domains (PLDs) affect their stability and ability to form molecular condensates. They used a computer model called Mpipi to simulate the behavior of six different PLDs from various proteins: hnPA, TDP, FUS, EWS, RBM, T1, and IA. The simulations showed that the stability of PLDs changes with the number and type of amino acid mutations, following specific rules. These rules are consistent with the physical and chemical properties of the mutations and apply to all tested PLDs, suggesting they can be used to predict changes in stability of PL condens.

The study found that for at least one protein, hnPA, there are rules that explain changes in thermodynamic parameters of condens in response to precise amino acid mutations. They investigated if similar rules can predict changes in critical parameters of a broader set of PLDs in response to amino sequence mutations. The rules are cumulative, meaning effects of successive mutations can be predicted by adding them as long as the mutation keeps PL composition and patterning.

The researchers used a systematic approach to vary amino sequence of PLDs to see how they change with compositional perturbations. For each type of mutation, they defined and tested three types of scaling laws. They found that changes in critical temperatures of PL as a function of number and type of amino mutations can be quantified by laws, conserved across the family of PL.

To help understand the laws, they organized data in a table showing effect of single mutations on critical temperatures of PL as function of PL length. Consistent with evidence and predictions, interactions involving aromatic residues are dominant in stabilizing condens formed by PL.
Researchers have long sought to use brain signals to predict an individual's cognitive traits or clinical conditions. Traditional approaches focus on structural aspects, such as brain connectivity or activity over time, but overlook a crucial aspect: how brain activity unfolds over time. Describing these patterns is challenging due to their complexity and unclear use in prediction. A new approach uses a Hidden Markov model (HMM) and Fisher kernel to predict traits. The Fisher is constructed mathematically, preserving the model's structure, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This approach leverages time-vary and functional information for prediction, with applications in neuroscience and personalized medicine.

In this study, an approach was established to describe brain activity over time to predict traits. The H-Fisher kernel accurately and reliably predicted traits from neuroimaging data, preserving the model's structure. This is essential for studies with small, heterogeneous samples, where a model is fit to controls and tested on patients. The approach's potential was shown in an fMRI dataset and simulated data, focusing on within-session changes in functional and amplitude from scans during wakeful rest. Parameters were used to predict behavioral traits. The Hidden Markov Model (H) was used, a probabilistic model of time-vary and functional dynamics. Despite its importance, reliability is often ignored in predicting traits from neuroimaging features. The Fisher approach, preserving the H's structure, accurately and reliably predicted traits from brain dynamics. It was compared to kernels ignoring the model's structure and a previously used based on Kull-Leibler divergence, and time-averaged connectivity methods.
Researchers have found that a protein called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRK2) is involved in two diseases: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Crohn's disease. LR2 variants of this protein lead to increased phosphorylation of its substrates. To understand how LR2 activity is regulated, scientists performed a targeted RNA screen and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LR2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. They used imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes and found that Rab12 is recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to a local increase in LR2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10. This suggests a conserved mechanism where Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates recruitment of LR2 and phosphorylation of its substrates at the lysosome.

LR2's recruitment to lysosomes may promote phosphorylation by increasing the local concentration of LR in proximity to its substrates. Researchers examined two PD-linked variants associated with increased LR2 activity, LR2 R1 and V35D, and found increased levels of LR on lysosomes. They used endogenous conditions to demonstrate that Rab, but not Rab29, regulates LR-mediated phosphorylation of Rab and Rab regulates localization and activation of LR on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. PD-linked LR variant R1, outside LR's kinase domain, and V35 have been shown to increase LR activity in previous studies.

LR2 activity is observed in pathogenic PD variants and sporadic patients, but mechanisms of LR regulation and response to endosomal stress remain unclear. Researchers identify Rab as a novel regulator of LR activation and demonstrate Rab plays a role in mediating LR-dependent phosphorylation response to lysosomal damage. They show Rab promotes phosphorylation by recruiting LR to lysosomes following lysosomal rupture. Pathogenic variants V35 and LR1 result in increased levels of LR and pRab on lysosomes. Data delineate a conserved mechanism where LR activity is regulated and response to lysosomal and genetic variants with disease.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the cell cycle of non-adherent cells, which are cells that do not stick to a surface. Current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, but non-adherent cells remain challenging. The new method combines a specialized surface to enhance attachment, the FUCCI (CA2) sensor, automated image analysis, and machine learning. This allows precise measurement of cell cycle durations in non-adherent cells. The method was tested in myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi, which have unique cycle characteristics. The impact of cycle-modulating drugs on NB cells was also tested. The system is also compatible with adherent cells and is fully automated, providing insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This presents a valuable tool for cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive cycle analysis in both adherent and nonherent cells.

The method was validated by comparing to manual tracking methods, which have been shown to be inaccurate. The workflow is explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5. Single cells were followed and annotated according to the color of red and green images, confirming the impact of CD inhibitors. The difference in cycle progression of NB vs Kasumi cells was evident. Time-lapse images were composed of red and green channels, detecting markers of the FUCCI (2 indicator.

The method allows researchers to analyze thousands of non-adherent cells per condition using image and data pipelines to perform processing, tracking, filtering, and cycle identification. The workflows rely on Fiji and R software, widely used by the community. Scripts are publicly available for customization. This streamlines cycle of cells expressing FUCCI (2 and makes it accessible to researchers with basic knowledge.
Researchers studied the relationship between brain size and cognitive abilities in 16 primate species, focusing on the prefrontal brain regions involved in metacognition and working memory. They found that the size of these regions, as well as the whole brain, was influenced by body mass, daily distance traveled, and population density. This suggests that metacognition and working memory are crucial for foraging skills in primates. The frontal pole region was more sensitive to social constraints than the dorso-lateral prefrontal region, consistent with studies showing its role in complex social interactions. The study highlights the relative importance of social and ecological constraints on the evolution of prefrontal brain and associated cognitive functions in primates.

The researchers used brain imaging data from 16 primate species to measure the size of the frontal pole and dorso-lateral prefrontal regions, involved in metacognition and working memory. They examined their relation to socio-ecological variables, such as population density and daily distance traveled. The size of these regions was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily distance, and population. This indicates that metacognition and working are essential for foraging skills in primates. The frontal pole was more sensitive to social constraints than the dorso-lateralfront, consistent with studies showing its role in complex interactions.

The study aimed to evaluate the strength of relation between prefrontal regions and socio-ecological variables across species, observed in the wild, complementing laboratory studies and bridging neurosciences, ecology, and primate evolution. Metacognition and working are critical foraging in primates, especially when traveling long distances and dealing complex navigation. This is in line with the ecological hypothesis, but provides insight into specific neuroognitive associated foraging strategies.
Researchers investigated how muscle fibers grow in response to increased mechanical loading, such as during exercise, and found that growth is largely due to an increase in the number of myofibrils, rather than their size. To study this, they developed a new method called fluorescence imaging of myofils with deconvolution (F-ID) that uses a standard microscope to visualize myofils with high resolution and contrast. They validated this method by comparing it to electron microscopy and found it was accurate. Using F-ID, they measured the size and number of myils in mouse and human muscles before and after exercise and found that growth is due to an increase in number of myils, not size. This is important for understanding muscle growth and development and provides a new tool for researchers to study it.
Researchers studied the role of SNAP25, a protein involved in releasing vesicles from neurons, in causing epileptic encephalopathy. They found three mutations: V48, D166, and I67, which affect its interaction with synaptagmin-1 (Sy1) and destabilize the SNARE complex. These mutations reduced Sy1-dependent vesicle docking and Ca2-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48 and D166 mutants led to reduced readily releable pool (RP) size, increased spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) release, and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased release, a gain-of-function not found in Sy1 knockout neurons. The I67 mutant decreased mSC frequency and evoked EP amplitudes due to increased energy barrier for fusion, while RP size was unaffected.

The mutations V48 and D166 increased spontaneous association with SNAREs, resulting in unregulated fusion. In contrast, the I67 mutant decreased mSC frequency and evoked EP amplitudes due to increased energy barrier for fusion. The RP size was unaffected, which could be compensated by lowering the barrier. Pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 changed the energy landscape for priming and fusion.

The study confirmed previous findings of increased release and reduced evoked by V48 and D166. The role of Sy1 and Sy1:SN interactions in ves priming has been controversial. The RP is assessed by applying hypertonic solution to neurons, usually 0.5 M sucrose. A missense mutation in the SN bundle I67 leads to increased energy for fusion. Disease display inefficient neuronal survival. Overall, SNAP encephal caused by single point mutations presents interdependent deficits, must be overcome for treatment.

In vitro analysis found both mutations lower Sy1 to SN-protein liposomes. This has consequences for understanding the role of SN:Syt in priming and release. It demonstrates the challenge of mechanism-based treatments in presence of multiple effects by single mutations. The role of Sy1:SN might be catalytic, lowering energy along the path to prim, affecting rates. Transient binding to Sy might SNAP assist SN complex formation, while mutants prestructure protein, bypassing Sy1.
Researchers analyzed data from thousands of researchers across 30 countries and found that disciplines with a higher proportion of women tend to have lower research quality and lower funding rates. This applies to both men and women, and is consistent across various measures such as the number of research outputs and bibliometric data. The study builds on previous findings that women's work is undervalued, regardless of who performs it. 

The study used independent datasets to examine research success and quality, and found a correlation between the proportion of women in a discipline and lower evaluations and funding rates. Both male and female researchers in female-dominated fields receive lower evaluations. This is robust across different disciplines and bibliometric measures. Funding rates also show a similar correlation, with male-dominated fields having higher success and quality scores than female-dominated fields. Accounting for researcher characteristics like age, institution, and publishing patterns, the results remain the same. Male-dominated fields have higher funding and quality than female fields, for both men and women.

The findings do not suggest research in female-dominated fields is of lower quality, but rather that they are consistently evaluated as lower than male-dominated fields. This affects everyone, but disproportionately women. Some studies show that as workforce becomes more female, salaries fall. To see if evaluation of research quality changes with feminization, longitudinal data is needed, which is not available. However, it's possible that research in female fields is evaluated lower due to feminization over time.
Researchers have developed a new strategy called "P editing" that enables the use of protein-protein interactions to activate the CRISPR-C9 system, a powerful tool for editing the genome. This system is a key component of synthetic biology, which aims to design molecular circuits that process information in a predictable manner like electronic circuits within living cells. By linking protein-protein interactions to the formation of a functional CRPR-C9 guide, scientists can modulate the expression of a target gene or record information to DNA.

The team engineered the crRNA:acrRNA interaction to demonstrate that various protein-protein interactions and chemical dimerization of domains can activate editing in human cells. They also showed that P can be used with AD-based RNA sensors, allowing specific RNAs to induce genome edits in larger circuits. This enhances the control of CRPR-based editing, making it suitable for synthetic circuits in living cells.

The researchers explored whether P can be coupled with AD RNA sensors to control editing based on expression, expanding the range of inputs that drive specific editing in synthetic circuits. They also demonstrated that molecular sensors can control cellular components of synthetic circuits by outputting genome events, expanding the range of activities that can be programmed by editing.

To improve P efficiency and specificity, the team engineered the cr-MS/Box-pacrRNA design. They developed a strategy called P, which uses protein-protein interactions to form the active CRPR complex. P is based on the dual gRNA of the CRPR-C9 system, but with cr:acr dimer replaced with protein RNA aptamers like MS and Box hairpins. This design mimics the molecules within CR9, discovered as the dual-guided system. The team further developed a proximity sensor that drives genome editing.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to have a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended to be consumed at least twice a week (Fernandez et al, 2021). PUFs have been found to increase the slow-rectifier current (IK) in the heart by shifting the voltage dependence of activation (Elinder and Li,201). The IK current is crucial for the repolarization of the ventricular action potential (AP) and is mediated by the KCQ/KC1 channel complex, which associates with the KCNE subunit.

Loss-of-function mutations in KCQ/KC1 are associated with long QT (LQ) syndrome, a condition characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (Splski et al,200; Tester Ackerman,201). LQ mutations reduce the IK current, leading to a prolongation of the ventricular AP. In contrast to other Kv channels, such as Shaker K, which are inactivated in low K, KCQ/K1 has a unique properties: it has a small single-channel conductance and low open probability.

Polyunsaturated acids activate KCQ channels by binding to two sites: one in the voltage sensor domain, shifting the voltage dependence to more negative, and the other in the pore, increasing the maximal conductance (G). However, the mechanism by which PUs increase G is poorly understood. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCQ is unstable, contributing to the low probability, and the PU-induced increase in G is caused by stabilization of the selectivity in an open-conductive state.
Researchers have long known that a deficiency in vitamin B6 is linked to cognitive impairments in various brain disorders, but the molecular mechanisms behind this connection are not well understood and whether supplementing with vitamin B improves cognition is unclear. An enzyme called pyridoxal 5-phosphatase (PDX) controls the levels of pyridal 5-phosphate (PL), the active form of vitamin B in the body, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention. However, there are no drugs that inhibit PDX to test this concept. A study identified a decline in PDX-dependent PL levels in the hippocampus of mice, providing a rationale for developing PDX inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, crystallography, and biolayerometry, researchers discovered 7,8-dihydroflavone (7,8HF) as a direct and potent PDX inhibitor. 7,8HF binds and reversibly inhibits PDX with micromolar affinity and submicrom potency. In hippocal neurons, 7,8HF increases PL in a PDX-dependent manner, validating PDX as a druggable target. The discovery of 7,8HF as a PDX inhibitor offers new insights into the controversy surrounding its effects in the brain.

PL deficiency has been associated with brain disorders for decades, yet causal links remain unclear. Aside from vitamin B administration, pharmacological strategies to elevate intracellular PL levels are lacking. Researchers identified 7,8HF as a direct PDX inhibitor that increases PL levels in hippocal neurons, validating PDX as a druggable to control intracellular levels in the brain. The expression of P is substantially upregulated in hippoc of middle-aged mice, suggesting that vitamin supplementation alone may not suffice under conditions where the PL-degrading phosphase is active. The discovery of 8 as direct P inhibitor was unexpected.

The identification of  as P inhibitor indicates it may modulate vitamin-dependent processes and P could be explored as entry into disorders.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the development of the gonad requires the production of diverse cell types and their migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development is not well understood. The gonad in C. elegans has a mirror-symmetric structure, guided by the migration of distal tip (DTC) cells, which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGP) Z1 and Z4. Researchers found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which have mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizzled receptor and Wnt proteins (CWN-1, C-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In LIN-17 mutants, C-2 promotes normal polarity in Z and Z, while C-1 promotes normal polarity in Z and Z, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits polarization of both Z and Z. In LIN- E-20-C-2 mutants, polarity of Z is reversed, resulting in frequent mis-migration of DTC from Z to the posterior. Further analysis shows that mis-position of DTC in the gon due to polarity reversal of Z leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in C-1 RNAi animals producing ectopic DTC. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating production and migration of DTC to establish mirror-symmetric organ.
Researchers have been exploring ways to develop combination therapies that take advantage of trade-offs in resistance, where resistance to one drug leads to sensitivity to another. However, questions remain about the reliability of these trade-offs, specifically whether mutants resistant to one drug have similar trade-offs. This is challenging because resistant mutants in the clinic and lab are often biased towards those with large benefits. To address this, scientists performed experiments to capture a wider range of mutations that give yeast an advantage against fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. They quantified trade-offs for 774 mutants across 12 environments, grouping them into classes with characteristic trade-offs. These trade-offs suggest each group affects fitness through different mechanisms. Some findings are surprising, such as mutants resistant to one drug not being resistant to combination, and same gene having different trade-offs. This demonstrates difficulty in relying on consistent trade-offs for multidrug treatments, but also shows that hundreds of mutations can be reduced to a few with characteristic trade-offs, potentially empowering multidrug strategies. By grouping mutants with similar trade-offs, the number of resistant mutants can be reduced from 774 to a manageable six for investigating molecular mechanisms. This approach may be useful for multidrug regimens that exploit trade-offs, but requires a large collection of barcoded mutants and ability to measure fitness in multiple environments. Across 774 yeast lineages, 6 distinct groups with trade-offs were found across 12 environments. The goal was to count types of mutations, each defined by unique trade-offs, in a drug-resistant population. This is surprisingly difficult due to mutations providing strongest advantage dominating evolution. To enhance diversity, multiple evolutions were performed in range of fluconazole and combination with second drug.
Researchers have long observed a phenomenon called the "central tendency" or "contraction" bias" in various species and sensory modalities, where the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This is thought to be an optimal strategy of the brain's ability to learn the structure of sensory input. On the other hand, recency biases such as serial dependence are also observed and thought to reflect the content of working memory. A recent study in rats suggests that both biases may be more related than previously thought. When the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short and long-term biases were reduced. A model was proposed that may be involved in generating behavior, showing that working memory is susceptible to shifting to past experience, producing short sensory biases naturally leads to contraction. Errors at the level of trials are from the distribution of stimuli and not a shift of memory towards the mean. Results are consistent with behavioral findings and predictions across different distributions and timings, intervals, as well as dynamics in working areas. The model was validated by human psychophysics experiments on auditory parametric working memory task.
Researchers investigated the role of the PD-LIM-containing protein 2 (PIM2) in lung cancer and its potential as a target for therapy. PIM is a tumor suppressor protein that is often repressed in lung cancer, contributing to chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance. The study used human samples and a mouse model to examine PIM genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. They found that PIM repression in lung cancer is due to both genetic and epigenetic alterations. A nanoparticle-encapsulated PIM expression (nanoPIM) was tested as a treatment, combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. Results showed that nanoPIM had low toxicity, high specificity, and antitumor activity, and improved the efficacy of anti-P-1 and chemother drugs, leading to complete remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in others. Mechanistically, nanoIM increased major histocompatibility class I (MHC) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR) induction, and tumor-related genes, and enhanced lymphocyte infiltration, making tumors sensitive to IC and chemotherapeutic and activating tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). These studies established a clinically applicable PIM-based therapy for lung and possibly other cancers.
Animals have a system to evaluate food quality and adjust their feeding behavior to survive in challenging environments. However, the mechanisms that regulate this system, which monitors nutrients from food and influences feeding behavior, are not fully understood. Researchers developed a low-quality food assay and found that heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli) and low-sugar food triggers a cellular response that encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. This system depends on the unfolded protein response (UPR) and innate immunity axis, particularly in neurons, which regulates feeding behaviors. Animals can adapt to low-quality food through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UP-regulated response by increasing vitamin biosynthesis.

The study used a low food evaluation system to elucidate the mechanism of the cellular response as a physiological system. This assesses glucose deficiency and vitamin content in animals through the UP- innate axis. A food mechanism was identified that recognizes quality through UP regulated response in neurons, dictating avoidance behaviors. This system is an adaptation for detecting deficiencies not by the quick nervous system. A limitation is the lack of explanation for HK-E coli activating UP and immunity. It's hypothesized that heat-killed HK may lack or contain metabolites that activate or inhibit UP, triggering avoidance. The innate pathway, mediated by PM-38, plays a role in evaluating unfavorable sources, such as HK coli, staphylococcus, and pseudomonas, and avoiding environments. Nutrients sensed by the X-PM axis for quality were investigated. Animals may assess quality through UP and innate pathways. Whether UP and innate play a role in low-quality was examined. Activation of UP by HK was dependent on known components, including IREBP, PER, and ATF.
Carbohydrates play a crucial role in various biological processes, but how they interact with important targets like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is not well understood. Researchers studied the P2 purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a target for inflammation and immune responses, to find out how sugar molecules activate GPCRs. They used computer simulations and experiments to identify the sugar-binding site on P2 and found that UDP-glucose activates the receptor by bridging two parts of the protein. A specific chain was found to distinguish different sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDPgalactose, UDPgluronic acid, and UDP-acetylglucamine. This chain is a functional motif for both P2 and P purceptor 12 (P2). New sugar molecules were designed to target this motif and activate P2. This study expands understanding of purergic receptors and provides insights for carbohydrate-based drug development for GPC.

Purinoceptors are a family of receptors responding to nucleotides, including ADP and UDP. P14 is unique as it's activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, UDP-sug. The arrangement of sugar-binding sites between P and sugarases may determine selectivity. A conserved motif was found in P and P, extending understanding of carbohydrate regulation of GPC. Studies with other sugars showed interactions with TM7 determine potency. The carbohydrate site has not been fully characterized for GPC, except P. Other members of the subfamily can be directly activated by carbohydrates. Models provide details for activation and recognition, inspiring drug development for GPC. Whether other motifs exist in GPC is unknown, further investigations will add to the field.
Researchers studied the role of glial cells in regulating the behavior of neural stem cells called neuroblasts (NB) in fruit flies. They found that glial cells produce ferritin, a protein that helps transport iron into NB for energy production, which is essential for their self-renewal and proliferation. Knocking down glial ferritin genes caused energy shortage in NB, leading to low proliferation and premature differentiation. Ferritin is also a potential target for tumor suppression. The study shows that glial cells are crucial for maintaining NB self-renew, revealing a new role of the glial niche in brain development.

The researchers investigated iron homeostasis in fruit fly CNS by knocking down genes involved in transport, storage, and regulation in NB, neurons, and glial cells. Only glial knockdown of ferritin genes led to NB loss and defective brain development. Ferritin in glial cells is crucial for regulating NB behavior and larval development. In a proliferative state, NB receive iron from glial via ferr to fulfill energy requirements for proliferation and self-renew. The required iron by NB is stored in ferritin glial cells and allocated as needed. Bicellular ironostasis makes glial the pool for ferr production, relieving NB from producing ferr and transferring risk of iron-induced oxidative stress to glial cells.

Glial cells clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets, ensuring NB normal function during development. The study explores whether bicellular ironostasis exists in other stem cells and niches. Normal NB converted to immortal NB, highly proliferative, need nutrients including iron. Iron is vital for all living organisms, participating in electron transport and cellular respiration supporting ATP production for cellular activities. The size of tumors decreased in larval brains lacking glial ferritin, suggesting glial ferr required for tumor development, a potential target for treatment.
Researchers investigated the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 mortality in the US population during the pandemic. They analyzed death certificate data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, and found that cancer mortality rose by only 3% over the pre-pandemic baseline, resulting in 13,600 excess deaths. Mortality was higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological) and lower for cancers with poor survival (lung, pancreatic). In contrast, deaths from diabetes and Alzheimer's increased by 37% and 19, respectively. To understand these differences, the researchers simulated expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each condition. They found that mortality differences were primarily due to life expectancy, with risk of death from cancer outcompeting risk of death from COVID-19.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops from eukotic chromosomes. R-loops are abnormal structures formed during gene transcription, consisting of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a strand of genomic DNA. They can be toxic to cells and contribute to disease. The Smc/6 complex, a regulator of chromosome architecture, binds to R-loops and promotes their degradation by the enzyme RNase H2. This process is essential for removing toxic R-lo at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. Yeast mutants lacking the Sm/6 complex and RNase H accumulate high levels of R-lo in their chromosomes, leading to synthetic lethality. The Sm/6 complex acts on specific RNA-DNA hybrids and stimulates RNase2 activity in vitro. It is involved in the repair of unscheduled-lo generated by various genomic transactions, particularly during gene transcription and telomere regulation. Sm/6 binds to R-lo and promotes RNase2-mediated degradation of the RNA component. Defects in both RNase and Sm/6 lead to accumulation of-lo in chromosomes. R-lo are frequently found at highly transcribed genes, telomeres, and replication forks.
Researchers investigated whether older adults' preserved attentional abilities can compensate for age-related hearing loss in sensory acuity. They found that listening performance remained stable over two years, despite expected decline in hearing sensitivity. However, attentional filtering and listening abilities followed separate developmental trajectories. The study analyzed electroencephalographic and behavioral data from 105 individuals aged 39-82. The results suggest that attentional filtering is not a reliable predictor of individual change in listening behavior over time. 

The study aimed to replicate previous findings and test the relationship between brain and behavior across time. It was expected that neural filtering would impact listening accuracy and speed independently of age and hearing status. However, in the longitudinal sample, no evidence was found for a predictive role of filtering despite observed links within each time point. 

The analysis characterized hearing, filtering, and listening changes across middle to older adulthood. Longitudinal change from time 1 to 2 was analyzed using linear mixed models. Test-retest reliability was quantified as Pearson's correlation. No systematic change in filtering was expected due to interindividual differences being independent of age and hearing. The stability of the age and hearing-independent effect of filtering on accuracy and response was tested. 

Behavioral outcome of interest was speed and accuracy in solving difficult listening situations, involving perceptual and cognitive processes. A neurobiological implementation of attentional filter was examined to explain interindividual differences and lifespan trajectories.
Researchers investigated how the role of chemosensation, the combination of taste and smell, in guiding the use of medicinal plants in ancient Greece and Rome. They tested whether the intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as specific tastes and flavors, could predict the therapeutic uses of botanicals recorded in ancient texts. The study found that chemensation was a strong predictor of therapeutic use: drugs with high versatility had simple tastes and intense flavors, and 21 out of 22 chemensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. In addition to bitter, musky, sweet, and soapy flavors were associated with versatility. The study suggests that ancient uses of drugs were based on physiological effects consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste pharmacology, not imbalance of bodily humors as previously thought. 

The researchers hypothesized that chemensation and physiological effects mediated by chemestesis and taste pharmacology explain the diversity of uses of botanicals in ancient times. They tested whether tastes and flavors, determined by a modern panel, predicted uses recorded in ancient texts, providing insight into how chemensation guided behavior in prehistoric times. The theory of humors, underlying Western medicine from ancient to Industrial Age, was discredited, but this study proposes a link to modern medicine through taste and flavor of drugs. The study used phylogenetic methods to assess plant properties and behavior, showing chemens connects ancient knowledge to modern, despite different etiologies.
Researchers have found that certain bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Salmonella and E. coli, are attracted to human serum, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and bloodstream infections. They used a device to simulate bleeding and found that tiny amounts of serum can attract these bacteria. This attraction is due to a chemical signal called L-serine, which is abundant in serum and recognized by a receptor called Tsr. The researchers found the structure of Salmonella T bound to L-ser and a shared recognition motif among T orthologs. Tsr is conserved among Enterobacteraceae, including World Health Organization priority pathogens. They also found that these bacteria use serum as a food source and chemotaxis and T provide an advantage for migration into hemorrhagic lesions. This behavior is called "bacterial vampirism" and may relate to their proclivity for bloodstream infections.

Experiments showed that attraction to serum is diminished with L-serase treatment, supporting direct recognition of L-ser by T. The response is conserved across Salmonella serovars and L-ser in serum could be a nutrient source during infection. Chemotaxis with T strain showed T is not the only receptor for serum but plays a role in high L-ser concentration. The researchers hypothesized attraction to serum through T might extend beyond Salmonella to other species. They found L-ser functions as a cue for Salmonella but other nutrients in serum provide growth advantages. Structural studies showed recognition of L-ser by T in Salmonella, E. coli, and C. koser from human, horse, and pig share rapid taxis to serum. An enterohemorrhagic model showed chemaxis T can mediate bloodstream entry.
Researchers have identified a common genetic program that defines the identity of male cells across different animal species, which has been conserved over 600 million years of evolution. This program is made up of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, with a third being deeply conserved and retained throughout evolution. A core component of this program is a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene regulators that represent the conserved genetic basis of metazoan spermatogenesis. Interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male cell identity revealed 161 previously unknown sperogenesis genes and three potential causes of human infertility. The findings highlight the importance of evolutionary history on reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline for other cell and pathologies.

The study analyzed the sperocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species to understand the conserved origin of metazo male cells at the molecular level. They found that despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ with new genes, conserved genes remain central in the germ cell transcriptome of distant species. The team explored this increased connectivity to gain insight into the conserved basis of metazo spermatogenesis. They observed that in both vertebrates and invertebrates, the germ transcript has an old origin tempered by increased expression of younger genes at developmental stages. Data indicates a sperogenic program spanning over 600 million evolution, expanding previous observations in mammalian lineage.

The researchers propose that despite rapid evolution of reproductive genes, the basis of metazo male cell relies on conserved program providing insight into sperogenesis and human infertility. They devised an interdisciplinary platform combining four approaches to test this hypothesis.
Researchers studied how the tiny organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii swims using its flagella, or whip-like structures, to move through water. They found that the flagella beat in a synchronized, or coordinated, way to steer the organism in different directions. This coordination relies on the flagella's asymmetry, or differences, such as how they respond to chemical signals. The researchers wanted to know how the flagella stay in sync despite their differences. One idea was that one flagellum, or flagella, leads the other in beating, copying its properties. They used experiments, computations, and modeling to investigate the role of each flagellum in synchronized beating. They selectively loaded one flagell with a non-invasive technique and found that beating only responds to load on that flagell. Asymmetry comes from unilateral coupling between flagella. Results show distinct roles for each flagell in coordination and implications for flagellate behavior.
Researchers investigated the mechanism behind the benefits of intermittent fasting on metabolism. They found that it promotes the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by a type of immune cell called innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the gut. This leads to an increase in "beigeing" of subcutaneous white adipose tissue, which is a type of fat tissue that burns energy. Adopting ILCs from the gut into mice with diet-induced obesity increased this process. Exogenous IL-22 also increased beiging of white adipose tissue. However, a deficiency of IL-22 receptor (IL-R) reduced the effect of intermittent fasting on beiging. Single-cell sequencing of immune cells revealed that fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon signaling in ILCs. Analysis of cell interactions showed that fasting stimulates interaction between ILs and dendritic cells and macrophages. These results suggest that ILCs play a role in beig of adipose tissue, and the IL-22/IL-22 axis contributes to the benefits of intermittent fasting.
Researchers studied how animals respond to threats and danger in a controlled environment. They used mice to test how associative and non-associative factors influence defensive behavior. Associative factors are learned connections between a stimulus and a threat, while non-associative are automatic responses to a stimulus. The researchers paired a tone and white noise with a foot shock to see how mice react. They compared this group with mice that had unpaired or reversed tone and noise, or only shock. On the first day, the paired mice froze during the tone and jumped during noise. The unpaired and reversed groups showed less freezing and rarely jumped or darted. During extinction, the paired mice's tone freezing decreased and jumping increased. The unpaired, unpaired, and shock groups showed tail rattling and darting. The reversed group didn't jump to noise, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings show non-associ factors promote responsiveness, but associative are needed for cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight.

The researchers used a modified Pavlovian paradigm to elicit a range of defensive responses. Associative and non-associ factors combine to produce distinct transitions between freezing and flight. The paired and unpaired groups showed different responses to the tone and noise. Freezing and activity were higher in the paired group, highlighting the impact of tone-shock contingency on responses. Sensitization and salience intensify freezing to auditory stimuli and increase reactivity to noise after stress. This highlights the need to understand associative and non-associ elements of Pavian fear conditioning that influence defensive behavior. Darting is often measured less in conditioning, limiting insight into response dynamics. A modified Pavian paradigm elicits both freezing and flight in response to conditioned stimuli, findings replicated in mice and rats. In standard Pavian paradigms, freezing is the dominant behavior evoked by cues paired with an aversive stimulus, like shock. Other responses like jumping and darting are less studied.
Researchers investigated how insects navigate their environment by tracking their direction. Previous studies showed that insects encode direction as a sinusoidal pattern around a ring of neurons in an eight-column structure. However, it was unclear if this sinusoidal encoding is an evolutionary coincidence or offers a functional advantage. The study established the mathematical requirements for direction encoding and found that many circuits can perform it with different patterns. Among these patterns, the sinusoidal is most resilient when coupled with sinusoidal connectivity between neurons. The predicted pattern was compared with anatomical data from locust and fruit fly heads, showing agreement. It was demonstrated that the circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, meaning connectivity doesn't need to be encoded in the insect's genetic program but can develop during development. The theory suggests that the eight-column organization of direction circuits across insects is not a coincidence but explained by evolutionary principles.

 Studies have shown that integrating neurons in insects have sinusoidal patterns (Wittmann and Schler, 1995; Vstaff and Paolo,2005; Stone et al,2017). Future work could compare direction encoding in insects with mammals, which use a different method with more neurons. Electrophysiology and imaging showed population encoding direction in insects has sinus-shaped patterns (Lab,198;Lab,200;Lo and Hom,200;Pfe et,200;Pfe and Hom,200;Kin,200;Hein,200;Hom,201;El,201;El,201). Insect heading circuits have been studied with models ranging from simple (Witt and Schler,199;C et,201) to complex (Kak and Bort,201; et,201; et,201;Pis,202; et,202).

Previous work argued sinus encoding facilitates vector addition (Witt and Schler,199). However, this can't be the only reason as shown a family of circuits enable easy addition. The predicted circuit was compared with locust and fly data, showing strong agreement. It was found that simple Hebb learning can develop the circuit.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations in PTEN kinase 1 (PINK) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CIS1, a homodimer mitochondrial iron-sulf-binding protein, is a target of Park-mediated ubiquitination. Researchers discovered a heightened propensity of CIS1 to form dimers in PINK mutant flies and dopaminergic neurons from PD patients with PINK mutations. The dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by a disulf bridge. In this conformation CIS1 cannot coordinate the ironulf cofactor. Overexpressing CIS, the Drosophila ortholog of CIS1, and a mutant CIS incapable of binding the ironulf cluster in Drosila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was pronounced with mutant CIS and aggravated in PINK mutant flies. Complete loss of CIS, in contrast, rescued detrimental effects of PINK mutation on climbing ability, posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial structure.

The study suggests CIS, ironpleted CIS, operates downstream of PINK, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CIS1 as a therapeutic target. CIS1 is a mitochondrial-sulf protein downstream of the pathophys cascade initiated by PINK and Pr loss function in flies and probably in humans. This sheds light on PD pathophysiology and implicates CIS1 as a therapeutic protein. CIS, specifically its ironpleted form, is a mediator of path effects from PINK loss and Park function. Investigation revealed dopamin neurons from PD patients with PINK mutations and PINK flies exhibit increased levels of slower-migrating CIS/CIS on immunoblots. CIS role in PD was investigated using fly and mammalian systems. Identified CIS, its ironpleted form, as mediator of PD induced by PINK and Park loss function. Immunlot revealed dimer formation and presence CIS under conditions. Increased dimer in P neurons represents apo-CIS, CIS devoid of ironulf, caused by changes homeostasis.

CISD overexpression was neurotoxic, disrupted morphology, and accumulation phosph-ubitin which blocks mitagy, resulting defective mitochondria. CIS suggests role in red imbalance and dysreg, implicating ironpleted CIS.
A parasite called phytoplas produces a protein called SAP54 that changes its host plant to make it more attractive to leafhopper insects, which help spread the parasite to new plants. The mechanism behind this change is not well understood. Researchers found that SAP54 causes plants to grow leaves that resemble flowers, making them more attractive to leafhoppers. However, they also discovered that exposure to male leafoppers is necessary for this change, suggesting that the parasite distinguishes between male and female leafoppers. In contrast, SAP discourages female leafoppers from colonizing the plant. The study found that SAP suppresses the plant's stress response to male leafoppers and identified a key factor called SVP, which is involved in plant development. SAP promotes SVP degradation, making plants more vulnerable to maleoppers. This makes it easier for leafoppers to find mates and colonize the plant. The study shows how a single parasite gene can change its host and attract a vector, essential for its life cycle. It also reveals how plant and insect interactions are influenced by transcription factors that regulate development. 

The researchers further explored how SAP targets SVP, a conserved host regulator, to attract female leafoppers to plants exposed to maleoppers. They found that femaleoppers prefer to reproduce on SAP and SVP mutant plants in the presence of maleoppers, indicating a complex effect of SVP and other MADS factors by SAP on plant responses to different insect sexes. This interaction is detailed in a proposed mechanism. The study builds on previous finding that SAP promotes fecundity of the leafopper vector. They investigated what aspect of insect-plant interaction is affected by SAP. Females feed and lay eggs, while males feed, and plants respond differently to feeding and egg-laying. SAP plants exposed to males show downregulation of biotic responses. The MADS factor SVP is essential for female preference to male-exposed SAP plants. Leafopper females prefer reproducing on SVP mutant, contingent on presence of male, aligning with SAP degrading S in leaves. Phytopmas rely on leafoppers for feeding and transmission, so SAP likely promotes abundance of phytopma-carry vectors and facilitates transmission. This shows a gene extends influence beyond primary host to modulate insect choice and behavior.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and has a substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, in part, because C. albicans can initiate a drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration. Researchers used a nanol droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antif drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell stage with metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure, a time tolerance is measurable, cells bifurcate into two subpopulations: one characterized by upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal, RNA machinery, and mitochondrial capacity, termed Ribo-domin (Rd); the other enriched for stress and processes, termed Stressomin (S). This bifcation persists at 3 and 6 post-treatment. The ribosome stress response (RR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate survival.

Researchers used the DROPq system to explore phenotypic heterogeneity in C. alb response to antif drugs. They profiled transcriptomes of thousands of cells that were either untreated or exposed to antif compounds with a focus on fluconazole across several days. Studies have profiled ~K cells. In a preliminary study, they profiled C alb using a nanol droplet-based assay modified from the system. The use of nanol droplets enabled detailed analysis of C alb in absence and presence antif over days. The assay was cost-effective with minimal issues. Studies of thousands cells enriched understanding community and heterogeneity. Results align with reports associate cell phase with expression and genes. Next, they investigated alb response to antif using fungatic fluconazole and fungidal CSP. The mechanisms differ from bacterial resistance, which small exhibits growth in drugs. This study focuses on antif to fluazole, a well fungatic drug. Previous characterized aspects of tolerance in alb.
Researchers have proposed a new way to measure how well a species adapts to its environment, called the Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS). This index is based on how often a species uses certain codons, the building blocks of DNA, to make proteins. Past methods to measure adaptation were limited because they were affected by other factors like the amount of G and C in the DNA or the types of amino acids used. CAIS corrects for these issues and can be calculated from a single genome without needing data on genetic variation or mutation rates. It's a more direct way to see how well a species adapts than estimating population size from genetic diversity. The researchers tested CA on vertebrates, which have a lot of data, and found that more adapted species have more proteins with intrinsic disorder. This means their proteins are more flexible and can change shape. They also compared CA to another measure, the Effective Number of Codons, and found the same result. CA can be used on more species because it doesn't need genetic data or mutation rates, just a complete genome. It's also not affected by amino acid frequencies. The study suggests CA is a good way to see how species adapts at the molecular level.
Seps is a leading cause of millions of deaths worldwide and a global health priority declared by the World Health Organization. Seps-related deaths are due to dysregulated immune responses, highlighting the need for strategies to target inflammation. A key mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), released by inflamed host cells and bacteria in a strain-dependent manner. Researchers investigated mechanisms of bacterial ATP release using mutant Escherichia coli (E. coli) and found that ATP release is dependent on ATPase within the inner membrane. Additionally, impaired outer membrane integrity contributes to release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of sepsis, effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using transformed E. coli with an inducible periplasmic pyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abating bacterial release shows that ATP suppresses local responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and survival. Furthermore, ATP has systemic effects via outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OM are distributed throughout the body and upregulate expression of degranulation in neutils, potentially exacerbating seps severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial release and roles in seis pathogenesis.

E. coli, a frequent pathogen in abdominal seps, released highest amount of ATP in a mouse model. Demonstrating seis-associated release, researchers questioned how release is dependent. Release is dependent on bacterial, with no differences in counts observed. ATP by bacteria suppresses responses and worsens survival in se model. Rapidly metabolized in extracellular, mode of action is limited to vicinity. However, role in non-colon compartments, such as abdominal or blood, remains unknown. This study investigated if released ATP influences se outcome. Isolated seis bacteria and measured ATP release. E. coli released more than E. faalis and S. aureus. Species differed on sequences, confirming release is strain-specific. Seps-associated release in growth and strain-dependent manner.

Bacteria release ATP into extracellular space, a conserved mechanism from defense. Release shown for various, including seis E. coli, Klei pneumonia, E. faalis, and S aureus.
Researchers investigated the relationship between psychotic-like experiences (PLE) in children and the risk of developing schizophrenia and other mental disorders. They hypothesized that genetic and environmental factors, such as family and neighborhood environment, influence this relationship through cognitive functioning. Using large-scale data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study, they tested the effects of genetic and environmental factors on intelligence and PLE in 6,602 children. The study found that lower intelligence and higher PLE were associated with lower genetic scores for cognitive phenotypes, lower family and neighborhood socioeconomic status, and less supportive environments. Intelligence mediated the effects of these factors on PLE, with positive parenting and school environments showing the strongest impact in reducing PLE. The study highlights the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLE through their effects on intelligence. Improving school and family environments and promoting economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.
Researchers used human stem cell-derived cerebral organoids to study the effects of FGF8 signaling on brain development. They found that FGF treatment increased cellular diversity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic domains in multi-regional organoids. Within telencealic regions, F8 affected anterior-posterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABA and glutamatergic neurons, impacting spontaneous network activity. F8 also modulated regulators of several neurodevelopmental disorders. Transcript analysis revealed F8 induction of ventral telph genes, suggesting a primary role in promoting ventral identity. Upregulation of ventral genes like ASCL, DLX, PBX and downregulation of dorsal genes EMX, NEURO, SOX, LHX was observed. F8 treatment resulted in altered identities in 3D organoids compared to controls, developing multi-regional with coing domains.8 modulated NR2 and genes associated with brain disorders in FOX1 telph cells, underscoring its role in fine-tuning neurodevelopmental and pathogenic pathways. F8-dependent identity modulation along with N-related targets, including conserved F8-NRF molecular axis was highlighted. The ability of F8 to modulate targets varied based on regional identity of exposed cells. Co-presence of various domains in F8-treated organoids, specifically dorsal and ventralenceph, as well as dienceph and mesph regions, was significant.
Researchers studied how sleep and feeding patterns develop in fruit flies (Drosophila) as they grow from larvae to adults. They found that young larvae sleep and eat throughout the day, but as they mature, sleep and eating become organized into day and night patterns. The researchers wanted to know what triggers this change. They discovered that the nutritional status of the larvae, or how much food they have, drives the development of sleep-wake rhythms. In the second stage of larval development (L2), sleep and eating are spread out across the day, but by the third stage (L3), they are organized into daily patterns. If mature larvae are forced to eat like immature larvae, it disrupts sleep-wake and ability to form long-term memory. The researchers also found that the development of the clock circuit that regulates sleep is influenced by the nutritional environment. They discovered that a specific neurons, Dh44, act through glucose genes to drive daily sleepake rhythms. The study suggests that changes in energy demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circuits and behaviors.
Researchers studied how fish swim in groups, called schools, conserve energy while moving through water. They measured the energy used by fish swimming alone and in groups to understand if group movement is more efficient. The study focused on giant danio fish, a type of fish that swims in schools. 

The researchers found that fish swimming in groups use less energy than swimming alone, especially at high speeds. At maximum speed, group swimming fish used 44% more aerobic energy and 65% less anaerobic energy than solo fish. This reduced total energy expenditure by 53%, the lowest recorded for any aquatic animal. Group fish also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solo fish. Anaerobic energy savings at high speeds improve peak and repeated performance, helping fish evade predators. 

Fish swimming in groups save energy by increasing aerobic performance and reducing anaobic energy. This may explain why many fish swim in groups. The study used high-viscosity water to understand how group movement can be more energy-efficient than individual movement. Fish conserve energy in air or water resistance should be higher at higher speeds. They hypothesized fish groups reduce high-speed locomotion cost, reducing anaobic costs and recovery time. 

The study measured aerobic and anaobic energy used by fish swimming alone and in groups at various speeds (0.3-8 body lengths per second). They compared performance to solo fish. Fish in nature swim various speeds, but no study measured total expenditure and anaobic costs at high speeds. The swimming curve of fish from minimum to critical speed has not been measured. Both solo and group fish have a concave-shaped aerobic rate-speed curve at lower speeds. No difference in cost at 0.3-3 speeds. Group fish at 1 speed use less energy at slower speeds.
Researchers studied the immune cells called macrophages in the lungs, which play a crucial role in fighting infections. They found that these cells can change their behavior in response to signals from the body's immune system. Macrophages in the lungs, called tissue-resident macrophages, were compared to those from the blood, called monocyte-derived macrophages. Both types of macrophages responded to a signal from the immune system, called IF-γ, by increasing their energy production. However, the lung macroages did not decrease energy production like the blood macroages did. This change in energy production was linked to their ability to produce cytokines, which help fight infections. Blocking energy production reduced cytokine production in lung macroages, showing that energy is key to their response. Lung macroages were more responsive to IF-γ and dependent on energy for cytokine production than blood macroages. Another signal, TNF, was controlled by energy in lung macro but not blood macro. The study suggests lung macro are flexible and can be targeted for treatments for respiratory diseases.
For the first time, researchers have shown that nocturnal ants use the polarized light pattern produced by the moon for navigation. Unlike the sun, which can be hidden by clouds or the horizon, the moon can still provide directional information through its polarized light. The sun produces polarized light across the sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarized light is a known cue for navigating animals. The moon produces a similar pattern, but much dimmer than sunlight. The study shows that polarized moonlight is part of the compass for nocturnal ants.

Nocturnal ants leave their nest at twilight and rely on the solar polar pattern to navigate. However, when the sun can't guide them, they use polarized moonlight to find their way home. The ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar cycle, even under crescent moons when polar light is lowest. The study also shows that the moonlight is incorporated into the ants' path system for homing, like sunlight is during the day.

The research focused on nocturnal ants, specifically the Myrmecia species, which mostly navigate during twilight. These ants use the polarized light to derive information, which is visible during twilight. The study found that polarized moonlight is detectable throughout the lunar cycle, aligning with responses to polar sunlight. This suggests that moonlight is integrated into the ant's path for homing, like sunlight. The ants process moonlight through the same pathways as sunlight, using the same neural architecture.
Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. Their tails ended in a soft, thin vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane was crucial for early pter flight, but how this was achieved was unclear, as vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and absent in birds and bats.

Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-link lattice within the vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a dynamic tension system to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the tail to augment control and v function as a structure. 

Early pterosaurs, non-pteractloids, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base, similar to some dinosaurs like Velocaptor. Many tails ended in a soft vane, which may have contributed to passive stability in flight. The stiffening of tails suggests they were important for earlyter control of mass or inertial control, as in terrestrial theropods with convergent tails. Dynamic control could improve maneuverability and stability, but v flutter would be costly unless v was tensioned under aerodynamic load.

Over 100 pter fossils were examined for well-preserved vanes using ultraviolet. Four exceptional specimens were imaged under Laserim Fluorescence. Three exhibited vanes under light, but one was only visible under SF.
During adolescence, significant changes occur in behaviors related to reward, social interactions, and decision-making, which are crucial for transitioning into adulthood but also increase vulnerability to various psychiatric disorders. The reorganization of the dopamine system during this period is thought to underlie these changes and increased vulnerability. Researchers used fast cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine dopamine release and mechanisms in the nucleus accumb (N) core of adolescent (28-35) and adult (70) male rats. They found differences in baseline dopamine release between adult and adolescent rats, as well as opposite effects of α nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh) on dopamine release. The α-selective blocker, α-conxin, increased dopamine in adolescent but decreased in adult rats. Blockade of GABA and GABA receptors revealed α-mediated increase in adolescent release requires N GABA signaling. The role of αA and G in this effect was confirmed using microdial. Results suggest a multisynaptic mechanism unique to adolescence involving acetylcholine at α-containing A to drive inhibitory GABA on dopamine.

 The effect is driven by multisyn regulation of dopamine in adolescent through acetyl acting α-containing A and GABA. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence. One study found antagonizing GABA increased dopamine when β-containing A were antagonized, indicating G and A have complex regulation of release that may be age-dependent. We found dopamine release decreased in N core of adolescent rats. The effects of G alone in presence endogenous are independent of α control explored. Microdial in awake confirmed age differences in dopamine mediated by G involving α-containing A in vivo. The mechanism regulating release in adolescent and adult remains unclear. The N core has largest difference in release between adult and adolescent rats, so focused on understanding mechanisms in this region. Changes in release are implicated in psychiatric disorders, but much is unknown about driving age differences. The goal was to identify N core dopamine and mechanism for changes in adolescent and adult rats. Consistent with previous findings, variations in release were found.
Researchers studied individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to understand the underlying causes of the condition. They found that people with two different types of autism, idiopathic and 16p.2 deletion, had similar problems with neural cell growth and migration. This was surprising because their genetic tests showed no overlap between the two groups. To find out why this was happening, they looked at cell signaling pathways and found that the mTOR pathway was altered in both groups. This pathway is important for cell growth and development. They tested this by reducing or increasing mTOR activity in cells and found that it could fix or recreate autism-like problems. This suggests that mTOR dysregulation is a common cause of autism, even in different types of the condition.
Researchers have found that the diversity in the structure and function of synapses between inner hair cells (IHC) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the cochlea contributes to the diversity in sound-evoked firing of SGNs. Synaptic zones on the pillar side of IHC activate lower potentials than those on the modiolar side, which have more presynaptic Ca2 channels. Postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges. The relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural diversity is likely, but evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has been difficult to obtain.

To bridge this gap, researchers performed paired IHC and S bouton recordings in acutely explanted organs of Cort from mice with stimuli mimicking in vivo S characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous release (SR) were found on the pillar side of IHC, having larger and more compact EPs, lower thresholds, tighter Ca2 channels and vesicular sites, shorter latencies, and higher release rates. This indicates synaptic heterogeneity in IHC contributes to diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked SGN firing.

The study also highlights challenges in bridging the gap between presynaptic hair function and neural encoding. Heterogeneity exists among synapses formed by individual I with 5-30 SGNs. Synaptic heterogeneity has been found at tonopic positions of the cochlea and is a candidate for decomposing acoustic information. Researchers compared physiology affer synapses with high and low SR by adapting protocols employed in vivo characterization sound by Ss. Step depolarizations emulated physiological potentials mature I of 'high' cochlea have graded primarily the rectified stimulus.
Researchers have been trying to understand how the malaria parasite Plasium falciparum regulates its genes to survive and thrive in the human body. One protein, called MORC, has been found to play a crucial role in this process. MOR is involved in compacting DNA and silencing genes in plants and animals, and recent studies have shown it also plays a role in regulating genes in parasites. This study used a powerful tool called CRISPR/Cas to edit the parasite's genome and found that MOR is essential for the parasite's survival. It also found that MOR binds to specific regions of the DNA involved in antigen variation, which helps the parasite evade the immune system. When MOR was knocked down, the parasite's chromatin structure collapsed, leading to its death. These findings confirm MOR's role in gene regulation and make it a promising target for new malaria treatments.
Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, such as depression and anxiety, which can be linked to the presence of tumor-infiltrating nerves in the brain. Researchers used a mouse model of head and neck cancer to investigate this connection. They found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct areas of the brain and activate a circuit that affects behavior, leading to decreased nesting, increased latency to eat, and reduced running. Tumor-infiltrating nocicept neurons showed heightened activity and brain regions receiving these projections had elevated fos and calcium compared to non-tumor counterparts. Eliminating nocice neurons decreased fos and mitigated behavioral changes caused by tumor presence.

Pain treatment restored normal nesting behavior but not running, indicating pain is not the only driver of changes. The study suggests tumor-infiltr nerves communicate signals to brain leading to cancer changes in behavior, independently of pain. Eliminating TR1-expressing noc neurons reduced tumor growth and improved survival, highlighting a potential target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. Absence of noc neurons in tumor animals decreased fos and fos in brain regions, but not others. This suggests tumor-brain communication was disrupted without nocice neurons. Evaluating effects on cancer behavioral changes, animals' well-being was assessed through nesting behavior.

Findings are important as they show tumor-infiltr nerves integrated into established circuit from tumor to brain, influencing behavior in pain-dependent and independent ways. Cancer patients and survivors experience poor mental health, and neural connection between tumor and brain might contribute to changes.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its impact on the multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. They found that variations in the protein's intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) allow for plasticity, but also have functional constraints similar to other coronaviruses. Experiments with mutated proteins showed that changes in IDRs can affect thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid separation. In one variant, distant mutations in IDRs had compensatory effects, shifting the balance of interactions and creating a new protein-protein interface. The study suggests that genetic diversity leads to variation in biophysical characteristics of the protein, particularly in IDRs.

The researchers analyzed the biophysical properties of SARS-2 protein domains and IDRs across mutants and related coronaviruses. The SARS-2 genome allowed them to examine how sequence impacts biophysical properties and constraints for viral viability. Focusing on S-2 protein, they studied biophysical phenotypes to understand mechanisms and aspects of bi fitness. Experiments with mutants from S-2 variants characterized thermodynamic, secondary, oligom, energetics, and LLPS. They found a large biophysical space for viable protein, with mutations affecting overall properties.

The study shows that protein IDRs have another level of biophysical variation impacting fitness. Exploiting the mutational landscape presents a challenge and opportunity to explore the bi phenotype and uncover principles of RNA proteins.
Scientists studied how small and large mammals, such as bears and bats, survive the winter by slowing down their metabolism. They wanted to know if a protein called myosin, which helps muscles move, changes during this time. They took muscle samples from hibernating animals and non-hibernating animals and measured how myosin's structure and how it uses energy. They found that in some hibernating animals, like bears, myos stays the same, but in smaller hibernating animals like bats, myos changes. This leads to more energy being used by fast-twitch muscle fibers at room temperature. When tested at a lower temperature, closer to hibernating animals' body, myos uses less energy in fast-twitch fibers by 77-107%. They also found myos is hyperphosphorylated in bats, which helps it stay stable. This could be a way myos helps reduce energy use during hibernation. The study shows myos changes in hibernating animals and how it affects muscle energy use.
Researchers studied the formation of chondrocy columns in the growth plates of mouse embryos and postnatal mice using 3D imaging and morphometric analysis. They found that chrocytes in the embryonic plate are not typically arranged in columns, but rather in elongated clusters perpendicular to the growth direction. This is due to incomplete rotation of the division plane during cell division, resulting in non-stacking of cells. In contrast, postnatal plates showed both ordered and disordered columns, as well as small disorganized clusters at the edges. The study suggests that modulation of division plane rotation determines the formation of clusters or columns, a multifunctional mechanism regulating morphogenesis throughout growth. The findings provide new understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying plate activity and bone elongation during development.
Researchers have been interested in proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) due to their ability to improve the bioavailability of certain drugs. These transporters are found in all living organisms and work by moving peptides into the cell using a proton gradient. Recent studies have shown the structure of two mammalian OTs, SLC15A1 and SLC2, but left questions about how they move protons and peptides. To understand this, scientists used computer simulations to map the SLC2 conformation and its driving forces. They found a sequence of proton steps that help the peptide enter the cell and identified differences between mammalian and bacterial OTs. Experiments confirmed these findings. The study also linked proton and peptide binding, revealing how OTs work. This research helps understand OT in mammals and may lead to better drug design. 

The study used recent structures of bacterial and mammalian OTs to create a model of how they work. It explained how protons drive conformation changes and how conformation and proton movement are linked to substrate. The presence of substrate affects conformation and protonation of certain residues. This work provides the first detailed steps of substrate and proton-coupled access in mammalian OTs. To understand peptide-proton coupling, simulations were done with a bound substrate. Calculations showed binding is similar in two states, indicating substrate alone does not drive the change. To generate hypotheses, simulations were done to get conformation energy landscapes in proton and substrate conditions. A 2:1 stoichiometry was assumed for dipeptides, motivated by results. OTs belong to the major facilitator superfamily and have a conserved six-helix structure, with N and C-termini facing the cytoplasm.
Researchers investigated how the brain's auditory cortex responds to speech production in humans. They used intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. The study found that the superior temporal gyrus (ST) region of the brain showed suppression of auditory responses during speech. This suppression varied across different areas of the ST. The researchers then tested whether these suppressed areas were also sensitive to auditory feedback using a delayed feedback task. They found that overlapping areas showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. Importantly, there was a strong correlation between the degree of suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting that suppression might be key to speech monitoring. 

When participants produced speech with auditory feedback, the posterior ST was selectively activated if they were in a delayed feedback paradigm, suggesting attention can modulate feedback sensitivity. The study aimed to test the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression increases sensitivity to feedback in humans. Results showed overlapping areas in ST exhibited suppression and sensitivity to feedback with a strong correlation, supporting the hypothesis that suppression predicts speech errors. Delaying feedback during speech enhanced responses in ST. The degree of sensitivity varied across recording sites, with a significant correlation between suppression and feedback, providing evidence for a shared mechanism between suppression and monitoring.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive study on the most common forms of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, known as McBC systems, and found them to be abundant and diverse in prokaryotes with various genomic associations. They focused on a previously uncharacterized branch, denoted as Coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoNuTs), which feature extensive coiled structures and nucleases. The CoNu systems show extraordinary variety, with three types and multiple subtypes, and are predicted to interact with translation components such as OB-folds, resembling the Smp protein that binds bacterial messenger RNA, Y-like domains that recognize methylated RNA, RNA, and RNA-binding Hsp chaper homologs, along with RNases, such as HN, suggesting they target RNA. Some CoNu might also target DNA via McC nuclease homologs. Restriction systems like Type I, RM, BRE, and Type III are often encoded in the same superons. Many of these superons CoNu are regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly RNA with cyclic termini that bind CAR (CRIS-Associated Rosann Fold) domains. The researchers hypothesize that CoNu, with ancillary factors, employ a defense strategy similar to Type III CRIS-C systems, first eliminating virus or RNA, then aborting infection via host cleavage.

The study found CoNu contain domains interacting with translation components, such as S-like OB, H70 homologs, or Y domains, with RN, suggesting they target RNA. They focused on a major branch of Mc systems, denoted CoNu for extensive coiled structures and nucleases. Astounding complexity was found, with three types and subtypes CoNu differing in composition and association. RNA capability of III and III can be inferred from similarity to III encoding H70 proteins. Higher associations of II and III CoNu with DNA systems suggest two-prong DNA and RNA strategy of III-C. The researchers suspect RNA is a feature of CoNu systems. Consistent with this, II and CoNu likely target rather than DNA, given operons encode HNases, recognizable in these systems. Association of CDC-like with III CoNu, encoding tm-binding domain supports tmRNA interaction. Analysis of bacterin protein indicates an inactivated fold, potentially nucleic-binding.
Researchers have studied the role of calcineur, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threon protein phosphatase, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that inhibiting calcine increased the worm's lifespan through multiple pathways. To investigate its role in immunity, they discovered calcine is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in C. elegans. Inhibiting calcine led to defects in DMP, resulting in bloating, gut colonization by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to infection. Bloating caused by calcine inhibition mimicked the effects of calorie restriction, enhancing lifespan. The TF ortholog, HL-30, is required for lifespan mediated by calcine inhibition. The nuclear receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcine inhibition and necessary for increased lifespan. This study reveals calcine's role in C. elegans DMP and a new mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated longevity.

 Calcine regulates C. elegans response to pathogens, despite lacking NF transcription factors. The relationship between lifespan and immunity is complex. Calcine regulates thermaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan in C. elegans. Knocking down the catalytic subunit of calcine, tax-6, enhances lifespan via autophagy and CRE-regulated transcriptional coactivators. Calcine activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, activated by calmodulin binding. The rhythmic D cycle in C. elegans is regulated by calcium waves. Calcine, conserved from yeast to humans, is involved in cellular processes and signal transduction pathways.
Researchers investigated how the brain resolves conflicts between task-relevant and irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. Conflicts can arise from various sources, such as sensory input or internal representations, and a limited set of cognitive processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a challenge. According to the cognitive theory, conflicts can be parameterized and represented as points in a low-dimensional space, which can be resolved by a set of control processes along dimensions. This leads to the hypothesis that conflicts with similar sources are represented similarly in the space.

A task with five types of conflicts was designed that could be conceptually parameterized. Human performance and fMRI activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supported that types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting space as a principle for representing conflicts.

The study aimed to test the geometry of conflict representation in cognitive space. It was hypothesized that types of conflicts are represented as points in space. Importantly, the distance between points reflects the geometry of space, with difference in sources of conflicts represented by points. Dimensions in space can be domains, where domain-specific control processes are defined. A type of conflict's location in space can be parameterized using coordinates, reflecting control needed for domain-specific processes. Space can represent types with low dimensionality (Bad et al, 2021;Macowell et al,202).

Different domains can be conjunct in space to achieve general control conflicts from sources can be resolved using same processes. It was hypothesized that space representing types conflicts is located in frontopetal due to roles in resolution (Freund et,202a; et,2004). Two solutions resolving types proposed differ based on control mechanisms applied. Domain-general control posits frontopetal encodes information and flexibly control for types, supported by generalizable adjustment.
Researchers conducted the largest study to date on the vaginal immune system's role in preterm birth, a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. They collected vaginal swabs from 739 pregnant women, 281 samples, across gestation, and analyzed 31 immune mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides. The study found that the vaginal immunopome, or vaginal immune system, has a homeostatic profile in uncomplicated pregnancies, but shifts to a pro-inflammatory state in women who experience preterm labor (PT) or preterm rupture of membranes (PP). This shift includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial peptides. The immunome has predictive value over maternal characteristics for identifying women at risk for early preterm birth (less than 34 weeks). The immunome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this are associated with preterm birth. The immun can be leveraged as a biomarker for early preterm, a subset associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.
Researchers have developed a new computer model, called the Hernandez-Hern model, to understand how smooth muscle cells in blood vessels control blood flow and pressure. These cells, called myocytes, line the walls of arteries and arterioles. The model is based on new data showing differences between male and female myocytes from mouse arteries. It explains how electrical and calcium signaling in myocytes develop tone in blood vessels.

The model suggests that a specific potassium channel, KV.5, controls the membrane potential in male myocytes. However, female myocytes have larger KV.1 channels and longer activation times, so KV.1 plays a key role in female membrane control. A few voltage-gated potassium and calcium channels drive sex differences in intracellular calcium and excitability. The model also shows that female arterial muscle is more sensitive to calcium blockers than male.

The researchers aimed to create a comprehensive model of electrical and calcium dynamics in myocytes. They integrated sex variations in voltage-gated potassium channels. The Hernandez model predicts KV.1 channels are crucial in female membrane control compared to male. Importantly, it shows calcium blockers reduce currents more in female than male myocytes.

A one-dimensional model of connected myocytes in a vessel suggests calcium blockers are more potent in females, reducing calcium in female smooth muscle more than male. The Hernandez model highlights sex differences in calcium and potassium channels.
Researchers studied how climate affects the breakdown of plant litter, or organic matter, in different environments with varying levels of rainfall. They hypothesized that larger decomposers, like insects and animals, are more tolerant of dry conditions and balance out the effect of smaller decompos, like microorganisms, leading to similar breakdown rates across environments. To test this, they placed baskets of different mesh sizes in areas with varying rainfall and caught decomposers using pit traps. Results showed decomers respond differently to rainfall based on size, with micro breaking down more in wet and larger in dry conditions. This led to similar breakdown rates except in extremely dry areas. Larger decomers, like insects and animals, were more abundant and rich in dry environments. The study highlights the importance of larger decompos in dry lands and resolves a long-standing question about breakdown in dry areas, emphasizing the need to consider decomposer size when studying soil processes.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of cancer with a poor prognosis and high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. A key driver of this cancer is the activation of the KRAS gene, which leads to increased cell migration and proliferation through a process called macropinocytosis. Macinocytosis is thought to be a mechanism for scavenging nutrients, but its role in signaling is not well understood. Researchers found that a protein called CY-B is highly expressed in PDAC in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven cancer. Deletion of the gene encoding CY-B accelerated tumor growth, leading to increased ER and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions, suggesting a role as a buffer of RAS activation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CY-B inhibits metastasis. CY-B depleted tumor cells showed reduced chemotactic response to lysosphatidic acid, a driver of tumor spread, due to impaired macinocytic uptake of lysosphatidic receptor 1. The study implicates CY-B as mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, providing insights into pathways controlling metastasis.

In a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, deletion of the CY gene and expression of KRAS and p53 led to accelerated tumor formation and increased area of pancreas lesions with phospho-ER and phosph-JNK, crucial targets of KR and RAS that drive proliferation and expansion. CY-B was highly expressed in human cancers and correlated with poorer survival. Increased CY-B in mice suggested it could help reveal role in human PDAC. Loss of CY in the model accelerated tumor formation and progression, likely due to CY-B's capacity to buffer RAS activation of KR, leading to abnormal architecture and hyperactivation of ER and JNK to drive proliferation. The model is characterized by high metastasis to organs such as liver, diaphragm, and bowel.

CY-B localizes on macinos in cancer cells, suggesting how loss could affect tumor progression. The first protein recruited to macinos is Rab, present in vesicles moving from periphery to perin region. To investigate CY in cancer, expression was assessed in metastatic PDAC model. PD develops around 10 weeks and progresses to stages 15, with full PD at 150-200 days.
Researchers have identified a group of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) called HERV-HML-2, which includes intact or nearly intact viruses, but no replication-competent H-2 proviruses have been found in humans. However, related proviruses have been found in other primates, including rhes macaques, but the extent and timing of H-2 activity in macques is unclear. The study found 145 H-2-like proviruses inhes macques, including a group of young,hes-specific insertions. The age, intact reading frames, and insert polymorphism of these insertions suggest recent or ongoing activity in macques. One group of proviruses has a 750 sequence between env and the 3 long terminal repeat (LTR), derived from recombination with a HER-K H-8-related virus. This group is found in Old World (OW) monkeys but not great apes, suggesting it originated after ape/OW split. Similar proviruses were found in white-cheek gibbons, with insertions within OW recombinant group, suggesting interspecies transmission from OW to gibbons. The LTR of youngest provir have deletions U, disrupting Response Element (RE), required for nuclear export unspliced RNA. The H-8 region functions as Response-independent constitutive transport (TE), indicating ancestralRE-RE export system replaced by C mechanism.

The study characterized a group of HER-H2-related ERVs inhes macques and OW that include 750 non-coding region between env and 3 L, derived from recombination with HER-K H-8 retroirus. This indicates SERV is relatively young (less than 500,000 years) andhes macques may harbor or recently active H-2 retroviruses. The study found a group ER inhesques that may serve model investigating evolution over time and HER-H2 virology and pathogenesis. Previous studies found 19 H- proviruseshes macques (ERV) with identical Ls, implying recent integration. Another study found H-2-like provirhes macques, detected env expression and mac with Env-specific response. To investigate possibility H- viruses activehesques, searched H- sequences recenthes assemblies and characterized structure, capacity, and history, focusing SER-like provir. Found SER part grouphes provuses showing recent activity.
Wound infections are common and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and economic impacts. They occur in various contexts, including diabetic ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. Enteroccus faalis is often found in non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds is understudied. Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected wounds compared to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. They examined over 23,000 cells, creating a comprehensive atlas that captures the cellular and transcript landscape of these wounds. Analysis revealed unique transcription and metabolic alterations in infected, elucidating distinct changes with bacterial compared to normal healing. The study found dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcript in response to infection, contributing to anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faalis prompted premature epithelial-mesymal transition in kerocytes. Additionally, E. fa modulated M-like macrophage polarization, inhibiting pro-inflammatory in vitro, in vivo, and scRNA atlas. Macrophages interacted with neutrophils, regulating chemine signaling, promoting anti-inflammatory with endothelial cells. The study offers new insights into immunosup role of E faalis in infections.

The study found that unected wounds undergo reparative angiogenesis while fa infection evokes pathological. Analysis highlights M-like macro-EC interactions as altered cell signaling during bacteria-infected healing. fa persistence virulence factors, immunodulatory strategies, and implications in delayed healing remain to be investigated. A comprehensive atlas of host response to persistent fa infection was generated, showing fa induces immunosup in kerocytes and fibroblasts, delaying response. The study provides a comparison of transcript and cellular profiles uninf and fa-infected skin at 4 post-infection. However, lacks a dataset uninf unwounded skin, which would investigate changes induced by wounding alone. fa reaffirmed fibro functions during unected healing, consistent with lig-receptor interactions.
Plants that are attacked by herbivores release volatile chemicals into the air, which can trigger defense responses in neighboring plants. However, the timing of this process is not well understood. Researchers used a special equipment called PTR-ToFMS to study the transfer of volatiles between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. They found that continuous exposure to blends of herbivore-induced volatiles triggers a delayed response in neighboring plants, characterized by a burst of terpenes at the start of the second day. This burst is not due to terene accumulation during the night, but coincides with jasmonate accumulation in plants. The burst is independent of day-night transitions and cannot be explained by volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of stress from exposure during the first day and secondary to bioactive volatiles on the second. The study shows that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress volatiles results in a response that primes and induces a distinct temporal pattern. This answers the question of whether volatiles induce or prime defenses in neighboring plants, revealing they can do both in sequence.

The study highlights the importance of tracking plant responses in real-time as they perceive the dynamic blend of volatiles from herboreatt neighbors. The ecological relevance of the clocked kinetics of activation in neighboring plants is proposed. Responding strongly to cues on the second may avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. This is the result of volatile priming on the first that yields a clock response to volat that are perceived the next. Plants respond to herbore volat by increasing their defenses, which can happen directly with hormone production and release. To test this, plants were exposed to volat from control or herbore plants for 1.25 hours, then disconnected and exposed to clean air until the next day. Half were then exposed to H as a trigger. H was selected as it showed strongest correlation with teres. The delayed burst may be due to interaction of initial volatile that primes for higher release at onset second and secondary in bioactive volat from sender at second.

Maize exposed to volat from herboreatt release teres. To understand the dynamics, a time-course of terene release by plants exposed to vol from sender under Spoptera caterpillars was conducted.
Researchers have long believed that recursion, a key feature of human language and music, is unique to humans. However, a recent study found that wild orangutans exhibit recursive vocal patterns in their calls. Specifically, male orangutans produce rhythmic sequences within rhythmic sequences, a hierarchical structure similar to that of human language and music. This discovery suggests that recursion may have originated in proto-musical expression in human ancestors and was later adapted for linguistic use. 

The study analyzed the calls of wild orangutans and found that the rhythmic patterns in lower-level sequences were not related to the overarching rhythm of higher-level sequences, indicating that these structures are not due to parallel processing or anatomical constraints. This finding represents a case of recursive combinatorics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music in a non-human species. 

The study opens the possibility that recursion was first a feature of proto-mus expression in human ancestors, later adapted for linguistic use. Further research on orangutan vocal patterns and great ape behaviors could test this idea. A structural approach to primate combics, particularly in the wild, offers a new way to assess precursors and proto-states of recursion in the homin family, adding recursion as a new layer of analysis.
Scientists have long studied the ongoing battle between viruses and their hosts, which has led to numerous innovations in life's evolution. A key aspect of this battle is the interaction between viral receptors and host cells, as viruses exploit cell surface proteins to initiate infection. This study sheds light on the relationship between the MDA receptor and 5'pp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate, Miichthys mii. The frequent loss of R-I in vertebrates led researchers to search for alternative substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation (HDCR) being the main pathway. Analysis found that M5 of Mii and Gallus, a homolog of R-I, can replace R-I in recognizing 5pp-R virus, potentially leading to R-I loss from the genome during evolution. As a counter strategy, 5pp-R virus utilizes m6 methylation to degrade M5 and weaken its antiviral ability, promoting its replication and immune evasion. This study provides insight into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering perspectives on ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system.

The study investigated whether M5, structurally similar to R-I, can substitute R-I in recognizing 5pp-R in vertebrates without-I. Results showed that M5 of Mii and Gallus can recognize 5-R virus and double-stranded poly (C-HM infection. This suggests that M5 acquired new functionalities to detect 5pp-RAs, initially recognized by-I. The study used teleost fish Mi and chicken, lacking-I, and 5pp-R viruses to investigate strategies between 5-R virus and host. Results showed that M of Mii and Gallus lacking-I evolved to recognize 5-R. SC virus mainly affects Sinca, lacking-I. Data suggest vertebrates evolved M with functions to resist 5-R virus in absence-I. SC virus can utilize m6 to degrade M of Mii for immune evasion. Findings unveil the diversity of antiv activity and the complex between virus and immunity in vertebrates. The loss of-I in vertebrates is widespread, providing a new perspective for groups lacking-I.
Researchers investigated the impact of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on body composition and bone metabolism in men undergoing androgen therapy (AD) for prostate cancer. FSH levels are affected by AD, which may contribute to changes in body mass, lean mass, and bone fragility. The study aimed to correlate FSH levels with body parameters, bone density, and markers at baseline and after 12 months of AD. Twenty-nine non-metatic prostate cancer patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019. Patients received luteizing hormone-releasing antagonist degare. Body mass, lean mass, and bone density were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptometry at baseline and after 12 AD. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and telopeptide type I collagen were assessed at baseline and 6 and 12 months.

At baseline, a weak, non-significant relationship was found between FSH and body mass in arms and legs. However, a stronger correlation was observed between F and total body mass, fat in arms, and trunk after 12 months. An inverse relationship was found between F and appendicular lean index/body mass ratio. F levels after AD may impact body composition, particularly lean mass. F could be a marker to monitor risk of sarcopenia and guide clinicians in evaluation of body in patients undergoing AD.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite research on drugs targeting sarcolem ion channels, none have proven effective in preventing SCD. Sarcoplasm ryanine receptor 2 (Ry2) Ca+ release channels, downstream of sarlem ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of Ry2 in the pathophysiology of S. Researchers tested the hypothesis that Ry2 inhibition in failing hearts reduces sarcasm Ca+ leak and repolar lability, mitigates VT/SC and improves contract function. They used a guinea pig model that replicates clinical aspects of nonchemic HF, such as prolonged interval, high arrhythmic S, and Ca leak via hyperactive Ry2. Animals were randomized to receive drol (DS) or placebo in early HF. The incidence of VT and S was the primary outcome, ECG heart rate and variability, echocardi left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunisto LV fibrosis, and sarcasm Ry2 oxidation were assessed. DS prevented VT and S by decreasing repolar and vent arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered heart rate, preserved competency during β-adnergic challenge and improved heart variability and function. Inhibition Ry2 with drol mitigates the cycle sarcasm Ca+ leak increases diolic Ca and ROS-mediated Ry2, reducing repolar and protecting VT/SC. Moreover, sarcasm Ca+ load improves contract function. These effects of Ry2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies repurposing drol as therapy for HF and S.

A guinea pig model of HFSC with arrhythm was used to study the effects of Ry2 inhibition on S and HF. The model has a high incidence of ventricular contractions (PVC) and VT, leading to S in two-thirds of animals within weeks. S occurs early, in the first weeks of hypertrophy, before heart dilates into failure. HF changes in expression and phosph-prote of key channels, transport, and excitation-coupling proteins were noted, including hyperphosphory of Ry2 in failing hearts compared to normal. Targeted therapy prevented modifications, indicating oxidative damage the cause. Oxidative alters the proteomic of cell, altering levels and function ECou proteins. Inhibition Ca2 via Ry pauses the transition to failure by reducing fibrosis, repolar, decreasing heterogeneity, competency, improving contract, and mitigating VT.

A body of evidence indicates sympathetic-induced hyperactivity of Ry2 in SR causes Ca leak, contributing VT and S pathogenesis. Fischer et al (2013), Alado Valia (202), Wehrens (2006), Eisner (9).
Researchers have studied how cells respond to signals from the transforming growth factor-β (TGF) family, including the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, which play a crucial role in development and growth. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the BMP4 ortholog DB-1 regulates body size through a receptor-Smad signaling cascade. The study identified binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its partner SMA-9/Schnri using ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq analysis of mutants. SMA-3 and SMA-9 have overlapping and unique target genes, with SMA-3 acting as a transcription activator and SMA-9 targeting both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in SMA-9 partially suppress the small size phenotype of SMA-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between the two factors. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathway, including disulf reductase-11. The findings indicate Smads and SMA-9/Sri have complex interactions regulating secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body regulation.

 Researchers used genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP to untangle the roles of Smad and Schnri factors in developing Caenorhabis larva. The second larval stage was chosen because Smad activity is elevated at this stage. Analysis revealed SMA-3/Sm and SMA-9 target genes co-regulated by both factors, as well as separate genes they independently regulate. Ch-seq data showed 73.7% SMA-3 binding overlap with SMA-9 sites, while half SMA-9 sites did not overlap SMA-3. The number of sites may reflect low affinity and degenerate sequence recognition of targets for their families. A matrix SMA- and SMA- peak was analyzed to identify direct targets differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq of wild-type versus SMA-3 using FDR ≤ 0.05 compared genomic coordinates SMA- peaks from Ch-se using BETA and WS annotation. SMA- exclusive genes imply Sm-independent roles SMA in functions, consistent with vertebrate Schnri homs in immunity.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUX that helps cancer cells evade the immune system, making it harder for treatments like immunotherapy to work. DUX is found in about 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers, and is more common in urothelial cancer. When DUX is present, the immune system is less likely to attack the tumor and treatments like PD-1 blockade are less effective. DUX is also linked to lower survival rates, even when accounting for other factors like tumor mutations and clinical features. The study suggests DUX could be a marker and target for developing new treatments to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.

In uroth cancer, DUX is associated with an immune-excluded or immune-des phenotype, meaning the immune system is excluded from the tumor. DUX is also linked to lower PD-1 levels in the tumor and immune cells. The study found DUX expression in metastasis is linked to reduced anti-tumor immunity, similar to previous findings in primary cancers and cell lines. DUX may induce an immunosuppressive gene program, consistent with its role in inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling in primary cancers. Researchers hypothesized DUX in metastasis generates transcript signals that exclude CD8 T cells from the tumor.

Uroth cancer has the highest frequency of DUX expression, 54% of patients, suggesting DUX is particularly important in this type. The study confirms high DUX expression in metastasis is not due to technical issues with formalin-fixed tissues and is consistent with polyadenylated D4 transcript in primary and metastasis. The study focused on uro cancer consequences of DUX expression.
Livestock abortion is a significant issue affecting livestock productivity and public health in Africa. However, there is a lack of data on its causes, which hinders effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and health. This study aimed to investigate the causes and impacts of abortion in Tanzania's pastoral, agro-pastoral, and smallholder systems. Farmers reported abortion events to livestock officers, who investigated within 72 hours, collecting samples and data on determinants, patterns, and zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017-2019, 215 events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated. Attribution was achieved in 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by sample delays. Histopath proved less useful than PCR due to sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical material for pathogen detection.

The study demonstrated the feasibility of a surveillance system through community-based officers, sample collection, and molecular platforms. It showed utility, acceptability, and feasibility of abortion as a syndromic event surveillance and effective reporting system across settings, including rural areas. The study suggests establishing a framework for evidence-based interventions to improve development, livelihoods, and health in Africa. Aetiological attribution of abortion rarely exceeds 35% even in well-resourced systems, and is sparse in African systems. Non-infect conditions, nutritional, and genetic factors cause abortions. Our study found a possible role for stressful events, including drought and wild attacks, reported in unattributed cases.
Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor for developing various diseases, and nicotine (NIC) is a major component of cigarette smoke. However, the mechanism of how NIC affects stem cells is not well understood. This study found that NIC increases the number and activity of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in mice and in a lab dish. NIC also activates a protein (YAP) that helps cells grow and a signaling pathway (Notch) in ISC through a receptor (nACh) and a protein (PK). This effect was not seen in other cells. Blocking this pathway with a drug (DB) stopped NIC's effects on ISC. NIC increased tumor growth in mice with a missing a tumor suppressor gene, and DB stopped NIC-induced tumor growth. This study shows NIC's role in regulating stem cell growth and tumor formation and suggests using DB as a treatment for intestinal tumors.

The study found NIC's role in promoting cancer cell growth in the intestine, explaining colon cancer in smokers. Developing drugs blocking ACh, YAP/TA, and Notch may treat colon cancer. Extrinsic factors, like NIC, increase cancer risk by promoting cell division. Data showed NIC increased ISC, which may explain increased tumors in smokers. NIC enhances ISC via ACh and Y/TA and Not signaling. This is consistent with DB suppressing Y/TA and Not in NIC-treated mice. NIC expands ISC through ACh and Y/TA loop, suggesting targets for treating NIC-induced colon cancer.

This study contributes to understanding how cells respond to NIC, a major smoke component, and a new strategy for treating smoking-related colon cancer. NIC affects ISC, not other cells, through YTA and Not activated by ACh. The interaction between Hippo, Not, and Wnt regulates intestinal homeostasis.
Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) plays a crucial role in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, which is associated with stress, aging, and disease. It dissolves aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release, regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). This study elucidates the impact of Hsp NEFs and different DP classes on H70-dependent processing. Results show that H70 plays a major role in initial stages of disaggregation, determining its efficacy. NE catalyzes the recruitment of H70 onto aggregate surface, modifying into smaller species processed by chaper. H70 stimulation by H is stronger with class B than A DP and requires interaction between B and H70 EE motif. Furthermore, H disrupts the DP-H70 interaction, destabilizing chone complexes at aggregate, improving disaggregation but inhibiting suboptimal H levels. Balanced interplay between coaper and H70 is critical to unlock disaggreg potential.

 Recent studies showed H70 exhibits different mechanisms with class A and B DP coaper (Wysowski et al, 2021). To understand interplay within H70 network, addressed H effects H70 members different DP classes. Result shows substrate activity not increase S1-S1 binding and NE concentration negatively correlated with affinity H70. Larger H70-J assemblies surface dependent S1 and interaction EE modify misfold species amenable disag (Wysowski et al). H-dependent disag is limited initial chaper recruitment and disassembly, not final folding (Figure). Initial H loading correlates remod into smaller species, improving recognition H104. H may release J, unless tethered via interaction, e.g., other subunit complex aggregate-bound H70 (Figure). Displaced proteins established, presumably low H levels rebind another site or aggregate-bound chaper. Positive H effect on recovery substantially comprises class JDP. Theoret stimulation occur stages protein – association, polype disentlement, final folding.

This study highlights the role of H110 in H70-dependent processing, showing it plays a major role in initial stages of disaggregation, determining efficacy. NE catalyzes recruitment of H70 onto aggregate, modifying smaller species processed by chaper. H stimulation is stronger with class B than A DP and requires interaction between B and H EE. Furthermore, disrupts DP-H70 interaction, destabilizing chone at aggregate, improving disag but inhibiting suboptimal H. Balanced interplay between coaper and H is critical to unlock disag potential.
Researchers have developed a low-cost digital insole that can analyze gait, or the way people walk, to diagnose and monitor knee osteoarthritis, a musculoskeletal condition. Traditional gait analysis in clinical settings relies on visual observation, but is subjective and requires expensive equipment and trained staff. The digital insole uses machine learning to analyze force data from the foot and can identify individuals with knee osteoarthritis with high accuracy. A model trained on data from participants with knee osteoarthritis and controls was highly predictive of force data from a separate validation set and an independent insole dataset. The insole-derived gait characteristics were comparable to traditional gait measurements. The researchers also showed that a single stride of sensor data can be assigned to a subject, allowing individuals to be identified by their gait. This work provides a framework for an alternative to traditional gait methods and supports development of at-home assessments, potentially improving ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring.
Researchers have been searching for non-opioid alternatives to manage post-surgical pain due to the severe side effects and risks of opioid analgesics. A recent study found that applying a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, called Clarix (FLO), reduced post-surgical hypersensitivity in mice without opioid side effects. This was achieved by inhibiting nocice dorsal root ganglion (DR) neurons via CD44 pathways. The researchers purified a major component, heavy-hyaluronic acid/paxin 3 (HCAX), from AM, which replicated LO's pain inhibition and had higher purity and solubility. HCAX induced cytoskeleton rearrangements and inhibited sodium and high-voltage calcium currents in nocice DR neurons, making it a key mediator of pain relief. The study highlights the potential of naturally derived biologics from human tissues as non-opoid treatments for post-s pain and unravels the mechanisms of pain inhibition by LO and HCAX.

The study suggests human tissue products can be used to treat post-s pain and identified HCAX as the primary component responsible for inhibition. It induced cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibited IN and HVA currents in a CD-dependent manner, making it a promising non-opoid for post-s pain. Due to technical limitations, researchers used cultured DR neurons to examine mechanisms and pathways involved in inhibition by LO. HCAX mimics LO's ability to inhibit pain and has higher purity and solubility, making it suitable for cellular studies. Intra injection of LO reduced activation of small DR neurons, mostly nocice, to noxious stimulation after plantar incision. HCAX was purified from water-soluble AM and biochemically and functionally characterized. It may attenuate key pain receptors such as TR1, TR1, and Mpr and decrease nocpt excitability by membrane hyperpolarization and altering membrane properties CD is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein regulating physiologic and pathologic processes.
Researchers studied the pigmentation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells grown in the lab to see if their color is related to their function. They used human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived R cells (iPSC-R) and a new imaging system to photograph and analyze each cell's gene expression. The cells were grouped into four categories based on gene expression, but their color did not match any specific gene profile. This suggests that the color of R cells may not directly indicate their function.

The researchers used a system to take pictures of iSC-R cells, pick one cell, and analyze its gene expression. They found that color did not match any specific gene profile. They analyzed the cells' transcriptome and used brightness as a proxy for pigmentation. Gene enrichment analysis showed that pigmentation is dynamic and regulated, with a time lag between mRNA production and melanin synthesis.

The study suggests that color may not be an indicator of R markers. They looked at genes related to retin recycling, a feature of R supplying photoreceptors, and found weak correlation with color intensity. Coefficients were 0.25, 0.20, 0.16, 0.12, and 0.11 for RD11, B1,10,3,5. There is evidence that in vitro pigmentation may not reflect maturation. Marrow-derived R cells are poorly pigmented in vitro but become pigmented transplanted. Similarly, i-R cells are not pigmented but become heavily engrafted.
Researchers in the field of neuroscience have increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in their natural environments to gain a deeper understanding of ethologically relevant processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmet (Callithrix jacch) has emerged as a pivotal model for this effort due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional research methods often fail to capture the nuances of marmet social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this gap, a novel apparatus, the Marmet Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MAAP), was developed to study cooperative behaviors in commonmets. MAAP enables high-throughput, detailed outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more comprehensive analyses in naturalistic settings. It also accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual capabilities, making it a versatile tool for advancing understanding primate behavior and cognitive processes. MAAP bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations, paving the way for research in cognitive and social neuroscience using mets as a model.

A new method for studying cooperative behaviors in commonmets was introduced using an automated apparatus and task. With increased trials through MAAP, the possibility of examining neural dynamics in mets was supported. The apparatus and paradigm represent an advancement, bridging traditional behavior studies and precise investigations of neural activity. Behavioral metrics from video and audio with mets' pulling and reward delivery provide a comprehensive understanding of behavior, communication, and interactions in this species using an automated task. MAAP offers rich data and flexibility for various tasks, creating an avenue for simultaneous recordings while mets are engaged in tasks by MAAP. This significantly increases trials for analysis, ensuring statistical power investigating between activity and behaviors.
Researchers studied the effects of moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy on the developing fetus using a mouse model that mimics human drinking patterns. They found that moderate drinking during pregnancy altered specific DNA methylation in newborns, but did not affect their behavior. Whole-genome sequencing of newborn brain and liver showed that DNA methylation changes were mostly tissue-specific, with some occurring as early as gastrulation. Methylation differences were in non-coding regions, suggesting broad effects on gene regulation. Replication in human studies with fetal alcohol disorder showed similar effects on genes linked to traits like facial features, intelligence, education, and autism. A diet rich in folate and choline protected against some effects of moderate drinking on DNA methylation. The study shows early exposure can affect the fetus's genome without visible changes and highlights the importance of maternal diet in prevention.

The researchers looked at regions sensitive to alcohol exposure in humans and found similar results. They compared mice with and without exposure, and added a group with a diet rich in folate and choline. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing measured DNA methylation in brain and liver, two organs affected by alcohol, to see if effects were specific or general. They also tested genes known to be affected by moderate drinking. Exposure was from conception to the first trimester, when women often drink before knowing they're pregnant. The main goal was to see DNA changes and behavior in offspring, relevant to fetal disorder.

In a human study, DNA from 147 newborns with and without exposure showed no differences. In mice, effects were mostly tissue-specific, with two regions and genes affected in both liver and brain. Changes may have started early and stayed in differentiating. Further study is needed to confirm.
Researchers have found that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective in silencing a wide variety of genes, but some genes require specific regulators to be silenced. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of these regulators can impair silencing of some genes. The study shows that this selectivity can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in RNA metabolism. The network includes the Mael domain protein R-10, intrinsically disordered protein-16, and Argona protein-3, which work together to silence some genes, but each is required for silencing another. The requirement for protein-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing.

 Models and simulations found that changing cis-regulatory elements of the gene reduce dependence on protein-3, animals can recover silencing in non-dividing cells, and cleavage tailing of mRNAs with U dinucleotides, which are templates for amplifying RNAs, are enriched in 'UG' zones matching dsRNA. Similar pathways and amplification result in selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.

The study used Caenorhabis elegans to examine how differences between genes and regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance. A pathway required for silencing response to dsRNA has been worked out in C. elegans. The requirement for protein-3 but not for-16 or-10 can be bypassed by enhancing processing ds, suggesting loss has least impact on efficiency. A model of RNA during silencing by ds reveals criteria for efficient silencing.

The three proteins, structurally and functionally different, are required for unc-22 silencing, suggesting each could contribute to silencing any RNA target. Mechanisms could generate other RN independent-10 (Yang et al, 2012; Zhang et al,201). Studies needed to test each model. RNA is widely used for silencing in plants, insects, and humans, like C. elegans, plants (San-Mra et al,202) and insects (Pinon et al). Observations hint influence gene factors on RNA outcome and exploration of detailed model.
Researchers studied the genes and pathways involved in tuberculous meningitis (TBM), a serious infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to understand why it's so deadly. They analyzed blood samples from 281 adults with TBM, 295 with pulmonary tuberculosis (PT), and 30 healthy individuals. They found genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and death, with differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Increased neutrophil and T cell activation were associated with TBM death. HIV-positive individuals had increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative had TNF signaling and impaired extracellular organization. Four genes (MMP1, N2, Z, C, and CD) were strong predictors of TBM mortality. The study suggests TBM triggers a similar inflammatory response to PT, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and a four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes.

The researchers found common pathways in HIV-positive and HIV-negative TBM, but also differences. Death was linked to increased angiogenesis in HIV adults and TNF and extracellular organization in HIV-negative. A four-gene signature was a potential biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status. They selected predictors using multivariate Cox regression for HIV-negative and HIV TBM, including common genes, HIV-specific genes, age, T severity, and CSF lymphocyte count. Three clinical factors (age, M grade, and CSF lymphocyte) were also used for selection.

The study looked at pathways leading to TBM death at a whole-genome level, characterizing immune dysregulation, inflammation, and specific genes involved in TBM and death. They sought to understand TBM pathogenesis by identifying blood transcription modules associated with disease and mortality. Transcription profiles with T mortality differed by HIV status. In HIV-negative, 3.9% genes were differentially expressed, while HIV had 8.1% genes. The researchers hypothesized signatures differ according to HIV status.
Researchers have assessed the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 human proteins in neuroscience, using a standardized approach to evaluate their specificity in three common laboratory applications: Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. The study found that more than 50% of antibodies failed in one or more applications, but around 50-75% of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing antibody, indicating significant coverage by commercial antibodies. Recombinant antibodies outperformed monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Hundreds of underperforming antibodies were used in published studies, prompting manufacturers to reassess and alter or remove them from market. This study demonstrates the scope of the specificity problem and suggests a strategy to achieve proteome coverage using existing antibodies and inform new generation.

The researchers developed protocols to assess specificity in Western blot, immunoprecitation, and immunofluorescence, testing 614 antibodies against 65 targets chosen by funders. The study provides an unbiased framework for comparing performance, estimating coverage with renewable antibodies, evaluating common characterization methods, and identifying renewable antibodies for all proteins. Approximately two-thirds of the protein set was covered by at least high-performing antibody and half by at least-per renewable, suggesting significant coverage by high-performing antibodies.

The analysis of 614 commercial antibodies assesses the performance and a step toward a standardized validation ecosystem. 614 were tested against 65 human side-by in Western, immunrecipitation, immunofluorescence. All data are openly available on Zenodo and participating manufacturers' websites.
Researchers have developed a new tools to control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal. This is important for studying how organs communicate with each other. They combined the GAL4/UAS system with the LexA or Q system to make this possible. The team created a set of reagents to use these systems in Drosophila, focusing on genes with known expression patterns. They made over 40 LexA and Q insertions by CRISPR and verified their specificity in larvae. They also made constructs with Q and Lex-G transcription factors in one vector. This was integrated into the fly genome, and FLP recombination was used to isolate lines that express only Q or Lex-G. New shRNA vectors were used to evaluate both systems for gene knockdown, creating a library of lines as a resource. These tools will help researchers activate or repress genes in an animal in an orthogonal manner.

The team made a vector that generates a driver that expresses Q and Lex-G. If desired, one region can be excised with Fl, resulting in flies that express only Q or Lex-G. They evaluated both systems for gene knockdown and generated a library of shRNA lines in custom vectors as a resource. A plasmid was synthesized with features for CRPR and cloning to insert Lex-G, Q, or Lex-G fragments in one step. Targets were selected with tissue-specific expression, including major organs (Table 1). Most were fluorescent reporters, not genetic agents like shRNAs. Lack of reagents slows studies requiring two binary systems, as reagents must be made by groups. Methods were developed to generate drivers with tissue-specific patterns. Genes were selected with characterized GAL insertion and evidence (e.g. RNAseq, in situ, immunohisto). Donors were cloned and injected into Cas-express embryos to induce CRPR HDR of Lex-G or Q. A set of stocks, vectors, and protocols were made to expand Dophila researchers to modulate expression simultaneously.
A transcription factor B11 (B11) has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. B11 is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy-CA synapses. However, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. Researchers found that the synaptic molecule Cql is a direct target of B11 that regulates vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at moss-CA synapses in vivo and vitro. Cql exerts its functions through interaction with a specific variant neurexin-3, Nrx (25+. Interruption of Cql-Nrx (25+) by expression of non-binding Cql or deletion Nrx in dentate gyrus neurons recapitulates major B11 and Cql phenotypes. This study identifies aql-Nrx (25)-dependent pathway through B11 controls moss- synapse function. Findings contribute to mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopment disorders by synaptic dysfunction.

B11 is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders with synaptic dysfunction. Previous work showed B11 essential for synapse in moss fiber of adult hippocampus. Molecular mechanisms of B11, however, remained elusive. B plays crucial role in development of hippocal moss fiber, adult neurogenesis, and hippocal learning and memory. In mature hippocampus, B is critical for structural and functional of moss synapses between dentate gyrus and CA pyramidal neurons. This study identifies novel B11/Cql/Nrx (25)-dependent mechanism for control of moss synapse function. Genetic studies suggested components associated neurodevelopment neuropsych disorders by synaptic dysfunction. Data demonstrate molecules interconnected in regulatory pathway.

Conditional ablation of B in adult hippocampus leads structural and functional changes syn characterized reduction, loss bouton, misdistribution, and loss of long-term potentiation. Reintroduction of Cql, direct target of B and downregulated in B mutant dentate gyrus, identifies B/Cql/Nrx-dependent pathway in control of synapse properties. Analysis this pathway may provide insights into pathogenesis neurodevelopment neuropsych disorders.
Researchers have investigated how the zinc finger protein S1 (S1) regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation. They found that S1 can control gene expression by binding to the promoter regions where transcription starts, similar to known activators, or to the transcribed regions (gene bodies) where RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is active. The study focused on the latter mode of S1 activity and discovered that after binding to the promoter, S1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration, causing dissociation or conformation change of its Rpb subunit and increased backtracking. Surprisingly, S1 binds a subset of mRNAs during transcription and stabilizes them. The interaction between S1 and mRNAs is controlled by their promoters and coincides with S1 dissociation from chromatin. Intrigly, S1 dissociation from chromatin correlates with extent of backtracked Pol. The researchers propose that after recruitment, S accompanies Pol and regulates backtracking. The back Pol is compatible with S relocation to nascent transcripts, where S accompanies mRN to cytoplasm and regulates stability. Thus, S co-transcription imprints mRNA fate, serving paradigm for cross-talk between synthesis and decay of mRN and paradigm for dual-role zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between S modes remains to be examined.

S1 impacts mRNA cycle from transcription to degradation. Its effect on elongation linked to function on stabilization, suggesting connected. S possesses two zinc fingers. Correlation found between binding S to bodies and Pol occupancy in genes. Capacity to alter Pol in context R4 and affect back likely underlies widespread effect. Alteration configuration reflected in increased backtracking, indicated by values. Binding to bodies with Pol activity, particularly CR genes. Function in subset target genes beyond initiation encompasses elongation, proposed earlier. Interaction with chrom has effect on Pol elong and mRN, mechanistic linkage. Rpb subunit enhances Pol activity and mRNA due co-transcriptional imprinting. Observations that back associated with co-binding S to nas RNA. Reassuring, genes exhibit S-dependent back also imprint S, whereas do not imprint. Unexpected, addition to chrom feature, find S binds population mRN whose transcription stimulated S-CRN.
Researchers investigated the connection between programmed cell death during plant development (PCD) and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thalian roots. They focused on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC/SMB and senescence-associated nuclease B1. Mutations in both PC regulators increased colonization by the fungus Serendita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. The smb-3 mutants exhibited hypercolonization around the merematic zone and delay of indica-induced root growth. This suggests that root PC and post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Reporter and transcription analysis revealed B1 expression is downregulated during indica colonization in mature epidermal cells, indicating a transcriptional control facilitating beneficial microbes in roots.

The study found that impaired PC in Arabidopsis mutants increased colonization by the beneficial endophyte S indica. The smb-3 mutants showed hypercolonization along the primary root, suggesting extra cell corpses surrounding smb-roots provide additional nutrients for fungal colonization. PC protects the meristem from microbial colonization, but some microbes manipulate host PC processes by affecting B1 transcription to facilitate accommodation.

Transcriptome analysis during colonization showed significant decrease in B1 expression after 6 days post-inoculation in older root parts, independent of fungal colonization. Inoculation of B1 reporter lines with S indica reduced promoter activity in epider cells in contact with fungus compared to mock-treated roots. B1 expression and localization in root xylem was not affected by S.
Researchers have found that large vesicles, called exophers, are released from stressed neurons in the worm C. elegans and may contribute to the spread of disease-causing proteins and inflammatory responses that lead to neurodegenerative disease. However, the factors that regulate this process are not well understood. The study found that mechanical force can increase the release of these vesicles from stressed neurons. In C. elegans, the production of exers from the AL neuron peaks at day 2-3, coinciding with the worm's reproductive peak. Disrupting the worm's reproductive system, such as by removing sperm or eggs, can stop exer release from the AL neuron during this time. Restoring reproduction through mating or genetic interventions that block egg-laying can increase ex production. Interventions that promote ex production are linked to longer uterine lengths, while those that suppress it are linked to shorter lengths. The study also found that filling the uterus with eggs, dead eggs, or fluid can enhance ex production, not just the presence of fertilized eggs. The researchers conclude that mechanical force in the uterus potentiates ex release from stressed neurons. This highlights the importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and spreading mechanisms, making a case for attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.
Researchers have found that a protein called Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) plays a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). K3 is a secreted by cells and accumulates in amyloid plaques, which are a hallmark of AD. The study investigated how K affects synapses in healthy and AD brains. Results show that K is upregulated in AD brains and its levels increase early in the disease. In mouse models of AD, extracellular K is increased and accumulates around dystrophic neuronal processes. Functionally, K triggers loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of Wnt/GSKβ signaling and increase inhibitory syn via W/JNK. In contrast, K knockdown restores synapse and memory in mice.

 Studies show that K regulates stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus through different pathways. Functional studies in J20 mice demonstrate that knocking down K ameliorates changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse in hippocampus before and after plaque deposition. Loss of syn around amyloid plaques is well described, but in vivo K loss-of-function ameliorates synaptic defects in mice, supporting that K is a key contributor to synaptic changes in this model. A feature of AD is loss syn around plaques. Investigated whether K affects syn number plaques in 9-old J mice. The impact of K on syn and function, affected by deficient signaling, in AD, remains studied. Investigated the role of K in integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory syn in healthy and AD.

 Syn loss is strongest correlate cognitive in AD, but mechanisms trigger changes poorly understood. Investigated the function of W antagonist K on integrity and memory in healthy and brain. Changes syn induced by silencing K unlikely due formation plaques as observed similar changes when plaques absent. Line with view, knock K does not affect number or size amyloid pla in J hippocampus. Gain-of studies demonstrate K directly affects integrity excitatory and inhibitory syn.
Researchers have identified a new potential solution to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. They found that certain compounds produced by a type of microbe, Pseudomonas, have strong antibacterial properties. These compounds, called pyoverines, work by taking iron from bacteria, which is essential for their growth. The team tested 320 Pseudas isolates against 12 human pathogens and found several pyines with strong antibacterial properties. The most effective pyine reduced the growth of three types of bacteria, Acinetobacter baumann, Klei pneumonia, and Staphlococcus aureus, in a concentration-dependent manner. Pyines also increased the survival of infected Galleria mellella larvae and showed low toxicity to mammalian cells and erythrocytes. Whole-genome sequencing of the bacteria showed limited resistance to the pyines. This suggests that pyines from environmental Pseudas could be a new class of sustainable antibacterials against human pathogens.
Researchers have long known that schizophrenia is linked to disruptions in the prefrontal network, but the exact mechanisms behind these disruptions at the synaptic level are unclear. This gap in understanding hinders the discovery of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to prefront network failure in schizophrenia. To address this question, a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal circuits was developed to explain the link between NMDA receptor synaptic and 0-lag synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological model of prefront network failure in schizophrenia. The model analyzed the balance between AMPA and NMD components of recurrent excitation and GABA in the network's influence on oscillatory spike synchrony to inform biological data. Results show that reducing NMD synaptic currents prevent the network from shifting to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, such as during behavior. These findings parallel dynamic modulation of 0-l spike synchrony observed between prefront neurons during behavior, as well as suppression of 0-l spiking by NMD antagonists. The network model provides a plausible link between NMD synaptic and 0ag synchrony deficits in pharmacological model prefront failure schizophrenia.

 The study established a theoretical basis for reduction of NMD function in schizophrenia leading to desynchronization in prefront circuits. Spiking networks near the boundary between asynchronous and synchronous states explain various biological observations. Reducing NMD synaptic currents prevent networks from transitioning to oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, preventing 0ag synchrony. Prior studies addressed NAR function and oscillatory in prefront networks, but not the current topic of how NAR excitation and external input influence spike and oscillatory dynamics. A spiking network model was developed to understand the link between NAR malfunction and reduced 0ag spiking observed in biological data.
Researchers have studied the process of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones in low-oxygen environments. They found that the initial steps of angiogenesis depend on the differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and St cell types, controlled by NOTCH cell-cell communication. However, the dynamics of this process are not fully understood. Using a controlled angiogenesis model and mathematical analysis, they found that Tip-St cell patterning undergoes an order-disorder transition at high levels of pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. This results in robust but unstable differentiation, with only a subset of Tip cells forming sprouts. Sprouts form in a way that maximizes mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that depends on fibronectin enrichment. NOT signaling enables cell differentiation but not instructs subsequent steps in angiogenesis, requiring additional cues and self-organization.

In angiogenesis, endothelial cells differentiate into Tip and St states guided by proangi cues like VEG and tissue organization by paracrine-NOTCH signaling. Mathematical models exist, but need testing for causality. Turing-like mechanisms explain experimental results. Analysis supports dynamic view: VEG input induces NOT signaling and Tip cells that behave as sprouts. Inputs can specify fate, e.g. VEG promotes Tip, NOT St, suppressing Tip in same cell. Signaling can result in complex, poorly understood outcomes based on Tip/St ratio.

Researchers calibrated model parameters to match VEG input 100ng/ml to observed Tip/St fractions. They quantified spatial patterning of Tip cells in angi model. Endothelial induction may contrast with collective migration, NOT modulating leader/follower patterns, highlighting need for refined models integrating biochemical/mechanical regulation of Tip-St fate.
Researchers have long known that the locus coeruleus (LC) and its projections to the hippocampus play a crucial role in learning and memory. However, the exact timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus were unclear. The LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity by releasing norepinephrine, but recent studies suggest it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other regions. This study investigated the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during fear conditioning in mice. The results show that the LC and its projections to the hippoc respond to task-relevant stimuli and amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation enhances long-term memory. The study also found that LC increases norepine and dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus and the timing of hippocampal dopamine during fear conditioning is similar to LC activity. Importantly, hippocal dopamine is important for fear memory, while norephrine is not.

The study suggests LC projections to the hippoc are activated by salient learning events and this activation can enhance long-term memory. However, it was unclear which neurotransmitter the LC releases during these responses. The LC is known to be the primary source of norephine in the brain. Based on previous work and learning activity in LC-hipp projections, the release of dopamine into the hippocampus may be responsible for observed effects. However, direct manipulation of this projection is needed to confirm.

The study provides evidence that LC increases both dopamine and noreph in the hippocampus and shows dopamine is important for fear memory, while release of nph is not. This suggests dopamine enhances learning plasticity in regions supporting fear conditioning. The LC and hippocampus are known to be critical for hippocampus-dependent memory formation. However, the temporal dynamics of learning-related LC and LC-hipp activity are poorly understood due to use of spatial memory tasks.
