**Title:** Unveiling the Role of GL-1/Notch Signaling in Cell Reprogramming in Caenorhabditis elegans**

**Research Question:** How does the GL-1/Notch signaling pathway facilitate reprogramming of germline cells into somatic cells in Caenorhabitis elegans, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes to investigate the role of GL-1/Not signaling in reprogramming.

**Findings:** We discovered that GL-1/Not signaling promotes reprogramming by activating genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and identified the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GL-1/Not target facilitating reprogramming.

**Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals an unexpected role of GL-1/Not signaling in reprogramming, contrary to its known function in maintaining undifferentiated germl stem/progen cells. We propose that GL-1/Not promotes reprogramming by activating specific genes silenced by PR2, and identify UTX-1 as a key GL-1/Not target facilitating reprogramming.

**Key findings:**

* GL-1/Not signaling is essential for reprogramming germl cells into somatic cells
* GL-1/Not activates genes silenced by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PR2)
* UTX-1, a conserved histone demethylase, is a crucial GL-1/Not target facilitating reprogramming
* GL-1/Not and PR2 have antagonistic effects on cell fate decisions
* GL-1/Not regulates genes maintaining germl stem/progen cells

**Implications:**

* Understanding GL-1/Not role in reprogramming has implications for development and diseases associated with Notch signaling
* GL-1/Not may be a target for therapeutic intervention in Notch-related disorders

**Future directions:**

* Investigate GL-1/Not reprogramming in other organisms
* Explore GL-1/Not regulation of PR2 and UTX-1 in other contexts
* Investigate GL-1/Not role in Notch-related diseases

**Title:** The Adaptor Protein SK2 (SK2) is Essential for Protection against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 438 Pulmonary Infections

**Research Question:** What is the role of adaptor protein SK2 (SK) in the host defense against Klebsella pneumoniae ATCC 438 pulmonary infections?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of SK2 in the innate immune response to Klebsella pneumoniae ATCC 438 using a murine model of pulmonary infection. SK- mice were compared to wild-type mice in terms of bacterial burden, neutrophil function, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

**Findings:** SK- mice had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice. Neutrophils and monocytes were present in lungs, but neutrophil degranulation was normal in response to Kleella pneumonia infection. However, Kle pneumonia-stimulated ROS production was abolished in vitro. Kle pneumonia-induced neutil ROS required the activity of Src family kinases (SFK), Syk, Btk, PLC2, and PK. The loss of SK significantly hindered Kle pneumonia-induced phosphorylation of FK, Sy, and Py2, implicating SK as proximal to their activation in pathogen signaling pathways.

**Implications:** SK-dependent neutil signaling is essential for Kle pneumonia-activated ROS production and promoting bacterial clearance during infection. The sensitivity of pneumonia to ROS is supported by increased bacterial burden in mice and observations in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients.

**Conclusions:** SK plays a critical role in host defense against Kleella pneumonia AT 438 in pulmonary infections. SK is indispensable for pneumonia-stimulated neutil ROS, but not degranulation or phagocytosis. The increased burden in SK- mice is due to loss of ROS sensitivity. These results indicate pneumonia 16 is resistant to neutil phagocytosis regardless of SK expression, but elicits SK-independent degranulation during infection. ROS is a mechanism for protection against pneumonia in mice lacking the gp91ph component of NAD oxidase.

**Title:** Modeling the Dynamics of Plasmodium vivax Relapse Infections: A Within-Host Model of Liver-Stage Hypnoites and Its Implications for Malaria Transmission

**Research Question:** How do liver-stage hypnoites contribute to Plasium viv relapse infections and malaria transmission, and what are the implications for malaria control strategies?

**Methods:** We developed a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnoites (hypnoites) and validated it against data from tropical strains of P. vivax. The model was then embedded in a P. viv transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypite activation and death.

**Findings:** Our results show that the hypite reservoir is overdispersed, with many individuals having few or no hypites and some having intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypites are predicted to experience relapses and contribute to P. viv transmission. Incorporating hypite killing drugs, such as primaquine, into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P. viv transmission, as individuals with most hypites are likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.

**Implications:** Relapses arising from hypite activation in the liver have significant consequences for P. viv transmission dynamics. The hypite reservoir constitutes a third parasite reservoir, in addition to blood and mosquito reservoirs for P. falciparum. Relapses can be incorporated into Ross-Mac models through a state representing the hypite reservoir. In the absence of diagnostics for liver-stage parasites, models will play a crucial role in estimating effectiveness of interventions targeting the hypite, either via vector and blood-stage anti-malarials or directly primaquine.

**Conclusions:** Our within-host model of hypites demonstrates that many epidemiological patterns of relapse can be explained by assuming hypites activate and die at a constant rate. This is integrated into existing Rossac models to account for rel infections of P. viv malaria, providing insights into impact of control on parasite reservoirs in vector, blood, and liver. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating hypite dynamics into malaria models for effective control and elimination strategies.

**Title:** Post-Logging Carbon Recovery in Amazonian Forests: A Regional Patterns and Predictions of Carbon Sequestration Potential

**Research Question:** How do regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass affect carbon sequestration in Amazonian forests after selective logging, and what are the key drivers of post-disturbance recovery?

**Methods:** We employed a novel approach using a network of 133 permanent forest plots (175 ha) across Amazonia to link regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass with carbon fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging recovery. We analyzed long-term (8-30 year) data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites in the Amazon and Guiana Shield.

**Findings:** Our results show that aboveground carbon recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield (21.3 ± 3 Mg ha-1) than in the south (12.3 ± 3 Mg ha-1) where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality). We highlight the key role of survivors in forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance carbon sequestration potential in Amazonia.

**Implications:** We partitioned contributions to post-disturbance carbon gain (growth and recruitment of ≥20 cm DBH) and loss from mortality of survivors and recruited trees to detect main drivers and patterns of recovery in forests disturbed by selective logging across Amazonia. Our study provides clues on regional differences in Amazonian response to large losses by other disturbances (e.g., wildfires, droughts). We upscale results to Amazonia using maps of climate, conditions, and soil density to elaborate predictive maps of changes over 10 years under a 40% loss, a common intensity after logging.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of considering regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass when predicting post-logging carbon recovery in Amazonian forests. The Guiana Shield shows higher carbon sequestration potential than the south due to lower environmental stress. Survivors play a crucial role in forest regrowth, and our maps provide a comprehensive understanding of post-disturbance carbon potential in Amazonia.

**Title:** Distinguishing Quiescent Neural Stem Cells from Neurosphere-Initiating Cells in the Adult Ventricular Subventricular Zone**

**Research Question:** The relationship between quies neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs) in the adult ventricular subventricular zone (SVZ) remains unclear.

**Methods:** We prospectively identified and isolated NICs from the adult mouse SVZ using flow cytometry, characterizing them as GlastEGhighPlexBhighCD24/lowO/4AAM/lowTer/119/45 (GEOT) cells, which were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo. In contrast, pre-GEOT cells were quiescent, expressed higher Glast, and lower EGFR, and PlexB.

**Findings:** GEOT NICs formed neurospheres, expressed stem markers Slc1-CERT, GF-CERT, Sox2ERT, and GliERT, and were long-lived in vivo. In contrast, pre-GEOT cells could not form neuropheres, were quies in vivo, but long-lived in the SVZ based on fate mapping with stem markers. Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 polyprotein depleted pre-GE and GEOT cells, with pre-GE cells more dependent on B-1 for Cdk2 (p16ink4) repression.

**Implications:** Our data distinguish quies NSCs from NICs, enabling study of their properties in vivo.

**Conclusions:** We identified two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of neural stem/progenitor cells in the adult SV: GEOT cells, highly mitotically active and transient, and pre-GE cells quies and long-lived. GEOTs formed neuropheres, expressed stem markers, while pre- cells did not. Conditional deletion of B-1 protein depleted pre- and GE cells, with pre cells more dependent on B- for Cdk2 (16ink) repression. Our findings distinguish quies NSCs from NIC, enabling study of their properties in vivo.

**Title:** Piezo1 Channels Behave as Independent Mechanotrans at Physiologically Relevant Densities, Enabling Homogeneous Force Transduction Across the Cell Membrane

**Research Question:** How do Pie1 channels spatially interact and functionally modulate each other's mechanical sensitivity at various densities, and what are the implications for force transduction across the cell membrane?

**Methods:** We employed cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp to investigate Pie1 channels in cells expressing endogenously low and overexpressing Pie1 at high levels. Stochastic simulations of Pie1 spatial distributions were used to predict channel overlap at endogenous (1-2/μm2) and non-physiological (10-100/μm) densities.

**Findings:** Our data, together with simulations, show that Pie1 channels at physiologically relevant densities (1-2/μm) behave as independent mechanotrans, with no effect on pressure sensitivity or open probability in the absence of membrane tension. In contrast, non-physiological densities (10-100/μ) exhibit substantial overlap, suggesting functional modulation of each other's sensitivity.

**Implications:** This property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire membrane, as Pie channels have no intrinsic tendency to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other's mechanical sensitivity.

**Conclusions:** Pie1 channels, at physiologically relevant densities, inherently function as mechanotrans, enabling cells to transduce forces with spatial homogeneity across the membrane. This is crucial for cells to detect and respond to mechanical forces in their environment.

**Title:** Investigating the Effects of Volatility on Decision-Making: A Novel Insights from a Bounded Accumulation Model**

**Research Question:** How does the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold influence decision-making, particularly in terms of speed, accuracy, and confidence?

**Methods:** We employed a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex, verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST, to test predictions of a bounded accumulation model.

**Findings:** Increasing noise led to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically higher confidence in both humans and macaques over a range of stimuli with minimal accuracy impairment. The magnitude of effects agreed with predictions of bounded accumulation model.

**Implications:** This study provides evidence for the bounded accumulation model's ability to account for joint effects of volatility on choice, reaction time, and confidence.

**Conclusions:** A manipulation that increases the variance of momentary evidence on a decision (volatility) increases speed and confidence associated with it. Testing volatility's influence on decision-making is challenging due to independent control over signal and noise in evidence. We mimicked manipulation by changing statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus, verified by recording from direction-selective neurons in MT and MST areas of macaque cortex. Neurons in these areas represent momentary evidence in tasks identical to our study (Salzman et al., 1990; Celebrini & Newsome, 199; Ditter et al., 2003; Fets et al., 2014).

**Title:** Regulation of Caenorhabditis elegans Lifespan by Insulin Signaling and Calcineurin Pathways

**Research Question:** How do the insulin and calcine signaling pathways regulate lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, and what is the role of the transcription factor DAF-16 in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the calcine phosphatase TAX-6CN-1 and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMK) ortholog UNC-43 in regulating DAF-16, the ortholog of the mammalian FOXO transcription factor, in Caenorhabditis elegans. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown of daf-16, tax-6, and unc-43, and observed the effects on DAF-16 localization and lifespan.

**Findings:** We found that UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting its nuclear localization, while TAX-6CN-1 dephosphorylates D-16, leading to its inactivation. Our data suggest that CAMK (UNC-43) and calcine (TAX-6CN-1) regulate Caenorhabitis lifespan through reversible phosphorylation of D-16 at serine 286. The antagonistic nature of these enzymes raised the possibility that their opposing effects on D-16 are negated by a common signal, Ca2/CAM.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that the insulin and calcine pathways regulate Caenoritis lifespan through D-16, with insulin signaling dominating when there is a conflict between the two pathways. Multiple pathways, including insulin/IGF-1, gerine, mitochondrial, and dietary restriction regulate aging in Caenorhabitis, with the best characterized being the insulin pathway. Our study highlights the complex regulation of D-16 by CAMK, calcine, and insulin signaling in Caenoritis.

**Conclusions:** The calc phosphatase TAX-6-1 and CAMK UNC-43 regulate Caenor lifespan by phosphorylating and dephosphylating D-16 at serine 286. The antagonistic nature of these enzymes suggests that their opposing effects on D-16 are negated by a common signal, Ca/CAM. Insulin signaling appears to dominate when there is a conflict between the two pathways. Our study contributes to understanding the complex regulation of aging in Caenoritis and the role of D- in this process.

**Title:** Hierarchical Organization of Motor Programs Underlies Sequential Grooming Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster

**Research Question:** How do nervous systems implement the sequential execution of motor programs to achieve complex behaviors, such as grooming, and what are the organizational principles governing this process?

**Methods:** We employed genetically targeted activation of neural subsets to drive distinct motor programs for cleaning individual body parts in Drosophila melanogaster, allowing us to experimentally control and reveal the hierarchy of motor programs.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that motor programs are organized in a suppression hierarchy, with earlier programs suppressing those that occur later. Cleaning one body part reduces sensory drive to its motor, relieving suppression of next movement, allowing sequence to progress down hierarchy. A model featuring evoked movements in parallel, but selected through hierarchical suppression, reproduces the grooming sequence.

**Implications:** This study provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by a prevailing model for generating action. Our findings suggest that evolutionarily ancient ability to select competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided infrastructure to perform actions in sequence.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals the organizational principles underlying neural control of serial selection in an innate behavior common to arthropods, grooming. Our empirically derived model demonstrates how suppression mediates sequential selection of motor programs. We anticipate that identifying neural circuitry for each module and their interaction will reveal how serial behavior is encoded in nervous system through hierarchical mechanism.

**Title:** Shugoshin-like 2 (Sg2) Regulates Chromosome Segregation by Coordinating Cohesion, Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, and Kinetochores-Microtubule Interactions

**Research Question:** How do diverse processes involved in accurate chromosome segregation, including cohesion, spindle assembly checkpoint, and kinetochore-microtub interactions, coordinate during meiosis I in mammalian oocytes?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Shoshin-like 2 (S2) protein in regulating these processes in mammalian oocytes.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that S2 plays a crucial role in turning off the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), promoting bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis spind, facilitating kinetoch-microtule (Kibers) formation, and limiting bivalent stretching. S2's ability to protect cohesin depends on interaction with PP2A, while its ability to silence SAC is mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent and Kiber formation is independent of PP2 and mediated by recruitment of MCA and inhibition of Aurora kinase activity.

**Implications:** S2 links multiple processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation by virtue of its multiple interactions. Depletion of S2 in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences during meiosis, including inefficient SAC silencing, increased bivalent stretching, and alterations in kinetoch-microtule attachments. We show S silences SAC by binding to Mad2 using a MIM motif common to Mad's partners Cdc20 and Mad1. Delayed biorientation of bival on meiosis spind, increased bivalent, and Aurora/C activity at kinetores, accompanied by increase in lateral and decrease in kinoch-microt attachments. S2 deficiency delayed APC/CC20 activation, suggesting it required to shut SAC.

**Conclusions:** A single protein regulates sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, spindle checkpoint, and Aurora/Cases. Demonstrating different mutations alter regulation but not processes, we prove pleiotropy in S2/Δ oocytes not due to secondary or tertiary effects eliminating single function. We show S2 defective PP binding fails protect centrom cohes, as S1 in yeast (Xu et al, 2009). However, if sole function S2, chromosome behavior meiosis should unaffected. To our surprise, S2 deficiency striking changes chromosome microt dynamics.

**Title:** Persistence of Experience-Dependent Changes in Brain Connectivity Requires RNA Localization and Protein Synthesis: A Role of Netrin-1/DCC Signaling in Synaptic Translation

**Research Question:** Do experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity require localized RNA and protein synthesis, and what are the underlying mechanisms that regulate this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of local translation and RNA trafficking in sensory-motor neurons using imaging and molecular biology techniques. Cultured Aplyia sensory-motor neurons were stimulated, and RNA localization and translation were imaged. Mechanisms of local translation were investigated, including calcium-dependent netrin-1/DCC signaling.

**Findings:** RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of sensory neurons, but translation was enriched at sites of synaptic contact and stimulation. Calcium-dependent netrin-1/DCC signaling triggered local translation. Spatial regulation of gene expression was mediated by local translation rather than RNA delivery from the nucleus to synapses. Three mRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered to both synaptic and non-synaptic sites, but translation was enriched at sites of contact and stimulation.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that spatial regulation of gene expression in sensoryotor neurons is primarily at the level of translation, not RNA targeting from nucleus. Netrin-1 release from SN or MN during synapse formation and plasticity triggers translation at synaptic but not non-synaptic sites. Recombinant netrin-1 incubation with Aplyia sensoryotor cultures demonstrated regulation of localized transcripts.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity require localized RNA and protein synthesis, and that netrin-1/DCC signaling is a key regulator of this process. Netrin-1 release from SN or MN during synapse formation and plasticity triggers translation at synaptic but not non-synaptic sites. These findings have implications for understanding synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory.

**Title:** Investigating the Morphogenesis of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Colonies through CRISPR-Meduced Knockdown of Cortical Tension and Cell-Adhesion Regulators

**Research Question:** How do cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiP) colonies be controlled through the manipulation of molecular regulators of cortical tension and cell adhesion?

**Methods:** We employed an inducible CRISPR interference (CRPR) system in hiSC to silence key proteins regulating cell adhesion and cortical tension. We created mixed populations of hiSC with and without CRPR system, then induced mosaic knockdown (KD) of ROCK1 and CD1 using CRPR.

**Findings:** Mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CD1 resulted in differential patterning within hiSC colonies due to self-organization, while retaining epithelial pluripotent phenotype. Knockdown induced a transient wave of gene expression within mixed populations stabilized with observed self-organization. Mosaic patter enabled interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, facilitating understanding molecular pathways regulating symmetry-breaking morphogenesis.

**Implications:** This study identifies a novel strategy to control emergence heterotypic cell populations and multicellular organization in pluripotent cells, creating robust models for mechanistic study human tissue patterning formation.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that CRPR-induced knockdown of cortical tension and adhesion regulators in hiSC subpopulations leads to controllable self-organization and patterning. This approach enables interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, providing insights into molecular pathways regulating symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis. Mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CD1 results in 'bottom-up' cell-driven formation of hiSC colonies, preserving pluripotency. This study opens avenues for directed emergence of heterotypic populations and multicellular organization in pluripotent cells, facilitating mechanistic study of developmental patterning and tissue formation.

**Title:** A Normative Theory for Set Effects in Visual Working Memory: Minimizing Error and Neural Cost

**Research Question:** How does the number of items encoded in visual working memory affect precision, and what is the underlying mechanism behind this effect?

**Methods:** We propose a normative theory that balances expected performance against the cost of neural resource spent on encoding, and construct a model based on this theory. We test the model on data from nine delayed-estimation experiments, examining effects of set size and probability on precision.

**Findings:** Our model accounts for effects of set size and probability on precision, and predicts a non-monotonic relation between set size and total resource invested in encoding. We also show that it is sometimes optimal to encode a subset or none of items in a task, raising the possibility that cognitive limitations arise from cost minimization rather than constraints.

**Implications:** Our theory provides a principled explanation for set effects in working memory and attention, and may apply beyond these domains. It formalizes the speculation that selectivity arises from balancing performance against spiking costs, and explains size effects in attention tasks. The model has few parameters and accounts for nonotonicity between size and resource invested in encoding.

**Conclusions:** Our findings support a normative theory that minimizes error and neural cost, providing a new understanding of set effects in working memory and attention. The model's predictions can be tested in neuroimaging experiments, such as Bal et al. (2016). Our theory also makes predictions about incentive manipulations on precision, as they affect the expected cost function.

**Title:** Pathogen Manipulation of Autophagy: A Novel Mechanism of Plant-Pathogen Interaction

**Research Question:** How do plant pathogens interfere with autophagy processes, and what are the implications for plant defense against infectious diseases?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between the Irish potato pathogen Phytophthora infestan's effector, PRD54, and the autophagy protein ATG8 in Arabidopsis thaliana.

**Findings:** PRD54 binds to AT8 with high affinity, stimulating AT8-marked autophagosome formation and depleting the autagy receptor J2 out of AT8 complexes, thereby interfering with J2's positive effect on pathogen defense.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of plant-pathogen interaction, where a pathogen effector has evolved to antagonize a host autagy receptor to counter host defenses.

**Conclusions:** Our results show that pathogens can activate autagy for their benefit, promoting nutrient recycling and eliminating defense-related compounds. This study highlights the complexity of plant-pathogen interaction and the need to consider pathogen-directed modulation of autagy and cellular trafficking during infection.

**Title:** Elucidating Cardiac Fibroblast Responses to Simultaneous Environmental Stimuli: A Novel Insights into Pathological Mechanisms of Cardiac Fibrosis

**Research Question:** How do cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) respond to simultaneous environmental changes in mechanical strain and oxygen tension, and what are the implications for cardiac fibrosis?

**Methods:** We employed a multi-stimulus microdevice to apply cyclic strain and controlled oxygen to primary human cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to investigate their responses to individual and combined stimuli.

**Findings:** Our results show that CFs exhibit differential responses to various combinations of mechanical and oxygen stimuli, with individual stimuli inducing proliferative effects (PH3 mitotic cells, YAP translocation, PD secretion) or collagen presence. Notably, the combination of hypoxia and simulated loss of contractility (2% strain) triggers increased release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.

**Implications:** This study proposes a novel model recreating a pathological environment for understanding CF responses during cardiac injury, replicating for the first time the combination of oxygen and mechanical cues, revealing how these stimulations combine to trigger pathological responses and emerging cellular mechanisms. Our findings have implications for in vitro models of cardiac disease, where CFs have been studied under physicochemical stimulation such as mechanical stress, oxygen deprivation, and biochemical with proibrotic cytokines.

**Conclusions:** This study provides insights into the synergistic contributions of environmental signals in the activation of early CF responses relevant to cardiacrotic disease. After ischemic myocardial insult (e.g., acute artery occlusion), tissue oxygen levels drop to 5-6 O2. During proliferative myocardial healing, excessive CF proliferation and phenotypic switch to fibrot response. To understand environmental modulation of CF proliferation, we examined mitotic cells (PH3+/DA) under mechanical and oxygen changes. We found mimicking combination of H and contractility crucial in eliciting inflammatory and fibrot remodeling of CF, while individual stimuli regulated proliferative and collagen responses. Our model provides a tool for understanding pathological mechanisms and tailoring reparative strategies.

**Title:** Alternative Isoforms of the DOM Nucleosome Remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, Specify Distinct Multiunit Complexes for Transcriptional Regulation in Drosophila

**Research Question:** How do the alternative isoforms of the DOM nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, contribute to transcriptional regulation in Drosila, and what are the mechanisms underlying their distinct functions?

**Methods:** We investigated the functional roles of DOM-A and DOM-B in transcriptional regulation using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, including RNA-seq analysis, knockdowns of DOM-A, DOM, T60, and H2V, and biochemical assays for histone acetylation and ATPase activities.

**Findings:** We found that DOM-B incorporates H2V, the fly ortholog of H2, genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR complex, while DOM-A functions as an ATP-independent histone acetylase complex similar to yeast Nu4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our data suggest that DOM-A might serve as the central subunit of a Nu4-type complex in Dophila, and that ATP activity of DOM is dispensable for H4 acylation by DOM-A.

**Implications:** Our work provides an instructive example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation in yeast and humans, nucleosome and histone acetylase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog, while Dophila generates diversity by alternative splicing a single gene. This study highlights the importance of alternative splicing in generating functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators.

**Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that DOM-A and DOM specify distinct multiunit complexes for transcriptional regulation through different mechanisms, with DOM-B incorporating H2 in an ATP-dependent manner and DOM-A functioning as an ATP-independent histone acetylase. This work illustrates how alternative splicing can generate functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators and highlights the complexity of chromatin regulation in Dila.

**Title:** Unraveling the Role of β-Catenin (Ctn1) in Motor Neuronal Differentiation: A Retrograde Signaling and Transcriptional Regulation

**Research Question:** What are the functions of β-Caten (tn1) in motorneuronal differentiation, and how does it regulate presynaptic formation through retrograde signaling?

**Methods:** We employed an in vivo transgenic approach to dissect the functions of β-Caten (tn) in motoruronal differentiation. We generated transgenic mice expressing wild-type or mutant βaten with impaired in transcriptional regulation or cell-adhesion signaling. We analyzed presynaptic morphology and function in these mice.

**Findings:** Our results show that βaten without the transactivation domain (TAD) was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits of βaten mutation, indicating the involvement of transcriptional regulation. In contrast, cell-adhesion function of βaten was dispensable. We identified Slit2 as a potential βaten-directed retrograde factor and showed that Sl2 expression in muscle diminished presaptic deficits in βaten mice. Sl2 immobilized on beads induced synapsin puncta in axons of spinal explants.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that βaten regulates presaptic differentiation through transcriptional control of muscle-derived proteins. This is supported by recent reports that stable βaten expression in muscle impairs presaptic in mutant mice. We propose that βaten in muscle is critical for a retrograde pathway directing terminal development.

**Conclusions:** βaten in muscle regulates presaptic differentiation by controlling the expression of muscle-derived proteins. Our study highlights the importance of transcriptional regulation in βaten function and identifies Slit as a potential retrograde factor. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of motoruronal differentiation and presaptic formation.

**Title:** Force Transmission at Cell-Cell Adhesions Regulates Tissue Development and Maintenance

**Research Question:** How do mechanical forces transmitted through cell-cell adhesions influence tissue development and maintenance in epithelial tissues?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of computational and experimental approaches to quantify force transmission at both subcellular and multicellular scales in spontaneously forming adherent epithelial cell clusters. We used a generalized cell-cell force measurement method to analyze spatially and temporally the transmission of mechanical forces through cell-cell junctions of dynamic epithelial clusters.

**Findings:** Our time-resolved force measurements demonstrated that cell-cell forces at junctions fluctuate over time, both during interphase and cell divisions. We found that basal fluctuations were coupled to E-cadher localization at the level of individual-cell junctions. At multicellular scale, cell force transmission depended on cell position within cluster and was adaptive to reconfigurations due cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through cell required coordinated modulation cell-matrix adhesion and actomy contractility in cell and its neighbors.

**Implications:** These findings provide insights into mechanisms controlling mechanical homeostasis in epithelial tissues and highlight our methods as a resource for study mechanotransduction cell adhesions. Our results suggest that force transmission through cell-cell adhes plays a crucial role in tissue development and maintenance.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of force transmission cell-cell adhes in epithelial tissues and highlights the need for further investigation into mechanotransduction mechanisms. We provide a novel method for quantifying force transmission cell-cell adhes at subcell and multicellular scales, which can be applied to study various biological processes, including tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, and disease.

**Key Findings:**

* Force transmission through cell-cell junctions fluctuates over time, both during interphase and cell divisions
* Basal fluctuations are coupled to E-cad localization at individual junction
* Multicellular force transmission depends on cell position within cluster and is adaptive to reconfig due cell divisions or positional rearrangements
* Force transmission through cell requires coordinated modulation cell-matrix adhesion and actomy contractility in cell and neighbors
* Our method provides insights into tissue mechanics, revealing force transmission across cell is short-ranged, typically on scale one cell diameter due anchoring forces by cell-matrix adhes and actomy contractility

**Title:** Elucidating the Structural and Biochemical Properties of Huntingtin and the Impact of Polyglutamine Expansion in Huntington's Disease

**Research Question:** How does the polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease, and what are the structural and biochemical properties of the full-length huntingtin protein affected by this expansion?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle microscopy, and cross-link mass spectrometry to investigate the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of polyglut expansion.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical soloid structure, with the amino-terminal and carbox-terminal regions forming a circumscribed central cavity. Notably, polyglut expansion increases α-hical properties of hunting and affects intramolecular interactions among domains.

**Implications:** This study delineates the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin affected by polyut expansion, providing an elegant solution to the conundrum of how the amino-terminal polyut tract confers novel property on hunting, causing disease. Our findings suggest that hunting may undergo conformation change upon interaction with partners.

**Conclusions:** Our systematic biophysical and biochemical analyses of a panel of purified recombinant huntingins with varied polyut tracts provide insight into the impact of polyut on hunting basic features. Single-particle microscopy of recombin humanins with polyut lengths of 23- and 78-resid reveal that hunting's shape may enable structural impact of amino polyut tract. Our results provide satisfying solution to mystery of how polyut may modulate hunting structure and function.

**Title:** Regulation of Autophagic Turnover of Ferritin by NCO4: Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of Intracellular Iron Homeostasis

**Research Question:** How is the autophagic turnover of ferritin, a critical for intracellular iron regulation, controlled, and what are the roles of N4 in iron-dependent processes?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between N4 and ferritin heavy chain 1 (F1) and found that direct association via a conserved arginine in F1 and C-terminal in N is required for ferritin delivery to lysosomes via autophagosomes. N4 abundance is regulated by autophagy and ubiquitin proteasome, with ubiquitin-dependent N4 turnover promoted by excess iron involving an iron-dependent interaction between N and HER2 ubiquitin ligase.

**Findings:** In zebrafish cells, N plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation. Our results reveal the molecular nature of the N-ferritin complex and how intracellular iron modulates N-mediated ferritinagy in an iron-dependent setting. When iron is high, N4 is low, promoting ferritin accumulation and iron capture; conversely, when iron is low, N levels increase to promote ferritinagy.

**Implications:** Understanding the mechanisms underlying these processes is complicated by the fact that the pool of N participating in targeting ferritin autagosomes is degraded within lysosomes. We show that N interacts with F via conserved N-terminal and conserved on F1. Mutation these sites abrogates binding in vivo and abolishes ferritinagy. HER2 uses its C-terminal domain to recognize N under high conditions to mediate N turnover via ubiquitin-proteome, reducing steady N levels and increasing ferr for capture.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms of N-ferr complex and intracellular iron regulation. N-mediated ferragy is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. N is identified as a target when V34 autagy activator inhibited and promotes ferragy. Our findings highlight the role of HER2, iron, and ubiquitin in regulating N and its autagic turnover during ferritinagy.

**Title:** Hierarchical Organization of the Lateral Prefrontal Cortex: Unveiling the Apex of Higher Cognition

**Research Question:** Does the lateral prefrontal cortex (LP) exhibit a hierarchical organization, with progressively rostral areas processing increasingly abstract information and facilitating efficient cognition?

**Methods:** We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling to investigate the functional organization of the LP in humans. We examined the rostral-caud axis of the LP by analyzing gradients of stimulus domain-specificity and temporal control, and modeled interactions among LP sub-regions to assess hierarchical processing.

**Findings:** Our results revealed rostral-caud gradients of abstraction in the LP, with dynamic modeling indicating asymmetrical interactions indicative of hierarchical processing. Contrary to assumptions, the strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned the midLP as the apex of the hierarchy. Cognitive demands modulated connectivity towards LP, consistent with a role in integrating information control. Furthermore, strengths of these dynamics were related to higher-level cognitive ability.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest the LP is hierarchically organized, with the midLP positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information for behavior. The organization of LP is intimately tied to cognitive capacity, with top-down control within LP a determinant of higher function. Asymmetrical projections from midLP to other LP regions were related to higher-level ability, indicating a beneficial effect of hierarchical organization with midLP at the apex.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for hierarchical organization of the LP, with midLP at the apex, contrary to dominant assumptions. Our results suggest top-down influences from rostral to midLP and bottom-up from caud to midLP during cognitive engagement. Effective connectivity and modulations indicate midLP forms a nexus where information converges to action. These findings have implications for understanding LP function and its role in higher cognition.

**Title:** Homin-Specific Gene TBCD3 Regulates Cortical Expansion and Folding through Generation of Outer Radial Glial Cells

**Research Question:** How does the homin-specific gene TBC3 contribute to the evolution of higher intelligence through cortical expansion and folding?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of TBC3 in cortical development by expressing it in ventricular progenitors of mice via in utero electroporation and examining its effects on radial glial cell (RG) and outer radial glial (oRG) cell generation. We also downregulated T3 in human brain slices to assess its impact on oRG production.

**Findings:** T3 expression in utero electropation led to delamination of ventricular radial glia (RG) and generation of self-renewing oRG with morphology typical of primates. Downregulation of T3 in human slices decreased o production. Localized o proliferation from electrop or transgenic T3 expression underlay cortical regions exhibiting folding.

**Implications:** This study identifies T3 as a homin gene required for oRG generation, regulating cortical expansion and folding.

**Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that T3 promotes oRG generation in mice with high proliferative capacity observed in primates, accompanied by cortical folding. We propose T3 as a candidate controlling other genes involved in cortex expansion and folding, appearing earlier than ARHG11 in human evolution. This study provides proof-of-concept that brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during homin evolution.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Ubiquitination in the Transcriptional Activity of the Coactivator NPR1 in Plant Immune Response

**Research Question:** How does ubiquitination of the coactivator NPR1 contribute to its transcriptional activity and immune response in plants?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of ubiquitination in the transcriptional activity of NPR1, a key coactivator in plant immune response, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism. We examined the involvement of Cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL) and E4 ligase U4 in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NPR.

**Findings:** Our results show that ubiquination of NPR is a progressive event initiated by CRL, which promotes chromatin association and expression of target genes. However, ubiquitination by U4 leads to proteasomal degradation of NPR. Conversely, ubiquitin ligases UBP/7, proteas-associated deubiquitinases, enhance NPR longevity. Immune transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by deubiquases fine-tuning NPR activity without sacrificial turnover.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that CRL-mediated ubiquination is required for NPR to attain full transcriptional activity, while stepwise formation of ubiquitin chains by U4 inactivates NPR and promotes degradation. Initial ubiquination boosts NPR transcriptional coactiv activity by enhancing promoter occupancy and potentially genomic mobility.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals that ubiquitination of NPR plays a crucial role in plant immune response. Unlike E4 ligases, which extend pre-existing ubiquitin chains, E3 ligases contribute to initial ubiquination of substrates. In Arabidopsis, E4ase U4/M3 is involved in degradation of NLR immune receptors. We propose that ubiquitination itself acts as a transcriptional signal, providing a window for NPR to activate target genes. Our study demonstrates that ubiqu chain extension and trimming can fine-tune transcription outputs of unstable activators without sacrificial turnover.

**Title:** Arabidopsis thaliana 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 siRNAs) guide cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset genes

**Research Question:** How are 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 siRNAs) generated in Arabidopsis thalian, and what is their role in guiding cytosine methylation and silencing of transpos and subset genes?

**Methods:** We investigated the biogenesis of 24 siRNAs in Arabidopsis thalian, focusing on the involvement of RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR), and DICER-like 3 (DCL). We identified Pol IV and R2-dependent RNAs (PR RNAs) that accumulate in DCL mutants and are diced into 24 RN by CL in vitro. PR RNAs are mostly 26-45 nucleotides long, initiating with a purine adjacent to pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol transcripts generated in vitro. R2 terminal transfer activity, demonstrated in vitro, may account for occasional non-templated nucleides at PR RNA 3 termini.

**Findings:** We found that 24 siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5 or 3 ends of PR RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRN are generated from end PR duplexes by single-dicing events. Our data indicate that short-stranded PR RN that accumulate D mutants are immediate precursors siRN, based on ability D to cut these precursors 24 RN in vitro. Results consistent with those of Nagano et al.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the biogenesis 24 siRN in Arabid thalian and their role in guiding cytos methylation silencing transpos subset genes. Our data suggest that Pol and R2 are essential for biogenesis 24 siRN and physically associate in Arabid and maize. We conclude that individual PR RN represent Pol-R2 transcription units, and that short-stranded PR accumulate D mutants immediate precursors siRN.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of Pol and R2 in biogenesis 24 siRN and their role in guiding cytos methylation silencing trans subset genes in Arabid thalian. We propose a model whereby si are generated from PR duplex by single-dicing events, and that short-stranded PR accumulate mutants immediate precursors si. These findings have implications for understanding si biogenesis and function in plant development and stress response.

**Title:** Emergence of Mature Neural Networks and Spatiotemporal Activity Patterns Supports Cognition: A Developmental Regulation and Evolutionary Conservation**

**Research Question:** How do large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns develop across the postnatal course of neural networks to perform complex computations?

**Methods:** We employed high spatiotemporal in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice to investigate the progression of large-scale and cellular activity across development.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by neural quiescence, followed by spatially distributed, temporally precise, and organized activity. We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism facilitating transition network operation.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that transient quies period is a requisite for the emergence of coordinated networks. The transition between immature and mature dynamics is marked by decreased cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second week, followed by precise synchronization and oscillatory in space and time.

**Conclusions:** The maturation of cortical dynamics is preceded by a discrete, evolutionarily conserved period during early development. During this period, oscillations and spiking display a nad signals shift from local, loosely correlated, sensory-driven patterns to internally organized, spatially distributed, and temporally activity. We hypothesize that emergence of advanced network properties is heralded by disappearance of immature patterns. Cortical microcircuits undergo dramatic changes in anatomical connectivity and functional during this epoch, with an abrupt increase in synaptogenesis in superficial layers. Neural spiking is more efficiently recruited to oscillatory with strong phase-locking and higher precision, characteristic of adult networks engaged in information processing. A transient developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily indicator of substantial shift in cortical operations.

**Title:** Modeling the Coexistence of Multiple Circulating Strains of Plasmodium falcum in the Presence of Sexual Recombination: Implications for Epidemiology and Control

**Research Question:** How do multiple circulating strains of Plasium falcum undergo sexual recombination, and what are the implications for epidemiology and control?

**Methods:** An agent-based model was developed to extend earlier "strain" theory, addressing the var gene family of Plmod falcum. The model considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression. It tracks the dynamics of unique reperto in a population of hosts, and shows that under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition through cross-immunity structures the population into a subset of coexisting repires of genes whose degree of antigen overlap depends on transmission.

**Findings:** Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports the role of immune in structuring parasite diversity. The model shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition through cross-immunity structures the population into a subset of coexisting repires of genes whose degree of antigen overlap depends on transmission.

**Implications:** This complexity provides significant challenges to malaria research and control, but also an opportunity to extend strain theory in a way that can be tested empirically. An extension of earlier theory considers the effects of immune in populations of pathogens whose antigen-loci are multi and recombining.

**Conclusion:** An agent-based model that extends strain theory to the effect of immune on multi-antigen genes was developed, using the var family of P falcum as basis. The model considers the dynamics of enormous diversity of rep of genes by tracking all possible rep, given a pool of genetic variants. It explores whether structured populations resulting from selection exerted by competition distinct rep for hosts, mediated by cross-imm, can emerge.

**Key Findings:**

* Even under high levels of sexual recombination, competition through cross-imm structures the population into a subset of coexisting repires of genes whose degree of antigen overlap depends on transmission
* Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic at antigenic and neutral supports the role of immune in structuring parasite diversity
* Extension of earlier theory considers the effects of immune in populations of pathogens whose antigen-loc are multi and recomb
* Agent model shows that structured populations resulting from selection exert by competition distinct rep for hosts, mediated cross-imm can emerge

**Implications for Epidemiology and Control:** The coexistence of multiple circulating strains of Plmod falc in the presence of sexual recombination has profound implications for epidemiology and control. The model suggests that control strategies that reduce transmission may not drastically reduce gene diversity, as a reservoir of parasite with diverse, non-overlapping repires will remain.

**Title:** Mechanism of Deamidation-mediated Inhibition of UBC/TRAF6 Complex Formation and Suppression of NF-κB Inflammatory Response by Shigella flexneri Effector OI

**Research Question:** How does the deamidation of glutamine residue Q100 in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC by Shella flexner effector OI affect the interaction between UBC and the RING ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, leading to suppression of the NF-κ inflammatory response?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of deamation on the interaction between UBC and TRAF6 using biochemical assays and molecular dynamics simulations.

**Findings:** Deamation of Q100 in UBC creates a new intramolecular saltbridge that competes with a critical intermolecular saltbridge at the native UBC/TR6 interface, preventing transient interactions necessary for complex formation. Additionally, repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged surface of TR6 reduces transient interactions in the UBC/TR6 complex.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which post-translational modification perturbs the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association. Deamation disrupts the interaction between UBC and TR6 by three mechanisms: i) intramolecular saltbridge in U13 competes with intermolecular saltbridge in native complex, ii) saltbridge competition perturbs U/TR6 transient to inhibit association, and iii) repulsion between negatively charged E and negatively surface TR6 reduces transient interactions.

**Conclusions:** Shella flexner effector O suppresses the inflammatory NF-κ pathway via deation of UBC at Q100. Deation inhibits the synthesis of K-linked polyubitin chains by the U/TR6 complex, preventing downstream activation of NFκ pathway. Our results highlight the importance of understanding post-transl modifications in regulating protein-protein interactions and their impact on cellular signaling pathways.

**Title:** Paradoxical Effects of Optogenetic Manipulation on Cortical Interneuron Functions in the Auditory Cortex of Awake Mice

**Research Question:** Can optogenetic activation and inactivation of specific cortical interneuron types provide consistent insights into their computational roles in the auditory cortex?

**Methods:** We used single-unit recordings in the auditory cortex of awake mice to optogenetically manipulate somostatin-positive (S+) and parvalbum-positive (Pb+) interurons while recording responses to tones. We evaluated the effects of activation and inactivation on response gain, tuning, and information transfer.

**Findings:** Inactivation of S+ interurons increased response gain, while inactivation of P+ interurons weakened tuning and decreased information, implying these neurons support separable functions. However, activation of S+ and P interurons revealed no differences.

**Implications:** Our results challenge the notion that activation and inactivation will produce consistent insights into interurons' computational roles. We propose that small changes in parameters, such as spontaneous activity or light strength, determine whether activation and inactivation produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions about interurons functions.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the complexity of using causal strategies to gain insight into interuron functions. We demonstrate the importance of considering multiple factors, such as spontaneous activity and light strength, when interpreting optogenetic data. Our findings suggest that S and P interurons have distinct roles in the auditory cortex, but activation and inactivation do not reveal these differences. We propose a simple model to understand this asymmetry, showing how small changes in parameters can lead to paradoxical conclusions about interurons' functions.

**Title:** Entrainment of Oscillatory Activity in the Frontopari Network Enhances Working Memory Performance: A Causal Evidence from Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation

**Research Question:** Can transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) modulate oscillatory activity in the frontopetal network to enhance working memory (WM) performance, and what are the underlying neural mechanisms of this effect?

**Methods:** We used tACS to selectively entrain endogenous rhythms in the frontop network, a region known to support WM, while participants performed a verbal WM task. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to examine the effects ofACS on brain activity and connectivity.

**Findings:** Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously, fMRI revealed thatACS effects depended on the relative phase of stimulation and internal processing. Specifically, synchronousACS during WM increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Functional connectivity results showed that relative frontopetal stimulation influenced information flow within WM.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate a link between performance in demanding WM and large-scale synchronization across the frontop network. We show that manipulations ofACS modulate underlying activity and influence long-range connectivity in a phase- and state-dependent manner.

**Conclusions:** This study provides causal evidence for the role of oscillatory synchronization in WM performance and investigates the neural mechanisms of frontopetal phase influence on WM. Our results indicate that entraining activity within the frontop network enhances WM, modulates regional activity in a phase-dependent manner, and correlates with behavioral performance. Functional connectivity is modulated in a phase-dependent manner, with frontal interactions increasing with synchronous and posterior with desynchronous stimulation. This demonstrates the role of phase in cognitive WM processes and neural correlates.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Embryonic Polarity in Vertebrates: Uncovering Pitx as a Key Regulator of Axis Formation and Left-Right Asymmetry**

**Research Question:** How is embryonic polarity determined in vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, established, in contrast to invertebrates where it is largely specified by maternal determinants?

**Methods:** We employed a molecular screen to identify upstream regulators of cV1, a homologous to mammalian growth differentiation factor 1 (GDF1), a transforming growth factor beta (Tβ) expressed posteriorly before gastrulation, in chick embryos and manipulated to form twins. Bioinformatic analysis and embryological experiments revealed Pitx as a candidate transcription factor.

**Findings:** Pitx is essential for axis formation and acts as a direct regulator of c1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes. Additionally, Pitx, c1, and Nodal are key actors in left-right asymmetry, suggesting an ancient polarity mechanism co-opted to different functions during evolution.

**Implications:** Our results implicate Pitx as the earliest described gene to regulate embryonic axis and embryonic regulation/twinning. In contrast to invertebrates, where polarity is specified by maternal determinants, vertebrates retain a regulative model until gastrulation, suggesting localisation of maternal determinants is not essential.

**Conclusions:** Pitx, a transcription factor, is expressed in the same domain as c1 in whole embryos and bisected marginal zone, and before c1, making it a candidate for upstream regulator of c1. This study highlights Pitx as a key regulator of embryonic polarity and left-right asymmetry, shedding light on mechanisms of vertebrate development.

**Title:** Temporal Processing of Odor Gradients in the Fruit Fly Drosophila melanogaster: Unveiling the Role of Projection Neurons in Encoding Odor Dynamics

**Research Question:** How do projection neurons (PNs) in the fruit fly Dophila melanogaster process temporal variations in olfactory stimuli, and what is the significance of this processing in spatial orientation?

**Methods:** We subjected flies to precisely defined odor waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and PNs. We found a significant transformation between OS and PN patterns, with PNs strongly signaling OS rate and rate of change.

**Findings:** A simple two-dimensional model admitting OS rate and rate as inputs predicted PN output. When cascaded with rate-change encoding by OS, PNs primarily signal acceleration and rate of dynamic stimuli to brain, enabling animals to respond to odor onsets.

**Implications:** PNs relay olfactory information to higher centers, such as the mushroom body and lateral horn (Stocker et al., 1990). Recent studies reported OS encode not only concentration but also rate as a function of time (Kim et al, 201; Nagel and Wilson, 201). Our results support that PN rate is strongly dependent on rate of feedforward OS input, crucial for detecting and responding to odor plumes.

**Conclusions:** Dophila's olfactory system encodes acceleration of concentrations to brain, allowing early detection of onsets (Figure 4). This mechanism enables animals to detect odor at an early phase. Recent studies investigated dynamic stimuli in early olfactory systems (OS and PNs) and observed temporal processing (Bawat et al,200;effen et,200; Kim et,201; Nag and,201; Martelli,201). We hypothesize acceleration in antennal lobe allows higher centers to rapidly respond onsets of rising stimuli.

**Title:** Fertilization-Triggered Auxin Production and AGL62-Mediated Transport Drive Seed Coat Development in Flowering Plants

**Research Question:** How does fertilization initiate seed development in flowering plants, and what is the role of auxin and the MADS transcription factor AGL62 in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of auxin and AGL62 in seed development in Arabidopsis thaliana using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, including mutant analysis, transgenic lines, and biochemical assays.

**Findings:** Fertilization triggers auxin production in the endosperm, which is likely exported to the integuments, removing the Polycomb Group (Pc) protein block on seed coat development. AGL62 regulates auxin transport from endos to integuments, leading to seed coat development. Mutants for AGL62 have impaired auxin transport, resulting in seed abortion.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a dual role for post-fertilization auxin production in driving endosperm and seed development. AGL is involved in mediating both endperm and seed developmental pathways.

**Conclusions:** Fertilization of the central cell results in auxin production, which is exported to the integuments, lifting the Pc block on seed development, allowing elongation and differentiation. This process is dependent on A62 activity, as ag62 seeds fail to export aux from endos, leading to aux accumulation and failure to develop a coat.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Rules of Phage Receptor Protein Function: A High-Throughput Engineering of the T7 Bacteriophage Receptor Binding Protein (RBP) Domain

**Research Question:** Despite the crucial role of the bacteriophage receptor protein (RBP) in governing phage activity and host range, the molecular mechanisms of RBP function remain poorly understood. This study aimed to systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the T7 phage RBP domain by developing a high-throughput, locus-specific phage engineering method.

**Methods:** We employed ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Expression), a high-throughput, locus-specific ph genome engineering method to create a large, unbiased library of phage variants at a targeted locus. We comprehensively mutated the T7 RBP domain by making single amino acid substitutions at every site (166 variants) and quantified the functional role of variants on multiple hosts.

**Findings:** Our dataset allowed us to compare functional profiles across hosts and identify regions of functional importance, many of which were previously unknown. Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in physicochemical properties, revealing molecular adaptation to individual hosts. We discovered gain-of-function variants against hosts and host-restrict variants eliminated certain hosts.

**Implications:** This study presents a framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in phage-bacterial systems. Our results demonstrate the therapeutic utility of ORACLE by engineering T7 variants against a urinary tract pathogen, Escherichia coli. We explain the molecular drivers of adaptability of the domain and identify key regions determining activity and host range.

**Conclusions:** ORACLE can generate ph variants superior to wild-type phage, which can serve as starting points for further therapeutic ph engineering. Further experiments are required to assess in vivo efficacy of T7 variants. Phages are specialists that target a narrow range of hosts, unable to infect closely related hosts (Hy and Abed, 2010), suggesting directionality ph-bacterial interactions and orientational bias of the domain. Single amino substitutions can generate functional diversity, highlighting evolutionary adaptability RBP.

**Title:** Neural Basis of Unreliable Pitch Processing in Individuals with Congenital Amusia: A Functional MRI Study

**Research Question:** How do individuals with congenital amusia process pitch cues during speech perception, and what is the neural basis for their reliance on alternative dimensions such as duration?

**Methods:** Fifteen individuals with congenital amus and 15 controls participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Participants read sentences with indicated grammatical boundaries and then selected the best match between two spoken sentences that differed in pitch, duration, or both dimensions.

**Findings:** Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amus group between left frontal language-related regions and right hemisphere-related pitch regions, reflecting between-group differences in cue weights. These connectivity differences were not present during a control task.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked to functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism.

**Conclusion:** Individuals with congenital amus have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing, down-weighting pitch cues during speech perception and relying on other dimensions such as duration. We investigated the neural basis for this strategy using fMRI. Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked to functional connectivity between frontal and percept regions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism.

**Title:** Emergence of Devil Facial Tum 2 (DFT2): A Contagious Cancer Exploiting Histocompatibility between Tum and Host

**Research Question:** How does Devil Tum 2 (D2), a newly discovered contagious cancer in Tasman devil (Sarcus harris), exploit histocompatibility between tumour and host to facilitate its transmission?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules in D2 cells in vitro and in vivo, comparing them to Devilum 1 (D1), a more widespread cancer in Tasman devil.

**Findings:** Contrary to D1, D2 cells express MHC class I molecules, with dominant non-polymorphic, non-class MHC I molecules reducing immunogenicity. Classical MHC I allele with highest expression in D2 is shared among devils and wider population. MHC I expression varies among D2 tumours in vivo, suggesting subclones may emerge as D2 transmits.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that contagious cancers may exploit histocompatibility between tumour and host, and loss of allogenic antigens facilitate transmission. D2 may mimic evolutionary trajectory of D1.

**Conclusions:** D2 cells can pass between individuals without host immune response due to shared MHC I. Conditions facilitating emergence of two contagious cancers in this species are unknown. D2 express classical and non-class M I in vitro and vivo, unlike D1, which lost M I. D2 express non-polorphic, non-class M I reducing immunogenic. Classical M I allele highest in D2 shared with devils. M I varies among D2 tumours in vivo, suggesting subones may emerge as D transmits. Our results demonstrate D2 express M I, unlike D1 and contagious in dogs, CTV. Further analysis needed to define host response D2 and role in tumour evolution.

**Title:** Dissecting the Neural Codes of the Granular Retrosplenial Cortex: A Double Dissociation of Parallel Circuits for Spatial and Non-Spatial Behaviors**

**Research Question:** How do the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) processes spatial and non-spatial information, and what are the underlying neural mechanisms?

**Methods:** We employed optogenetic mapping in mice to investigate the neural circuits of the RSG, focusing on the layer 3, which contains two types of principal pyramidal neurons: low-rhease (LR) and regular-spiking (RS) cells. We examined the afferent inputs from the anterior thalam, dorsalic, clastrum, and anterioringulate cortices.

**Findings:** Our results reveal a double dissociation of parallel circuits in the superficial RSG, where LR cells receive spatial information from the thalamus and dorsalic, while RS cells are controlled by clastr and anterioring inputs. Precise subaminar and dendritic arborization in layer 1 enables parallel processing. Thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable LR neurons to compute speed of rotation, despite receiving direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of precise subamin organization of distinct neuronal subtypes and afferents in the RSG. LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the thalam and dorsalic, while RS cells are controlled by clastr and anterioring inputs. Synaptic dynamics of thamic inputs allow robust encoding of angular speed by LR cells, despite inputs only containing direction information.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the neural codes of the R, a critical for both spatial and nonpatial behaviors. Integration of parallel streams of information in downstream neurons within ipsilateral and contralateral granular and granular retrosial cortices is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of retrosial computations. Further research is needed to elucidate how these streams are integrated.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Seizures in Traumatic Brain Injury-Induced Tauopathy: A Novel Insights from a Zebraf Model

**Background:** Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for dementia, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), characterized by the prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates. However, the mechanisms underlying this process are not fully understood, partly due to the lack of tractable animal models.

**Research Question:** Do seizures play a role in the prion seeding and spreading of tauopathy after TBI?

**Methods:** We employed a novel zebraf model expressing a genetically encoded Tau biosensor to report accumulation of human Tau species seeded via intraventricular brain injections. Zebraf larvae were subjected to a TBI paradigm inducing cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. Application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued T-induced tauopathy and cell death.

**Findings:** Our data suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion seeding and spreading of tau following TBI. Bath application of dynamin or anticonvulsant drugs mitigated T-induced tauopathy and cell death.

**Implications:** These findings implicate seizures as a druggable mechanistic link between T and the pr-like progression of tauopathy. Our zraf model offers a potent complement to rodent models of T and cellular models of tauopathy, allowing us to reveal postumatic seizures as a mechanistic link between T and prion progression.

**Conclusions:** Our in vivo data reveal a burst of neural activity during T, and zraf larvae exposed to T exhibit a higher propensity for spontaneous seizures. TBI induces Tau aggregates in our biosensor model. Combining approaches, we found postumatic seizures strongly correlate with spreading pathology following T. Manipulating activity mitigated aggregation, revealing a role for endocyt in pr-like spread of seeds in vivo T. Results implicate seizures and endocyt in the spread of seeds, offering therapeutic targets.

**Future Directions:** zraf as a bridge organism in neurotra, postumatic seizures in our model led us to consider neural events during T and their bearing on correlation activity and tauopathy.

**Title:** Unraveling the Complexity of Brain Connectivity: The Role of Spatial Arrangement of Cortical Regions in Modelling Brain Function and Behavior

**Research Question:** How does the spatial arrangement of cortical regions interact with measures of brain connectivity, and how does it relate to trait variability in behavior and lifestyle across individuals?

**Methods:** We employed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the relationship between the spatial organization of functional regions and functional connectivity in the brain. We used partial correlation analysis (CCA) to disentangle the influence of spatial organization from coupling between neural populations.

**Findings:** Our results show that the shape and location of brain regions strongly interact with modelling brain connectivity, and that spatial arrangement of functional regions is predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. We found that cross-sub variations in spatial configuration of functional regions are often interpreted as changes in functional connectivity, highlighting the importance of understanding these effects when interpreting functional imaging data and cognitive traits.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that spatial organization of functional regions is a significant confound for studies of functional connectivity, and that disambiguating its influence enables estimation of fMRI measures that uniquely reflect coupling between neural populations. Recent advances in spatial alignment have tackled the issue of misalignment across individuals.

**Conclusions:** The organization of the brain into large-scale networks has been extensively investigated using resting-state fMRI. Spontaneous fluctuations in brain regions measured with fMRI show correlations, revealing patterns of functional connectivity (FC) (Biswal et al., 1995; Frist, 1994, 201). Our partial CCA results show network matrices contain unique trait-level cross-sub information not reflected in spatial organization of functional regions. The conceptualization of brain organization is relevant to interpretation of findings. The implication is that cross-sub information in adopted 'connectivity' largely reflects variability in location of regions rather than coupling strength, for methods mapping group-level parcellations onto data.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Role of TBP2 in Skeletal Muscle Regeneration and Gene Expression

**Research Question:** Does TBP2 play a crucial role in skeletal muscle regeneration and gene expression, as previously proposed, or is TBP the essential component of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated muscles?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of TBP and TBP2 in myotubes derived from C2C12 myoblasts and primary mouse satellite cells (MuSC), and analyzed the regeneration potential of T2 deficient mice. We also compared the RNA profile of Tbp and Tbp2 genes in MuSC isolated from skeletal muscles of wild-type mice and C2 myogenic cell line.

**Findings:** Our results show that TBP, not T2, is the essential component of PIC that promotes muscle expression in skeletal muscles. T2 is not expressed in myotubes from C2 mylast or primary MuSC. T2 deficient mice displayed intact regeneration, and Mu isolated from T deficient muscles differentiated into myubes with same efficiency as wild-type Mu.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate the lack of requirement of T2 for adult muscle regeneration, prompting us to compare RNA profile of Tbp and T2 genes in Mu isolated from skeletal muscles of wild-type mice and C myogenic cell line. T expression was detected in Mu-derived myubes and C12 myubes (Figure 2). Our results indicate that TBP is essential for muscle differentiation and absence of T2 in myubes suggest that TID complex may be present in myogenic and drive gene transcription during mylast into myubes.

**Conclusions:** We conclude that TBP, not T2, is required for muscle gene expression in skeletal muscles. T2 does not replace T during differentiation, as previously proposed. TID subunits and T are downregulated during myoblast differentiation, forming a complex detectable on muscle promoters essential for their expression. Our data demonstrate that TBP is essential for muscle expression, while T2 is not.

**Title:** Large-Scale Optogenetic Stimulation Modulates Excitability of Neural Circuits and Drives Neuroplasticity: Implications for Neurorehabilitation

**Research Question:** How does large-scale optogenetic stimulation modulate the excitability of neural circuits and drive neuroplasticity in the brain, and what are the implications for neurorehabilitation?

**Methods:** We used a large-scale optogenetic interface to simultaneously stimulate excitatory neurons and record electrocortic activity across primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M) cortex in macaques. We tracked two measures of network connectivity: the response to focal stimulation and baseline between pairs of electrodes, which were strongly correlated before stimulation. Within minutes, stimulation in S or M significantly strengthened functional connectivity between areas. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous changes across the network, reflecting correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in connectivity across the network, explained by a Hebb model of large-scale-induced plasticity. We found that stimulation-evoked activity drives large-scale plasticity in a Hebb manner, with significant implications for future neurorehab strategies.

**Implications:** This work extends Hebb plastic models to large circuits, with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation. Our findings support a key role for Hebb learning in sensorimotor cortical plasticity, but highlight the need for further study of intermediate timeframes and cortical mapping. The large interface enabled robust estimation of functional and stimulation-evoked correlations.

**Conclusions:** Large-scale optogen stimulation modulates excitability of neural circuits and drives neuroastic, with implications for neurorehab. Our results demonstrate a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in connectivity, consistent with Hebb plasticity. We show that stimulation-ev activity drives large-scale plasticity in a Hebb manner, informing future neurohab strategies. This work extends Hebb models to large circuits, supporting a key role for Hebb learning in sensorotor plasticity.

**Title:** Understanding the Neural Consequences of Primary Visual Cortex Lesions: A Case Study of a Rhes Macaque Monkey Born Without V1 and Implications for Rehabilitation

**Research Question:** What are the neural consequences of damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) on visual perception and behavior in ahes macaque monkey born without V1, and how can this understanding inform the development of rehabilitation methods?

**Methods:** We investigated ahes macaque monkey born without V1 using multi-modal imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the structure and function of visual areas outside the lesion. Visual stimulation with checkerboards and full-field dots activated the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvin, respectively, while visual cortical activation was sparse and included patches. Functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V/MT activation, even without V.

**Findings:** Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, we found little evidence for strengthened subort input to V/MT supporting residual function or blindsight phenomena. Visual structures both cortical and subort outside the lesion remained intact with little atrophy, suggesting a role in residual function consistent with an intact network of extrastate visual areas comparable to controls. Connectivity between subort regions and V/MT was weak, but microstructure intact.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that residual vision can manifest in different ways, including ability to determine information from faces, as seen in patient TN (Bur et al., 2013), which has been suggested to survive loss V. For motion stimuli, we saw activation in region V/ in dorsal ST of hemispheres, suggesting activation may be subthreshold and difficult to detect. Without strong visually-evoked V/ responses, we mapped a functional network of areas showing similar BOLD response to V/MT. Retinal information may reach dorsal areas via weak pathways LG and pul, but lack of consistent activation due to anesthesia makes question difficult. Lack of differences between S and controls in pathways LG-V/ and pul-V/ suggests either could support residual abilities.

**Conclusions:** This study provides insights into the neural consequences of primary cortex damage on visual perception and behavior inhes macaque born without V, informing the development of rehabilitation methods. Our findings suggest that residual vision can manifest in different ways, including ability to determine information from faces, and that retinal information may reach dorsal areas via weak pathways. The lack of significant differences between S and controls in pathways LG-V and pul-V suggests either could support residual abilities. These results have implications for the development of rehabilitation methods for patients with similar damage.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanism of Innate Immune Sensor IF16's Ability to Distinguish between Self and Foreign DNA in the Nucleus

**Research Question:** How does the innate immune sensor IF16 distinguish between self and foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA in the intracellular environment, particularly in the nucleus?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical and single-molecule techniques, including time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays, to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying IF16's ability to recognize and respond to foreign DNA.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that IF16 scans along exposed stretches of foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular platforms, while chromatin barriers prevent IF16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with this one-dimensional movement. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism enables IF16 to distinguish between self and foe and assemble oligomers efficiently on foreign DNA.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of innate immunity, resolving a long-standing question in immunology. We show that IF16's 1-diffusion mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating its immune responses, allowing a limited number of molecules to target large genomes of invading pathogens.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a unifying mechanism explaining IF16's central role in initiating foreign-dsensing pathways. We propose that 1-diff mediated assembly is essential for IF16's ability to distinguish self from foreign in the nucleus, and that chromatin acts as a key feature preventing IF16 from targeting host DNA. These findings have implications for understanding the innate immune system's ability to recognize and respond to pathogens, particularly in the context of viral infections such as herpes simplex-1.

**Title:** Spatially Targeted Optical Proteomics (ST): A Novel Technique for Interrogating Micron-Scale Regions of Interest in Mammalian Tissue without Genetic Manipulation

**Research Question:** Can a novel proteomics technique, Spatially Targeted Optical Proteomics (ST), be developed to interrogate micron-scale regions of interest (ROIs) in mammalian tissue without genetic manipulation, fixation, and formalin, or methanol?

**Methods:** Methanol-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, then soaked in solutions containing photo-tag 4-benzylbenz-glyc-histidine. Confocal imaging with two-photon excitation is used to covalently photo-tag all proteins within ROI to a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. After solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated by mass spectrometry.

**Findings:** As a test case, amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse and post-mortem case were examined, confirming known constituents and discovering new ones. ST can be applied to various samples, including cell lines, primary cultures, ex vivo, specimens, biopsy, and post-mort tissue.

**Implications:** ST offers single-mic-scale three-dimensional resolution, an order of magnitude better than current state-of-the-art LCM, providing clues to neurodegenerative disease etiology and advancing research in cell biology by yielding small features not amenable biochemical purification.

**Conclusions:** ST combines two-photon laser microscopy with photochemical labeling and mass spectrom, previously used in microscopic 3D-resolved photochemistry. The predominant photo-tagged protein is Aβ, not visible in non-plaque experiment due to low abundance. The photo-tag procedure uses two-ph microscopy, not conventional confocal microscopy. ST represents first application to affinity labeling, offering single-mic-scale resolution.

**Title:** Disruption of Frizzled3 (Fz) Gene Disrupts Axonal Growth and Survival in Motor Neurons: Implications for Planar Cell Polarity Signaling in Axon Guidance**

**Research Question:** How does the disruption of the Frizz3 (F) gene affect axonal growth and survival in motor neurons, and what is the role of planar cell polarity (PC) signaling in axon guidance?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of Frizz3 (F) gene disruption on axonal growth and survival in motor neurons in the VIIth and XII cranial nerves, phrenic nerve, and dorsal nerves of fore- and hindlimbs in mice. We analyzed the phenotypes of Fr3−/− limbs and found that dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the plexus, distinct from other axon-pathfinding mutants, and do not reroute to alternative trajectories. We also examined the fate of affected motor neurons and found that they die 2 days prior to normal developmental cell death, coinciding with innervation of muscle targets.

**Findings:** Our results provide in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. We found that the absence of Fr3 leads to specific stalling among LM axons in the limb, distinct from phenotypes produced by other signaling systems. Affected cranial and spinal neurons die shortly after axons stall, suggesting that growing axons receive essential survival signals from intermediate targets. We ruled out aberrant pathfinding as the primary cause of motor deficiency in Fr3−− mice, as most axons do not follow erroneous trajectories.

**Implications:** Our findings implicate planar cell polarity (PC) signaling in axon growth and highlight the role of PC proteins in cell-cell complexes in epithelia in dynamic axonal growth. We propose that controlling ax growth may be the primary function of Fr3 in motor neurons, as a subset of motor neurons exhibit both ax growth defects and apoptotic death in Fr− embryos. Our results support the model of neuronal survival factors produced by intermediate targets along ax's trajectory, as suggested by in vitro co-culture experiments.

**Conclusions:** Disruption of the Frizz (F) gene disrupts axonal growth and survival in motor neurons, highlighting the importance of planar polarity signaling in axon guidance. Our findings provide evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long axons are programmed to die unless axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule, and that growing axons receive essential signals from targets for survival. These results have implications for understanding axon guidance and neuronal development, and the role of PC proteins in cell-cell complexes in epithelia.

**Title:** Elucidating the Regulatory Roles of Transposable Elements in Early Embryonic and Extraembry Lineages of the Mouse Embryo

**Research Question:** Do transposable elements (TEs) play a significant role in establishing gene regulatory networks in embryonic and extraembry lineages of the early mouse embryo?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of epigenomic, transcriptomic, and genetic editing approaches to investigate the function of a set of terminal TE families as enhancers in mouse embryonic trophlast cells. Epigen and transcript data suggested that a large number of TEs contribute to tissue-specific gene expression. Genetic editing of individual T confirmed a subset of regulatory relationships. Furthermore, CRISPR interference of RL13 elements in embryonic cells revealed that only a minority play significant roles in regulation.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that a subset of TEs are crucial for gene regulation in early mouse development, highlighting the importance of functional experiments evaluating regulatory roles of TEs. Notably, other T play minor or no role in regulation, despite strong evidence at chromatin composition and conformation. To test regulatory roles of multiple enhancers in ESCs, we performed CRIS interference at RL13 elements. Data align with chrom accessibility suggest TE enh may support lineage-specific expression subset genes. However, correlations may emerge absence causal links T and expression. Directly test functional role TE enh in regulation, we performed CR-mediated excision selected T.

**Implications:** Our study identifies a number T that drive expression lineage-specific genes, underscoring the complexity of TE regulation in early development. Extensive work necessary evaluate proportion TE act redundant with other elements. In contrast, epetic work Wysock lab revealed large LTRH elements significant regulation nearly genes human carcinoma line (Fuentes et al., 2018).

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that a subset of T are important for gene regulation in early mouse development, emphasizing the need for functional evaluation regulatory roles T. Our findings suggest that T may support lineage-specific expression subset genes, while others play minor or no role in regulation, underscoring the complexity of TE regulation in early development.

**Title:** Unraveling the Complex Evolution of C4 Photosynthesis: A Polyphyletic Origins and Flexible Trajectories

**Research Question:** How did C4 photosynthesis evolve independently in at least 60 plant lineages, and what are the underlying evolutionary drivers of this complex trait?

**Methods:** We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing C3, C4, or intermediate C3-C forms of photosynthesis to parameterize a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. We developed and experimentally verified a novel Bayesian approach based on hidden Markov model to predict the evolution of C4 phenotype.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. We found that the order of C trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers, facilitated by ancestral and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the emergence of C4 phenotype is not solely driven by photosynthetic pressures, but rather by non-photosynthetic drivers. This flexibility has facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex trait. We propose that early evolutionary events determined downstream phenotypes of C sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to have arisen in lineages: C photosynthesis. We conclude that distinct sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative evolutionary responses to non-photosynthetic pressures. The mechanistic diversity underlying multiple pathways generating C photos may be key in facilitating convergent evolution of complex traits. This has implications for efforts to recapitulate acquisition of C photos through genetic engineering of C species, expanding the molecular toolbox to establish C traits in distinct backgrounds.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Nucleotide Specificity in the Function of SpoIVA, a Bacterial Cytoskeletal Protein

**Research Question:** How does the specificity of nucleotide hydrolysis influence the function of SpoIVA, a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that polymerizes during Bacillus subtilis sporulation?

**Methods:** We reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity, creating SpoAGase, and investigated its function in vitro and in vivo. We also examined the effects of varying concentrations of ATP and GTP on SpoIVA and SpoAGase polymerization.

**Findings:** SpoAGase functioned as a GTPase but failed to polymerize due to lack of NDP intermediate formation required for polymerization. Incubation with ATP did not promote polymerization, indicating that nucle base specificity, not just energy from hydrolysis, is crucial for function. Spo and SpoAG polymerized in presence of ATP, but not GTP, suggesting specific requirement for nucle base. Physiological levels of intracellular ATP, not GTP, facilitated conformation changes in Spo and SpoAG. Both Spo and Spo failed to undergo hydrolysis-mediated changes in presence 0.06 mM GTP, but did so in 1.5 mM ATP.

**Implications:** This study reveals that nucle specificity of hydrolysis is critical for Spo function, not just energy released from hydrolysis. Increased levels of ATP relative to G at end of sporulation may have driven the change in nucle preference in Spo from GTP to ATP.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that nucle specificity of hydrolysis, in addition to energy, plays a key role in biological functions. Spo, a cytoskeletal protein that polymerizes during Bacillus subtil sporulation, has evolved to use ATP instead of GTP, likely due to selective pressure of physiological levels of intracellular ATP during sporulation. This study highlights the importance of considering nucle specificity of hydroly in understanding protein function and evolution.

**Title:** Long-term Consequences of Early Leptin Signaling Deficiency on Metabolic and Neuroendocrine Development

**Research Question:** What are the long-term effects of early leptin signaling deficiency on metabolic and neuroendocrine development, particularly during critical periods of growth and development?

**Methods:** To investigate the role of leptin in early life, we restored leptin signaling at the 4th or 10th week of age in mice null for the leptin receptor (LepR) gene. We examined the consequences of early leptin deficiency and reactivation in adulthood on metabolic and neuroendocrine development.

**Findings:** We found that defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal leptin deficiency, such as poor arcuate nucleus projections, were recovered by Lep reactivation in adulthood. However, Lep deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. Lep reactivation in adulthood led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cart, and Prlh expression and defects in reproductive and growth systems.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems. Changes in leptin signaling during development may affect the organization of neural circuits regulating energy homeostasis, favoring metabolic diseases later in life. Leptin may be involved in developmental programming (Ravski and Horvath, 2015). Early postnatal lept block in rats leads to long-term lept resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity (Att et al, 2008; Licio et al,200; Donato et,201).

**Conclusions:** The importance of lept signaling during development for long-term homeostasis and aspects regulated by lept is not fully understood. Our study uncovers the long consequences of absence leptin in early life. Lep deficiency leads to reduced brain mass, disruption of projections from AR neurons to paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PV), behavioral and cognitive problems. Our findings contribute to understanding metabolic programming of metabolic, neuroend, and developmental consequences from absence leptin in life, especially in context of alarming childhood obesity worldwide (Cunningham et,201).

**Title:** Heterotrimeric G Proteins Regulate Arabidopsis Immune Signaling through Pre- and Post-Activation Mechanisms**

**Research Question:** How do heterotrimer G proteins regulate Arabidopsis immune responses to bacterial flagellin epitope flg22?

**Methods:** We employed biochemical and genetic approaches to investigate the role of heterotrimer G proteins XL2, AGB, and AG/2 in Arabidopsis immune responses to fl22.

**Findings:** Prior to fl22 activation, XL2 directly interacts with F2 and B1, forming a complex that attenuates proteas-mediated degradation of B1, ensuring optimal signaling competence. Upon fl22 stimulation, XL2 dissociates from A1 and is phosphorylated by B1 in the N-terminus, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by modulating NADPH oxidase Rho.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that heterotrimer G proteins are directly coupled to the F2-B1 receptor and regulate signaling through pre- and post-activation mechanisms. Introduction of a transgenic copy of B1 restores fl22-triggered responses and disease resistance in x2 ag1 mutants, highlighting the importance of heterotrimer G in maintaining F2-B1 competence.

**Conclusions:** Heterotrimer proteins dynamically interact with the F2-B1 complex during F2 signaling, consistent with observed defects in fl22 responses and Rho phosphorylation in G mutants. Our findings support plant kinases acting as GPCRs by coupling to heterotrimer proteins, subject to multiple regulations during F2 signaling.

**Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of the Arabidopsis Circadian Clock: Single-Cell Oscillations and Cell-to-Cell Coupling across the Plant

**Research Question:** How does the Arabidopsis circadian clock regulate gene expression across the day-night cycle, and what is the level of robustness of the clock in individual cells, and how is timing coordinated across the plant?

**Methods:** We examined the activity of the Arabidopsis circadian clock at the single-cell level across Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions using a reporter for the core gene CIRCAD CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CA1) (Wang and Tob, 1998).

**Findings:** Our data reveal robust single oscillations, albeit desynchronized, with two waves of clock activity, one up and down the root, and evidence of cell-to-cell coupling, especially in the root tip. A simple model shows that cell-to-cell coupling and measured differences in period between cells can generate the observed waves in gene expression.

**Implications:** Our results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralized mammalian clock, the Arabid clock has multiple coordination points. We estimate the strength of coupling between cells and find evidence of strong coupling, especially in the root. A simple model suggests that observed differences in period plus cell-to-cell coupling can generate the observed waves in clock expression.

**Conclusions:** Our data reveal both the structure and robustness of the plant circadian system. However, our results suggest that the structure of the clock is more complicated, as the hierarchical model does not explain observed short oscillations in the tip or wave of expression from the root. Our results support a decentralized model of coordination in plants (Endo, 2016; Endo et al, 2014). Our findings are consistent with previous studies arguing that oscillations are uncoupled (Thain et al,2012) and provide new insights into the dynamics of the Arabid clock at single resolution.

**Key Findings:**

* Single-cell oscillations are robust and desynchronized
* Two waves of clock activity, one up and down the root
* Evidence of cell-to-cell coupling, especially in the root
* Simple model shows cell-to-coupling and period differences can generate waves
* Decentralized model of coordination in plants supported
* Uncoupled oscillations consistent with previous studies

**Title:** Identifying Neural Biomarkers for Multitalker Speech Intelligibility in Adults with Clinically Normal Hearing

**Research Question:** Can we develop objective physiological markers to predict multalker intelligibility in adults with clinically normal hearing?

**Methods:** We conducted a study involving over 100,000 participants with clinically normal hearing, who visited a clinic due to reduced hearing difficulties. We used a combination of behavioral and physiological tests, including temporal processing, pupil-indexed listening, and frequency modulation (FM) cues measured by ear EEG recordings to assess multalker intelligibility.

**Findings:** We found that multalker intelligibility varied widely in clinically normal adults, but could be predicted by neural-locking to FM cues. Combining temporal processing, pupil-indexed listening, and FM accounted for 78% of variability in multalker intelligibility. We identified bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multalker perception, which can inform next-generation clinical tests for hearing disorders.

**Implications:** Our study provides a battery of behavioral and physiological tests that account for nearly 80% of variability in multalker intelligibility without linguistic cues. This addresses the need for new diagnostic and interventions for the majority who struggle to follow conversations in noisy environments and avoid clinical care for hearing difficulties.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest a strong association between psychophysical tests for FM detection and speech-noise intelligibility, attributed to early auditory encoding cues. The correlation between low FM encoding and intelligibility may reflect fast processing fidelity and intelligibility. We aim to develop objective markers for complaints of poor communication in clinically normal hearing individuals.

**Title:** Non-invasive Visualization of Microvascular Network in the Mammalian Retina using Adaptive Optics and Ultrafast Imaging

**Research Question:** How can we noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow in the mammalian retinal circulation, overcoming the limitations of traditional imaging techniques that blur microscopic capillaries and blood cells?

**Methods:** We employed adaptive optics (AOS) imaging with an ultrafast camera to nonvasively image blood cells in the C57/BL6 mouse retina, a widely used research animal model, without surgery or contrast agents. We developed an automated analysis pipeline to measure millions of blood speeds in vessels of varying diameters (3.2-45.8µm).

**Findings:** We achieved single-cell velocity flow in the smallest to largest vessels, measuring 4 orders of magnitude (0.0001-1.55µL/min, without contrast agents. Our ultrafast imaging and automated analysis enabled high-throughput measurement of hundreds of thousands of cells per second.

**Implications:** This study addresses a long-standing challenge in mammalian retinal imaging, enabling noninvasive measurement of blood flow in vessels containing thousands of cells per second. Our approach is directly applicable to clinical applications using the same instrumentation. We innovated imaging strategies and algorithms to image blood nonvas in smallest to largest vessels (3.2-45.8µ) without exogenous agents.

**Conclusions:** Our noninvasive retinal imaging may serve as a window to understanding microcirculation in CNS and systemic health. Combined capabilities enabled single-cell resolution in tight and spars formations (Gvara-Tres et al., 2016). We measured sub-mic precision lumen diameters and imaged near-infrared backscatter without dye injections. In total, 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied.

**Title:** Deciphering the Mechanisms of Symbiotic Fate Discrimination between Phosphate-Acquiring Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (AM) and Nitrogen-Fixing Root Nodule Symbiosis: A Role of Symb Receptor Kinase (SYK)

**Research Question:** What are the mechanisms that discriminate between phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis, and what is the role of Symb receptor kinase (SYK) in these processes?

**Methods:** We employed ectopic expression of receptor-like genes Nod Factor Receptor 1 (N1), N5, and SYK in Lotus japonicus to initiate nodule organogenesis and nodulation gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Overexpression of N1 or N5 associated with endogenous SYK in roots revealed that dominant SYK initiates signalling independently of N1 or N5 and upstream a set of genes required for generation of calcium-spiking in both symbes.

**Findings:** Overexpression of SYK, but not N, triggered expression of AM-related genes, indicating SY plays a key role in the decision between AM or root nodule symbiosis development. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed SYK associated with N1 and N, but not unrelated EF receptor EFR, demonstrating SYK interaction with Ns. SYK-mediated signalling specificity may be explained by complex formation of SYK with N and N, and Lys-kinases that mediate recognition of signals from AM, resulting in release of negative regulatory mechanisms or unbalanced stoichiometry of SY and putative negative regulators of AM and nodule symb signalling.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that SY plays a crucial role in discriminating between AM and nodule symbiosis, and that SY-mediated signalling is independent of N or N. The discovery of SY-N association in the absence of nod factor highlights the importance of SY in nodule development. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of symbiotic fate discrimination and the role of SY in plant-microbe interactions.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals that SY is indispensable for the development of AM and nodule symbiosis, and that SY-mediated signalling is independent of N or. The discovery of SY-N association in the absence nod factor highlights the importance of SY in nodule development. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of symbiotic discrimination and the role of SY in plant-micro interactions. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of SY-mediated signalling and its role in plant-micro interactions.

**Title:** DeepPose: A Novel Software Toolkit for Fast and Accurate Animal Pose Estimation using Deep Learning

**Research Question:** Can we develop a novel software toolkit, DeepPose, that addresses the limitations of current animal pose estimation methods in speed and robustness using an efficient multi-scale deep learning model, StackedNet, and a GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for keypoint estimation with sub-pixel precision?

**Methods:** We introduce DeepPose, a user-friendly software that leverages state-of-the-art individual pose estimation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve fast inference without compromising accuracy or generalizability. Our novel pose model, StackedNet, outperforms existing models in accuracy (Figure 3; Figure—supplement 1). The code, documentation, and examples of our software are freely available at https://github.com/graving/deepose under a permissive open-source license.

**Findings:** DeepPose significantly improves processing speed (>2x) with no loss in accuracy compared to current methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our method with challenging pose tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals. Our work reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and broadens applicability across the sciences.

**Implications:** Our advances could lead to larger, higher-resolution, reliable datasets revolutionizing understanding relationships between behavior, brain, and environment.

**Conclusion:** We present DeepPose, a toolkit for automatically measuring animal posture from images. Achieving fast pose using CNNs relies on parallel processing large batches or downsampling, increasing error. Our Stacked model, with batch one, runs at ∼30–110 Hz, depending on resolution (Appendix—figure1b). In contrast, computer vision methods, deep-learning can achieve human-level accuracy by annotating data and training a CNN to estimate body parts directly (Figure).

**Title:** Disruption of Glycolytic Flux Triggers NLRP-Mediated Inflammatory Signaling and Pyroptosis in Murine Macrophages

**Research Question:** How do innate immune cells, such as macrophages, sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens and trigger inflammatory responses?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of glycolytic flux in NLR3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1 production, and pyptosis in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) challenged with the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimur.

**Findings:** Disruption of glycol flux resulted in a drop in NAD levels, induction of mitochondrial ROS, and activation of NLR3 inflamome, leading to IL-1 production and pyptosis. This effect was rescued by addition of products that restore NAD production. Importantly, typhur infection impaired NAD production, resulting in mitochondrial ROS formation essential for NLR3 inflamome activation, revealing a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and inflammation.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that innate cells sense metabolic perturbation through glycol pathway, activating N3 to initiate inflammatory responses. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and tyur effectively limited glycol through distinct mechanisms, resulting in N3-mediated inflamome formation and pypt.

**Conclusions:** Disruption glycol flux is a mechanism by which innate cells sense homeostasis during tyur infection and induce pro-inflammatory response via N3 inflamome and pypt death. Functionally, cells sense metabolic perturbation as danger, resulting inflamome, caspase-1 activation, and cytokine secretion. Supplementation of glycol product pyruate resulted in significant reductions casp-1, IL-1 secretion, and death. Pyruate had no effect on inflam signaling by N3 activators, indicating pyru does not impair N3 inflam by nonspecific mechanism.

**Title:** Unveiling the Critical Role of PALB2 in Homologous Directed Repair (HDR) through DNA Binding and Interactions**

**Research Question:** How does the PAL2 protein, a partner of BRCA1 and BR2, contribute to homologous directed repair (HDR) and interact with chromatin proteins, and what is the functional significance of its DNA binding?

**Methods:** We investigated the DNA-binding sites of PAL2 and its impact on RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency in cells. We also examined the role of PAL2's N-terminal DNA-binding domain (NDB) in stimulating RAD51 recombinase activity and strand exchange reactions.

**Findings:** We identified a major DNA-binding site of PAL2, which reduces RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency by 50%. PAL2's NDB stimulates RAD51 recombinase activity, including strand exchange without RAD51, and can use RNA as a substrate. Our data reveal PAL2's versatile interaction with DNA and highlight its critical role in chromosome repair.

**Implications:** PAL2's interaction with DNA is crucial for BR2 and RAD51 recruitment to DSBs and efficient repair in cells. PAL2 NDB stimulates RAD51-mediated strand exchange in vitro. Our results demonstrate PAL2's novel activity and importance in DNA maintenance.

**Conclusion:** PAL2, a partner of BR1 and BR2, is a tumor suppressor linked to malignancies, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. It coordinates BR1 and BR2 during HDR and interacts with chromatin proteins. However, the role of PAL2's DNA binding is poorly understood. Our study reveals a major DNA-binding site of PAL2, which reduces RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency by 50%. PAL's NDB stimulates RAD51 recombinase activity, including strand exchange without RAD51, and can use RNA as a substrate. Our data demonstrate PAL's versatile interaction with DNA and highlight its critical role in chromosome repair.

**Research Question:** How are actin-like proteins assembled, and what is the arrangement of their protofilaments?

**Methods:** We investigated the prokary actin homologue Mre from Caulobacter cresus using in vitro and in vivo experiments, including crystallography, cryo-EM, and site-directed mutagenesis.

**Findings:**

1. We show that Caulacter Mre protoaments form antiparallel pairs in vitro and in vivo.
2. Crystal structures reveal antipar protoaments of Caulacter Mre.

**Title:** Divergence in the Pleiotropic Floral Regulator APETALA1 (AP) Contributes to Species-Specific Petal Robustness in Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine huta

**Research Question:** What is the genetic basis for the difference in petal robustness between Arabidopsis thalian and Cardamine huta?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA (AP) in the divergence of petal number between the two species using a combination of genetic and molecular approaches.

**Findings:** Our results show that divergence in AP1 accounts for the species-specific difference in petal robustness. The effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions, where A. thalian AP masks the phenotypic expression of petal QTL in C. huta, conferring robustness. In contrast, C. huta AP fails to complement this function of A. th AP, conferring variable petal number. Regulatory regions of AP contribute to this divergence, and pet number is maintained in C.uta despite standing genetic variation in accessions producing four-pet flowers.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that AP divergence exposed cryptic genetic variation in Cuta that contributes to variable pet number within accessions. AP is a major regulator of A flower development, acting early to initiate and specify organs. We identified AP as a gene of effect in the transition from robust four-petaled A. th to variable pet in C.uta. However, AP polymorphisms do not directly contribute to within-species variation Cuta pet number. Instead, decimation of pet in A reflects robustness to genetic variation. Complementing AP mutants with AP genomic from Cuta mimicked variable pet found Cuta, suggesting hidden variability in the regulatory network controlling pet number A.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of AP in the evolution of petal robustness between species. AP is a key regulator of flower development, and its divergence contributes to species-specific petal number. Our findings have implications for understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation and the evolution of complex traits.

**Title:** Misfolding of Proins via Disulfide Complexes: An Early Event Associated with Prediabetes and Worsening β-cell Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes

**Research Question:** How does the misfolding of proins via disulfide complexes contribute to the development of prediabetes and worsening β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes?

**Methods:** We investigated the biosynthesis of insulin and its critical role in metabolic homeostasis, focusing on the folding of proins and formation of evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. We analyzed pancreatic islets from human and rodent models with perturbed endoplasmic reticulum environment, genetically obese mice with wild-type islets, and leptin-deficient mice.

**Findings:** Our results show that normal islets contain a subset of proins molecules with at least one free cystine thiol, while human or rodent islets with perturbed endoplasmic reticulum environment exhibit non-proins intermolecular disulf-linked complexes. In genetically obese mice with wild-type islets, disulf-linked complexes of proins are more abundant, and in leptin-deficient mice, the increase of such complexes tracks the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. Proins-Cys (19) and Cys (20) are necessary and sufficient for the formation of proins disulf-linked complexes, and proins-Cys (19)-Cys (19) covalent homimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting a structural basis for aberrant proins complex formation.

**Implications:** We conclude that increased proins misolding via disulf-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens β-cell dysfunction in type 2. Our findings establish that proins misolding includes the inability to successfully complete its internal disulf bonds, a subfraction of proins molecules in the ER bearing unpaired cystine residues. This population improperly folded proins molecules enters aberrant disulf-linked partnerships with proins in ER, resulting in misfolded proins complexes first identified in human islets.

**Conclusions:** The presence of aberrant disulf-linked proins complexes in β-cells of human islets and model systems in states alter the ER environment and T2 progression prior onset of β-cell differentiation or death. We examined proins in islet lysates of additional predi Lepdb mice, all similar to islets of animals in Figures 4 and 6 weeks age with blood glucose levels 101 and 118 mg/dL, containing large state proulin seen Western blotting SDSAGE with >90 molecules entangled disulf-linked dimers higher complexes seen Western blot nonreducing SDSAGE.

**Title:** The Nucleic Acid-Binding Activity of SUVH1 Contributes to Heterochrom Assembly and Targeting

**Research Question:** How does SUVH, a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3)-specific methyltransferase, target perentric regions and assemble heterochatin in the absence of pre-existing H3me?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of SUVH's chromodomain (CD) in recognizing trimethylated H3 (Hme3) and its ability to bind nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA.

**Findings:** We found that SUVH's CD (SUVH-CD) binds nucleic acids, with higher affinity for RNA than DNA, and its ability to bindic is independent of H3me recognition. SUVH bound major satellite RNAs in vivo, and knockdown of satellite RNAs lowered SUVH retention on perentric. Mutational studies indicated that both nucleic-binding and Hme-binding activities of SUV-CD were crucial for perentric heterochatin assembly.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that chrom-bound RNAs contribute to SUVH's target specificity and retention on chromosomal regions. SUV's nucleic-binding activity integrates with its recognition of methylated H to establish and maintain SUV-mediated perentric heterochatin, such as Hme formation, HP accumulation, and transcriptional repressive status.

**Conclusions:** SUVH's nucleic-binding activity cooperates with its recognition of methylated H to establish and maintain SUV-mediated perentric heterochatin. Chrom-bound RNAs contribute to SUV's targeting and retention on chromosomal regions. SUV's RNA-binding also contributes to its stable association with H-rich perentric regions. Our findings highlight the importance of SUV's nucleic activity in heterochatin assembly and targeting, beyond its lysine methyltransferase activity.

**Title:** Decoding Position in Space: Grid Cells in the Entorhinal Cortex Respond to Covert Attention without Physical Movement

**Research Question:** Do grid cells in the entorinal cortex require physical movement to elicit spatially structured receptive fields, or can they be activated by covert attention?

**Methods:** We recorded neuronal activity from 141 neurons in the entorinal cortex of two rhes macaque monkeys performing a covert attention task, where they maintained central fixation while attending to a small dot moving in the periphery. Monkeys performed the task with >70% accuracy, with most errors due to saccades outside the fixation window.

**Findings:** We identified a significant population (20/14%, p<0.05) of entorinal cells with spatially structured fields, contrasting with recordings in the hippocampus where grid-like representations were not observed. Our results provide evidence that entor cells in macaque do not rely on physical movement.

**Implications:** Our findings support the hypothesis that grid cells participate in a range of cognitive functions, as attention is an important control for mental processes (Peters and Posner, 2012). Grid cells may be activated by movements of attention, not just physical movement.

**Conclusions:** Activation of entor cells with spatially firing fields does not require physical movement through environment. Previous studies demonstrated stationary grid cells can be activated by eye movements as monkeys explore complex scenes (Killian et al, 2012). Our results provide strong evidence that entor cortex can represent not only gaze but locus of attention in general. The neural substrate for overt and covert attention is largely overlapping (Corbetta et al,199).

**Title:** Establishing Reproducibility in Rodent Behavior: A Standardized Task for Decision-Making in Mice Across Laboratories**

**Research Question:** Can a standardized task for decision-making in mice be reproduced across multiple laboratories, and what are the implications for reproducibility in neuroscience?

**Methods:** We developed a perceptual value-based decision-making task for head-fixed mice and standardized training protocol, hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries and collected 5 million choices into a publicly available database.

**Findings:** Learning was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, past successes, and failures, and estimates of stimulus probability to guide choices.

**Implications:** These results reveal that complex behavior can be reproduced across laboratories, establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior and providing an unprecedented dataset and open tools to study decision-making in mice. They indicate a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through open-science approaches.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the feasibility of reproducible rodent behavior across laboratories, suggesting a path toward improving reproducibility in neuroscience. By adopting identical equipment and protocols, mice learned the task in all laboratories, and performed comparably after learning. Mice in laboratories adopted comparable reliance on visual stimuli, past, successes, and estimates to guide choices. To facilitate reproducibility, we adopt an open science approach, sharing hardware, software, and protocols. Our results provide a large cohort of mice trained in task, demonstrating reproducible methods and results across laboratories.

**Significance:** Physiological studies of decision are increasingly carried out in mice to leverage genetic, imaging, and physiological tools for brains. Our collaboration aims to explore neural basis of behavior in multiple laboratories, enabling comparison of results, knowing differences unlikely due to behavior. We hope these resources catalyze new adaptations and variations, accelerating use in high-quality, reproducible studies of neural correlates decision.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Standardized task for decision-making in mice is reproducible across laboratories
* No significant differences in behavior after learning across laboratories
Mice rely on visual, past, successes, and estimates to guide choices
Open science approach facilitates reproducibility

**Title:** Deciphering the Mechanisms of Digestive System Regeneration: A Comprehensive Atlas of Gene Expression and Cell Types in the Planarian Intestine

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the regeneration and function of the digestive system in animals, and how are they conserved across species?

**Methods:** We employed laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to characterize the intestinal transcriptome of Schmidtea mediterrane, a planarian flatworm capable of regenerating organs, including the gut.

**Findings:** We identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression undetected by previous approaches, revealing extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. Spatial LC enabled us to uncover previously unrecognized regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, especially intestinal goblet cells. We identified two intestine-enrich transcription factors specifically regulating regeneration (hedgehog effector gli-1) or maintenance (RE2) of goblet cells.

**Implications:** This work provides resources for further investigation of mechanisms in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration. We identified 22 intestine-enrich transcription factors, including required for production/maintenance of gob cells, setting stage for studies of this type. The planarian transcriptome is a resource for investigating aspects of regeneration and physiology.

**Conclusions:** Characterization of the planarian transcript provides a framework for next steps. We developed methods for applying LC to planarian tissue, defining expression and types in intestine (Figure 9-). The intestine expresses genes in metabolism, storage, transport, immunity, and other roles, demonstrating homology with digestive systems other, including humans. A detailed description of cell facilitates studies of types. We identified factors gli-1 and RE2, RNAi phenotypes suggesting distinct mechanisms differentiation and maintenance goblet. Evolutionary conservation of expression and physiological roles by human organs consolidated in planarian. Definition transcript enables identification genes for regeneration and distinct cell types.

**Title:** Divergent Sensory Mechanisms in Mormyrid Fish: A Novel Coding of Electric Signals through Oscillatory Synchrony**

**Research Question:** How do evolutionary adaptations in sensory perception relate to physiological coding of stimuli in mormyrid fish, and what mechanisms underlie the divergence in sensory capabilities?

**Methods:** We investigated the peripheral coding of electric signals in mormrid fish, which communicate through species-specific electric discharges (EOD) with variable interpulse intervals (I). We compared the responses of two types of receptors: spiking, sensitive to waveform variations, and oscillating, producing spontaneous oscillatory potentials.

**Findings:** Oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes timing and location, but not waveform. These receptors are sensitive to frequencies found in collective signals of conspecifics, correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. In contrast, spiking receptors are specialized for detecting signals from individuals.

**Implications:** Our findings provide the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony, a novel mechanism where receptors with spontaneous oscillatory activity respond to stimuli with phase resets, resulting in transient synchrony across the population. The degree of synchrony provides information about pulse timing, but not waveform, consistent with the inability of fish to behaviorally detect EOD variation.

**Conclusions:** We hypothesize that divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments. The oscillatory mechanism may be an adaptation for detecting signals from groups, while spiking for detecting from individuals. Oscillatory activity is widespread in neural networks, and may facilitate detection of signals from large groups. Behavioral experiments demonstrated that species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond IPIs within receptor sensitivity range, while spiking receptors did not. This novel coding mechanism may represent an adaptation for communication from groups.

**Title:** Structural Insights into the Bacterophage BPP-1: Unveiling the Cryo-Electron Microscopy Structure of its Head at 3.5 Å Resolution and Implications for Phage Display Engineering**

**Research Question:** What is the three-dimensional structure of the bacteriophage BPP-1 and how does it relate to its capsid formation and phage engineering?

**Methods:** We employed single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to determine the 3D structure of BPP-1 at ∼ 3.5 Å resolution and constructed an atomic model of its head.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that BPP-1 adopts two characteristic folds of major viral lineages: jellyroll for its capsid protein (CP) and HK97-like for major capsid protein (MCP). Strikingly, the topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted from the Johnson fold previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. We show that β-sheet and electrostatic interactions contribute to non-covalent chain formation in B-1, unlike coval interprotein linkages in HK97. Despite these interactions, both CP and MCP termini are positioned for DGR-based phage engineering.

**Implications:** The atomic description of B-1 will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal nonval molecular interactions conducive to stable capsid formation and clarify evolutionary relationships B- MCP and CP with other viruses.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first 3D structure of B- at ∼ 3.5 Å resolution and sheds light on its capsid formation and evolutionary relationships with other viruses. The non-circular perm topology of MCP is a feasible alternative to the known HK topology, and β-sheet and electrostatic interactions contribute to nonval chain formation. These findings have implications for phage engineering and our understanding of viral evolution.

**Title:** Elucidating the Dynamics of Dengue Virus (DENV) Adaptation to Host Environments through Serial Passage in Human and Mosquito Cell Lines: Insights into the Role of Beneficial and Deleterious Mutations

**Research Question:** How do Dengue virus (DENV) populations adapt to different host environments, and what are the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population?

**Methods:** We employed serial passage of DENV in human and mosquito cell lines and estimated the effects of single-nucleotide variants in these populations using ultra-deep sequencing. This allowed us to determine the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed that the continuous influx of a large burden of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations, shaping the path of adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and cluster in defined regions of the genome. These phenotypically redundant alleles facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. Importantly, the evolutionary constraints described in our system mirror observed across DENV and Zika strains, indicating recapitulating key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term evolution.

**Implications:** Our findings quantify the cost of deleterious mutations across the DENV genome, highlighting negative selection shaping diversity in viral populations. Understanding how functional and structural features shape these patterns and contribute to overall fitness will be interesting. Examples illustrate our ability to recapitulate and identify shifts in DM to uncover mechanisms of selection and adaptation operating on DENV populations in cells and host. Clusters of adaptive mutations in regions of DENV suggest elements targeted by selection in host.

**Conclusions:** Adaptation relies on host-specific mutations clustered in regions of DENV and enriched in regions of proteome exhibit structural flexibility. We used CirSeq to characterize fitness landscapes DENV adapting to distinct cellular machineries human and mosquito by tracing allele trajectories for all single nucleotide variants across D genome. This reveals influence of positive and negative shaping evolutionary paths D in environments. Notably, beneficial mutations clustered at specific locations, suggesting adaptation relies on hotspots of host selection. Further, we mapped allele values on three-dimensional structure of DENV E, a well-studied transmembrane protein forming outer layer of envelope.

**Title:** Membrane Nanodomains Regulate Ras Signaling by Dictating KRas12 Diffusion and Trafficking in U2OS Cells

**Research Question:** How do membrane nanodomains influence the diffusion and trafficking of KRas12, an active Ras mutant, in U2 cells, and what are the implications for Ras signaling?

**Methods:** We employed single-particle tracking photoactivated localization microscopy (sPALM) and detailed trajectory analysis to investigate KRas12 diffusion and trafficking in U2 cells.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that KR12 exhibits an immobile state (~70 nm) embedded in a larger domain (~200 nm) that confers intermediate mobility, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. KR12 is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast, reminiscent of internalization and recycling. Importantly, diffusion and trafficking of KR12 remain invariant over a broad range of expression levels.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that membrane nanodomains dictate KR12 diffusion and trafficking, offering new insights into the spatial regulation of Ras signaling. Partitioning of KR12 into three states remains invariant over a wide range of KR12 levels, indicating that diffusion and trafficking through mobility-associated nanodomains is maintained homeostatic. These data paint a picture of the spatiotemporal dynamics of KR12 on the membrane, providing a basis for understanding mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling.

**Conclusions:** We propose a new model describing membrane dynamics KR12, where nanodomains dictate diffusion and trafficking, with implications for multimer and signaling. Our work sheds light on how nanodomains organize membrane to dictate Ras diffusion and trafficking, offering guidance for future experiments determining molecular and structural identities of Ras-associated nanodomains and mechanisms of multimer and signaling.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) Signaling Gradient Formation in the Dorsoventral Embryonic Axis of Vertebrates and Invertebrates: A Novel Insights from Zebraf Embryos

**Research Question:** How is the Boneogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling gradient formed in the dorsoventral embryonic axis of vertebrates and invertebrates, particularly in the zebraf embryo?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling approaches to investigate the mechanism of BMP gradient formation in wild-type and mutant zraf embryos. We developed a robust imaging method to directly measure BMP signaling activity and integrated the results with a computational model to test hypotheses for gradient formation.

**Findings:** Contrary to the prevailing view of a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists and ligand shuttling, our analysis ruled out a shuttling and transcriptionally-formed mechanisms. Instead, our results support a novel source-sink mechanism, where a restricted antagonist acts as a sink to drive BMP dorsally and gradient formation. We measured Bmp diffusion, which supports the source-sink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development.

**Implications:** Our findings challenge the current understanding of BMP gradient formation in vertebrates and provide a new perspective on the role of antagonists and ligands in patterning the dorvent axis. The sourceink mechanism highlights the importance of restricted antagonist distribution in shaping the BMP gradient, underscoring the complexity of BMP systems.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of BMP gradient formation in the zraf embryo, where a restricted antagonist acts as a sink to drive BMP dorsally gradient. The sourceink model provides a new framework for understanding BMP patterning in vertebrates and highlights the need for further investigation into the role of antagonists and ligands in shaping gradients during development.

**Title:** Characterization of MF1, a Novel Lysosomal Member of the Major Facilitator Superfamily, and its Essential Role in Cellular Homeostasis

**Research Question:** What is the function of MF1, a previously uncharacterized lysosomal member of the major facilitator superfamily, in cellular homeostasis, particularly in the liver and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs)?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of biochemical, proteomic, and genetic approaches to investigate the role of MF1 in lysosomal transport and cellular homeostasis. We isolated lysosomes from wild-type and MF1 knockout (KO) mice by differential centrifugation and sucrose-gradient centrifugation, and performed proteomics analysis to identify accessory proteins associated with MF1. We generated MF1KO mice to study the physiological consequences of MF1 deficiency.

**Findings:** MF1 is a non-glycosylated, ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues, and localized to lysosomes under steady-state conditions. Its transport to lysosomes is mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif in the N-terminus. Proteomics of lysosomes from wild-type and MF1KO mice revealed GL as an essential accessory protein for MF1. GL is a glycosylated lysosomal protein of unknown function. Deficiency of MF1 leads to drastically reduced levels of GL and vice versa. GLKO mice mimic the phenotype of MF1KO.

**Implications:** Our data reveal a tightly linked MF1/GL lysosomal protein complex essential for cellular homeasis, particularly in the liver and LSEC. These findings indicate that MF1 is not a transporter for tested amino acids under tested conditions. The deficiency of MF1 affects the composition of the lysosomal proteome.

**Conclusions:** MF1 is a novel lysosomal member of the major facilitator superfamily with a critical role in cellular homeasis, particularly in the liver and LSEC. The MF/GL complex is essential for maintaining normal levels of MF1 in lysosomes and vice versa. Our study highlights the importance of understanding lysosomal transporters in cellular homeasis and disease.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Microtub Transport by Kines Motors Powered by ATP Hydrolysis

**Research Question:** How do kines motors, powered by ATP hydrolysis, regulate microtub transport in eukaryotes?

**Methods:** To gain insight into this process, we developed atomic models of nucleotide and ATP states of the moneric kines motor domain microtules from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5-Å resolution. We compared these models with existing X-ray structures of AD-bound kines to infer a mechanistic scheme.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that microt attachment, mediated by a universally conserved 'chpin' residue kines (N255), triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and release of AD. Binding of ATP closes the cleft in a manner tightly coupled to translocation of cargo via kines'neck' element. These transitions are reminiscent of analogous nucle-exchange steps in myosin and F-ATase motors, informing how two heads of kines dimer gate each other to promote stepping microtules.

**Implications:** This mechanism allows microules to regulate kines' affinities for AD and ATP by modulating conformation of switch, yielding a structural basis for kines nucleotide behavior on microules. Several sites in kines have been identified uncoupling motor nucleotide from micro affinity, but structural basis remained unclear.

**Conclusions:** To clarify kines microtule cycle, we solved high-resolution cryoEM reconstructions of human moneric kines motor (K349) attached to microtules in different states: before and after binding nucleotide in presence AD•Aluminum (AD•AlFx). Nucleotide and ATP models kines-microt complex are depicted. Pair X-ray structures AD-bound kines K construct (PDB:1MJ have undocked and docked linkers) superposed. Cryo analysis AD and ATP-bound states NK mutant support hypothesis, revealing previously unidentified modes kines attaching to microt but rotationally mobile.

**Key Findings:**

1. Clam-like closure of kines nucle cleft triggered by binding microt, revealed by cryo density maps nuclekines (top) and AD•Al state (bottom).
2. AD and ATP-bound states NK mutant support hypothesis, two modes kines attaching microt but rotation mobile.
3. 3D maps did not refine high resolution, due kines heads mobility.

**Implications:** This study provides a mechanistic understanding of kines microtule cycle, shedding light on regulation of kines affinities for AD and ATP.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Quality Control Pathway for Misfolded Mitochondrial Proteins: Temperature-Sensitive Peripheral Outer Membrane Proteins as Model Substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

**Research Question:** How are misfolded mitochondrial proteins recognized and removed by quality control (QC) pathways, and what are the mechanisms involved in their degradation?

**Methods:** We employed temperature-sensitive (ts) peripheral outer membrane (MOM) proteins, sam-2Hs and sen-1Hs, as model substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate QC pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins. We used ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation assays to study the turnover of these substrates.

**Findings:** We found that sam-2Hs and sen-1s are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteome system, with ubiquination of sam-2s mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1 and sen-1 by San1. Mitochondrial degradation (MAD) of substrates requires the SSA family of Hsp70 and HspS1, providing evidence for chaperone involvement. Additionally, the Cdc-N4-Ufd AAA-ATase complex Do1 and a mitochondrial pool of transmembrane C48 adaptor U2 are implicated in degradation.

**Implications:** This study reveals a unique QC pathway comprised of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors, distinguishing it from other cellular pathways. Our data establish roles for ubiquination and proteomal degradation in turnover of sam-2s and sen-1 at the OM, expanding our understanding of QC in mitochondria.

**Conclusions:** Mitochondrial proteins are subject to oxidative insults, resulting in damage, misfolding, and dysfunction. We found ubiquinated forms of ts proteins localized to mitochondria under proteome impairment. Deletion of proteas shuttling factor D1 did not affect degradation of sam-2 or sen-1, distinguishing from ERAD. Our results indicate ubiquinated QC substrates require the C-Nfd complex for efficient proteomal degradation. The-Nfd complex can be recruited substrates via interaction with coactors. This study elucidates a novel QC pathway for misfold mitochondrial proteins, highlighting the importance of ubiquination and proteasomal degradation in maintaining mitochondrial function.

**Title:** Visualizing Epidermal ERK Activity in Living Mice Reveals Radial Propagation of ERK Activity and Its Role in Cell Proliferation

**Research Question:** How is extracellular-regulated kinase (ER) activity regulated and propagated in the epidermis, and what is its role in cell proliferation?

**Methods:** We used transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ERK to monitor ER activity in epider cells at single-cell resolution. Long-lapse imaging of intact epider revealed radial propagation of ER activity, where ER activation originates from a few cells and propagates radially to a radius of 50 μm over 30 min. We named this phenomenon Spatial Propagation Radial ER Activity (SP) and investigated its mechanism and role in cell cycle.

**Findings:** Under steady-state conditions, the epider exhibited bursts of ER activation where ER activity radially propagated from cell to cell. The frequency of SP correlated with the rate of epider cell division. SPs were stimulated by 12-O-tetadecanoyphol-13-acet (PA) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their cognate ligands. At wounded skin, ER activation propagated as wave parallel to wound, suggesting ER activation can be superimposed. Visualizing cell cycle, we found SPs associated with G/M cell progression.

**Implications:** Our results provide new insights into how proliferation and ER activity are synchronized in living tissue. ER regulation is crucial for homeostasis in the epider and other tissues. ER activation is triggered by EGFR binding to cognate ligands. SPs are observed in epider and backskin, indicating generalizability of our findings.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals radial propagation of ER activity in epider and its role in cell proliferation. SPs are associated with G/M progression, suggesting ER activity is synchronized with cell cycle. ER regulation is essential for tissue homeostasis, and our findings provide new insights into how growth signals are generated and propagated in living tissue.

**Title:** Elucidating the Principles of Circadian Rhythm Entrainment in Cyanobacteria: A Mathematical Framework for Predicting Clock Behavior in Varying Environments

**Research Question:** How do cyanobacterial circadian clocks align with external cycles, and what are the underlying principles that govern this entrainment?

**Methods:** We investigated the cyanobacterial circadian clock in both in vivo and in vitro, using purified Kai proteins to reconstitute the core oscillator. We simulated metabolic pulses of nucleotides on a 24-hr cycle, mimicking in vivo conditions, and observed linear scaling of phase with day length.

**Findings:** The phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday conditions with variable length. The biochemical oscillator comprised of Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating intrinsic dynamics. We developed a mathematical framework based on instantaneous transformation of the cycle by external cues, predicting clock behavior under cycling environments.

**Implications:** The entrained behavior of the circadian clock can be captured quantitatively by a framework with a small number of parameters. This framework guides the design of experiments probing molecular origins of key features. The defined nature of the cyanobacterial clock facilitates such experiments, but the model is general, expected to be useful for other organisms as well.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest that mechanisms for seasonal adaptation are intrinsic to the Kai proteins. The reduction in our model holds promise for predicting circadian rhythms in many-vary environments from minimal data characterizes response. Although the biochemistry of the simplest clock is complex, our analysis indicates a determinant of entrained behavior is how the cycle is deformed by coupling to environment.

**Title:** Meis Inactivation in Neural Crest Leads to Altered Sympatho-Vagal Regulation and Increased Susceptibility to Sudden Cardiac Death**

**Background:** Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of premature mortality in the general population, yet its origins remain unidentified in many cases. Genome-wide association studies have identified Meis as a risk factor for SCD.

**Research Question:** Does Meis inactivation in neural crest lead to altered sympatho-vagal regulation and increased susceptibility to SCD?

**Methods:** We investigated Meis inactivation in mouse neural crest and its effects on sympatho-vagal regulation and SCD.

**Findings:** Meis inactivation in neural crest leads to altered sympatho-vagal regulation characterized by chronotropic incompetence and conduction defects, increasing susceptibility to S. We demonstrated Meis is a major regulator of sympathetic target innervation and Meis deficient neurons die by apoptosis from embryonic to perin stages. Additionally, Meis regulates transcription of key molecules for endosomal machinery, and traffic of Rab+ endosomes is severely altered in Meis-inactivated neurons.

**Implications:** Our results suggest Meis interacts with trophic signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons, highlighting its role in sympathetic differentiation.

**Conclusions:** Meis inactivation in neural leads to imbalanced sympatho-v regulation and increased susceptibility to S. Meis a novel actor in sympathetic differentiation by its role in distal target innervation.

**Title:** Mechanical Instabilities and Interfacial Energies Drive Biofilm Morphogenesis in Vibrio cholera Biofilms

**Research Question:** How do mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies contribute to the morphogenesis of bacterial biofilms, specifically in Vibrio cholera?

**Methods:** We employed a multi-disciplinary approach combining mechanical measurements, theory, simulation, quantitative image analysis, surface characterization, and mutagenesis to investigate the morphogenesis of Vibrio cholera biofilms.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie the morphogenesis of growing biofilms. Interfacial energy is a key driver of mechanomorphogenesis, dictating the creation and annihilation of new and existing interfaces. Feedback between mechanomogenesis and bio expansion shapes the overall biofilm contour.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that mechanical forces play a crucial role in morphogenic events in biofilms, a phenomenon conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Biofilms represent a tractable model to investigate the role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and provide a system for morph-engineering.

**Conclusions:** We propose a mechanorphogenesis model, where biofilms wrinkle and delaminate due to compressive stress (Figure 1—supplement 2). Altering the spatial distribution of mechanical stress can change bio topography. We demonstrate this by inoculating V. cholera biofilms onto agar and allowing them to collide. We speculate that Δz P aerugin mutant forms radial wrinkles and delaminations due to same mechanical instability in V. cholera. Examples illustrate how regulation of cell physiology can be coupled to mechanical instability to promote bio surface morphologies. Recent work on bio has considered mechanical instabilities. Collectively, our findings on connections between bio surface morphology and mechanical properties suggest new genes/compounds altering bio morphology by mechanics could be discovered to address bio-related problems. Morph patterns involve gene programs, but our mechanical findings in V cholera expect to be applicable to other biofilms.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mechanisms of Epileptic Neuronal Networks: Uncovering the Role of Neuron-restrictive Silencer Factor (NRS/REST) in Seizure-Induced Gene Regulation

**Research Question:** How does the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS/REST) contribute to the development of epileptic neuronal networks following severe seizures?

**Methods:** We employed large-scale transcriptome analysis, quantitative PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) to investigate the role of N/REST in regulating gene expression during epileptogenesis.

**Findings:** Surprisingly, a twofold to threefold increase in NREST levels, induced by seizure-provoking seizures, led to repression of only a subset of potentially regulated genes, and these were rescued by interfering with NREST function. Unexpectedly, genes selectively repressed by NREST had mid-range frequencies to the repressor, a property that rendered them sensitive to moderate fluctuations in NREST levels. Genes selectively regulated by NREST during epileogenesis coded for ion channels, receptors, and other contributors to neuronal function.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that dynamic selective regulation of NREST target genes may play a role in influencing neuronal properties in pathological and physiological contexts.

**Conclusions:**

1. NREST contributes to epileptogenesis by regulating a group of genes critically influencing neuronal function.
2. Hundreds of hippocampal genes are potential NREST targets, but only a few are actually repressed by the transcription in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy.
3. The basis of selective regulation of a subset of NREST genes includes mid-range frequencies to NREST, making them sensitive to moderate fluctuations in NREST levels.
4 NREST-regulated hippocal genes include ion channels, receptors, calcium molecules, and transcription factors governing neuronal plasticity, suggesting their repression may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

**Title:** Parallel Pathways in the Olfactory System: Unraveling the Mechanisms of Feature Selectivity in Mitral and Tuft Cells via Lateral Inhibitory Circuits

**Research Question:** How do parallel pathways in the olfactory system, formed by mitral and tuft cells, maintain or enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features, and what is the role of lateral inhibitory circuits in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tuft cells in the olfactory system of mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via lateral inhibitory circuits.

**Findings:** We found differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tuft cells that likely reflect differences in activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations showed that circuit-level differences allow mitral and tuft cells to best discriminate odors in separate ranges, indicating that segregating information about different stimulus intensity may be an important function of parallel pathways.

**Implications:** Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of feature selectivity in parallel pathways in the olfactory system, highlighting the role of lateral inhibitory circuits in generating differential responses between mitral and tuft cells. These results have implications for understanding parallel processing in sensory systems, particularly in areas where distinct outputs are generated from homogeneous sources, such as the olfactory system.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism for differential responses in parallel pathways formed by mitral and tuft cells in the olfactory system, shedding light on the emergence of feature selectivity via lateral inhibitory circuits. These findings suggest that segregation of information about stimulus intensity may be a key function of parallel pathways, allowing for enhanced encoding of specific features. Our results have implications for understanding parallel processing in sensory systems, particularly in areas with homogeneous sources, such as the olfactory.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular and Supramolecular Determinants of Allosteric Effects in the M2 Muscarinic Receptor: A Comparative Study of Monomers and Oligomers

**Research Question:** How do monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor exhibit allosteric properties, and what are the molecular and supramolecular determinants of these effects?

**Methods:** We employed a FRET-based sensor to monitor alloster conformation at the alloster site and pharmacological assays involving engineered mutants to exclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of alloster at the atomic level were examined using molecular dynamics simulations.

**Findings:** Alloic effects in monomers were exclusively negative and primarily derived from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between alloster and orthost ligands. Allo effects oligomers could be positive or negative, depending on alloster-orth pair, arising from interactions between constituent protomers. The behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.

**Implications:** Our findings challenge the traditional view that allosteric effects in the M2 muscar receptor are solely due to interactions within a monomer, highlighting the importance of oligomeric nature of GPCRs. Alloic effects in oligomers arise from interactions between constituent protomers, not solely from alloster site modulation of orthost site.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the molecular and supramolecular determinants of alloic effects in the M muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allosteric GPCRs. Our findings have implications for understanding the complex behavior of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations and the broader family of GPCRs.

**Title:** SET2 Establishes Chromatin States that Coordinate the DNA Damage Response: A Novel Role in Homologous Recombination and p53 Activation

**Research Question:** What is the role of SET2, a histone methyltransferase, in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and its impact on homologous recombination repair and p53 activation?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of SET2 in the DNA damage response using reporter assays, cell culture models, and chromatin immunoprecipitation.

**Findings:** SET2 is required for the activation of ATM and homologous recombination repair of DSBs, promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. Depletion of SET2 impairs ATM activation and leads to delayed recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB sites. SET2 is necessary for recruitment of RAD51 to resect DNA 5' ends and SET2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of DSB.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel role of SET2 in priming chromatin for the response to DNA damage, distinct from previous histone modifications that promote the DNA damage response. Loss of SET2 in clear renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells impairs p53 activation, a guardian of the genome, despite persistence of DNA lesions, leading to decreased cell survival.

**Conclusions:** SET2 establishes chromatin states that coordinate the DNA response to DSB, facilitating homologous recombination and p53 activation. Loss of SET2 in CC may provide an alternative mechanism for inactivation of p53 without additional mutations in TP53. This study provides a link between altered chromatin states and mechanisms maintaining genome integrity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanistic basis of SET2 impact on the DNA damage response.

**Title:** A Novel Missense Variant in Rasgrp1 Disrupts T Cell-Intrinsic Regulation of CD4+ T Cells through Elevated mTOR Signaling

**Research Question:** How does a missense mutation in the Ras1 guanine exchange factor (Rasgrp) impact CD4 T cell regulation and autoimmunity?

**Methods:** We generated RasgrpAna mice with an ENU-induced missense mutation in the Ras1 EF-hand domain and analyzed their CD4 T cell development, function, and autoantib production.

**Findings:** RasgrpAna mice exhibit anti-nuclear autoantib and accumulate a CD44+ Helios+ PD-1+ CD4 T population dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Ras1-Ras-ER activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in RasgrpAna is normal in vivo, although CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T in a T-autonomous manner. We identify CD44 as a reporter of tonic mTOR signaling through a novel strain, chino, with a reduction-function mutation in mTOR. Elevated mTOR signaling in RasAna naïve CD4 cells, CD44, CD+ T subset, and autoantib returned to normal in RasAnaMino double-mut mice, demonstrating increased m activity essential for RasAna T dysregulation.

**Implications:** This study reveals a new role for Ras in cell-intrinsic regulation of CD4 T cells, dissociating this function from its known role in thymic selection. By combining biochemical and genetic studies, we identify overactive m signaling in naïve CD4 cells as a key driver of RasAna abnormalities: (1) constitutive increase in CD44 naïve CD T and (2) accumulation of peripheral Helios CD44 CD cells and autoantib.

**Conclusions:** A missense in Ras1 disrupts CD4 T regulation through elevated mTOR signaling, leading to autoimmunity. Genetic reduction of m function in RasAna mice normalizes CD expression naïve CD T and abolishes excessive accumulation effector cells and autoantib, highlighting a central role for increased activity in immune dysregulation RasAna mice.

**Title:** The Role of SWI/SNF Chromatin Remodeling Component Arid1 in Pancreatic Cancer Initiation: A Context-Dependent Modulation of Acinar Cell Identity and Tumorigenesis

**Research Question:** How do mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family contribute to cancer development, particularly in the context of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation, and what is the role of the SWI/S subunit Arid1 in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a mouse model of inducible and reversible suppression of Arid in the pancreas in the setting of oncogenic KrasG12 to investigate the effect of Arid loss on PDAC initiation. We found that Ar1 cooperates with Kras in the pancreas, and postnatal silencing Ar1 following KrasG12 expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PD precursor lesions. In contrast, Ar1 silencing during embryogenesis with Kras12 activation leads to retention of acinar fate.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate Ar1 as a critical modulator of K-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and underscore the influence of timing and genetic context on SW/S complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis. Suppression of Ar1 in adult acinar cells with oncogenic K mutations accelerates acinar to ductal reprogramming and specification of mucinous cancer lesions, which cannot be reversed by restoring endogenous Ar1 expression. Alc blue staining confirmed retention of mucinous lesions in Ar1-restored mice. Ar1 loss enables non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate dependent on cellular and genetic context.

**Implications:** Our data suggest Ar1 can provide a barrier to K-driven acinar duct metaplas and early pancreatic neoplas. Perturbation of the SW/S chrom-remodeling complex is expected to impact expression of SW/S target genes, implying genomic areas rendered by Ar1 involved in preventing ac to duct transdifferentiation in mutant K, a critical step in K-driven neoplas. Transcription and chrom profiling data indicate Ar1 disruption in oncogenic K reduces chromatin accessibility of TFs to enhancers needed sustain ac cell.

**Conclusions:** While Ar1 stabilizes ac identity as a barrier to cancer initiation, other factors are necessary to promote Pan-to-PDAC transition. Our data suggest acute Ar1 loss in pre-existing K rapidly perturb identity and function of ac cells, enhancing sensitivity to metlastic Pan-inducing signals from oncogenic K.

**Title:** Sex-Specific Effects of Social Isolation on the Properties of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) Neurons in the Paraventricular Nucleus (PVN) of the Hypothalamus

**Research Question:** How does social isolation affect the intrinsic properties of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PV) of the hypothalamus in male and female mice, and how do these effects compare to those of acute physical stress?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of social isolation and acute stress on the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in the PV of the hypothalamus in male and female mice. Pre-adolescent female mice were isolated from littermates for 24 hours, while age-matched males were not. We also subjected either isolated or group-housed females and males to acute physical stress (swim) for 20 minutes. Intrinsic properties of CRH neurons were assessed in hypothalamic brain slices.

**Findings:** Social isolation increased first latency (FSL) and decreased excitability of CR neurons in socially-isolated female, but not age-matched male mice. Acute stress increased FSL in groupoused females and singleoused males. The increase in F following social or acute stress was blocked by glucocortic synthesis inhibitor metrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in F resulted in decrease in excitability of CR neurons.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that social, but not acute stress, has sex-specific effects on PV CRH neurons. Social isolation alters intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in a sexually dimorphic fashion, increasing F and decreasing excitability in socially-isolated female, but not ageatched male mice. Acute stress, however, has indistinguishable effects on males and females.

**Conclusions:** Our observations suggest that social isolation, but not acute stress, has sex-specific effects on PV CRH neurons. Social isolation may be interpreted as stress by female, but not male mice, as evidenced by prior isolation occluding effects of acute stress on F in females but not males.

**Title:** Evolutionary Optimization of Hemoglobin Cooperativity and Affinity for Tissue Oxygen Delivery in Mammals**

**Research Question:** How do hemoglobin (H) affinity and cooperativity adapt to optimize oxygen delivery to different tissues in mammals?

**Methods:** We investigated the relationship between the Hill coefficient (n) and conformational changes of the Monod-Wann-Change alloster model, graphing the "biophysical landscape" describing this relation. We analyzed mammalian H cooperativity values and relative affinity parameters.

**Findings:** Mammalian H cooperativity values reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity, allowing fine-tuning of oxygen unloading to meet distinct tissue requirements. Our findings reveal the underlying mechanism of body-related adaptation of mammalian H.

**Implications:** Evolutionary tuning of mammalian H maximum cooperativity and affinity, achieved by varying the relative and conformation ratio of quaternary states, regulates oxygen delivery by H and serves as a means to meet the needs of different tissues for oxygen.

**Conclusions:** Our results support the hypothesis that maximum cooperativity of H has been tuned during evolution to satisfy physiological requirements of tissues for oxygen. Mammalian H exhibit different maximum n values, with higher values giving higher sensitivities to substrate unloading by MWC proteins. Small animals display lower affinity than large animals, reflecting adaptive adjustment of oxygen unloading by H. However, results from the dataset support that changes in mammalian H binding and conformation have been tuned, giving rise to maximum cooper in binding, albeit different n in each case. The human dataset shows a positive correlation between metabolic rate and maximum cooperativity, and an inverse correlation between rate and affinity.

**Key Findings:**

* Mammalian cooperativity values reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity, allowing fine-tuning of oxygen unloading to meet distinct tissue requirements
* Evolutionary tuning of mammalian maximum cooperativity and affinity regulates oxygen delivery by H
* Mammalian exhibit different n values, with higher values giving higher sensitivities to substrate unloading
* Small animals display lower affinity than large, reflecting adaptive oxygen unloading by H
 Dataset supports changes in mammalian binding conformation have given rise to maximum cooperativity
 Human dataset shows positive correlation between metabolic rate and cooperativity, inverse between rate and affinity

**Title:** Unveiling the Dynamics of Plasmodium Sporozoite Motility and Interaction with Dermal Vessels: Implications for Malaria Infection

**Research Question:** How do Plasmodium sporozoites navigate through the dermal tissue and interact with blood vessels, and what are the implications for malaria infection?

**Methods:** We employed intravital microscopy in mice to investigate sporite motility and interaction with dermal vessels over the first 2 hours after intradermal inoculation.

**Findings:** Our data reveal two types of sporite motility: 'vascular motility' characterized by high speed and confinement in avascular areas, and 'perascular motility' with constrained movement near blood vessels. Curvature of sporite tracks optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Mutations in key adhesive proteins highlight the importance of sporite gliding speed and modulating adhesive properties for successful exit from inoculation.

**Implications:** Gliding motility of Plmod sporites is essential for infectivity. Our study refines understanding of how sporite navigates through dermis and out. Mutant sporites with altered motility or speed show decreased blood invasion and infectivity. Data suggest exit inoculation site presents barrier for sporite, an opportune for intervention.

**Conclusions:** This study provides first quantitative in vivo analysis of Plmod sporite motility over time and visualization of dermal endothelia interaction with blood vessels. Changes in sporite motility over first 2 hours post-inoculation reveal two types of motility: avascular and perivascular. Mutations in adhesive proteins highlight importance of sporite gliding and modulating adhesive properties for successful exit inoculation. Gliding motility Plmod sporites is critical for infectivity. Our study refines understanding of sporite navigation through dermis and out. Mutant sporites with altered motility or speed show decreased blood invasion and infectivity.

**Title:** Evolutionary Robustness of Cell Polarization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: A Study on the Removal of the BEM1 Gene

**Research Question:** How do cells adapt to the loss of a crucial component of the polarization module, and what are the underlying mechanisms that enable them to recover and evolve new functions?

**Methods:** We conducted an experiment where we evolved Saccharomy cerevisiae for 100 generations without the BEM1 gene, a key component of the polarization module. We sequenced the genomes and monitored polarization to track the evolutionary trajectory.

**Findings:** Initially, bem1 lineages rapidly increased in fitness, then reached >90% of the fitness of BEM ancestors at the end of evolution. Sequencing revealed a common evolutionary trajectory of adaptive mutations, each improving polarization by inactivating proteins.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiological perturbations and recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in cell biologically important functions.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that cells can adapt to loss of a crucial component of the polarization module by a reproducible evolutionary trajectory, largely explained by interactions amongst mutated genes, leading to substantial recovery in speed and accuracy of polarization. The loss of 88 genes in Saccharomy cerevisiae from an ancestor 100 Mya ago and recruitment of new functions by adaptations alter existing genes and create de novo support our findings. Our experiment created a set of rapid polarizing mechanisms. Bem1 cells contain more than one polarity site, suggesting positive feedback ensures single site polarization weaker. We interpret results as demonstrating multiple regulation allow cells to polarize rapidly and adapt to strong perturbations under selective, favoring trajectories remove components over quantitatively alter properties.

**Title:** Neural Mechanisms of Economic Decisions: Unveiling the Role of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex in Commitment and Rejection

**Research Question:** How do humans make economic decisions involving commitment and rejection, and what neural mechanisms underlie these processes in the medial prefrontal cortex?

**Methods:** In this study, we investigated the neural mechanisms of economic decisions involving commitment and rejection using a multi-altern choice task with financial consequences that persisted over time. Participants made successive choices between accepting or deferring a prospect, with the option to commit or reject later. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate (ACC) cortices.

**Findings:** We found that the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmFC) encoded value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating signals over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cing cortex (ACC) encoded value only when participants rejected or accepted a prospect. ACC signals reflected two biases: deferring to later and weighting potential losses more heavily than gains, paradoxically maximizing reward in the task.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions and computation in the prefrontal cortex. Our results suggest that value encoding in the medialfront cortex depends on whether decisions involve commitment or not, and that the dorsal cing cortex plays a critical role in weighing losses and gains.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals the neural mechanisms of economic decisions involving commitment and rejection, and highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex in integrating value signals over time. Our findings have implications for understanding the neural basis of economic behavior and decision-making.

**Title:** Circadian Regulation of Gene Expression by Paraspeles: A Novel Post-Transcriptional Mechanism in Pituitary Cells

**Research Question:** Do paraspeles, nuclear bodies composed of non-coding RNA and RNA-binding proteins, control gene expression at the post-transcription level through the retention of mRNA containing 3'-UTR inverted repeats of Alu (IRu) sequences in pituitary cells?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of paraspele components, including major proteins and Neat, in pituitary cells and found a circadian pattern. Insertion of IRu at the 3'-UTR of EGFP cDNA led to rhythmic nuclear retention of eGFP mRNA, which was lost when paraspeles were disrupted. Using real-time microscopy, IRu drove circadian expression of EGFP.

**Findings:** Our results show that parasles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene expression at post-transcription level. Insertion of IRu at 3'-R of EGFP cDNA led to rhythmic nuclear retention of eFP mRNA, which was lost when parasles were disrupted. Insertion of antisense IR had weak effect. Real-time microscopy showed IRu drove circadian EGFP expression.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel post-transcription mechanism of circadian regulation in pituit cells, providing an additional layer of gene regulation by sequestering mRNAs within the nucleus. Components of parasles, NON and SFP, display circadian pattern in pituit cells and rat cell line GH4. Circadian genes showed loss of rhythmic pattern when parasles disrupted, suggesting parasle retention plays role in circadian expression. Post-transcription circadian plays major role in determining oscillations at mRNA level.

**Conclusions:** Given presumed functions in gene expression through mRNA retention and circadian pattern, parasles may rhythmically retain RNAs in nucleus leading to rhythmic expression of corresponding gene. This study demonstrates that parasles, through circadian expression, control circadian gene expression postcription in pituit cells, providing new insights into circadian regulation.

**Title:** Critical Role of Munc13 in Modulating Presynaptic Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels for Efficient Information Transfer at the Synapse

**Research Question:** How do presynaptic proteins regulate the function of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) to facilitate efficient synaptic transmission at the synapse?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between Munc, a protein essential for exocytosis, and VGs in the active zone, and its impact on VG function during various forms of activity.

**Findings:** We discovered that Munc interacts with VGs via a pair of basic residues in its C2 domain, controlling VG response and recovery from high-frequency action bursts and calcium influx from single stimuli. Elimination of this interaction by Munc removal or replacement with a M13C mutant altered VG response and calcium influx.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel form of synaptic modulation, where Munc controls vesicle priming and exocyt by regulating VG function on millisecond time scales. The dependence of exocyt on Ca+ influx and control of VG on fast scales implies that synaptic throughput can be actively controlled by VG-active protein interactions.

**Conclusions:** Munc is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by modulating VG function. Our data pinpoint a critical site in the C2 domain of M on the membrane-interacting loops and demonstrate that M enhances Ca+ influx and modulates VG kinetic properties across stimulation conditions. This interaction has broad implications for understanding synaptic transmission control.

**Title:** The Puzzle-Shaped Cells in Plant Epidermis: A Mechanical Stress-Driven Morphogenesis

**Research Question:** What is the functional significance of puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of plants, particularly in isotropic tissues such as leaves, cotyledons, and fruits?

**Methods:** We investigated the relationship between puzzle-shaped cells and isotropy in various plant species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, using FEM analysis of 3D pressurized cells, mechanical models, and mutants where growth direction was perturbed.

**Findings:** Our results show that puzzle-shaped cells in epider provide an effective strategy to reduce mechanical stress in isotropic tissues, such as the epidermis of leaves, cotyledons, and fruits. FEM analysis revealed that cell shape influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell wall. In isotropic organs, such as broad leaves and cotons, puzzle-shaped cells prevent large areas and high stresses. Our model predicts that cells regulate their shape to prevent LEC, a proxy for stress, from becoming too large.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell shape morphogenesis in plant epider cells. We propose that puzzle-shaped cells are an adaptation to developmental constraint related to mechanical forces acting on turg plant cells in epider. Mechanically, plant cells are small inflated with turg pressure, up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaf cells, reaching up to 50 bar in specialized cells such as stomata.

**Conclusions:** The puzzle-shaped cells in epider of many plant species are not just a complex shape, but a functional adaptation to reduce mechanical stress in isotropic tissues. Our results support the hypothesis that lobes emerge at cellular level to prevent formation of isodetric cells that bulge under stress produced by turg pressure. Together, our data from plant organs and simulation models show a mechanism regulating cellular stress reproduces the development epider cell shape.

**Title:** Investigating the Dynamics of Spliceosome Assembly in Human Pre-mRNA Splicing: Unveiling the Role of Cross-in and Crosson Interactions

**Research Question:** How do cross-in and crosson interactions contribute to the assembly of the spliceosome in human pre-mRNA splicing, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying this process?

**Methods:** We employed a novel approach using fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes in human nuclear extracts to investigate the dynamics of pre-mRNA interactions with individual spliceosomal subcomplexes, focusing on the role of cross-in and cross interactions in promoting pre-splice assembly.

**Findings:** Our results show that U1 binding to the 5' splice site of an intron, in conjunction with U1 bound to the 5' site of the adjacent intron, significantly increases the rate and efficiency of U2 recruitment to the 3' splice site of the upstream intron. Notably, flanking 5 splice sites exhibit additive effects, suggesting distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5 splice sites across introns and exons is crucial for the correct and efficient splicing of multi-in preRNAs.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest an ordered pre-splice assembly pathway in human, where U2 association requires prior U1 binding in the presence of ATP, contrasting the branched pathway observed in S. cerevisiae (Shbak et al., 2013). In multi-in preRNAs, internal exons 5'S both upstream and downstream, or both, can bind U and act to recruit U to 3'S. In principle, two U1 can act independently or synergistically.

**Conclusions:** We establish methods for observing spliceosomal subcomplex dynamics on preRNA splicing in human extracts, revealing that U binding to 5'S is unaffected by U sites positioned downstream (crosson) or upstream (cross) of 5'S. Spliceosomes can form on multi-in preRNAs through two pathways: a) cross-in interactions leading to catalytically active spliceosome, or b) crosson interactions where exons flanking introns are defined, followed by cross-in interactions between adjacent exons leading to spliceosome (Mold and Query, 2010). Our models propose that once a functional U-U prelice forms across intr, interactions with U bound downstream 5 provide no additional U binding or stabilization of subsequent steps.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Ubiquitin-Dependent Folding System for Membrane Proteins on the Cytosolic Side of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)

**Research Question:** How do membrane proteins fold efficiently on the cytosolic side of the ER, and what are the molecular mechanisms involved in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 and other membrane proteins, such as CFTR and anthrax receptor 2, using biochemical and biophysical approaches.

**Findings:** We discovered a novel ubiquitin-dependent folding system that operates on the cytosolic side of the ER, involving site-specific ubiquitination and deubiquination cycles. LRP6 undergoes ubiquitination on lysine 140, likely interacting with a ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaper, providing time for folding. If folding is successful, L6 is transported out of the ER, favored by palmitoylation. If folding is impaired or delayed, polyubiquination of cytosolic lysines targets L6 to ERAD.

**Implications:** This ubiquitin-dependent folding system controls proteostasis of membrane proteins involved in severe human diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Hyine Fibrosis Syndrome.

**Conclusions:** Our findings reveal a novel ubiquitin-dependent folding machinery on the cytos side of ER, dependent on site-specific cycles of ubiquit-deubiquination. This system likely operates on other membrane proteins, such as CFTR and anthrax receptor 2. In analogy to glucylation-deglucylation in the lumen, we hypothesize lys-140-ubitin interacts with a putative ubiqu-binding protein acting as a chaper. Release from this ubiqu-binding chaper, L6 is deubiquinated by US19. Our study highlights the importance of ubiquitin-dependent folding in membrane protein quality control and its potential therapeutic implications for human diseases.

**Title:** Sex-Based Modulation of Cognitive Processes Sets the Stage for Individual Differences in Vulnerability to Neuropsychiatric Disorders: Uncovering Latent Variables in Value-Based Decision Making

**Research Question:** Do sex-based differences in cognitive processes, particularly in value-based decision making, contribute to individual vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders?

**Methods:** We investigated sex differences in latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision task, the restless two-armed bandit, in mice. Male and female mice had similar accuracy, but achieved performance via different patterns of exploration.

**Findings:** Male mice made more exploratory choices, getting stuck in exploration once started, while females explored less but learned more quickly. These results suggest sex influences decision making during learning and exploration, not stable choices. Exploration is altered in people with addictions, depression, neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing neural mechanisms as a translational avenue for sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsych diagnoses.

**Implications:** Sex differences in exploration contribute to performance variability across tasks and species (Grom and Reyes, 2019; van Bos et al, 2013). We applied computational tools to characterize sex differences in latent variables underlying behavior, understanding key process regulating reward-guided behaviors: exploration-exploitation.

**Results:** Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models revealed sex differences in exploration, paralleled by differences in learning rate. How exploration-exploitation, reward, and outcomes interact to influence choices remains unclear.

**Conclusions:** Mechanisms biasing approaches during tasks are significant contributors to performance. We used combination modeling to characterize differences in explore-exploit task. Males and females had similar performance, but used different latent strategies to learn environment. Post-hoc win-lose analyses showed females displayed more win-st behaviors, indicating more likely to repeat behaviors producing reward on previous trial.

**Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation (ERAD) Protein Extraction: The Role of Ubiquitin Ligase Doa10 as a Retrotransase

**Research Question:** How do hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments and hydrophilic folded luminal domains of ER proteins interact with the phospholip bilayer and cytos during endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD)?

**Methods:** Using a reconstuted system with purified proteins from Saccharomy cerevisiae, we investigated the role of ubiquitin ligase Doa10 (Te-4/MARCH in animals) in ERAD protein extraction.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that Doa is a membrane retrotransase that facilitates protein extraction by interacting with the membrane-embedded domain of Do10 and passively moving the TM segment into the aqueous phase. Luminal segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, with unfolding occurring on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasm C48 action.

**Implications:** This study provides mechanistic insights into ERAD protein extraction without relying on indirect read-outs of downstream reactions such as proteasomal degradation. We show that Do10 cooperates with C48 ATPase in extracting proteins with folded luminal domains.

**Conclusions:** Our findings address long-standing questions regarding the folding state of luminal domains during retrolocation and the role of Do10 as a retroase in ERAD. We demonstrate that Do10 is a membrane-bound retroase that cooperates with C48 in extracting proteins with folded luminal domains. Our results have implications for understanding protein quality control pathways in the ER and other organelles, such as the Golgi, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, where membrane proteins are removed for proteomal degradation in the cytos.

**Title:** Deciphering the Mechanisms of Hedgehog Signaling in Drosophila Wing Imaginal Discs: Unraveling the Roles of Ci Processing and Regulation

**Research Question:** How do extracellular Hedgehog (H) proteins regulate transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Drosoph Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to transcriptional repressors and activating the full Ci Gli proteins, and what are the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent H signaling in Dophila wing imaginal discs?

**Methods:** We investigated the contributions of Ci variants expressed at physiological levels to the mechanisms of H signaling in Doph wing imaginal discs. We generated Ci variants that cannot be processed normally and supplemented them with constitutive Ci repressor to assess the role of regulated processing in H signaling.

**Findings:** Our results show that Ci variants that cannot be processed support a normal pattern of graded gene activation and development of adults with normal morphology when supplemented with constitutive Ci repressor, indicating that H can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing. Moreover, processing-resistant Ci variants were also activated in the absence of H by elimination of Cos, likely through binding the CORD of Ci or PK, revealing inhibitory roles of these components in addition to their established roles in promoting processing.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that H signaling in D wing imaginal discs does not require regulation of either repressor or full Ci protein by processing, and that Ci can mediate normal H morph action in the absence of regulated processing. This is supported by the development of adults with normal wing pattering provided constitutive Ci repressor suppresses ectopic dpp expression in anterior cells.

**Conclusions:** Our study unravels the mechanisms of H signaling in D wing imaginal discs, highlighting the contributions of Ci processing and regulation to dose-dependent H signaling. We demonstrate that Ci can mediate normal H morph action in the absence regulated processing, and that processing-resistant Ci variants support development with normal wing pattering provided constitutive repressor is present. These findings have implications for understanding H signaling in development and disease, where aberrant H production, distribution, and responses are common causes of developmental defects and cancer.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Excitatory Interneurons in the Dorsal Horn in Pain Signaling: An Optogenetic Activation of Calretinin-Expressing Interneurons

**Research Question:** How do excitatory interneurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord contribute to the generation and amplification of pain signals, and can they be targeted for analgesic therapy?

**Methods:** We employed an optogenetic approach to selectively activate interneurons expressing the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and investigated their role in pain signaling.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that CR-expressing interneurons form an interconnected network that initiates and sustains excitatory signaling, directly relaying signals to lamina projection neurons. Photostimulation of these interneurons in vivo elicited significant nocifensive behavior, which was morphine-sensitive, caused conditioned aversion, and enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodin-mediated inhibition of these interne elevated sensory thresholds.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that dorsal circuits involving excitatory neurons are crucial for the generation and amplification of pain, identifying interne as a potential analgesic target.

**Conclusions:** This study confirms that excitatory interneurons in the dorsal horn contribute to pain signaling and amplify signals in the absence of peripheral input. The strong connectivity of this chemically-defined subpopulation in the horn positions them to alter sensory information prior to relay to higher centers, as demonstrated by the nocif responses elicited by photostimulation. Future work must determine how these circuits respond to peripherally-evoked sensory processing. Recent studies have implicated neurochemically-distinct subpopulations of dorsal interneurons in both acute and chronic pain states, while historically, research has focused on inhibition. Our data is compatible with current models placing CR in polysynaptic circuits through SOM to activate lamina projection and initiate pain.

**Title:** Mutations in the RAB23 Gene Cause Carpenter Syndrome: Elucidating the Role of RAB in Skull Development and Suture Formation

**Research Question:** How does the RAB gene regulate skull development and suture formation, particularly in the context of Carpenter syndrome, characterized by polysyndyly and craniosynoses?

**Methods:** We generated RAB deficient mice (Rab-/-) that survived until embryonic day E18.5, allowing us to investigate the role of RAB in bone formation. Similar to Carpenter patients, ab- mice exhibited polysyndly and craniosynoses.

**Findings:** Disruption of RAB led to upregulation of Pit2, F10, and Fg1 expression, decreased p38 and enhancedER1/2-RUN2 signaling, and elevated osteopitor proliferation. We found that R regulates the sutural cell marker GL1, represses H, and inhibits osteitor expansion. R also repress F10-drivenER1 signaling, affecting osteitor development, RUN2 differentiation, and repress GL1.

**Implications:** Our results suggest a novel role for R as an upstream regulator of F10ER1-RUN2 and H-GL1 signaling, and non-canonical regulation of GL1 through ER1/2. R coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating F10ER1-RUN2 activity, activation of GL1, and repression of H targets.

**Conclusions:** R plays a crucial role in suture morphogenesis and patency through three mechanisms: F10-ER1 signaling, repression of H through canonical pathway, and repression of GL1 by ER1. GL contributes to regulation of mesenchymal stem cell niche. F10-ER1 and H-GL1 signaling regulate osteitor proliferation. Overlapping phenotypes caused by mutations in FG, H regulators, and R suggest common etiological mechanisms. F and H signaling have well-defined roles in intramembrane osteogenesis, regulating mesenchal condensation, osteitor proliferation, and activation of transcription factor RUN2.

**Title:** Inheritance of Gene Expression States: Unveiling the Role of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 in Epigenetic Memory

**Research Question:** Can Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) epigenetically repress genes in animals and plants by modifying chromatin, and can this epigenetic memory be inherited through cell division, or is it dictated by concentrations of diffusible factors?

**Methods:** To address this question, we monitored the expression of two copies of the Arabidopsis Polycomb target FLOW LOCUS C (FLC) in the same plants, demonstrating that one copy can be repressed while the other is active, and this mixed state is inherited through cell divisions as plants develop.

**Findings:** Our data show that epigenetic memory of FL expression is stored in cis, not trans, indicating that Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a gene can instruct its own inheritance and constitutes a cis system. We used the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis, where prolonged cold exposure accelerates flowering by epigen repressing the Poly target and floral repressor FLC. Vernal has been observed in imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation, which involves DNA methylation and chromosome-wide changes in chromatin structure and nuclear positioning.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that epigen memory can be stored locally in chromatin of individual genes, in the form of DNA methylation or post-translational modifications of histones, rather than in concentrations of diffible factors maintained through feedback loops. We developed an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of FL expression at single-cell level and crossed F-merry to F-Venus to generate F hybrids carrying single copy each trans. In trans memory, only heritable states F-Venus/FL-merry are ON/ON and OFF because epigen information stored as diffus signal.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that Poly-repressed chromatin at single gene can store epigen memory, supporting the concept of cis epigenetic memory. FLC repression requires P2 but is independent DNA methylation, making it a system for studying cis-memory capability of Poly at single. Vernal plants F expression bistable, with number cells F stably repressed increasing with duration prior cold exposure. These findings have implications for understanding epigenetic inheritance and gene regulation in plants and animals.

**Title:** Elucidating the Structure and Function of Hsp70 Chaper Oligomers: Insights into the Regulation of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response

**Research Question:** How do Hsp70 chaper oligomers, formed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70, regulate protein folding and function in response to unfolded protein stress?

**Methods:** Site-specific proteolysis and cross-linking were used to probe the architecture of oligomers formed by ER Hsp70. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and Hsp oligomers.

**Findings:** Hsp oligomers consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain of one in the substrate site of another, attenuating chaper function of Hsp. Lumen ER depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian Hsp and coincidental diminution in substrate binding, pointing to relative inertness of oligomers. Equilibrium between inactive oligomers and active monomeric Hsp is poised to buffer fluctuations ER protein load on rapid timescale.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that Hsp oligomerization is tuned to physiological state of the cell, given oligomer inactivating H protomers, the olig form is relatively inactive chaper that is accessible on short scale. Competition between oligomer and binding buffers ER against fluctuations in protein load in both directions. Affinity of Hsp for substrates is governed by protein-driven non-equilibrium mechanisms (De Rios and Barducci, 2014), which could account for H favoring as client oligizing over other, (Ca2) declines. ER depletion would shift equilibrium unfolded and chaper in favor former.

**Conclusions:** Observations paint a picture of enhanced production of unfolded drawing pool inactive oligomeric to service clientele. Reports of presence in longer stressed cells may reflect partition of produced during activated UPR or cytoplasm counterpart, heat response but redundant following resolution. Relationship between unfolded load and oligom state is confounded by feedback that dominates unfolded responses chone to levels of stress.

**Title:** Structural Insights into the Coat Protein-RNA Interactions of Pepino Mosaic Virus, a Representative of the Potexivirus Family

**Research Question:** What is the three-dimensional structure of the coat protein (CP) of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), a representative of the Potexivirus family, and how does it interact with its viral RNA?

**Methods:** High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy was used to determine the structure of PepMV CP at 3.9 Å resolution, allowing for modeling of the protein and its interactions with viral RNA.

**Findings:** The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the Phlebovirus family, a group of enveloped ssRNA viruses, differing in C-terminal extensions that determine distinct multimer assemblies. Surprisingly, a structural homology was found between CP of flexuous viruses and NPs of Phleviruses, a group of enveloped ssRNA viruses.

**Implications:** This study provides insights into the structure-function relationships between CP and RNA of flexuous viruses and enveloped viruses, suggesting gene transfer between eukaryotic and ssRNA viruses.

**Conclusions:** The structure of PepMV CP, a representative of the Potex family, was determined at 3.9 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a fold similar to that of NPs from Phlevir, a group of enveloped ssRNA viruses, differing in C-terminal extensions that determine distinct multimer assemblies. Homology was found between CP of flexuous viruses and NPs of Phvir, a group of enveloped ssRNA viruses, suggesting gene transfer between eukotic and ssRNA viruses.

**Title:** High-Resolution Imaging of Antibody Binding Sites on Heterogeneous Cellular Surfaces using SiteLoc: A Novel Method for Epitope Localization

**Research Question:** Can a novel imaging-based method, SiteLoc, accurately determine the location of antibody binding sites on heterogeneous cellular surfaces with nanometer precision, facilitating the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines?

**Methods:** We developed SiteLoc, a method for imaging-based localization of antibody binding sites on cellular proteins with nan-scale precision, using topological averaging of high-resolution images. This approach calculates the distance between bound ligand and reference surface by averaging fluorescent signal along cell contour.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that Site is well-suited for antibody binding measurements on native surface morphology and can be applied to other molecular estimations. We achieved nan-scale precision by reducing surface data dimension within an image plane. Site measurements on antibody-coated bacteria agree with previously reported data, and accurately estimate heights on spherical and non-spherical surfaces.

**Implications:** Fast and efficient epitope screening is crucial for therapeutic development. Current methods for nan-scale localization microscopy are costly and unsuitable for heterogeneous surfaces. Our method addresses this limitation, enabling high-throughput analysis of binding sites on cellular surfaces.

**Conclusions:** Site offers a novel solution for high-resolution imaging of antibody binding on heterogeneous surfaces. This method has potential for mechanistic understanding and therapeutic development of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Our results show that Site can be applied to other molecular estimations, such as protein-protein interactions, with nan-scale precision. Future work will explore applications of this method in various biological systems and therapeutic contexts.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Peripheral Tissue Oxygen Sensing in Systemic Vascular Regulation: A Novel Insights from Hypoxic Response in the Skin

**Research Question:** How do peripheral tissues, specifically the skin, contribute to systemic vascular regulation in response to hypoxia, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of hypoxic response in the skin, mediated by HIF transcription factors, on cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia in mice. We analyzed the effect of loss of hypox-responsive genes on cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressure, and body temperature.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that peripheral oxygen sensing in the skin plays a crucial role in systemic response to hypoxia. Specifically, we show that HIF-1α and H-2 expression in keratinocytes modulate cardiovascular response to hypox, influencing heart rate, arterial pressure, and body temperature. Notably, mice lacking HIF-α, H-2, NOS, and Arg-1 in the epidermis exhibit significant changes in blood pressure and cutaneous temperature compared to littermate controls.

**Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of peripheral tissues in cardiovascular adaptation to hypia. We propose a model of hypoxic response involving HIF isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in the skin, where hypia leads to H-1/NOS/NO-mediated increase in diameter and perfusion, followed by H-2/Arg-induced reduction of intracellular L-argin.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in peripheral tissue modifying cardiovascular response to hypia. Our results underscore the significance of peripheral sensing in systemic vascular regulation, particularly in response to hypoxia. These findings have implications for understanding cardiovascular adaptation to hypia in various conditions, such as high altitude or disease.

**Title:** Refining Optogenetic Methods for Circuit Mapping: Enabling Functional Connectivity Measurements at Single-Neuron Resolution

**Research Question:** Can we develop a refined optogenetic approach to map synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution by restricting channelrhodinodin (ChR) expression to soma and proximal dendrites, while using two-photon beam expansion and temporal focusing, to evoke action potentials in individual neurons and verify spike generation with GCaMPs, and determine synaptic presence or absence with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording?

**Methods:** We employed a novel combination of two-photon beam expansion and temporal focusing to activate channelrhodin (Ch2) expressed in soma and proximal dendrites of neurons, allowing for reliable action potential evocation, spike verification with GCaMP, and synaptic connectivity assessment with patch-clamp electrophys recording.

**Findings:** Our refined optogenetic method enables synaptic connectivity mapping at single-neuron resolution by restricting Ch expression to soma and proximal dendrites, reducing unintended activation of fibers and axonal boutons, which respond to temporal two-photon excitation. This approach provides a precise and flexible paradigm for optogen mapping, overcoming limitations of previous methods.

**Implications:** Understanding synaptic organization of individual neurons into circuits is crucial for interpreting sensory input and behavioral responses. Our refined optogen method enables functional connectivity mapping with single-cell resolution, essential for elucidating circuit function. This study demonstrates the potential of combining two-photon activation with Ch2 and Ch expression restriction to soma and proximal dendrites for reliable synaptic evaluation.

**Conclusions:** This study presents a refined optogen approach for synaptic connectivity mapping at single-neuron resolution, addressing limitations of previous methods. By restricting Ch expression to soma and proximal dendrites and using two-photon expansion and focusing, we achieve reliable action potential evocation, spike verification with GCMP, and synaptic assessment with patch-clamp electrophys. Our findings highlight the importance of precise optogen mapping for understanding neural circuit function and behavior.

**Title:** Unraveling the Complexity of Transcription Factor Interactions on Eukaryotic Genomes: A Biophysical Analysis of Sox2 and Oct4 Reciprocity

**Research Question:** How do transcription factors (TFs) Sox2 and Oct4 interact with eukaryotic genomes, and what is the nature of their binding dynamics?

**Methods:** We conducted a rigorous biophysical analysis of single-molecule data from living cells to investigate the interaction between Sox2 and Oct4, previously interpreted as evidence of ordered assembly on DNA.

**Findings:** Contrary to previous findings, our analysis reveals that Sox2 and Oct exhibit reciprocity, with Sox2 increasing Oct4's genomic binding while decreasing Oct4 Sox's binding. This reciprocity can arise from either energy expenditure from thermodynamic equilibrium or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci.

**Implications:** Our study highlights unexpected complexity in TF interactions on DNA, underscoring the need for single-molecule methods to detect novel mechanisms. The genomic-divers model suggests that Sox and Oct sometimes help, sometimes hinder each other across the genome, challenging previous assumptions of ordered assembly. This finding has significant ramifications for interpreting single-m data and understanding TF interactions across the genome.

**Conclusions:** Our analysis reveals tantalizing possibility of energy expenditure in Sox and Oct's action on DNA, previously unexplored in living cells. Single-molecule methods offer exciting capabilities to unravel such mechanisms. The variation in cooperativity across genome suggests that single-m data, coupled with experimental strategy, provides more information than expected. Notably, a single number can indicate both positive and negative cooperativity across loci in vivo. The genomic-divers model implies either energy expenditure or mixed cooperativity, with Sox and Oct helping each other at some loci and hindering at others. This study underscores the need for further investigation into TF interactions across the genome to properly interpret single-m data.

**Title:** Detection of Bacterial Endotoxins via a Gustatory Pathway in Drosophila melanogaster

**Research Question:** Do Drosophila melanogaster possess sensory mechanisms to detect bacterial endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), prior to infection, and if so, what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

**Methods:** We investigated the aversive responses of Dophila to L and the role of gustatory neurons expressing Gr66 receptors and the chemosensory channel TRPA1 in L detection.

**Findings:** We found that Doph display strong aversive responses to L and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66 mediate avoidance of L in feeding and egg assays. The expression of TR1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for L avoidance. Furthermore, L stimulates Doph neurons in a TR1-dependent manner and activates exogenous TR1 channels in human cells.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoins via a gustatory pathway through TR1 activation, a conserved mechanism. The avoidance of L-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections, compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals.

**Conclusions:** Our results show that flies possess a gustatory mechanism underlying detection and avoidance of L. The fact that this mechanism exploits TR1 suggests a broadly conserved principle whereby channels play a role in L detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of the sensory modality involved. Our findings, together with evidence of olfactory detection of secondary metabolites Gram-positive bacteria, highlight the importance of conserved mechanisms in host-pathogen interactions.

**Title:** Identification of Zfp as a Transcription Factor Essential for Naïve T Cell Maturation

**Research Question:** The mechanisms governing the maturation of naïve lymphocytes, a critical for immune function, remain incompletely understood. We investigated the role of Zfp, a zinc finger protein, in this process.

**Methods:** We generated a mouse mutant, Zfpbl, harboring a hypomorphic mutation in Zfp. Zfpbl/bl mice exhibited a naïve cell deficiency due to an intrinsic defect beginning in the thymus and continuing into the periphery, affecting cells that had undergone thym egress.

**Findings:** The effects of Zfp were multigenic and could not be attributed to altered thic selection, proliferation, or B2-dependent survival. Zfp bound to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its targets were enriched in categories related to metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring expression of one target, An2, partially rescued cell maturation.

**Implications:** These findings identify Zfp as a transcription factor and regulator of late-stage intrathic and post-thic cell maturation.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel role for Zfp in T maturation. Analyzing mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation in C2 zinc finger Zfp, we revealed a selective defect in accumulation naïve cells from maturation in thymocytes and recent thic emigrants. Zfp regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes. We identified a set of Zfp targets in thymocytes and showed decreased Zfp occupancy at a subset alters expression in mutant thocytes. Together, our findings provide evidence Zfp functions as a factor and regulator of transcription program required T maturation.

**Key Findings:**

* Zfp is essential for naïve T cell maturation
* Zfp regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes
* Zfp targets are enriched in metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation
* Restoring An2 expression partially rescues cell maturation
* Zfp is a transcription factor and regulator of late-stage intrath and post-th cell maturation

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of mRNA:ncRNA Interactions in Protein Abundance Regulation: A Novel Insights into the Mechanisms of Translational Efficiency

**Research Question:** Do mRNA:RNA interactions significantly impact protein abundance, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms driving this relationship?

**Methods:** We employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate the relationship between mRNA:RNA interactions and protein abundance. Firstly, we generated synonymous variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with varying potential for mRNA:RNA interactions and demonstrated a strong correlation between GFP levels and avoidance. Next, we analyzed 97 species and found a reduced capacity for mRNA:RNA interactions relative to controls. Furthermore, we generated variant mRNAs that differ in their potential to interact with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and showed that GFP levels can be predicted and controlled.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate a strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA:RNA interactions across prokaryotes, which has a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. Moreover, measuring extrinsic avoidance using shuffled mRN as controls revealed that mRNA:RNA interactions are significantly underrepresented in 73% of proary phyla (p<0.05). These findings establish a signature of selection acting to minimize mRNA:RNA interactions. However, with thousands of potential interacting RNAs in simple proary systems, complete avoidance is combinatorially unlikely, suggesting a trade-off between avoidance and optimal expression.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that mRNA:RNA interactions impact protein levels, and taking them into account will enable precise protein expression control. We predict that mRNAs with low avoidance will produce fewer proteins per transcript than those with high avoidance. To test this, we conducted a meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data and found a significant correlation between mRNA:RNA measures and protein levels.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of translational efficiency, mRNAncRNA avoidance, and demonstrates its impact on protein abundance. Our findings have significant implications for the design of constructs where protein levels can be precisely controlled. Furthermore, they highlight the importance of considering mRNA:RNA interactions in understanding protein regulation.

**Title:** Unraveling the Complexity of Neuromuscular Junction Denervation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Longitudinal In Vivo Imaging Reveals Asynchronous Motor Unit Dismantling and New Synapse Formation**

**Research Question:** Does neuromuscular junction (NM) denervation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) result from global motor neuron degeneration or local branch-specific events?

**Methods:** We employed longitudinal in vivo imaging of single motor axons and their neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in SOD1G37 mice over a three-month period to investigate the dynamics of NM denervation in ALS.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that motor units are dismantled asynchronously, with axonal branches being dismantled prior to complete degeneration, accompanied by contemporaneous axonal sprouting and synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events propagate from the first NM, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible.

**Implications:** These findings indicate that NM denervation in ALS is a complex process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden motor degeneration. A temporal window exists between branch-specific dismantling and global axonal degeneration, which could be therapeutically exploited.

**Conclusions:** Our longitudinal in vivo analysis reveals a previously unsuspected dynamism at the NM in an animal model of ALS, highlighting a long window between early branch-specific dismantling and motor degeneration. Local-specific events may play a key role in NM denervation, as rescue of neuronal loss in S1 mice does not necessarily improve NM denervation. Alterations in synaptic function and molecular signaling occur early at NM in ALS, suggesting a complex interplay of local and global mechanisms in disease progression.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Tamoxifen-Induced Side Effects: A Mouse Model Reveals ERα Signaling in the Hypothalamus-PO Mediates Thermoregulation, Movement, and Bone Homeostasis

**Research Question:** Despite the efficacy of tamoxifen in improving breast cancer survival, its long-term treatment is marred by debilitating side effects, including hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood, partly due to the lack of suitable animal models.

**Methods:** We employed a mouse model of tamoxifen treatment to investigate its effects on thermoregulation, movement, and bone homeostasis. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed tamox-induced gene changes in the hypothalamus-preoptic area (hypothalam-PO), which were dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Conditional knockout of ERα in the hypoth-PO ablated or reversed tamox-induced gene expression.

**Findings:** ERα-deficient mice did not exhibit tamox-induced changes in temperature, movement, or bone density. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tamox on the hypothalam-PO and indicate ER mediates several physiological effects of tamox treatment in mice.

**Implications:** ERα expression in the hypoth- is necessary for tamox-induced changes in gene expression and effects on thermg, bone, and movement. These suggest tamox treatment modulates ER signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology. Given ER's roles in mediating many aspects of physiology, and the effect of ER knockout on tamox transcriptome, we asked if loss of ER would affect physiological responses to tam in mice. We measured temperature, movement, and density in ER1KO mice equivalently with wild-type animals.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the utility of mice as a model for studying tamox physiological effects. Tamox administration in mice increases heat dissipation, decreases movement, and increases bone density. Together, these reveal widespread effects of tamox treatment on the hypoth- and implicate ERα signaling as a major mediator of effects on thermg, movement, and homeasis. This rodent model of tamox treatment mimics several key side effects of endocrine therapy in humans.

**Title:** ISG15: A Novel Interferon-Stimulated Ubiquitin-Like Protein with Antiviral Activity Restricts Listeria Infection

**Research Question:** How does IS15, an interferon-stimulated ubiquitin-like protein, contribute to the innate immune response against Listeria infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of IS15 in nonphocytic cells during Lister infection using in vitro and in vivo models. We employed stable isotope labeling tissue culture (SILAC) to identify ISylated proteins responsible for the protective effect of IS15.

**Findings:** IS15 expression was dramatically induced in nonphoc cells upon Lister infection, independent of type I interferon signaling. This induction depended on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA signals through STING, TBK, IR3, and IR7. Importantly, IS15 restricted Lister infection in vitro and in vivo. ISylation of ER and Golgi proteins by IS15 correlated with increased secretion of cytokines counteracting infection.

**Implications:** Our data reveal a previously uncharacterized IS15-dependent restriction of Lister infection, reinforcing IS as a key component of the innate response.

**Conclusions:** IS15 can be induced by Lister in an interfer-independent manner in human nonphoc cells. ISylation of ER and Golgi proteins by IS15 increases secretion of cytokines counteracting infection in vivo. This mirrors the phenotype of Isg−/− MEFs, indicating IS's role in defense against Lister requires ISylation.

**Title:** DeepRET: An Automated Single-Molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer Analysis using Deep Learning for Biomolecular Dynamics

**Research Question:** Can a deep learning-based approach be developed to automate the analysis of single-molecule Försteron resonance energy transfer (smRET) data, enabling rapid and objective quantification of biomolecular dynamics?

**Methods:** We present DeepRET, an open-source, standalone software that utilizes deep learning to analyze smRET data with minimal human intervention, requiring only a user-adjustable threshold for image quality. Integrating standard smRET features, DeepRET outputs kinetic metrics, outperforming human operators with >95% accuracy and requiring ~1% of the time.

**Findings:** DeepRET achieved high accuracy on ground truth data, demonstrating its capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics and contribute to benchmarking smRET for structural biology. Training on simulated or high-quality data, we expect neural networks like DeepRET to enable fully automated methodologies for biomolecular recognition, folding, and resolution.

**Implications:** DeepRET, with a pre-trained DNN core, offers rapid, objective, and accurate assessment of smRET for quantifying biomolecular dynamics. The fully automated software operates with minimal human intervention, requiring only a threshold on data quality, outputting detailed quantification of structural from raw images. DeepRET comes as a free, executable for Windows and Mac users, allowing end-users with limited skills to operate.

**Conclusions:** Deep-based analysis outperforms other approaches by recognizing patterns and learning features from raw data, allowing implementation of routines without extensive preprocessing or empirically defined rules, and reproducible evaluation of single-molecule data. It is faster than human for large datasets, coming close to or improved classification without preprocessing or post-inspection data, illustrating DeepRET's power to operate without interventions and benchmark reproducibility of smRET methods for multiple systems.

**Title:** SCML2, a Polycomb Group Protein, Regulates Epigenetic Gene Expression through RNA Binding and Interaction with Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1)

**Research Question:** How does SCML, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, contribute to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression by interacting with Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC)?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of SCML, a Polycomb group protein, in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by examining its interaction with PR1 and RNA binding properties.

**Findings:** We found that SCMLA, an isoform of SCML, tightly associated with chromatin, contributes to PR localization and repression of certain Polycomb targets. SCML binds PR1 via its SPM domain and interacts with RNA through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). Targeting SCML to chrom involves coordinated action of MB domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PR1 through SPM. Deletion of BR reduces SCML occupancy at target genes and overexpression of mutant SCML lacking BR causes PR recruitment defects.

**Implications:** Our results suggest a role for RNA in regulating SCML function and that SCML participates in epigen control directly with PR1.

**Conclusions:** SCML is a Poly group protein that binds RNA and contributes to repression of Poly targets, shedding light on the interplay between RNA and epigen regulation and combinator factors driving specificity of Poly complexes in different contexts. Our data show RNA plays a role in SCML function, required for localization to chromatin. In Dophila, interaction SCM and PR relies on C-terminal SPM (Peterson et al., 2004), our results show conserved in humans. We propose a model where BR contributes localization SCML to chrom, interacting PR, creating chrom environment refractory to transcription.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Sec-Mediated Translational Stalling in Escherichia coli Ribosomes through Cryo-EM Structures

**Research Question:** How does the C-terminal sequence of SecM regulate the Sec-dependent secretion pathway in Escheria coli ribosomes, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms of translational stalling at the atomic level?

**Methods:** We employed single-particle cryoEM to analyze Sec-stalled ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) purified from an in vitro translation system in Escheria coli, revealing two distinct stalling mechanisms at different elongation steps of the translation cycle.

**Findings:** Our cryo-EM structures of Sec-stalled ribosomes at 3.3-3.7 resolution reveal two stalling mechanisms: (1) inactivation of the ribosomal peptid-transfer center inhibiting peptide bond formation with incoming tRNA, and (2) prolonged pept-RNA residence at the A site inhibiting full tRNA translocation. These findings demonstrate control of translation by regulatory peptides through dynamic reshaping of the ribosomal center.

**Implications:** Our results provide atomic-level understanding of Sec-dependent translational stalling, shedding light on how Sec nascent peptides modulate translation in distinct steps. Together with previous structural studies of ribosomes stalled by antibiotics, our work reveals diverse mechanisms of translational control.

**Conclusions:** Our cryo-EM structures of Sec-st ribosomes reveal two distinct stalling mechanisms at elongation steps, providing insights into the molecular basis of Sec-dependent translational stalling in Escheria ribosomes. These findings have implications for understanding translational control and regulation in bacteria, highlighting the dynamic reshaping of the ribosomal center by regulatory peptides.

**Research Question:** This study investigates the relationship between foveal cone density and axial length in eyes, aiming to elucidate the structural changes occurring at the fovea center during myopic progression.

**Methods:** We employed an Adaptive Optics Scanning Ophthalmoscope to image cones at the fove in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, the fove cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fove, but not proportionally to length. Despite retinal stretching (cones/mm2), myopes exhibit higher angular density (cones/deg) around the fove compared to emmetropes, potentially offering better visual acuity. Reports of best-corrected fove vision deficits in myopes compared to emrop cannot be explained by increased spacing photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during my progression.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that myopes have higher fove photore sampling, enabling better performance on visual tasks compared to emrop. This contradicts previous studies implicating retinal stretching as a cause for myopic deficits. Instead, our results indicate that the fove cone mosaic adapts to compensate for axial elongation, preserving visual acuity.

**Conclusions:** This study provides definitive analysis of cone density at the fove center as a function of eye length, resolving a long-standing question in the field. Our findings have significant implications for understanding myopic vision and visual acuity, highlighting the importance of fove adaptation in maintaining visual performance.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Determinants of Streptococcus pneumoniae Carriage Duration: A Genome-Wide Analysis of Longitudinal Swab Data

**Background:** Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, particularly in low-income settings, and asymptomatic nasophary carriage is a prerequisite for disease. However, the variability in its duration is currently understood only at the serotype level.

**Research Question:** We aimed to develop a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combine these with whole genome data to estimate the genetic contribution of pneumoccal variation to carriage duration.

**Methods:** We analyzed longitudinal swab data from a cohort of infants and combined with whole genome data to estimate heritability of carriage duration. We partitioned herit into lineage and locus effects and quantified the attributable sources of variation.

**Findings:** Pneumoccal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype, whereas host traits (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. We identified the largest sources of variation: serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other locus (7%). A pan-genome-wide association study revealed prophage sequences associated with decreased carriage independent of serotype, potentially disrupting the competence mechanism.

**Implications:** These findings support theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and antibiotic resistance. Our analysis shows that variants other than serotype affect carriage, consistent with recent work (Leinen et al., 2017). We identified candidates for loci fulfilling this role, suggesting pneumoc genome variants alter carriage, linked to antibiotic resistance.

**Conclusions:** The pneumoc genome explains most variability in carriage duration, with serotype and erythromycin resistance causing 19% and prophage presence/absence 7%. This has corollaries on pneumoc genome diversification through frequent infection loss of prophage during episodes. The genetics of S. pneumonia is a factor in determining duration in this population. Environmental conditions, such as host status, may alter herit estimate.

**Title:** Elucidating the Stoichiometry of the KCN1-KCNE Complex: A Key to Modulating Cardiac Repolarization**

**Research Question:** The stoichiometry between the α-subunit KCN1 and β-subunit KCNE of the slow rectifier current (IK) channel has been a subject of controversy, with reports ranging from a strict 2:4 to variable 4:4 ratio. This study aimed to clarify the stoichi using fusion proteins linking KCNE to one, two, or four KCN1 subunits.

**Methods:** We generated fusion proteins linking KCNE to one (EQ), two (EQ), or four (QQQ) KC1 subunits to reproduce 4:4, 2:4, or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings showed EQ and EQQ to have hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter latency compared to EQ, abolished by addition of KC1. Using UV-crosslink unnatural amino acid in KC1, we found EQQ and EQ crosslink rates to be slowed compared KC1, demonstrating no intrinsic limit to association of up four-subunits within IK complex.

**Findings:** Our results indicate flexibility in KC1 β-sub association, both in number and type, allows for modulation of repolarization in the heart through changes in expression. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings revealed EQ and EQ to have hyperpolar activation, reduced conductance, and shorter latency compared to EQ, abolished by addition of KC1. UV-crosslink unnatural amino acid in KC1 showed EQ and EQ crosslink rates to be progressively slowed compared KC1, demonstrating no intrinsic limit to association of four-sub within IK complex.

**Implications:** This study clarifies the stoichi of KC1-KCNE complex, a crucial for modulating repolar in the heart. The flexibility in KC1 β-sub association allows for powerful modulation of repolar through changes in expression. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the role of IK in health and disease, particularly in conditions such as arrhythmias.

**Conclusion:** The stoichi of KC1-KC complex is not fixed, but rather flexible, allowing for modulation of repolar in the heart through changes in expression. This study provides new insights into the complex and its role in cardiac repolar, with implications for understanding and treating arrhythmias.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Macrophages in Tissue Regeneration: A Double-Edged Swords in Tissue Repair

**Research Question:** How do interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and macrophages contribute to tissue regeneration, and what are the consequences of their dysregulation?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of IL-1β and macrophages in zebraf fin regeneration using a combination of genetic, molecular, and cellular approaches.

**Findings:** We found that IL-1β expression is induced in epithelial cells in response to tissue injury, leading to apoptosis of regenerative cells in myoid-defective zraf mutants. Macrophages attenuate IL-1 expression and resolve inflammation, necessary for survival of regenerative cells. IL-1 plays a crucial role in fin regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes.

**Implications:** Our study reveals that IL-1 and inflammation act as double-edged swords: required for regeneration, but excessive impair tissue regeneration. Proper levels of IL-1 signaling and inflammation, tuned by macrophages, are necessary for tissue regeneration.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the role of macroph in attenuating IL-1 expression and inflammation during tissue regeneration. We demonstrate that IL-1 is provided by epithelial cells in response to injury, and that macroph are responsible for IL-1 attenuation and resolution. Our data suggest that normal IL-1 expression and inflammatory response are necessary for tissue regeneration to activate regeneration-induced genes. Collectively, these data support the notion that excessive IL-1 signaling and inflammation in tissue cause apoptosis in the mutant. Our study highlights the function of IL-1 and inflammatory response in tissue regeneration, emphasizing the importance of proper levels of IL-1 and inflammation, tuned by macroph, for tissue progression.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Protein Properties and Ionic Strength on Translational Diffusion in the Cytoplasm of Prokaryotes

**Research Question:** How do protein surface properties and ionic strength influence the translational diffusion of proteins in the cytoplasm of proaryotes, and what are the implications for the composition of the cytoplasm proteome?

**Methods:** We employed surface-modified fluorescent proteins (FPs) to measure translational coefficients (D) in the cytoplasm of Escheria coli, Lactoccus lactis, and Haloaxii. We analyzed the dependence of D on protein net charge and charge distribution, as well as the effect of electrostatic screening and ribosome interactions.

**Findings:** In E. coli, D depends on net charge and distribution, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative ones. This effect is weaker in L. lact and H. due to electrostatic screening. Decrease in mobility is caused by interaction of positive FPs with ribosomes, confirmed in vivo and in vitro with purified ribosomes. Ribosome properties may limit cytoplasmic proteome composition.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a paradox in proary endosymbiotic functioning. In L. lact and H, slowdown with increasing positive charge is less pronounced due to electrostatic screening. Decrease in D is mainly caused by binding of positive to ribosomes, with KD on order µM, indicating non-selective interactions. Ribosome properties may limit cytoplasm proteome composition.

**Conclusions:** Transl diffusion of proteins in E. coli depends on net charge and distribution, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative. This effect is weaker in L. and H due to electrostatic screening. Decrease in mobility is caused by interaction of positive with ribosomes. Ribosome properties may limit cytoplasmic proteome composition. These findings have implications for understanding proary endosymbiotic functioning and the role of ribosomes in protein synthesis.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Regeneration in Planarians: Identification of S-follatin as a Key Regulator of Regenerative Responses to Tissue Absence

**Research Question:** How do planarians distinguish between injuries involving varying amounts of tissue loss and regulate distinct wound programs, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying these responses?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Sollatin, a homolog of the TGF-β inhibitor follatin, in planarian regeneration using RNA interference (RNAi) and gene expression analysis.

**Findings:** Soll is required for molecular and cellular responses to tissue absence during regeneration, and its inhibition of Activin signaling is necessary for regeneration to occur. Soll expression is wound-induced and persists at higher levels following injuries causing tissue absence. Two Activin homologs, S-activ-1 and Sactiv-2, are required for the Soll phenotype.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that Soll inhibits Activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence, identifying a critical mechanism for initiation of the regenerative process across the animal kingdom.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies Soll as the first gene required for regeneration-specific responses in planarians, and highlights the importance of Activin signaling in regenerative processes. Our findings inform a broad understanding of regenerative mechanisms in long-living animals.

**Title:** Mismatch Repair-Deficient Tumors Exhibit a Distinct Molecular Fingerprint and Resistance to Standard Therapy: Implications for Diagnostics and Therapeutics**

**Research Question:** What is the molecular fingerprint of mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors and how do they exhibit resistance to standard therapy?

**Methods:** We employed whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing to analyze 28 tumor-normal pairs, including 5 MMR-deficient and 23 M-proficient tumors. We validated indel mutations using orthogonal technologies and assessed microsatellite instability (MSI) using the extended Bethesda panel, immunohistochemistry of MMR proteins, and methylation of the ML1 promoter.

**Findings:** MMR-deficient tumors exhibited a distinct molecular signature from other tumors but surprisingly similar to germline DNA, indicating a substantial fraction of genetic variation arises from escaping MMR. We identified a set of recurrent indels that may serve as a marker for MSI. Using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, we optimized a novel marker capable of detecting MSI with greater specificity and selectivity than standard tests. Recurrent indels were enriched in the DNA-strand break by homologous recombination pathway. DSB repair was reduced in M-deficient tumors, triggering dose-dependent sensitivity to DSB inducers.

**Implications:** MMR-deficient tumors exhibit a distinct molecular fingerprint and resistance to standard therapy. Our findings have implications for diagnostically assessing and therapeutically targeting M-deficient tumors.

**Conclusions:** MMR-deficient tumors exhibit a distinct molecular signature from other tumors but similar to germline DNA, indicating a substantial fraction of genetic variation arises from escaping M. We identified a set of recurrent ind that may serve as a marker for MSI. Our novel marker for MSI detection has greater specificity and selectivity than standard tests. Recurrent ind are enriched in the DNA-strand break by homolog recombination pathway. D repair is reduced in M-def tumors, triggering dose-dependent sensitivity to D inducers. These findings have implications for diagnost assessing and therapeut targeting M-def tumors.

**Title:** Optogenetic Control of Biological Processes with Enhanced Magnets: A Novel Light-Inducible Dimer Protein Modules for Precise and Spatial Control

**Research Question:** Can we engineer a novel light-inducible dimer protein module, Magn, to enable precise and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive manner?

**Methods:** We engineered Magn from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor by orthogonalizing the homodimer interface into complementary heterodimers. Magn components, which are well-tolerated as protein partners, photorequire simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling spatiemporal confinement of dimer with single excitation. However, Magn require concatization for efficient responses and preinc at 28°C to be functional. To overcome these limitations, we engineered an optimized Magn pair requiring neither concatization nor low preinc.

**Findings:** We validated the 'enhanced Magn (eags) by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit to subcellular organelles, induce organel contacts, and reconstitute OS-VAP-ERol tether implicated in phosphidyositol-4-phosphate metabolism. eags represent a effective tool to optogen manipulate physiological processes whole or subcell volumes.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate the potential of Magn as a novel optogenetic tool for precise and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive manner. eags offer advantages over existing systems, including rapid association and dissociation kinetics, and low background activation, making them suitable for optogen modulation of small subcell volumes and organelles.

**Conclusions:** We engineered an optimized Magn pair, eags, with greater thermal stability and dimer efficiency as well as faster association and dissociation kinetics. We confirmed their effectiveness in various applications, including protein recruitment to different organel, expansion of organel sites, and rapid reconstitution of V-dependent organel teth with key functions in lipid transport. eags represent a powerful tool for optogenetic manipulation of biological processes, enabling precise and spatial control in a non-invasive manner.

**Title:** Unraveling the Signaling Pathways Triggered by Ribosome Stalling in Neurodegeneration: A Critical Role of the Integrated Stress Response Pathway

**Research Question:** What are the signaling pathways triggered by ribosome stalling during neurodegeneration, and how do they impact neuronal survival?

**Methods:** We investigated the brain of C57/BL/6-Gbp2f2-/- mice, where elongation complexes are stalled at AG codons due to deficiencies in tRNA and Gbp2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor.

**Findings:**

* Increased phosphorylation of eIFα (Ser51) was detected prior to neurodegeneration in these mice
* Transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway
* Genetic experiments showed this pathway was activated by e2 kinase, GC2, in a deacylated tRNA-independent fashion
* ISR attenuated neurogeneration in C57/BL/6-Gbp2-/- mice, underscoring the importance of cellular context on the outcome of this pathway

**Implications:**

* Ribosome stalling activates GC2, a previously unknown mechanism linking elongation and initiation of translation
* Failure to resolve elong complexes in mammalian neurons results in degeneration, but pathways triggered by these complexes were unknown
* GC2 activates ISR in the brain of mice with stalled ribosomes, demonstrating a feedback loop between elongation defects and initiation
* ATF activation is vital for survival of neurons during ribosome stalling

**Conclusions:**

Our results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress. The integrated stress response pathway is activated by GC2 in response to ribosome stalling, which attenuates neurogeneration in C57/BL/6-Gbp2/- mice. These findings highlight the importance of cellular context on the outcome of this pathway and suggest ribosome stalling may contribute to GC2 activation in other conditions, such as amino acid deprivation. The exact mechanism of GC2 activation by rib stalling remains unclear.

**Title:** Uneven Global Changes in Adult Height Over the 20th Century: Implications for Longevity and Socioeconomic Outcomes**

**Research Question:** How has adult height changed across the world over the past century, and what are the implications for longevity and socioeconomic outcomes?

**Methods:** We analyzed 147 population-based studies with measurements of over 18.6 million participants, estimating height for individuals born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries.

**Findings:** The largest gains in adult height occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% CI 17.5-22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3-19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, little change in adult height was observed in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The tallest individuals were men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, averaging 182.5 cm, while the shortest were women born in Guatemala (140.3; 135.8-144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations 100 years ago remained the same for women and increased for men, despite changes in country rankings.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that adult height has changed unevenly across the world, with no indication of convergence. The height differential between the tallest and shortest was 19 cm for men and 20 for women 100 years ago, and remained the same for women and increased for men, despite changes in country rankings. The largest gains since the 1896 birth cohort occurred in South Korean and Iranian men, who became 20.2 (17.5-22.7) and 16.5 (13.3-19.3) taller than women in Guatemala. Women were taller than 158 in Norway, Iceland, USA, and Samoa. The tallest populations 100 years ago lived in Central Europe, North America, and Pacific islands. Men in Sweden, Norway, and USA surpassed 171, 18 taller than in Laos. Men in 199 surpassed 181 in Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, and Denmark, with Dutch at 182.5 (180.6-184.5), the tallest on the planet. The gap with shortest countries Timor, Yemen, and Laos, men only 160 tall is 22, an increase 4 on the global in 189 birth.

**Conclusion:** Our study highlights the substantial and uneven changes in adult height across the world, with implications for longevity and socioeconomic outcomes. The largest gains in height occurred in South Korean and Iranian men, while little change was observed in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The tallest individuals were born in Netherlands, while shortest in Guatemala. The differential between tallest and shortest populations remained the same for women and increased for men, despite changes in country rankings. These findings have implications for understanding the relationship between height, longevity, and socioeconomic outcomes.

**Title:** Uncovering the Neural Mechanisms of Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression: Identification of Critical Brain Regions and Neurons Mediating Overdose

**Research Question:** What are the key brain regions and cell types responsible for mediating opioid-induced respiratory depression, a major contributor to the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States?

**Methods:** Using a murine model, we investigated the effects of opioid administration on breathing patterns and identified the brainstem's breathing circuitry as the primary site of action. Local elimination of the µ-opioid receptor confirmed the brainstem's role. Genetic tools revealed 70-140 neurons in the pre-Bötzinger Complex, the breathing rhythm's origin, as sensitive to opioids. Characterization of these neurons may lead to novel therapies preventing respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.

**Findings:** We found that Opr1 glutamatergic preöC neurons mediate the effect, and surprisingly, just 70 glutamateric neurons are sufficient to rescue depression of the preö rhythm. Given the importance of Db1 neurons in rhythm generation, we hypothesize opioids act by silencing presynaptic release, removing these neurons from the network. Alternatively, a subset of preö excitatory neurons may generate inspiratory rhythm, with Opr1 enriched in this subgroup. Opr1 is expressed in central and peripheral nervous systems, modulating breathing sites like cortex, brainstem control, motor, solitary nucleus, and afferents.

**Implications:** Our study identifies a dominant site driven by 140 critical neurons in vitro, not required for opioid-induced analgesia, a target for safer opioids or rescue strategies. Deletion of µ-opi receptor from both sites eliminates OIRD, even high doses of potent fentanyl, suggesting targeting these sites rescues respiratory depression. Remaining effects may be due to incomplete transduction or minor sites.

**Conclusions:** This study uncovers the neural mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression, identifying critical regions and neurons mediating overdose. Characterization of these neurons may lead to novel therapies preventing respiratory depression while sparing analgesia. Our findings suggest a dominant site driven by 140 neurons, not required for opioid analgesia, a target for safer opioids or rescue strategies. Deletion of µ-opi receptor eliminates OIRD, even high doses of fentanyl, suggesting targeting these sites rescues respiratory depression. Remaining effects may be due incomplete transduction or minor sites.

**Title:** Identification of Sodium Taurochotransport Polypeptide (NTCP) as a Functional Receptor for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) Infection**

**Research Question:** What is the identity of the receptor(s) responsible for the cellular entry of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis delta virus (HD) into hepatocytes?

**Methods:** Using a combination of biochemical and virological approaches, including zero-distance cross-linking and affinity purification, we investigated the interaction between the pre-S domain of the large envelope protein of HBV and potential receptors on hepatocytes.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that sodium taurochotransport polypeptide (NT), a transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver, specifically interacts with the pre-S domain of HB and functions as a common receptor for both viruses. Silencing NT inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NT expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatarcinoma cells susceptible to these infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157-165 of nonfunctional monkey NT with human counterpart conferred ability to support both viral infections.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that NT is a functional receptor for HBV and HD, resolving a long-standing question in the field. The pre-S domain of the protein is a key determinant for entry of both viruses and mediates interaction with the receptor on hepatocytes.

**Conclusions:** Our study identifies NT as the first confirmed functional receptor for HBV and HD, a major public health problem worldwide. Understanding the interaction between NT and HBV/HD will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for prevention and treatment of these diseases.

**Title:** Sepsis-Induced Changes in the Memory CD8 T Cell Compartment: A Long-Term Alterations in Phenotype, Function, and Localization

**Research Question:** What are the long-term effects of sepsis on the composition, function, and localization of memory CD8 T cells, and how do these changes impact the host's ability to respond to re-infection?

**Methods:** Utilizing a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced seps, we investigated the impact of seps on central memory CD8 T cells (TCM) and effector memory CD8 cells (TEM). We compared the proliferation, transcriptional profile, and chromatin accessibility of CD8 cells from septic and non-septic mice. Additionally, we assessed the capacity of memory CD8 cells to control Listeria monocytogen infection.

**Findings:** We observed increased proliferation of TCM in septic mice and patients, leading to changes in the composition and localization of the memory CD8 cell compartment. Pre-existing memory CD8 cells numerically recover after seps, potentially due to increased proliferation in response to seps-induced lymphopenia. The transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility of memory CD8 cells from seps survivors indicate long-lasting intrinsic changes. Seps-induced changes in the memory CD8 cell pool resulted in altered function and reduced capacity to control Listeria monocogen infection.

**Implications:** Seps leads to long-term alterations in memory CD8 cell phenotype, function, and localization, potentially changing the host's capacity to respond to re-infection.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that seps accelerates the adoption of time-dependent changes in the composition of the memory CD8 cell pool. The preferential proliferation of TCM alters the composition and localization of pre-existing memory CD8 cells after seps. The changes in the biology of central and effector memory cells underlie the mechanism by which central CD8 cells become over-represent in pre-existing populations after seps. These findings have significant implications for understanding the long-term consequences of seps on the immune response to re-infection.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mechanism of LINE-1 Retrotransposition Inhibition by APOBEC3A3 Cytidine Deaminase

**Research Question:** How does APOEC3A3 cytidine deaminase inhibit LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition in human cells?

**Methods:** We employed in vitro and in vivo assays to investigate the mechanism of A3-mediated inhibition of L1 retroposition. We used the L Element Amplification Protocol (LEAP) to recapitulate the first cDNA synthesis step of L integration and analyzed the effects of A3 on L retroposition.

**Findings:** Our data demonstrate that A3 inhibits L1 retroposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA during the process of L integration. Engineered L retroposition events from cultured cells co-expressing A3 and uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) showed strand-specific A3-mediated C-to-U deamination. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how A3 cytidine deamin protein inhibits L retroposition.

**Implications:** Our results resolve the long-standing mystery of how A3 inhibits L retroposition. The deamination of single-strand DNA in the pre-integration site leads to insertions/deletions (indels) in the post-integration site, which could explain why previous studies failed to detect A-mediated events in retroposed L sequences.

**Conclusions:** APOEC3 cytidine deamin is a potent inhibitor of LINE-1 retroposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA during the process of integration. This mechanism explains why overexpression of wild-type A3, but not deamin-deficient A3 mutants, potently inhibits L retro in cultured cells. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the regulation of LINE-1 retroposition in human cells and the role of A in genomic stability.

**Title:** The Role of Activity-Regulated Ras GTPase Rem2 in Sensory Experience-Dependent Neural Plasticity and Circuit Function

**Research Question:** How does the activity-regulated non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 (Rem2) contribute to the conversion of external stimuli into altered neuronal output, influencing experience-dependent plasticity and circuit function?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Rem2 in visual plasticity by examining ocular dominance (OD) plasticity during the critical period and at the cellular level, focusing on layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons' intrinsic excitability and synaptic function.

**Findings:** Rem2/- mice exhibited impaired ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, we established a cell-autonomous role for Rem2 in regulating intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons prior to changes in synaptic function. In vitro and in vivo recordings revealed increased spontaneous firing in the absence of Rem2.

**Implications:** Our data demonstrate that Rem2 is a key molecule regulating neuronal excitability and circuit in the context of changing sensory experience. Rem functions at the nexus of a signaling network sensing and responding to changes in neuronal activity to preserve circuit function in the face of sensory experience.

**Conclusions:** Rem2-dependent mechanisms will elucidate the molecular instructing activity-dependent modifications of neural circuit. Our findings raise the possibility that Rem may regulate the responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation through regulation of excitability or synaptic scaling. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying OD plasticity deficits in Rem-/- mice, we examined adult plasticity. Rem functions as a regulator of experience-dependent plasticity at morphological, cellular, and circuit levels, connecting molecular regulators of morphology with broader function. Given Rem expression is acutely regulated by experience, we investigated Rem's role in activity-dependent processes in the cortex following sensory deprivation by examining ocular (OD) plasticity.

**Significance:** Rem is an excellent candidate linking neural activity with plasticity. Rem is a member of the Rad/Rem/Gem/K (RG) family, a Ras subfamily of small GTPases whose expression and function are regulated by activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated channels.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Claims of Magnetism in Biological Systems: A Critical Analysis of the Proposed Mechanisms and Implications

**Research Question:** Can magnetic fields indeed influence biological molecules and cells as proposed by recent studies, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms and implications?

**Methods:** A critical analysis of existing literature on magnetism in biological systems, focusing on reports of protein complexes acting as magnetic compasses (Qin et al., 2016), magnetic control of membrane conductance by ferritin (Stanley et al., 201; Wheeler et al., 2016), and magnetogenetic systems (201).

**Findings:** The proposed mechanisms of magnetism in biological systems conflict with basic laws of physics, exhibiting discrepancies of 5-10 orders of magnitude. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes limits their utility for magnetically sensitive cells. Forces and torques produced are too small to affect molecular orientation or membrane channels.

**Implications:** If the phenomena occur, they must rely on different mechanisms. Barring new discoveries on biological matter structure, magnetogen routes based on pulling ferritin/channel with magnetic fields have no chance of success.

**Conclusions:**

Recent studies on magnetism in biological systems have sparked interest in magnetogenetics, the dream of controlling cells with magnetic fields. However, a critical analysis reveals discrepancies between proposed mechanisms and laws of physics. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes limits their utility for magnetically sensitive cells. Forces and torques produced are too small to affect molecular orientation or membrane channels. If the phenomena occur, they must rely on different mechanisms. Barring new discoveries on biological structure, magnetogen routes have no chance of success.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Prospero in Regulating Stem Cell Quies in Drosophila Neuroblasts

**Research Question:** How do stem cells switch between self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying this transition?

**Background:** Drosila neuroblasts have been an excellent model for studying self-renew and differentiation, but quies remains poorly understood.

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Prosper, a transcription factor, in regulating quies in Drosila neuroblasts.

**Findings:** We show that Prosper is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus prior to entry into quies, followed by establishment of a unique molecular profile lacking progenitor and differentiation markers. Low levels of Prosper precede entry into quies, even when timing is advanced or delayed by temporal factors. Loss of Prosper prevents quies, whereas low levels drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quies.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that Prosper levels distinguish three progenitor states: absent self-renew, low quies, and high differentiation.

**Conclusions:** We propose that Prosper is a key regulator of quies in Dila neuroblasts, with transient low levels marking entry into quies. Our results have implications for stem cell therapeutics, as understanding how stem cells switch between states is crucial for regenerative medicine.

**Key Findings:**

* Prosper is transiently detected in neuroblast nucleus prior to quies
* Loss of Prosper prevents quies
* Low levels drive proliferating larval neurobl into quies
* levels distinguish three progenitor states: absent selfnew, low quies, high differentiation

**Title:** Unraveling the Mysteries of HIV-1 Capsid Disassembly: A Single-Molecule Fluorescence Microscopy Reveals Kinetics and Regulation

**Research Question:** How is the metastable HIV-1 capsid disassembly process regulated, and how can it be modulated, to facilitate the release of viral DNA prior to nuclear import?

**Methods:** We developed a single-molecule fluorescence microscopy method to track real-time unco kinetics of authentic HIV-1 capsids in vitro after permeabilizing the viral membrane.

**Findings:**

1. Opening the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step of unco, followed by rapid, catastrophic collapse.
2. Caps-binding PF74 accelerates caps opening but stabilizes the lattice.
3. Binding of polyan to a conserved arginine cluster in lattice delays initiation of unco but does not prevent lattice disassembly.

**Implications:** Different stages of unco can be controlled by the interplay between capsid regulators, determining overall unco kinetics.

**Conclusions:**

Our single-molecule fluorescence microscopy reveals that HIV-1 caps disassembly is a tightly regulated process, with distinct stages controlled by interplay between capsid regulators. Caps-binding molecules exhibit differential effects on initiation and continuation of unco. The structural heterogeneity of HIV-1 caps is described, with assembly yielding conical, tubular, and other shapes containing lattice defects. Our assay resolves intermediates in disassembly averaged in traditional ensemble measurements, allowing classification of individual caps according to unating behaviors.

**Key Findings:**

1. Capsid integrity and stability is heterogeneous, with majority containing defects and uncoating immediately after membrane removal.
2 In absence of binders, unco is all-or process proceeding rapidly after first defect created.
3 Half-life of caps is sufficient for P-permeabilized particles as platform to quantify binding labeled proteins to authentic caps at single level.

**Implications:**

Our findings provide new insights into HIV-1 caps disassembly and regulation, highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Caps-binding molecules can modulate unco kinetics, with PF74 accelerating opening and stabilizing lattice, while polyan delaying initiation but not preventing disassembly.

**Title:** Loss-of-Function Mutations in the JNK Signaling Pathway Promote Genomic Instability and Tumor Initiation in Breast Cancer

**Background:** Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, and genomic analysis of breast cancer DNA indicates frequent loss-of-function mutations in components of the JUN-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Unexpectedly, J signaling can promote cell proliferation by activating the AP transcription factor. We investigated the effect of J deficiency in murine breast epithelium.

**Research Question:** What is the role of J signaling in breast cancer development?

**Methods:** We examined the effect of J deficiency in murine mammary epithelial cells and a murine model of breast cancer.

**Findings:** Loss of J signaling caused genomic instability and development of breast cancer. Moreover, J deficiency accelerated tumor formation in a murine model of breast. These effects of J deficiency to promote development were associated with presence of neoplas and genomic instability. We show J plays a role in initiation of development.

**Implications:** The frequent J pathway loss-function mutations in breast cancer may represent driver mutations that promote development. We find J plays a role at early stages of cancer by promoting mammary neoplas. This likely accounts effect mutational of J signaling to promote development. The J pathway may be suppressed in many cancers. The association breast with reduced J signaling a correlation.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that J deficiency in mammary epithel can cause murine breast cancer and J deficiency accelerates tumor development a model breast. The significance of J pathway in cancer unclear. Our data indicate that J plays a key role in initiation of cancer by promoting neoplas and genomic instability.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Peptidylglyc α-amid Monooxygenase (PAM) in Cilogenesis: A Conserved Function in Multiple Cell Types

**Research Question:** What is the role of Peptylgly α-amid monooxygenase (P) in the assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamdomonas, planaria, and mammalian cells?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of P in Chlamdomonas reinii, planaria, and mice using RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown and gene expression analysis. We observed the effects of P knockdown on cilia assembly, Golgi architecture, and levels of ciliary components in Chlamonas and planaria. Additionally, we examined the impact of decreased P expression on motile ciliary density on the ventral surface of planaria and the appearance of cytoplasmic axemes lacking ciliary membrane.

**Findings:** Our results show that P is required for normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamonas and planaria. P knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, exhibited abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered levels of ciliary components. Decreased P expression resulted in reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface of planaria and the appearance of cytoplasmic axemes lacking ciliary membrane. Similarly, primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in P-/- mouse embryos were aberrant.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that P activity and post-Gol trafficking contribute to cili defects, providing a conserved link between amidation and cilium assembly in multiple cell types. P is crucial for biogenesis of motile cilia in C. reinii and ventral epithelium plan, as well as assembly primaryilia neuroepith cells. These findings indicate a novel conserved signaling function of P in eukoticilia.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals P as an evolutionarily conserved factor required for cogenesis in multiple cell types. P plays a conserved role in early steps of cogenesis, linking amidation and cilium in multiple cell. We propose that P was included in set of proteins trafficked to ciliary from Golgi in ancestral eukote. Our results suggest both amid and membrane roles of P contribute cogenesis.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Myosin III (My3) and Espin Interaction: A Critical Regulators of Stereocilia Development and Hearing Impairment

**Research Question:** How does Myosin III (My3) interact with Espin to regulate actin bundle assembly and stabilization in stereocilia, and what are the implications for hereditary hearing impairments?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between My3 and Espin using structural biology and biochemical approaches, including X-ray crystallography and binding assays.

**Findings:** We discovered that My3 contains a pair of repeat sequences in its tail homology motif (TH) that independently bind to ankyrin repeats of Espin, revealing a novel My3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin. The My3-Espin complex structures elucidate the binding mechanism and reveal My-induced release of Espin autoinhibition. Moreover, My3 cross-linking promotes actin fiber bundling activity of Espin.

**Implications:** Our findings provide insights into the molecular basis of My-Espin interaction, a critical for stereocilia development and maintenance, and hereditary hearing impairments. We propose that My-Espin interaction promotes formation of thicker actin fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin-induced actin bundling regulation mechanism of actin cross-link protein Espin, highlighting the importance of Espin in stereoc development and maintenance. We propose that My-Espin interaction is essential for assembly and stabilization of parallel actin bundles in stereilia. Our findings have implications for understanding hereditary hearing impairments caused by defects in My-Espin interaction.

**Key findings:**

* My3 contains two repeat sequences in TH capable of independently binding Espin with high affinity

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Voltage Sensing in Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels: A Combined Structural, Mutagenesis, and Electrophysiological Analysis of the Voltage-Sensing Domains of CaV1.1

**Research Question:** How do voltage-gated calcium channels (CaVs) achieve their diverse functions in excitable cells, such as synaptic transmission in neurons and contraction of heart and skeletal muscles, by activating at different voltages and kinetics? Specifically, what are the molecular mechanisms governing voltage sensing in the two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukotic calcium channel Ca1.1?

**Methods:** We combined computational modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and kinetics of the activated and resting states of the two functionally distinct VSDs of Ca1.1. Using the Rosetta software, we built a homology model of the human eukotic Ca1.1 based on the cryo-EM structure of Ca1.1 (Wu et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015). We generated a new structural model to study the molecular mechanisms determining specific gating properties of this voltageated channel.

**Findings:** Both VSDs displayed features of the sliding helix model, but differed in ion-pair formation of outer charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced voltage dependence, while stabilization of resting slowed kinetics. This mechanism provides a mechanistic explanation for how ionair formation in VSDs realize characteristic properties of voltageated cation channels.

**Implications:** Our study fills an important gap in understanding voltage sensing in eotic voltageated cation channels. Tested interactions predicted by the model showed effects on gating when experimentally tested by mutesis and electrophys analysis. Alterations of kinetic properties recognized experimentally were reliably explained by our model. Structures of lowest energy states Ca1.1 VSD display basic features of sliding helix model (atter et al 2017; Yarovarovoy et al 2012).

**Conclusions:** This study provides a mechanistic model for specific ionair in VSD to realize gating properties of voltageated cation channels. Our findings highlight the importance of ionair formation in VSD in voltage sensing and provide a framework for understanding the diverse functions of voltageated channels in excitable cells.

**Title:** The Role of Matrix Metalloproteinases in Adult Visual Cortex Plasticity: Unveiling the Optimal Regulation for Recovery and Learning**

**Research Question:** Do matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a crucial role in adult visual cortex plasticity, and can inhibition of their upregulation after stroke rescue lost plasticity?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of MMP inhibition on experience-dependent plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected adult mice using a combination of in vivo imaging and behavioral tests.

**Findings:** In healthy animals, 7-day application of MMP-inhib prevented plasticity, while treatment with MMP-inhib once, but not twice, rescued plasticity normally lost under stroke conditions. Our data suggest that an optimal level of MMPactivity is crucial for adult plasticity to occur.

**Implications:** These findings highlight a critical role of MMPs in adult plasticity and suggest that upregulation of MMPactivity shortly after cortical lesion compromises experience-induced plastic, which can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. Precise regulation of MMPactivity is essential for plasticity in the adult brain, offering new opportunities for treatment and recovery after stroke.

**Conclusion:** Our study demonstrates a vital role of MMP for visual cortex plastic, particularly in the increase of open responses V1 after MD, expanding previous studies from juvenile rats. Under normal conditions, MMPactivity supports brain development and function; however, different MMPaction has been described in diseased brain. Increased MMPactivity was observed 24 hours after photothromically-induced stroke, and application of broad MMP-inhib at time stroke partially rescued barrel plasticity. We tested if stroke-induced impairment of cortical plastic can be rescued by inhibiting MMP after stroke.

**Key Findings:**

* Optimal MMPactivity is essential for adult plasticity to occur in healthy and stroke-affected brain
* Upregulation of MMP shortly after cortical lesion compromises experience plastic, which can be rescued by MMP-in
Precise regulation MMPactivity is crucial for plastic in adult brain
Single treatment after stroke rescued plastic in both paradigms, while treatment twice diminished plastic-promoting effect
MMPs play a crucial role in adult plastic and MMPactivity must be within a narrow window for experience plastic to occur

**Title:** Conformational Dynamics of AMPA Receptors at Vertebrate Excitatory Synapses: Insights from Cryo-EM and Chemical Cross-Linking Studies

**Research Question:** How do auxiliary subunits influence the conformational flexibility of AMPA receptors at vertebrate excitatory synapses?

**Methods:** We employed cryo-electron microscopy and bifunctional methaniosulfate cross-linking to investigate the conformational dynamics of AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargin.

**Findings:** Our data indicate that the extracellular layer of AMP receptors can be trapped in stable, opened conformations upon long exposures to glutamate, whereas Stargin limits this conformation flexibility. Under synaptic conditions, where glutamate and auxiliary proteins are present, the extracellular domains of AMP receptors likely remain compact.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that extracellular domains of AMP receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during synaptic transmission and operate in a compact conformation regime, unless exposed to long glutamate in pathological conditions.

**Conclusions:** The presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Starg, restricts conformational flexibility of AMP receptors, limiting their ability to undergo large-scale structural changes during synaptic transmission. Our findings provide new insights into the structural dynamics of AMP receptors at vertebrate excitatory synapses and highlight the role of auxiliary subunits in regulating receptor conformation.

**Title:** Optimized Single-Cell Isolation of Immune Cells from Helmin-Infected Murine Intestines Reveals Novel Insights into Anti-Parasite Immune Responses

**Research Question:** Single-cell isolation of immune cells from helmin-infected murine intestines has been notoriously challenging due to the strong anti-parite type 2 immune responses, which drive mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration.

**Methods:** We optimized a standard intestinal digestion protocol to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from heavily infected duodenum. To validate the accuracy of these cells, we analyzed them using high-dimensional flow cytometry and confirmed findings with confocal microscopy.

**Findings:** Our optimized protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify known hallmarks of anti-parite immune responses throughout the course of helmin infection, accelerating single-cell discoveries of local helmin immune responses previously unfeasible. We characterized isolated cells using 23-color flow cytometry, incorporating hallmark and intracellular markers for type 2 responses associated with helmin infections (Maiz and Mcorley, 2016; Reynolds et al). Confocal microscopy validated changes in cell ratios between naïve and infected samples, reported by both approaches. Importantly, many changes were observed locally, highlighting the requirement for cell techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helths directly.

**Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding helmin infections, where anti-parite type 2 responses drive mucus production, alter epithelium, induce cell infiltration, and tissue remodeling (Hashimoto et al, 2009; vonolt et al 2016; Ger et al 2016; Howitt et 2016; Inanico and Sirusa 2018; Mot et 2018; Boy and Hsie 2014). Our single-cell isolation and high-dimensional analysis provide novel insights into innate and adaptive-parite responses throughout helmin infection.

**Conclusions:** Our optimized single-cell isolation and high-dimensional analysis of immune cells from helmin-infected murine intestines reveal novel hallmarks of anti-parite immune responses, previously unexplored. This approach accelerates single-cell discoveries of local helmin immune responses, previously unfeasible. Our findings have significant implications for understanding helmin infections, where anti-parite type 2 responses drive mucus production, alter epithel, induce cell infiltration, and tissue remodeling.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Proteasomal Peptide Hydrolysis: A Comprehensive Modeling and Experimental Approach to Understanding Proteas Dynamics

**Research Question:** Despite the crucial role of proteasomal degradation in regulating protein half-life and cellular processes, the mechanisms governing proteas activity remain poorly understood. This study aims to develop and validate mechanistic models of proteomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics.

**Methods:** We employed an integrated experimental and computational approach combining advances in proteas structure function and previous modeling attempts at proteas dynamics (Lie et al., 2014) to create a comprehensive model describing regulatory components of 20 proteas and interactions between substrate transport and hydrolysis over time for representative peptides.

**Findings:** Our analysis suggests the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is substrate transport into the proteome, varying between human and immuno-proteomes affecting total degradation and cleavage-site usage. Using carefully designed fluorogenic peptides with single proteas-catalyzed cleavage, we followed kinetics in real-time, observing proteas dynamics over time with purified 20 proteome and homogenates. Our model describes core proteome features reflecting prote dynamics in complex scenarios like cellular environment.

**Implications:** Polyubiquitin tagging and peptide-hydroly regulate protein-life affecting majority cellular processes. Despite biochemical and structural efforts, proteomal mechanisms, particularly differences in substrate proteysis between proteome isoforms, are incompletely understood. The 20 proteome is dynamic, catalytic activity varying over time, influenced by substrate and product interactions with proteolytic and regulatory sites.

**Conclusions:** This study provides first comprehensive model describing regulatory components 20 prote and interactions substrate transport hydroly over time for peptides, shedding light on mechanisms proteas functions. Our findings highlight the importance of substrate transport into proteome as rate-limiting step, varying between human and immuno-proteomes. This work contributes to understanding proteas dynamics, crucial for regulating protein half-life and cellular processes, with implications for metabolic and immunological processes.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel β-Alanine Transporter, Bala, Essential for Histamine Homeostasis and Visual Transmission in Drosophila

**Research Question:** How is β-alanine, a byproduct of histamine recycling, returned to retinal glial cells in Drosila, and what is its role in visual transmission?

**Methods:** We employed genetic and biochemical approaches to identify a novel β-alanine transporter, Bala, in retinal pigment cells of Drosila, and investigated its function in histamine homeostasis and visual transmission.

**Findings:** Bala mutants exhibited lower β-al levels and reduced β-al accumulation in retina. Bala is expressed in retinal cells and required for visual transmission and photaxis. β-al recycling is essential for histamine homeostasis and photore synaptic transmission.

**Implications:** Our results provide first genetic evidence for retinal cells' role in visual transmission and suggest a Bala-dependent β-al trafficking pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and visual transmission.

**Conclusions:** We identified a novel β-al transporter, Bala, in retinal cells of Dila, which recycles β-al for histamine homeasis and visual transmission. Disrupting Bala synthesis abolishes photore synaptic transmission. β-al recycling is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photore synaptic transmission. Our findings, together with previous reports, propose a complete histamine recycling pathway for sustaining photore synaptic transmission.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mysteries of Oxidative Stress in Aging: A Novel Insights from Chronological Yeast Aging

**Research Question:** What is the role of oxidative stress in chronological aging, and how does it contribute to the aging process?

**Methods:** We employed chronological aging Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to investigate the onset, extent, and targets of protein oxidation in post-mitotic cells. We monitored the thiol status of almost 300 proteins and discovered that cells undergo a redox collapse leading to massive oxidation of 80% of identified proteins several days before cell death.

**Findings:** Contrary to the free radical theory of aging, we found that oxidative stress is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, but by a substantial drop in NAD+ levels, which normally maintains cellular redox homeostasis. This decrease in NAD levels occurs early in lifespan and sets off a cascade downregulation of cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a universal lifespan-extending measure, increases NAD levels and delays each facet of the cascade. Our studies reveal a timeline of events leading to system-wide oxidation of the proteome before cell death.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that chronological aging represents a physiological stress condition that utilizes the redox buffering capacity of the thiolome. We cannot exclude that oxidation of some proteins might contribute to beneficial downregulation of cellular processes that shorten lifespan. The decrease in NAD levels and concomitant increase in redox potential is not yeast-specific, but shared with other organisms' metabolism. Yeast undergo same pattern NAD decrease, T1 oxidation, and red collapse (time-delayed) when cultivated in 2% or 0 glucose.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the role of oxidative stress in chronological aging, revealing a global red collapse of thiol-containing proteins before cell death. Our findings highlight the importance of NAD levels in maintaining redox homeostasis and suggest caloric restriction as a potential therapeutic strategy to delay aging. The chronological lifespan of S. cerevisiae represents a model for aging postmit cells, allowing us to uncover protein targets of oxidative modifications contributing to aging and establish correlation between oxidative stress and lifespan.

**Title:** Mechanistic Basis of D-aminoacyl-tRNA Deacylase: Unveiling the Enantioselective Enforcement of Homirality in Protein Synthesis**

**Research Question:** How does the enzyme D-amacyl-tRNA deacyase (DTD) selectively remove D-amino acids from tRNAs, ensuring the enforcement of homirality in protein synthesis?

**Methods:** We solved the crystal structure of DTD from Plasmodium falcum complexed with a substrate-mim analog, revealing an invariant cross-subunit Gly-Pro dipeptide capturing the chiral center of D-amacyl-tRNA.

**Findings:** DTD uses a side-chain independent mechanism for substrate recognition, allowing it to act on multiple D-am acids. No protein residues are directly involved in catalysis. The chiral specificity explains the enriched pool of L-amacy-tRNAs escaping proofreading.

**Implications:** This study provides insights into fundamental enantioselective process and elucidates a chiral mechanism crucial in preventing D-am acid infiltration during translation apparatus.

**Conclusions:** The study reveals how nature designed a single deacyase to deal with D-tRNA, highlighting the role of weak bonds in chirality selection. If L-am binds, it must do so in one of three possible conformations (Figure 4). DTD removes D-am acids from tRN, ensuring they don't get into proteins (Calendar & Berg, 1967; Wyau et al, 2009; Zheng et al,200). Ds act as freanding modules, likely operating by recapturing aa-tRNAs from EFu (Ling et,200). The amino site captures all atoms attached to chiral C, with crossunit Gly-Pro motif central in recognition, described in Mechan L-am acid rejection.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Spontaneous Gating in Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Channels: Energetic Coupling between Nucleotide Binding Domains (NBDs) and Pore Movements

**Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying spontaneous gating in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels, a chloride channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients?

**Methods:** We investigated the energetic coupling between nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and pore movements in CFTR channels using single-channel recordings and molecular dynamics simulations.

**Findings:** Our results show that spontaneous openings in CFTR channels are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may occur even without coordinated NBD/pore movements. This suggests that NBD movements are intrinsic to CFTR, altering the stability but not the structural architecture of open and closed conformations. This explains the effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights into CF and drug mechanisms.

**Implications:** Our findings constrain mechanistic models of ATP-dependent gating and driving forces conserved among ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins. They also explain modulatory effects of physiological or pharmacological regulators.

**Conclusions:** The presence of bound ATP does not alter global conformations; rather, it acts as a molecular glue to stabilize the transition and open state. The mechanism of ATP binding promotes CFTR opening is likely through stabilizing the high-energy transition state, not altering the arrangement of conformations. The occlusion of the ligand site in open channels precludes open-state binding, making rates zero. Disruption of hydrolysis forces CF channels to gate, following a linear sequence rather than a cycle. Low-probability ATP-independent openings can be linked to N dimer, but our results argue that remaining N-TMD machinery undergoes similar movements to dimer when truncated.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Spontaneous openings in CFTR channels are coupled to NBD dimer, which may occur without coordinated NBD/pore movements.
* NBD movements are intrinsic to CFTR, altering stability but not structural architecture of open and closed conformations.
* ATP binding stabilizes the transition and open state, not altering conformations.
* Mechanism of ATP binding promotes opening is through stabilizing high-energy state, not altering conformations.
* Ligand site occlusion in open channels precludes open binding, making rates zero.
* Disruption hydroly forces CF to gate, following linear sequence rather than cycle.

**Title:** Unveiling the "Orderobic" Effect: A Novel Mechanism for Transmembrane Protein Assembly in Lipid Bilayers

**Research Question:** How do transmembrane proteins assemble in lipid bilayers, and what is the underlying mechanism driving force behind this process?

**Methods:** Using large-scale molecular simulations, we investigated the behavior of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, focusing on the transition between ordered and disordered phases. We considered proteins with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer.

**Findings:** Our results show that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order-disorder interface with finite stiffness. When such proteins approach each other, assembly reduces the interfacial energy, analogous to the hydroobic effect. We refer to this phenomenon as the "orderobic" effect. This effect is mediated by proximity to the order-disorder transition and hydroph mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those from membrane elasticity.

**Implications:** The orderobic effect is a novel mechanism for transmembrane protein assembly in lipid bilayers, distinct from the hydroobic effect. The strength and range of orderobic forces depend on the ability of the protein to induce disorder in its vicinity, which depends on proximity to the membrane transition and hydroph mismatch. Our prediction of enhanced lipid mobility surrounding orderobic proteins may be experimentally tested by single-molecule techniques. Biological membranes and transmem proteins are more complex than our models, with multiple components allowing multiple order-dis transitions.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a new mechanism for transmem protein assembly in lipid bilayers, mediated by the orderobic effect. This effect arises from proximity to the order-dis transition and hydroph mismatch of protein. The strength and range of orderobic forces are significantly larger than those from membrane elasticity. Our findings have implications for understanding transmembrane protein behavior and lipid bilayer dynamics, with potential applications in biotechnology and biomedicine.

**Title:** Elucidating the Relationship between Action Potentials and Fluorescence in Calcium Indicators: A Study of AP-Fluorescence Transfer in Layer 2/3 Pyramidal Neurons of Primary Visual Cortex

**Research Question:** The relationship between action potentials (APs) and fluorescence in genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECs) remains unclear, particularly in population imaging studies where APs are often undetectable due to limited photon flux.

**Methods:** We investigated the AP-fluorescence transfer in vivo in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of primary visual cortex using simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCa6 or GCf. APs were detected under optimal conditions, but only a minority of 1 and 2 AP events (<10% and ~20, respectively) were detected under typical population imaging conditions, highlighting the limits of detection.

**Findings:** We constructed AP-calc fluorescence curves using isolated APs separated by ≥100 and ≥500 ms for GC6, and ≥300 ms for GCf. Only a minority of APs were used to construct curves, with APs summed over 250 ms. Our results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity and fluorescence, aiding interpretation of existing and future imaging datasets.

**Implications:** This study highlights the challenges in inferring underlying AP train firing from calcium imaging due to large fields of view and limited photon flux. Our findings facilitate interpretation of existing datasets, such as the Allen's Brain Observatory Visual Coding, and provide a framework for future studies using transgenic lines.

**Conclusions:** The AP-fluores transfer in layer 2/3 pyram neurons is characterized, emphasizing the need for optimal imaging conditions to detect APs. Our results provide a basis for understanding the relationship between spiking activity and fluorescence, aiding the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging studies.

**Title:** Functional Switching Valve in the Genitalia of the Brazilian Insect Neotla: A Novel Mechanism for Females to Compete for Seminal Gifts in Nutrient-Poor Cave Habitats

**Research Question:** What is the functional significance of the switching valve in the genitalia of the Brazilian insect Neotla, and how does it enable females to compete for seminal gifts in nutrient-poor cave habitats?

**Methods:** Observations were made on the reproductive behavior and anatomy of Neotla, a species of insect inhabiting oligot cave habitats. Females were observed to have a penis-like introment organ to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen, which is packed in a capsule formed by seminal injection. The valve is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure, and in- and out canals.

**Findings:** Females of Neotla use a special mechanism to control the direction of seminal flow, allowing them to receive two seminal packages (nutrition) from the same or different males within a short span. The switching valve enables females to receive a second capsule while the first is consumed. With the valve, females can selectively use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other empty, enabling them to receive an additional package from the same or other male using the empty slot.

**Implications:** The presence of a spermathe plate with valve to control seminal flow refines our understanding of causes and consequences of sexual selection in this genus. Female-female competition for males (sex reversal) to receive nutritious substances is considered the most factor driving evolution of female penis. Females are responsible for long copulation, probably to obtain more semen from male.

**Conclusions:** The switching valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal in nutrient-poor habitats through long copulation and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this valve may have been prerequisite for the reversal of introment organ in Neotla. Females Neotla and possibly Sensitilla Afrog can selectively use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other empty, enabling them to receive additional package from same or other male.

**Title:** Munc-18 Regulates Stage-wise SNARE Assembly and Exocytosis through Distinct Domains and Activities

**Research Question:** How does Munc-18 regulate the assembly and exocytosis of SNARE proteins, and what are the distinct roles of different SNARE domains in this process?

**Methods:** Using optical tweezers, we observed four stages of SNARE assembly: N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively) and found that SN mutations differentially affect SN assembly. We compared the effects of SN assembly on exytosis and found that NT and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, while MD regulates SN assembly and fusion.

**Findings:**

1. Munc-18 initiates SN assembly and stabilizes the half-zipped SN complex, independent of syntaxin N-terminal domain (NTD).
2. In the absence of M-18, SNAP-25 dissociates from tethered syntax and VAMP when the SN complex is unfolded.
3. M-18 holds SNAP-25 together with tethered syntax or VAMP as SN unfolded, facilitating de novo SN assembly.
4. M-18 regulates every stage of SN assembly, enhancing de novo assembly, assembly, and interactions between SNs and membranes to facilitate fusion.

**Implications:**

* M-18 plays a crucial role in regulating SN assembly and exytosis through distinct domains and activities.
* NT and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, while MD regulates SN assembly and fusion.
* M-18 initiates SN assembly and stabilizes the half-zipped complex, independent of NT.
* M- regulates every stage of SN assembly, enhancing de novo, assembly, and interactions between SN and membranes.

**Conclusions:**

Our observations demonstrate distinct functions of SN domains in assembly, chapered by M-18. We propose a working model for M-18-regulated stage SN zippering and membrane fusion, where M18 acts on intermediates SNs to chaper assembly. This study highlights the importance of M18 in regulating SN assembly and exyt, and provides insights into the mechanisms of SN assembly and fusion.

**Title:** Rapid and Diverse Assembly of Cell-Matrix Adhesion Sites through Pre-assembled Integrin Adhesomes

**Research Question:** How do integrin adhesomes self-assemble locally and correctly at diverse cell-matrix adhesion sites?

**Methods:** We employed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to investigate the cytosolic state of integrin-adesome components and their dynamic exchange between adhesion sites and cytos.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that integrin adomes are extensively pre-assembled in the cytos as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Stationary adhesions symmetrically release the same types of protein complexes they recruit, maintaining a uniform cytosolic pool of building blocks. We propose a model where multi-protein blocks enable rapid and modular assembly of adhesion and symmetric exchange of blocks preserve their specifications, ensuring the logic of the system.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that integrin adomes are pre-assembled in the cytos, forming multi-pro building blocks that facilitate rapid and modular assembly of adhesion sites. Physical associations between adhesion components are spatially uniform around focal adhesions, indicating symmetric exchange of blocks with cytos without alteration. In the cytos, blocks cannot form larger structures due to protein interactions dependencies. We propose that the plasma membrane system can switch to self-assemble adhesion sites through checkpoints inducing additional interactions in integrin adomes.

**Conclusions:** Integrin adomes are preassembled in the cytos, forming multi-pro building for cell-matrix adhesion sites. Our results indicate blocks are size-confined and correspond to functional layers of focal adhesions anchoring, integrin regulation, force, and actin. Symmetric exchange between adhesion and cytos ensures blocks enter and exit sites unaltered. Our findings provide insights into the assembly logic of adhesion sites, highlighting the importance of interaction dependencies across integrin adomes.

**Title:** Electrophysiological Markers of Reduced Arousal States: A Novel Insights into Wakefulness, Sleep, and Anesthesia

**Research Question:** Can we identify a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including sleep and anesthesia in humans?

**Methods:** We analyzed intracran and surface EEG recordings from four independent datasets to investigate the relationship between the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophys power and arousal states. Specifically, we hypothesized that the slope would become more negative (i.e., the spectrum steeper) in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the 1/f slope of electroph power, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale component of neural activity, delineates wakefulness from propof anesthesia, NREM, and REM sleep. Critically, the slope discriminates wake from sleep solely on the basis of neurophysiological brain state. We also show that the slope mirrors rapid changes in excitability over the course of slow waves, providing a mechanistic link between the slope and synchrony during oscillations.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a novel electrophys marker that tracks arousal states of reduced, including sleep and anesthesia in humans. This marker, the 1/f slope of elect power, is observable on a wide range of timescales from sub-epochs to full recordings and correlates with all stages of arousal, including REM, NREM, and propof anesthesia. Our results support the notion that reduced states are not only defined by synchronous activity, but also by non-oscillatory components.

**Conclusions:** Together, our results from four studies provide five main advances: (1) the slope tracks arousal in propof anesthesia and sleep in humans with high precision; (2) the slope correlates with all stages of arousal; (3) the slope mirrors changes in excitability over slow waves; (4) the slope provides a mechanistic link between slope and synchrony; and (5) the slope differentiates wake from all states of reduced arousal. Our electroph marker, the 1/f slope of power, offers a new perspective on understanding reduced states, including sleep and anesthesia in humans.

**Title:** Stromules Extend along Microtubules and Actin Filaments to Facilitate Chloroplast Movement during Innate Immunity

**Research Question:** How do stromules, dynamic tubular extensions of chloroplasts, interact with microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AFs) to facilitate chloroplast movement during innate immunity?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of MTs and AFs in stromule dynamics and chloroplast movement in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves using live-cell imaging and biochemical assays.

**Findings:** Our results show that MTs are required for stromule extension and movement, with depolymerization leading to strom retraction and stabilization increasing strom frequency. Actin filaments are not necessary for strom extension but provide anchor points for stromules. We observed a strong correlation between strom direction and chloroplast movement, with strom-directed chloroplast movement occurring in steady-state conditions without immune induction.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that MTs and AFs facilitate perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during innate response. We propose a model where stromules extend along MTs and attach to AF points, guiding chloroplasts to the nucleus.

**Conclusions:** This study provides mechanistic insights into interactions between the cytoskeleton and stromules, revealing a new type of organellar movement along MTs and a mechanism for peruclear clustering during innate immunity. Future research will investigate molecular components required for strom dynamics and importance of peruclear clustering during immunity.

**Title:** Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions across Interfaces using Residue Covariance: A Pseudo-Likelihood Approach

**Research Question:** Can residue identities that covary across protein interfaces during evolution be used to predict contacts and assemble models of biological complexes?

**Methods:** We employed a pseudo-likelihood-based method to identify residue pairs that covary across protein-protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 bacterial complexes with known structures. We found that these pairs are almost always in contact in the complex, provided the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average of the two proteins. We applied this method to predict subunit contacts for 36 complexes with unknown structures and presented models for the tripart ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate lyase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC transporter.

**Findings:** Our results with the 50S ribosome and benchmark suggest that interactions can be accurately predicted across proteinprotein interfaces given sufficient aligned sequences. Residue-residue predictions for 36 complexes with unknown structures are provided, with E. coli sequences clustered, representing multiple pairs. We used pseudo-likelihood to predict contacts for evolutionarily conserved complexes with unknown structures and presented models for four well-constrained complexes. In a set of known structures, cov pairs are almost always in 3D, provided sufficient sequences. Significant residue-residue occurs frequently between interacting pairs but rarely non-interacting, useful for predicting interactions.

**Implications:** This study examines residue-residue covariance across protein interfaces using a pseudo-likelihood statistical method. coli pairs. Predictions contribute to structures biologically important complexes.

**Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that residue covariance can be used to predict protein-protein interactions across interfaces and assemble models biological complexes. The pseudo-likelihood method accurately identifies covary pairs in 50S ribosome and 28 complexes, and predicts subunit contacts for 36 with unknown structures. Residue-residue covariance occurs frequently between interacting pairs, but rarely non-interacting, making it useful for predicting interactions. This study contributes to understanding protein-protein interactions and structure determination of biologically important complexes.

**Title:** Active Sensing in Visual Scenes: Unveiling the Role of Prior Knowledge and Perceptual Noise in Eye Movements

**Research Question:** How do participants accumulate information from multiple locations in a scene when performing a visual categorization task, and what is the role of prior knowledge and perceptual noise in their eye movements?

**Methods:** We employed a gaze-contingent paradigm in a categorization task, where participants' eye movements were tracked while they viewed a series of visual patterns. We used a Bayesian observer model to estimate the information gathered at each fixation and compared it to an optimal active algorithm that revealed locations to participants.

**Findings:** Our results show that participants' eye movements follow an active strategy that incorporates prior knowledge of scene structure and statistical patterns. Notably, categorization performance improved when locations were revealed by an optimal active algorithm. Using a combination of Bayesian observer and sensor, we estimated that 70% of apparent optimality in fixation arises from prior biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that participants select eye movements to maximize information about abstract categories, integrating information from multiple locations. This extends the range of active sensing tasks to non-spatial features, such as categories, and provides the first fixation-by-fixation analysis of information gathering under eye movements. We dissociate eye-movement process from perceptual and decision processes, identifying sources of suboptim in sensing and quantify efficiency of each fixation.

**Conclusions:** Our approach enables multiple tasks in perceptual domains. To study eye movements quantitatively, we estimated efficiency on a fixation-fixation basis in a high-level task. We focus on pattern categorization, different from search, where a single location has all information. Participants' movements were more efficient than heuristic strategies and 70% as optimal with prior, perception, noise, and saccadic inaccuracies. Inspired, we designed an experiment with controlled patterns and simple, ensuring fove vision dominated by gaze-conting categorization.

**Title:** Elucidating the Requirements for Nuclear Import of Large Cargoes through the Nuclear Pore Complex

**Research Question:** What are the key determinants of nuclear import for large cargoes, such as pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes, that exceed 15 nm in size, and how do multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localization sequences (NLS) influence import efficiency?

**Methods:** We investigated nuclear import kinetics of 30 cargo models of capsid-like particles (17-36 nm in size) with tunable numbers of NLS (up to 240) using a two-parameter biophysical model that correlates import with energetics of large transport through the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC).

**Findings:** Our results show that import requirements for transport scale non-linearly with size and can be recapitulated by a simple biophysical model that correlates import with energetics of large transport through the NPC. For small cargoes, biochemical and physicochemical properties of the surface have been shown to influence transport (Fre et al., 2018; N et al.,2009; Tan et.,2018). Our findings reveal key determinants of large import in cells.

**Implications:** This study provides a fundamental understanding of nuclear import of large cargoes, which is crucial for cellular viability. Theoretical model assumes caps do not interact during transport through the pore. Cargoes with NLS and bind transport receptors (NTR) can rapidly enter the nucleus. Studies have characterized N-mediated transport, focusing on cargoes with one to five NLS, and import follow mono-exponential behavior (Ribbeck and Görlich,200; Kop and Elbaum,200; Tim et al,200). Our results have implications for future understanding export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal units and RNA complexes.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the requirements for nuclear import of large cargoes through the NPC, revealing key determinants of import in cells. Our biophysical model correlates import with energetics of transport, providing a framework for understanding nuclear transport of large cargoes. Theoretical model assumes caps do not interact during transport through the pore. Carg with NLS and TR can rapidly enter the nucleus. Our results have implications for understanding export of large cargoes, such as preribosomal units and RNA complexes.

**Title:** Essential Role of CD28 Molecule in Maintaining Helper T Cell Responses Following Activation

**Research Question:** Does CD28 play a crucial role in maintaining helper T cell responses following activation, in addition to its established function in T cell priming?

**Methods:** We generated a strain of mice where CD28 was removed from CD4+ T cells after priming to investigate the role of CD28 in effector T cell responses.

**Findings:** Our study demonstrates that CD28 is essential for effector CD4 T cells following infection, required for the expansion of Th1 cells and differentiation and maintenance of follicular helper T cells during viral infection. Moreover, CD28 is necessary for clearance of Citrobacterium rodent from the gastrointestinal tract.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel function for CD28 in helper cell polarization response to infection, distinct from its established role in T priming. CD28 expression is required for intact effector CD4 T responses during infection.

**Conclusions:** CD28 is not only essential for CD4 T priming and differentiation into effector cell subsets, but also plays a previously undescribed role in maintaining helper cell responses following activation. CD28 expression is necessary for expansion of Th1 cells, differentiation and maintenance of follicular helper T cells, as well as clearance of enteropathic bacteria Citrobacterium after oral infection. These findings highlight the importance of CD28 in immune response to bacterial infection, not just viral.

**Title:** The Helical Shape of Helicobacter pylori: Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of Curvature Generation and Maintenance

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the helical shape of Helicobacter pylori and how does it maintain sidewall curvature during growth?

**Methods:** We employed quantitative 3D microscopy and immunofluorescence to investigate PG patterning in H. pyl using metabolic probes and superresolution imaging. We analyzed the localization of cytoskeletal proteins Mre and C in H. pyl and compared with straight-rod E. coli.

**Findings:** Our results show that wall growth is enhanced at sidew curvature extremes, with M being most abundant at negative curvature and C being most at positive curvature. Strains expressing C variants with altered polymerization properties lose helical shape and associated curvatures. We propose a model where M and promote PG synthesis at positive and negative curvatures, respectively, and patterning is necessary for helical shape.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that M and C play crucial roles in PG patterning, enabling H. pyl to maintain sidew curvature during growth. We propose that M promotes synthesis at negative curvature due to its preference for this curvature in H. pyl and role in localizing synthesis in other organisms. To compensate for M-driven straight-rod growth, H pyl uses C to enhance synthesis at the major axis, independent of M. pyl also leverages C to promote positive curv on the sidew and supplements M-enhanced synthesis at negative curv.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that M and C help maintain PG activity and patter is a fundamental mechanism in helical shape maintenance. We also show that H pyl achieves broader sidew curv than curved-rod C. cresus and V. cholera and uses distinct mechanisms to achieve these curv. Our study provides insights into the molecular basis of H. pyl shape and highlights the importance of PG patter in bacterial morphogenesis.

**Title:** CDC48, a Ubiquitin-selective Chaper, Orchestrates the Function of E3 Ligases and Deubiquilases (DUBs) in Mitochondrial Dynamics

**Research Question:** How does CDC48, a ubiquitin-selective chaper, regulate the function of E3 ligases and deubiquilases (DUBs) in mitochondrial dynamics?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of CDC48 in ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, focusing on the deubiquilases UBP12 and UBP2, which exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on mitofus F1.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that CDC integrates the activities of these two DUBs, which are themselves ubiquilated. First, CDC promotes proteolysis of UBP, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiqulation on F1. Second, loss of UBP stabilizes U2 thereby facilitating removal of ubiquitin on F1 inhibiting fusion. Thus, CDC synergistically regulates the ubiqulation of F1, controlling the balance between activation or repression of mitochondrial fusion.

**Implications:** We unravel a cascade of ubiqulation events comprising CDC and two Ds fine-tuning the fusogenic activity of F1, ensuring tight control of F1 ubiqulation levels to allow mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiqulation targeting F1 for proteasomal turnover.

**Conclusions:** The cascade between UBP and U2 also revises recent results linking U2 and M30 (Cavini et al., 2017). M30 catalyzes the formation of pro-fusion forms on F1 (Cohen et al., 2008). We identify a role of CDC in mitochondrial fusion as part of a novel enzymatic cascade of CDC, UBP, and U2. CDC negatively regulates UBP, which negatively regulates U2, explaining the two Ds opposite effects on targets and ubiquostasis.

**Title:** Categorical Organization of the Ventral Occipital-Temporal Cortex (VOT) in Sighted and Blind Individuals: An fMRI Study

**Research Question:** Does the ventral occipitaltemporal cortex (VOT) exhibit categorical organization in response to auditory stimuli in sighted and congenitally blind individuals, and if so, what are the similarities and differences in the representational structure and connectivity between the two groups?

**Methods:** We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate OT responses to auditory stimuli in eight categories in sighted and congenally blind individuals. Our results showed that OT reliably encodes categories in both groups using representational structure and connectivity similar to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group using a representational format closer to the one in vision. Crucially, OT in congenally blind represents categorical membership rather than acoustic features of sounds.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that categorical organization similar to the one in vision can emerge in OT in the absence of visual experience, and that such response to sounds is enhanced and more stable in congenally blind. We used representational similarity analysis to show that membership is the main factor predicting representational structure of sounds in OT in congenally blind, rather than lower-level acoustic attributes of sounds.

**Implications:** Our study shows that OT encodes categorical membership of sounds from different categories in sight and congenally blind, using topography, represent format, and represent connectivity similar to the observed in response to images in vision. However, the representation of auditory stimuli in OT of congenally and sight individuals exhibits qualitative nuances compared to the organization by visual in sight people. This may be due to OT representing visual attributes in sight and acoustic in congenally due to cross-modal plasticity.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that OT exhibits categorical organization in response to auditory stimuli in congenally and sight individuals, with similarities in represent structure and connectivity to the found in vision. However, the representation of auditory in congen and sight exhibits nuances compared to the organization by visual in sight. These results have implications for our understanding of cross-modal plasticity and the brain's ability to reorganize in response to sensory deprivation.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Behavioral Manipulation by the Fungal Pathogen Entomophthora mus in Drosophila melanogaster

**Research Question:** How does the fungal pathogen Entomthora mus manipulate the behavior of its host Drosophila melanogaster, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in this process?

**Methods:** We isolated and characterized a strain of Entom mus infecting D melanogaster in the laboratory and observed behavioral changes in infected flies, including upward climbing, proboscis extension, and wing raising, clearing a path for spore release. We found that E mus invades the nervous system, suggesting a direct mechanism for behavioral manipulation. To understand the molecular basis of this manipulation, we measured transcriptional changes in host and fungus at 24 time points over 5 days.

**Findings:** Infected flies exhibited morund behaviors characteristic of E mus infection, including upward climbing, probis extension, and wing raising, clearing a path for spore release. E mus invades the nervous system, granting direct access to neurons, potentially mechanistically important for behavioral manipulation. We propose four possible mechanisms by which E mus achieves behavioral manipulation: (Keller, 2007). To test if E mus can infect outside Drosidae, we exposed flies to E mus-infected melanaster using a modified protocol, observing death and sporulation, indicating infection. We measured transcriptional changes in host and fungus at 24 time points over 5 to elucidate molecular basis of manipulation.

**Implications:** The E mus-D melanaster system enables rapid progress in understanding parasitic manipulation of host behavior. The invasion of nervous system by E grants direct access to neurons, potentially mechanistically important for behavioral manipulation. However, we must consider alternative explanations before concluding this. The E mus-D system offers a model for mechanistic understanding of parasitic manipulation.

**Conclusions:** The Entom mus-D melanaster system provides a tractable model for understanding parasitic manipulation of host behavior. E mus invades the nervous system, granting direct access to neurons, potentially mechanistically important for behavioral manipulation. We propose four mechanisms by which E mus achieves behavioral manipulation (Keller,2007). The E-D system enables rapid progress in understanding parasitic manipulation.

**Title:** Systematic Analysis of RNA Degradation Pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Reveals Insights into RNA Processing, Regulation, and Surveillance

**Research Question:** How do RNA degradation pathways select and regulate RNA levels, and surveil aberrant or poorly functional RNAs in cells?

**Methods:** We employed photoactivatable ribonucleotide-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PARCLIP) to generate transcriptome-wide binding profiles of 30 RNA degradation factors involved in deadenylation, decapping, exosome-mediated degradation, and RNA surveillance pathways, including nuclear surveillance and cytoplasmic nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in Saccharomy cerevisiae.

**Findings:** Our results reveal the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes, consistent with the canonical pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling mRNA half-lives suggests most factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited for degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping preferentially binds mRN with non-optimal codons, consistent with degradation of inefficiently translated mRN. Global analysis suggests the surveillance machinery, including complexes N1/N3 and TR4, targets aberrant nuclear RN and snoRNAs.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of RNA degradation in eukaryotic cells, revealing how degradation factors vary in binding specificities for classes of RN and locations on transcripts. Comparisons with published profiles of other RNA-binding factors reveal clusters that co-occupy RN or co-localize RN. Our dataset offers a rich resource for future studies of eukotic RNA pathways, mechanisms, and integration of mRNA metabolism.

**Conclusions:** Our systematic analysis of RNA degradation pathways in Sacomy cerevisiae reveals insights into RNA processing, regulation, and surveillance, and highlights the importance of decapping as a rate-limiting step in degradation. Decapping preferentially binds mRN with non-optimal codons, consistent with degradation of inefficiently translated mRN. The surveillance machinery targets aberrant RN and snoRN, underscoring its role in RNA quality control. Our findings provide a framework for understanding RNA degradation in eukotic cells, with implications for future studies of RNA metabolism and disease.

**Title:** Temporal Dynamics of Gene Expression Underpinning Responses to Internal and Environmental Stimuli: Epigenetic Regulation of Camalexin Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana

**Research Question:** How do epigenetic modifications regulate the rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thalian in response to bacterial and fungal infections?

**Methods:** We combined publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin mapping to investigate the role of epigenetic marks on camalex biosynthesis genes. We examined the localization of trimylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3me3K27) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 (H3ac) on camin biosynthesis genes and functionally tested the role of H3meK27-Hac bivalent chromatin in Arabidopsis.

**Findings:** We found that cam biosynthesis genes are marked with two epetic modifications with opposite effects on expression: trimylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3meK27) repression and acetylation lysine 18 of histone 3 (Hac) activation, forming a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3me or Hac suggested both modifications were required for the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at early stage of stress. Our study indicates that Hme-Hac bivalent chrom, which we name kstat, plays an important role in controlling timely induction of expression upon stress in plants.

**Implications:** Our results provide new evidence for epetic regulation of camin biosynthesis and suggest that Hme-Hac bivalent chrom maintains proper timing of camin induction upon pathogen signal. Integrating epigen profiles with genome-wide metabolic network Arabid, we found epetic marks playing opposite roles on expression, Hme and ac, were enriched cam biosynthesis and other specialized pathways. Mutants defective of Hme or ac, induction cam bios genes and metabol accumulation accelerated or delayed, respectively.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of epetic regulation cam biosynthesis in response to internal and environmental stimuli, providing a molecular handle for future investigations into transcription factors interacting with proteins depositing or removing epetic marks forming bivalent chrom upon stress.

**Title:** Epigenetic Regulation of Neurogenic Astrocytes by EZH2 in the Adult Subventricular Zone: Implications for Regenerative Medicine and Oncogenesis**

**Research Question:** What epigenetic mechanisms enable astrocytes to retain neurogenic competence throughout adult life, and what is the role of the histone methyltransferase EZ2 (EZH2) in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of EZ2 in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) of mice and examined its role in neurogenesis. We generated Ink4/Ar-deficient Ezh-deleted SV NSCs to rescue cell proliferation, but neurogenesis remained defective. We identified Olig2 as a direct target of EZ2 and showed that repression of this bHL transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation.

**Findings:** EZ2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SV astrocytes, orchestrating distinct aspects of adult stem cell biology. In the mouse brain, SV cells, including astrocytes, express EZ2, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. In the human brain, SV cells, including astrocytes, also express EZ, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. EZ2 directly represses the Ink4/Ar locus to enable SVC self-renewal. Our studies establish EZ2 as a feature of astrocytes in the postnatal neurogenic SV of the mouse and human brain.

**Implications:** These results provide novel insights into the role of the Polycomb repressive factor EZ2 in development and gliagenesis. We identify distinct and separable roles for EZ2 in the production of neurons from a multipotent cell population. Future studies may address re-expression of EZ in non-SV astrocytes to enable neurogenesis or transdifferentiation into neurons in vivo for therapeutic purposes.

**Conclusions:** EZ2 is a critical epigen determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astrocytes, enabling proliferation and fate specification of an adult stem population. Our results indicate EZ has a role in SV neurogenesis distinct from its function in Ink/Ar repression. By rescuing only proliferation and not differentiation, Ink/Ar-deficiency enabled us to investigate additional roles EZ in the neurogenic capacity of astroial population.

**Title:** Unveiling the Dynamics of Virus-Host Interactions in Uncultivated SUP Bacteria in Marine Oxygen Minimum Zones: Implications for Biogeochemical Cycling

**Research Question:** How do viruses modulate microbial communities and ecosystem functions in marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), and what are the dynamics of virus-host interactions in uncult SUP bacteria?

**Methods:** We employed single-cell genomics to examine 127 amplified genomes (SAGs) from uncultivated SUP bacteria isolated from a model OMZ, identifying 69 contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudirales and ssDNAviridae. We analyzed microbial and viral metagenomes over a 3-year interval, revealing patterns of co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses and occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) modulating electron transfer reactions essential to SUP metabolism.

**Findings:**

* Approximately 1/3 of SUP bacteria are infected with viruses, with higher infection frequency where oxygen deficiency is most severe.
* Observed Microvir clonality suggests recovery of bloom-terminating viruses.
* Co-infection between dsDNA and ss viruses indicates previously unrecognized cooperation.
* SUP viruses persist for years but remain endemic to OMZ.
* Identification of virus-encoded dissimulatory sulf reductase suggests viruses reprogram their host's energy metabolism.

**Implications:** These results demonstrate coupled SUP virus-host co-evolution dynamics modulating biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and OMZs.

**Conclusions:**

This study provides the first direct link between SUP viruses and hosts across defined oxygen and sulf gradients in a model OM ecosystem, revealing endemic patterns of co-infection between ds and ss viruses and occurrence of AM with potential to modulate electron reactions essential to SUP metabolism. Our findings suggest viruses play a key role in modulating biogical processes in OMZs, with potential implications for climate change.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of IFT26/DY13 in Cilia/Flagella Assembly and Motility: A Novel Insights into the Complexity of the Intraflagellar Transport Machinery**

**Research Question:** What is the specific function of IFT26/DY13, a putative IFT protein, in cilia/flag assembly and motility, and how does it contribute to the complexity of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery?

**Methods:** Using live imaging and biochemical approaches in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, we investigated the role of TTC26/DY13 in IFT complex formation and its impact on ciliaflag assembly and motility. Knockdown of TTC26Y13 in zebraf embryos and mutation of TTC26Y13 in C. reinhardt resulted in short cilia with motility defects. Proteomic and biochemical analyses revealed specific proteins involved in motility were depleted in the dy13 mutant.

**Findings:** Unlike other IFT complex proteins, TTC/DY13 is not required for ciliogenesis or IFT particle assembly, but plays a specialized role in transporting a subset of motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia/flagella. Comparative proteomic analysis of flagellar proteins in the dy13 mutant supports this function. IFT56, conserved in most ciliated organisms, has a conserved role in cilia/flag or IFT, but further analysis is necessary to clarify its role.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that different IFT proteins are responsible for different subsets of cargo, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery. Unlike other IFT proteins, TTC/D13 is not required for cili or IFT assembly, but transports specific proteins involved in motility, indicating a specialized role in ciliaflag motility.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the function of IFT/D13 in ciliaflag assembly and motility, shedding light on the complexity of the IFT machinery. Our results support the concept that different IFT proteins are responsible for distinct subsets of cargo, contributing to the intricate process of IFT. Further research is necessary to clarify the role of I56 and TTC/D13 in determining cilia length and flagella motility.

**Title:** Lymphatic Invasion and Lymph Node Metastasis Correlate with Poor Outcome in Melanoma: Uncovering a Novel Mechanism of Lymphatic Dissemination

**Research Question:** How do lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) interact with melanoma cells to facilitate distant metastasis, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms involved?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of 2D and 3D co-culture models of human melanoma cells with LEC, transcriptome profiling, in vitro studies, and zebraf xenograft metastasis assays to investigate the molecular crosstalk between LEC and melanoma cells.

**Findings:** Exposure of expansively growing human WM852 melanoma cells to LEC in 3D co-culture facilitated distant metastasis in mice. Notably, expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasive sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix, dependent on MMP14, Not3, and β-integrin. Unexpectedly, MMP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Not3 and β-integr activation. Moreover, MMP14 and Not3 were required for L-mediated metastasis of zraf xenografts.

**Implications:** Our study uncovers a unique mechanism whereby LEC promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasive sprouting cell phenotype. The interaction of melanoma cells with LEC induced MMP14-dependent Not3 and β-int activation, leading to increased metastasis of melanoma xenografts in vivo, which was dependent on MMP and Not3.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of lymphatic dissemination in melanoma, where LEC contact with melanoma cells induces a switch from 3D growth to invasive sprouting phenotype, mediated by MMP14, Not, and β-int. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of LEC in melanoma progression and identifying potential therapeutic targets for metastatic melanoma.

**Title:** miR-9 Regulates Dendritic Growth and Synaptic Transmission in Vivo through REST Downregulation

**Background:** MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved, non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. mi-9 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the brain, but its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown.

**Research Question:** What is the role of mi-9 in dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo?

**Methods:** To target mi-9 in vivo, we developed a transgenic mi sponge line allowing conditional inactivation of mi-9 in a spatio-temporally controlled manner.

**Findings:** Using this novel approach, we found that mi-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mi-9-mediated downregulation of transcription repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth.

**Implications:** Our results define a key role for mi- in postmitotic differentiation of neurons. We present a double mouse line to characterize activity of mi in cell types in brain. Analysis of mi-9-SNest-C mouse showed inhibition mi- results aberrant dend growth in vivo, accompanied concomitant impairment in transmission.

**Conclusions:** We describe first conditional transgenic mouse model. Derived two strains for in vivo: (i) reporter line to monitor mi with single-cell resolution and (ii) for mi- loss-function. Latter revealed novel developmental of mi in postmit differentiation, as regulator of dend growth and transmission in vivo. We focused postmit stages neuronal differentiation and critical for mi in control dend development. Other miRN have shown influence growth (Wayman et al., 2008; Fi et al.,2009; Parrish et.,2009; Mag et.,2010; Pathania et.,2012; et.,2013) suggesting expression orchestrating process under post regulation.

**Title:** Atypical Functional Organization of Social and Visual Circuits in Toddlers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

**Research Question:** How do social engagement difficulties in toddlers with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relate to atypical functional brain organization, and can they be quantified using eye-tracking methods?

**Methods:** We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large sample of toddlers with ASD and non-ASD comparison groups to investigate functional connectivity between social brain circuits, such as the default mode network (DM) and visual networks.

**Findings:** Toddlers with ASD showed hypoconnectivity between DM and visual networks, particularly between the default mode network (DM) and occipital-temporal cortex (OTC). Increased DM-OTC hypoconnectivity was related to severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in toddlers with pronounced social-visual difficulties (GeoASD).

**Implications:** Early social-visual hypoconnectivity is a key neurobiological feature of GeoASD and may be critical for future social-communic development and new treatment targets for early intervention.

**Conclusion:** This study provides evidence for atypical functional organization of social and visual circuits in toddlers with ASD, highlighting the importance of heterogeneity in early social engagement for some, but not all, functional differences in ASD. Our findings support the idea that toddlerhood is characterized by hypoconnectivity between DM and visual circuits PVC and OTC as well as attention circuitry DAN. Eye-tracking is a simple, fast, and easy, and robust assay for identifying clinically relevant ASD subtypes, such as GeoD.

**Title:** Notch-Dependent Plasmatocyte Transdifferentiation in Drosophila Larvae: A Novel Insights into Hematopoiesis and Blood Homeostasis

**Research Question:** How do plasmatocytes differentiate into crystal cells in Drosila larvae, and what is the role of Notch signaling in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the hematopoietic system of Drosila larvae, focusing on the differentiation of plmatocytes into crystal cells, a process essential for blood homeostasis. We analyzed the role of Notch signaling in this process and its dependence on the microenvironment provided by hemocyte clusters.

**Findings:** We show that crystal cells in third instar larvae originate from plmatocytes through a Notch-dependent transdifferentiation process. This process occurs in sessile clusters and is contingent on the integrity of these structures. Notch signaling is necessary for plasocyte differentiation into crystal. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of hematopoies in Dila, highlighting the importance of structure-dependent signaling for blood homeostasis.

**Implications:** This study addresses outstanding questions in Dila hematopoies and establishes parallels with vertebrate systems. Macrophages are the most plastic cells in vertebrate hematiet tissue, and their specialization depends on local microenvironment (Ostuni and Natoli, 201; Wyn et al 2013). Similarly, we show that Dila hemocyte microenvironment induces crystal differentiation from plmatocytes through cell-cell contact involving Notch signaling (Serrate,2007). Understanding hematiet structure and function is crucial for understanding how mature blood cells arise and their numbers are controlled.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into Dila hematopoies and bloodostasis, highlighting the role of Notch-dependent plmat transdifferentiation in crystal cell formation. This novel mechanism expands our understanding of hematiet development and homeostasis, shedding light on fundamental questions in Dila hematopoies.

**Research Question:** How do cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneuploidy until new phenotypes evolve?

**Methods:** We investigated the prevalence of aneupidy in wild yeast isolates and generated diploid panels with two, three, or four copies of affected chromosomes to study gene dosage compensation.

**Findings:** Aneupidy is common in wild isolates with lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. Gene dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage are higher constraint in populations but show elevated amplification, suggesting copy variation is buffered.

**Implications:** Aneupidy provides an ecological advantage to strain YPS9 by amplifying a gene that escapes compensation.

**Conclusions:** Dosage buffers amplification through anup provides a natural, likely transient route to rapid phenotypic evolution.

In this study, we report that chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast, inherently tolerant of anup and active dosage at transcript level for specific amplified genes. Strikingly, genes subject to dosage are buffered against copy variation (CN) and show elevated amplification in isolates. We generated isogenic aneup-euploid pairs for three wild strains to distinguish between heritable downregulation and dosage compensation. Our results provide insight into the long-standing conundrum: how cells tolerate duplication toxic genes for new phenotypes to evolve. Up to 40% amplified genes in anup strains show lower-than-expected expression due to heritable polymorphisms downregulating amplified genes, some selected during adaptation to anupidy.

We investigated transcript abundance relative to DNA for amplified genes, interrogating 220 across six anupids. Results raise the possibility of natural variation in dosage compensation. Dosage-compensated expression is controlled in proportion to copy, but many escape compensation in anup and contribute to phenotyp variation. Whole and partial amplification is common in laboratory experiments.

**Title:** Discovery of Xenopsin, a Novel Opsin Photoreceptor in Flatworms, Challenges Our Understanding of Opsin Photore Evolution and Phototransduction

**Research Question:** What is the molecular and functional characterization of xenops, a recently classified subtype of opsin, and its role in phototransduction in flatworms?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression and function of xenops in the flatworm Maritrella crozier, using immunohistochemistry, ultrastructural analysis, and functional assays in human cells.

**Findings:** Xenops is expressed in ciliary cells of the larva and extraocular cells around the brain in adult, with hundreds of cilia in intra-cellular vacu (phasome). Functional assays in human cells show xenops drives phototransduction primarily coupling to Gα. Ultrastructural analysis reveals xenops+ extraocular ciliary cells enclose cilia within their own plasma membrane, similar to jawed vertebrate photoreceptors.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight similarities between xenops and c-ops, revealing a novel type of op-expressing cell that encloses cilia within their own membrane, and provide molecular and functional evidence for ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms.

**Conclusions:** The discovery of xenops+ ciliary cells in the eyes of protome challenges our understanding of opsin photore evolution, deviating from the invertebrate trend of extraocular photoreceptors. Xenops expression is both ocular and extra, supporting the possibility that VPx motif is involved in transporting xenops to cilia. Our study provides the first molecular and functional evidence of ciliaryoreceptors in flatworm, with xenops ability to driveotrans in human cells and expression in ciliary in Maritrella.

**Title:** Deciphering the Integration of Spatial and Temporal Cues in Neural Progenitors: A Study on Drosoph Neuroblasts

**Research Question:** How are spatial and temporal cues integrated in neural progenitors to specify neuronal diversity?

**Methods:** We employed Targeted DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunch temporal factor in Dros neuroblasts (NB-5 and NB-7), which make different progeny. We found that Hunch targets were distinct in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent model. Moreover, each neuroblast had unique chromatin domains, correlated with differential H-bound loci in each neuro.

**Findings:** Our data support a model where early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific chromatin, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and production of distinct neurons in each lineage. We identified over 100 loci differentially bound by H in NB-6 or NB-4, which are candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification.

**Implications:** This study sheds light on how spatial and temporal cues are integrated during neurogenesis in Dros, a model organism with a deep understanding of neural progenitor lineages and patterning mechanisms. Our findings suggest that early spatial factors establish chromatin domains, allowing temporal factors to bind and produce distinct neurons in each lineage.

**Conclusions:** Our results support a sequential model where spatial and temporal cues are integrated in neural progenitors to specify neuronal diversity. We propose that early-acting spatial factors establish chromatin domains, enabling temporal factors to bind and produce distinct neurons in each lineage. This study contributes to understanding how spatial and temporal cues are integrated in neurogenesis, a fundamental process conserved across species.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of P2 Receptor Gating through Photo-Switchable Cross-Linkers and Molecular Dynamics Simulations

**Research Question:** How does the P2 receptor open its transmembrane pore in response to extracellular ATP, and what is the molecular mechanism of pore opening?

**Methods:** We employed photo-switchable cross-linkers, termed "molecular tweezers," to monitor inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of P2 receptor during activation. Experimentally derived structural constraints were combined with computational studies to provide high-resolution models of the channel in open and closed states.

**Findings:** Our data reveal that the extent of outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. Moreover, the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insight into the gating of P2 receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to membrane proteins.

**Conclusions:** This study presents the first application of photoable derivatives to investigate the mechanism of pore gating in P receptors. Our results demonstrate that a decrease in distance between the inner and outer ends of adjacent poreining helices, through bending at a critical gating hinge, is essential for activation of the P2 receptor. This is consistent with previous studies showing that breaking the TM-TM interface is sufficient for gating, but contradicts evidence that this movement alters sensitivity to ATP, suggesting a local rearrangement of the TMD. Our study provides a new chemical method to explore the motion of the rat2 receptor by cross-linking cysteine residues with photoable azobenz tweez, whose end-to-end distance can be controlled by light. A set of structural constraints with Molecular Dynamics (MD) provided high-resolution models of the channel in both open and closed states in physiological environment.

**Title:** Cell-Type Variation in Cytokinesis Regulation in the Four-Cell C. elegans Embryo: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Mechanisms Promote Robust Division

**Research Question:** How do individual cells within the four-cell C. elegans embryo regulate cytokinesis, the physical division of a cell into two, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying cell-type variation in this process?

**Methods:** We used fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment to probe the mechanisms of cell-type variation in cytokinesis among blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. We employed thermogenetics, drug, embryo dissection, and microsection to investigate the regulation of cytokinesis in individual cell types.

**Findings:** We found cell-type differences in the functional and temporal window of activity forminK-1, but not myosin-IIN-2, during cytokinesis. In one-cell embryos, cytokinesis failed 100% of the time with formin-1 inactivation by thermal shift to restrictive temperature at any time before mid-constriction. In contrast, four-cell embryos showed cell variation in the requirement formin-1 activity among individual blastomeres. Our analysis revealed cell-type variation in the requirement formin-1, but not myos-I-2, in four-cell embryos.

**Implications:** Our data demonstrate that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute to cytoketic diversity and promote robust cytokinesis when the contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within the four C. elegans embryo. Each cell has a unique identity and can be individually scored contractile constriction during cytokinesis.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals cell-type variation in cytokinesis in the four C. elegans embryo, challenging the long-held assumption that all animal cells divide by a similar mechanism. Our findings highlight the importance of cell-specific regulation in cytokinesis and suggest that intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms work together to ensure robust division when the contractile ring is weakened. These results have implications for understanding cell division in development and disease, where contractile ring failure can lead to developmental abnormalities.

**Title:** Unveiling the Enigmatic Flagellar Sheath: A Novel Role in Host-Microbe Interactions and Immune Activation**

**Research Question:** What is the function of the membranous sheath encasing the flagella of bacteria, including human pathogens, and how does it influence host-microbe interactions and immune responses?

**Methods:** We employed the squid-vibrio symbiosis model to investigate the role of the flagellar sheath in host-micro interactions, using Vibrio fischer as a mutualist and Vibrio cholera as pathogen.

**Findings:** We discovered that rotation of the sheathed flagella in both V. fischer and V. cholera releases lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent immunogenic molecule, from the flagellar sheath. Contrary to previous hypotheses, the sheath does not evade host immune responses, but rather triggers them.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a new role for the flagellar sheath in mediating host-micro interactions and immune activation, expanding our understanding of this enigmatic structure and its contribution to bacterial virulence. This discovery has implications for studying pathogens with sheathed flagella and raises biophysical questions about she-flagellum function.

**Conclusions:** The flagellar sheath plays a previously unrecognized role in the release of immunogenic LPS from V. fischer and V. cholera, promoting host-micro interactions and immune responses. Further research will elucidate the mechanisms of squid-vrio symbiosis, including LPS composition, squid receptors, and flagellin's role in host responses. This study expands our understanding of the enigmatic flagellar sheath and its contribution to bacterial virulence.

**Title:** Genome Instability and Mitotic Errors: Unraveling the Mysteries of Chromosomal Rearrangement in Arabidopsis

**Research Question:** This study investigates the phenomenon of genome instability associated with mitotic errors, which can lead to deleterious rearrangements, but also genetic novelty, and questions regarding its genesis and evolutionary role remain unanswered.

**Methods:** We describe chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination, a process resulting from hybridization of Arabidopsis plants expressing centromere histone H3. Shattered chromosomes formed from the genome of haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single, lard compartmentalized within micronus. Analysis breakpoint junction implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining (NHE) or fork repair. Furthermore, mutation of NHE factor Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery.

**Findings:** Our results provide evidence for the occurrence of chromosome restructuring when divergent individuals hybridize, identifying centrom-based mechanism for genomic instability. This phenomenon depends on chimeric CEN3, but similar effect observed when haploid strain expresses CEN of close species. Additionally, results using Ligase-2 mutants suggest NHE plays role in repair of haploid chromosomes contributing diploid aneup progeny, that when NHE inhibited, haploid frequency increased. In silico reconstruction suggests NHE involved repairing breaks on shattered chromosomes.

**Implications:** This study provides a tractable natural system investigating causes mechanisms complex rearrangements associated with human disorders.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that NHE contributes to formation or persistence anup and diploid progeny, unrepaired double-stranded breaks elimination haploid genome, similar observations mouse-human genome elimination. We hypothesize missegregated chromosomes enter degrad pathway initiated endonucle breaks. Occasionally, such chromosomes rescued, consequences mit malfunction genome integrity dire. Misegregation can lead anup (Jans et al., 2011), also extensive restructuring, sequestration micronucle, enducle damage, defective, rescue (Cr et al.,201; Hatch et.,2013; Zhang et.,201).

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Epstein-Barr Virus-Induced Apoptosis Suppression in the Absence of LMP1/NF Signaling during Early Infection**

**Research Question:** How does Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) induce apoptosis suppression in the absence of LMP/NF signaling during early infection, and what is the role of the viral protein EBNA in this process?

**Methods:** We employed BH profiling to investigate the regulation of apoptosis in uninfected, early-infected, and immortalized B cells, and identified a dynamic shift from BCL-2 to M-1/B-2 and B-1 in virus-infected cells. We found that EBNA regulates the BH profile and suppresses apoptosis by promoting M-1 localization and B-1 transcription.

**Findings:** Our study reveals a new role for EBNA in apoptosis suppression during early and late EB-induced cell proliferation. Human peripheral B cells depend on B-2 for survival, while EB upregulates additional survival proteins to suppress apoptosis. BH profiling predicted that EB-infected cells are primed for apoptosis due to combined effects of M-1 and B-2, with additional protection by B-1 in immortalized cells. Constitutive NF signaling from viral oncoprotein L1 is thought to be responsible for apoptotic suppression in latently proliferating cells, but the initial burst of cell proliferation by EB is driven by EB transcription factors in absence of appreciable L1 or NF activity.

**Implications:** This study defines a unique mechanism of EB-induced apoptosis suppression in the absence of L/NF signaling, highlighting the role of EBNA in regulating M-1 function and B- transcription. This has implications for EB lymphomagenesis, particularly in the early phase of infection where EBAs are expressed with little or no Ls.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of apoptosis in EB-infected cells and the role of EBNA in this process. The dynamic shift from B-2 to M-1/B- and B- in virus-inf cells is unique and relies on regulation of M-1 localization and B- transcription by EBNA. This study defines a new role for EBNA in apoptosis suppression with implications for EB lymphomagenesis.

**Title:** Deciphering the Complex Interplay of Genetics, Geography, Demography, and Environment in Shaping Specialized Metabolite Variation in Arabidopsis thaliana

**Research Question:** How do genetics, geography, demography, and environment intersect to shape the diversification of specialized metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana, and what are the mechanisms driving the generation and distribution of allelic variation influencing adaptation?

**Methods:** We investigated the variation of specialized metabolites in a population of 797 Arabidopsis thalian accessions, focusing on the glucosinolate (GSL) pathway, a well-characterized biosynthetic pathway with known causal loci for natural variation.

**Findings:** Our results show that a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography, and genetic processes influence specific chemotypes and their distribution, with causal loci in metabolism containing frequent independently generated alleles, suggesting within-species convergence. This highlights the complexity of selective forces shaping generation and distribution of allelic variation influencing adaptation.

**Implications:** This study provides a new perspective on the intricate interplay of genetics, demography, and environment in shaping specialized metabolite variation, underscoring the importance of understanding the intersection of these factors in local adaptation.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that genetics, geography, demography, and environment all contribute to the diversification of specialized metabolites in Arabid thalian, underscoring the need to consider the intersection of these factors in understanding trait evolution. This study highlights the complexity of allelic variation at causal loci, raising questions on how pathways with such diversity and structural variation pass speciation boundaries.

**Title:** Apoptotic Caspases: A Double-Edged Swords in Tumor Suppression and Promotion**

**Research Question:** How do apoptotic caspases, traditionally regarded as tumor suppressors, promote tumor growth and proliferation under certain conditions, and how are cells protected from their harmful effects?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of apoptotic caspases in a well-studied neoplastic tumor model, Drosoph, with oncogenic mutations in the proto-oncogene RasV (Ras12), which maintains tumorous cells in an 'und-like condition and transforms caspases from suppressors into promotors.

**Findings:** Our results show that caspases are activated in Ras12-modified tumorous cells, promoting the generation of intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells that signal back to tumorous epithelial cells, activating oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK further amplifies casase activity, constituting a feedback amplification loop. Interfering with this loop reduces neoplastic behavior and improves organism survival.

**Implications:** Our study reveals that Ras12-modified casases initiate a feedback loop between tumorous epithelial cells and macrophage-like cells necessary for uncontrolled growth and invasive behavior.

**Conclusions:** Although apoptotic casases are considered tumor suppressors, under certain conditions, such as oncogenic Ras12 in scri mutant cells, they can adopt tumor-promoting roles. This work extends previous models of E and J signaling switch from anti-tumor to pro-tumor by oncogenic Ras and identifies casases as essential components.

**Title:** Temporal Perception of Social Interactions: The Role of Oxytocin and Social Competency

**Research Question:** Does the subjective experience of time during social interactions vary with social competency, and is oxytocin involved in mediating this effect?

**Methods:** We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the relationship between social competency, temporal perception, and oxytocin. In Experiment 1, we measured the duration of social interactions between communicative and non-communicative agents. Results showed that communicative interactions were perceived as shorter than non-communicative, and this effect was negatively correlated with autistic-like tendencies. Experiment 2 tested the effect of intranasal oxytocin administration on socially proficient individuals, which restored the temporal compression effect. Conversely, administration of atosiban, an oxytoc antagonist, diminished the effect in socially proficient individuals. Experiment 3 reaffirmed the influence of social interactions on subjective duration and tied it to a stable trait - social proficiency. Experiment 4 probed the role of oxytoc in social interactions by administering atos to socially proficient individuals, which diminished the effect. Experiment 5 tested if intranasal oxytoc administration would promote social-induced compression in less proficient individuals.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that perceived time is not a faithful representation of physical time, but is idiosyncratic and ingrained with personality. Oxytoc is involved in mediating time perception of social interactions, supporting its role in human cognition. Temporal compression of social interactions is negatively correlated with autistic-like traits, which can be ameliorated with intranas oxytoc administration.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that oxyin plays a critical role in social cognition, particularly in the perception of time during social interactions. Socially proficient individuals are more susceptible to temporal compression, whereas less proficient are less so. Intranas oxy administration promotes compression in less individuals, whereas atos diminishes in proficient. This highlights the complex relationship between oxyin, social competency, and time perception.

**Conclusion:** Our study demonstrates that subjective experience of time during social interactions varies with social competency, and oxyin is involved in mediating this effect. Oxy plays a critical role in social cognition, particularly in the perception of time during interactions. These findings have implications for understanding social cognition, autism, and oxyin's role in mediating social behavior.

**Title:** Investigating the Interaction between SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Receptor Domain (RBD) and ACE2 Cell Protein: Effects of Mutations on Viral Infection and Immune Evasion**

**Research Question:** How do mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor domain (RBD) and ACE2 cell protein affect viral infection and immune evasion, and what are the implications for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern?

**Methods:** We performed a detailed affinity and kinetic analysis of the effect of five RBD mutations (K417, K417, N501, E484, and S477) and two ACE2 mutations (S19 and K26) on the R/ACE interaction at physiological temperature (37°C). We analyzed the effects of individual R mutations and combinations in SARS-CoV Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P) variants.

**Findings:** Most R mutations increased the affinity of R/ACE interaction, except K417, which decreased it. Our results suggest that N501 and S477 mutations enhance transmission by binding, K417 mutations facilitate immune escape, and E484 enhances immune evasion.

**Implications:** These findings have significant implications for understanding SARS-CoV-2 transmission and immune evasion. The increased affinity of RBD for ACE may enhance viral infection and disease severity, while K417 mutations may facilitate immune evasion. ACE variants with mutations may be at greater risk of infection and severe disease.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between RBD and ACE in SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune evasion. Further research is needed to examine the effect of these mutations on viral attachment to cells and disease severity.

**Title:** Mapping Gene-Gene Interactions Shape Phenotypes and Modify the Effects of Mutations during Development and Disease: A Large-Scale Mapping of Directional Epist Interactions in Drosophila Cells**

**Research Question:** How do gene-gene interactions shape phenotypes modify the effects of mutations during development and disease, and can directional epist interactions be mapped at a large scale?

**Methods:** We employed a combinatorial RNA interference and single-cell phenotyping approach to generate a large interaction map of 21 phenotypic features in Dophila cells. We devised a method that combines genetic interactions on phenotypes to reveal directional relationships, reconstructing the sequence of protein activities during mitosis.

**Findings:** Our study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional networks and provides a resource for interpreting functional consequences of genetic alterations. We report the largest map of multi-phen genetic profiles in metazoan cells to date, comprising 136 Doph genes implicated in cellular processes, including signalling, chromatin, and cell regulation. We quantitatively scored 21 phenotypes in cells using automated imaging. Gene functions were inferred based on statistical interactions, protein complexes clustered by similarity.

**Main Findings:**

1. We generated a large-scale map of multi-phen genetic profiles in metazo cells by combining gene pairs RNAi, high-throughput imaging, and modelling (Figure 1).
2. Identified 136 genes in key biological processes, including signalling, chromatin, cell regulation, and turnover (Supplementary file).
3. Demonstrated epist relationship between Ras/MAP signalling and SW/S regulators chrom remodelling, confirmed in vivo.
4. Showed directional interactions can be identified at scale and mapped to genomic sets to identify relationships.
5. Unbiased mapping and inference of epist made by multivariate phenotyping revealed a detailed diagram of regulatory and causal complexes during mitosis (Figure 5).

**Implications:**

1. Our study provides a powerful approach for reconstructing regulatory networks and interpreting genetic alterations.
2. Revealed a link between chrom remodelling and signalling, conserved in cancer cells.
3. Demonstrated that epist can be mapped at scale and used to identify relationships.

**Conclusions:**

Our study presents a novel approach for large-scale mapping epist interactions and provides a resource for understanding functional consequences of genetic alterations. We demonstrate that epist can be mapped at scale and used to identify relationships. Our findings highlight the importance of epist in understanding developmental and disease.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Basis of Heterosty in Primula: Identification of the CYP73450 Gene as the Locus Determining Style Length Polymorphism

**Research Question:** Despite the widespread occurrence of hetery in flowering plants, the genetic and evolutionary origins of this trait remain poorly understood. In Primula, hetery is controlled by the Slocus supergene, which determines reciprocal reproductive organ incompatibility between morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remain unknown.

**Methods:** We investigated the genetic basis of hetery in Primula by identifying the CYP50 gene, a putative brassinoster-degrading enzyme, as the locus determining style length polymorphism. CYP50 is present on the short-styled morph haplotype, specifically expressed in short styles, and its loss leads to long styles.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that CYP50 represents the locus in the Prim hetery super, whose expression in short styles causes brassoster degradation, limiting cell expansion and elongation. Evolutionarily, C50 arose via lineage-specific duplication and gain of style-specific expression. The proposed duplication and gain of style expression of C50 in the ancestor of Primaceae likely represents the dominant shortening mutation. C50 is a rare example of an identified locus underlying adaptive polymorphism, opening the way for understanding the origin of the Prim Sloc as a complex super.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for Prim style dimorphism and shed light on the evolution of the Sloc as a model for a plant super. The C50 gene shows accelerated molecular evolution and is absent in long-styled morphs, supporting its role in determining style length. The presence/absence polymorphism strictly cosegregates with morph in heterous species across the Prim phylogeny, strongly supporting C50 as the locus of the heter super.

**Conclusions:** Our study identifies C50 as the causal locus of heter in Primula, providing insights into the evolution of the Sloc as a complex super. This discovery opens avenues for understanding the genetic basis of heter in flowering plants and sheds light on the evolution of complex traits in plants.

**Title:** Essential Role of Kisspept and Neurokinin B (NKB) Circuits in Pubertal Development and Fertility: Unveiling the Cellular Mechanisms of Kisspept Neurons in the Hypothalamic Arc (KissAR)

**Research Question:** How do Kisspept neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (KissAR) regulate the episodic secretion of gonadotrop-releasing hormone (GnRH) during pubal development and fertility?

**Methods:** We employed optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular biology, and single-cell RT-PCR in mice to investigate the cellular basis of KissAR neuronal activity.

**Findings:** High-frequency photostimulation of KissAR neurons evoked the release of excitatory neurokinin B (NKB) and inhibitory dynorphin neuropeptides, which synchronized KissAR neuronal activity. The light-evoked activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons via a mechanism involving glutamateric input to preoptic Kiss neurons from KissAR. We found that KissAR neurons play a dual role in driving epis secretion of Gn through differential release of peptide and amino neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that Kisspe neurons in the hypothalamic arc play a crucial role in regulating the epis secretion of Gn during pubal development and fertility. The dual mechanism involves the release of NKB and dynin neuropeptides to synchronize KissAR activity, which in turn excites Gn neurons via glutamater input. This study provides new insights into the cellular basis of KissAR activity and its role in reproductive function.

**Conclusions:** Kisspe neurons in the hypothamic arc are essential for pubal development and fertility. We propose that KissAR neurons drive epis secretion of Gn through differential release of peptide and amino neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function. This study highlights the importance of Kisspe and NKB circuits in regulating Gn secretion during pubal development and fertility.

**Title:** Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling Regulates Pluripotency and Mesodermal Differentiation through Downregulation of CDH1

**Research Question:** How does bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling contribute to the maintenance of pluripotency and favor mesodermal differentiation, and what are the underlying mechanisms that control differentiation?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of BMP signaling in pluripotency and mesodermal differentiation by examining the expression of CDH1, a transcription factor involved in early stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. We found that loss of CD1 is a limiting for pluripotent cell differentiation and that suppression of CD1 rescues the BMP-imposed block to multilineage differentiation.

**Findings:** Our results show that BMP acts prior to and independently of CD1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesodermal differentiation, reinforcing the block to neural differentiation. We also found that higher levels of BMP impose posterior identity on cells, priming them for meserm and incompatible with neural fate.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that differentiation depends not only on exposure to extrinsic cues but also on morphogenetic events controlling receptivity to those cues. We propose that a key pluripot signal, BMP, feeds into this mechanism by maintaining CD1 expression, which interferes with neural and mesermal differentiation.

**Conclusions:** Our study identifies loss of CD1 as a limiting event for earliest stages of neural differentiation and proposes that BMP controls differentiation by maintaining CD1 expression. The strategy of coupling cell adhesion to transcriptional control of fate specification is used during development to coordinate tissue morphogenesis. We also show that BMP target Id1 imposes proximal identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them towards meserm. The ability of Id to block differentiation is unlikely to be explained by inhibition of neural-inducing factor or activation of mesermal, but a shift in positional identity of plurotent cells in absence of overt differentiation.

**Summary:** We have identified loss of CD1 activity as limiting for earliest stages of differentiation and propose BMP controls by maintaining CD1 expression. Our findings help explain why BMP can protect plurotency and promote mesermal differentiation at the same time.

**Title:** Centriole-associated protein Cep120 regulates centrosome homeostasis and ciliary assembly during quiescence

**Research Question:** How are the asymmetric properties of centrioles established and maintained during quiescence, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of centri-associated protein C120 (Cep) in regulating centros homeostasis and ciliary assembly during quies in mouse and human cells.

**Findings:** Depletion of C120 in quies cells leads to accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) components, including pericentr, C5ap2, ninein, and C170, resulting in increased microtubule-nucleation at the centome. Loss of C120 causes aberrant dyin-dependent trafficking of centomal proteins, dispersal of centolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that C120 maintains centros homeasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centole and defines a new molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Thoracic Dystrophy and Joub syndrome.

**Conclusions:** C120 plays a critical role in regulating PCM levels during quies, and its loss initiates a series of changes in protein localization and abundance that result in defective ciliary assembly and function. Changes in the maturation state of the centole, on which C120 is enriched, disrupt ciliary assembly and signaling, a process requiring CS-dependent delivery of factors to the centome. We propose that C regulates asymmetric distribution of PCM at the centome by residing on the outer wall of centolar microtubules. Loss of C during quence is detrimental to ciliary function, likely due to aberrant CS trafficking of proteins to the centome. Collectively, our results suggest loss of C disrupts localization of CS due to changes in PCM, microtule organization, and dyin trafficking of centomal proteins. Since satellites are essential in cogenesis, we hypothesize dispersal of CS upon C loss disrupts formation and/or of cilia during quence. Our findings establish exquisite control of centome homeasis and its relationship to ciliary assembly and signaling, and uncover a new molecular defect potentially underlying pathogenesis ofili such as Je and Joub syndrome.

**Title:** Neuron-Glia Interactions in the Developing Retina: Unveiling the Molecular Pathways of Communication between Neurons and Müller Glial Cells

**Research Question:** How do neurons and Müller glial cells (MCs) interact in the developing retina, and what are the molecular pathways that mediate this communication?

**Methods:** We employed whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and two-photon imaging of calcium indicators and glutamate sensors specifically expressed in MCs to investigate neurotransmitter release during retinal waves and their effects on MC activity.

**Findings:** Our results show that retinal waves induce calcium transients in a large proportion of MCs, indicating that spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks at this age. During cholinergic retinal waves, MC transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists, whereas glutamaterg waves were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate antagonists, suggesting that MC responsiveness changes match the neurotransmitter used in retinal waves. Using an optical glutamate sensor, we found that the decline in MC transients was caused by a reduction in glutamate reaching MCs.

**Implications:** These findings indicate that neurons and MC exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation enabled by neurotransmitter overflow from retinal synapses. Our study elucidates the spatio-temporal characteristics and molecular pathways of neuron-MC communication in the developing retina.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that MC express multiple neurotransmitter receptors throughout this period, allowing neuronal control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal shifts from cholinergic to glutamgic signaling. The proportion of MC that responded to waves with transients decreased from P9 to P11, despite retinal waves presence. MC express a variety of neurotransmitter types, including glutamg and cholin receptors, and calcium trans at different ages could be evoked by neurotrans released during retinal. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of neuron-MC interactions in the developing retina and highlights the importance of neurotransmitter spillo from retinal synapses in retinal maturation.

**Title:** Establishing a Novel Microbial-Based Method for Estimating Postmortem Interval (PM) in Forensic Investigations

**Research Question:** Can microbial communities associated with decomposing corpses provide a reliable and accurate method for estimating postmortem interval (PM) in forensic investigations, overcoming the limitations of existing techniques such as forensic entomology?

**Methods:** We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the temporal changes in microbial communities associated with mouse corpses decomposing on soil over 48 days. We characterized bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes using a combination of culture-independent, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches for each sample.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that postmortem microbial changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model, allowing PM to be estimated within approximately 3-48 days. We provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing system, suggesting that microbial data can be developed into a tool for estimating PM.

**Implications:** Our study rigorously tests hypotheses held by the forensic community about the role of microbes in decomposition and assesses whether microbial changes are predictable over the timeline, crucial for using microbes as a "clock" to estimate PM. Our data not only understand the underlying ecology of decomposition but also the feasibility of using microbes as evidence. We demonstrate that microbial community change is measurable and directional during decomposition, allowing accurate estimates of past events such as PM.

**Conclusions:** This proof-of-principle study shows that microbial ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a complementary forensic tool for estimating PM. Our approach distinguishes from prior work by evaluating models' ability to explain variation in data, being fit to all points (Pech et al., 2013). We provide a novel method for estimating PM that avoids limitations of existing techniques, such as forensic entom, which can range from days to months. Microbes offer a promising alternative for estimating PM in forensic investigations.

**Title:** Evolutionary Origins of the Hox- TALE Patterning System in Bilateria: A Stepwise Emergence of a Major Patterning Module

**Research Question:** How did the Hox-TALE pattering system evolve to provide positional information along the anterior-posterior axis in bilaterian animals?

**Methods:** Using unicellular and multicellular lineages, we investigated the emergence of Hox-TALE networks from an ancestral motif present in Hox and related protein families.

**Findings:** Our results show that Hox-TALE networks originated from a generic motif present in H and other homeobox families, with additional molecular innovations crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans.

**Implications:** This study highlights how homeobox families evolved during eukaryote evolution to constitute a major pattering system in Eumazoans.

**Conclusions:** We propose that H-T networks constituted an ancestral module later exploited for pattering in Bilateria, effective through interaction with duplicated H family members, diversifying patter functions along the axis. This original system was co-opted by various contexts of embryogenesis in eumazoan phyla for axis or tissue patterning.

**Key Findings:**

* Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of bilian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis.
* H genes are thought to have contributed to morphological diversification of bilian organisms during evolution.
* Developmental genes display dissimilar patterns or are absent in non-bian lineages, showing genetic mechanisms embryonic are not universal.
* Cnidaria is the only non-b phylum with a bonaide H repertoire, others lack H genes.
* P and Me proteins are present in non-b phyla, raising the question of how H acquired axial functions.

**Summary:** Our study describes the molecular underlying H-T patter system in Bilateria established stepwise during eary evolution.

**Title:** Investigating the Dynamics of AMPA Receptor Trafficking at Synapses using Super-Resolution Microscopy and Fluorophorescent Probes

**Research Question:** How do the size and photostability of fluorophores affect the trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPAR) outside and within postsynaptic densities (PSDs) in rat neurons?

**Methods:** We employed super-resolution microscopy to examine the dynamics of AMPAR labeled with different-sized fluorophores, including organic dyes (~4 nm), small quantum dots (sQDs, ~10 nm), and big dots (bDs > 20 nm), coupled to AMP via various linkers. A total of 126 synapses were observed.

**Findings:** We found that >90% of AMPs labeled with dyes or QDs were diffusing in confined nanodomains in PSDs, stable for 15 min or longer. Less than 10% of Q-AMPs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. In contrast, 5-10% of Q-AMPs were in PSD and 90-95 were extrasynaptic. Contrary to the hypothesis that AMP entry is limited by PSD occupancy, our findings suggest AMPs rapidly enter stable nanodomains in PSD with lifetime >15 min and do not accumulate extrasyn membranes.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that AMP localization is predominantly at synaptic regions, with typically one nanomain per synapse, and multiple nanodomains exist. Factors influencing surface-expressed AMPs, such as size and linker length, affect diffusion. Labeling with bDs is problematic due to the number of DIVs. Using QDs, we found no accumulation of large extrasynaptic receptors, instead, motion is constrained in PSD nanodom.

**Conclusions:** Our findings using three techniques (QDs, live, and fixed-neurons with fluorores) suggest that AMP localization is predominantly at synaptic regions. We also observe in fixed samples that typically one nanomain per synapse, multiple nanodom exist. Factors influencing surface-expressed AMPs, such as size and linker, affect diffusion. Labeling bDs is problematic due the number DIV. Using QDs, we found no accumulation large extrasyn receptors, instead, motion constrained in PSDodom.

**Title:** Mechanism of Hypoxia-Induced Increase in Voltage-Gated Sodium Current (IN) in Central Neurons: Role of SUMOylation of NaV1.2 Channels**

**Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the increase in voltage-gated sodium current (IN) in response to hypoxia in central neurons?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUM) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CG) and its effect on Na1.2 channels in response to hypia.

**Findings:** Our results show that hypia activates the SUM pathway in CG, leading to SUMylation of Na1.2 channels, which increases IN. The time-course of SUMylation of Na1.2 channels at the surface and IN coincide, and are prevented by mutation of Na1-Lys38 or application of a deSUMylating enzyme. Within 40s, hypia linkage of SUM1 to channels is complete, shifting the voltage dependence of channel so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents.

**Implications:** Given the recognized role of IN in hypoxic brain damage, the SUM pathway and Na1.2 are identified as potential targets for neuroprotective interventions.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that SUMylation of Na.2 channels at the plasma membrane underlies the immediate increase IN response to hypia in cultured neurons and CHO cells. This is consistent with tonic control of IN by the SUM pathway, as SUM and SEN1 increased and decreased the current, respectively, under normoxic conditions. The response IN to hypia was ablated by µ-Conotoxin-TII (CTX), a blocker of Na. channels. Supporting the mechanism, hypia SUMylation of Na.2 was shown to increase the interaction of SUM and Na. Our results suggest that Na. channels and SUM enzymes may be valuable targets for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons.

**Title:** Elucidating the Thermal Optima and Limits of Vector-Borne Disease Transmission: A Mechanistic Modeling of Ross River Virus Transmission

**Research Question:** What are the thermal optima and limits of vector-borne disease transmission, and how do they vary among different vector-pathogen systems?

**Methods:** We developed a mechanistic model for the thermal response of Ross River virus (RV), an important mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia and Pacific Islands, using data from two vector species (Culex annulirostris and Ae. vigil). We parameterized the model with empirical, unimodal thermal responses to predict transmission.

**Findings:** Our results show that RV transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines to zero at thermal limits (17.0 and 31.5°C). The model accurately predicts year-round transmission in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in a seasonal peak in human cases. Climate warming will increase transmission in temperate areas (where most Australians live) but decrease in tropical areas where temperatures are near the optimum.

**Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of nonlinear models in inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change. Thermal responses vary substantially among diseases and vectors, yet mechanistic models are lacking for many. Our results support a general pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission, where optimal temperature is driven by adult lifespan, but upper and lower limits are uncertain, determined by unique vector-pathogen traits. The strongest signal of temperature on disease is in temperate regions where temperature varies along the rising portion of the R curve (~20-25°C). Upper limits of mosquito-borne transmission, a concern for climate change, are determined by vector life traits with symmetrical performance (fecundity and survival) rather than asymmetrical traits (biting or pathogen rate).

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of mechanistic modeling in understanding thermal responses of vector-b disease. Our results illustrate the need to move beyond linear assumptions of increasing transmission with temperature, to accurately predict geographic, seasonal, and interannual variation in disease. Climate change will impact transmission differently in temperate and tropical areas, underscoring the need for region-specific predictions.

**Title:** Deciphering the Behavioral Correlates of Cortical Beta Oscillations: A Multi-Scale Neural Activity Analysis of Motor Cortical Oscillations and Behavior

**Research Question:** How are cortical beta oscillations linked to changes in neural activity and behavior?

**Methods:** We recorded multi-scale neural activity from the motor cortex of three macaques performing a novel neurofeedback task, where subjects voluntarily brought their beta power to an instructed state and executed arm reaches. Reaches preceded by a reduction in beta exhibited faster onset times than those preceded by an increase in power. Population activity was found to shift from a movement state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching.

**Findings:** Our results establish a neural basis for slowed onset periods following beta oscillatory activity. Notably, this shift in population was also seen in naturally occurring oscillations during tasks, suggesting beta reflect common spiking patterns in different contexts. This study ties together behavioral correlates of oscillations with hypotheses of the motor cortex encodes movement through population-level activity.

**Implications:** Our findings support the hypothesis that beta oscillations are linked to patterns slow onset new movements (Gilbertson et al., 2005) and add to previous reports of elevated power prior and after-trained movements (Donoghue et al., 199; Mur and Fetz, 199; Sanes andogh, 199). The behavioral effect of neuro-induced oscillations matches hypotheses a movement-slow role of oscillations during natural movements (Gilbert et al., 200). However, individual unit responses during beta were different across tasks. Mechanistic generators of oscillations reconciled discrepancies in reported correlates activity.

**Conclusions:** Simultaneously recorded units exhibited different activity during neurofeedback beta compared to natural oscillations during reaching. Despite unit-level differences, population analyses show beta promote a movement-slow state both tasks, matching behaviorally observed. This study provides a population basis for understanding the neural correlates of beta oscillations and their role in motor control.

**Title:** Essential Role of TRAF2 in Maintaining Immune Homeostasis and Keratinocyte Survival: Implications for Psoriasis Pathogenesis**

**Research Question:** What is the role of TRAF2 in regulating immune homeostasis and keratinocyte survival, and how does it contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of TR2, a component of the TNF superfamily signaling complex, in regulating immune homeostasis and keratinocyte survival using TR2 deficient mice and keratinocyte-specific deletion models. We also examined the role of the TR2 RING domain as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and its interaction with sphingosine-1-phosphate generated by sphingosine kinase 1.

**Findings:** TR2 deficient mice die at birth, highlighting its essential role in adult tissues. Keratin-specific deletion of TR2, but not sph1 deficiency, disrupted TNF-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling, causing epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation was driven by TN, non-canonical NF-κ, and the adaptive immune system, representing a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TR2 has tissue-specific functions not overlapping with sph1.

**Implications:** TR2 protects keratinocytes from death and downregulates inflammatory responses, supporting intrinsic defects in keratin initiate psoriasis-like inflammation. TR2 deficient keratinocytes do not require bacterial stimulation to produce TN, and TN-induced death sets a vicious cycle of inflammation. Concomitant deletion of TN and TR2 breaks this cycle, preventing keratin apoptosis and psoriasis onset. Primary keratinocytes from wild-type, TR2KO, and sph1- mice showed delayed TN signaling and weakened in TR2 deficient, but not sph1 deficient. TR2, but not sph1, keratinocytes were sensitive to TN-induced death, associated with reduced cIPL levels and caspase cleavage.

**Conclusions:** TR2 plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeasis and keratin survival, and its deficiency contributes to psoriasis pathogenesis. TR2 deficient keratinocytes produce inflammatory cytokines via non-canonical NFκ pathway, generating ps-like phenotype with slower onset. These cytokines recruit immune cells to skin, including neutrophils and IFγT cells. This study highlights the importance of TR2 in regulating keratin survival and inflammation, and its potential as a therapeutic target for psoriasis treatment.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Pathway for Synaptic Vesicle Reformation Independent of Clathrin and Dynamin 1/3 during Intense Synaptic Activity

**Research Question:** How do synaptic vesicles (SVs) rapidly reform after exocytosis, and what is the role of clrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and dynamin 1/3 in this process?

**Methods:** We used synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double-knockout (Dyn1/3KO) neurons, where CME is impaired, to investigate the poorly understood mechanisms of SV reformation. We analyzed the formation of bulkosomes and their conversion into SVs in the presence and absence of clrin and dyn 1/3.

**Findings:** Massive formation of bulkosomes was not defective, but rather enhanced in the absence of dyn 1 and 3. The conversion of bulkosomes into SVs was not accompanied by accumulation of clrin-coated buds on their surface, and proceeded even after clrin knockdown, suggesting independence of clrin. These findings support the existence of a pathway for SVformation that bypasses the requirement for clrin and dyn 1/3 and operates during intense synaptic activity.

**Implications:** Our results reveal a novel pathway for SV reformation that is independent of clrin and dyn 1/3, which is activated during intense synaptic activity. This challenges the current understanding that clrin and dyn 1/3 are essential for SV reformation, and highlights the complexity of synaptic vesicle recycling.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that clrin and dyn 1/3 are not required for bulkocyt, and their absence delays, but does not abolish, SVformation from internal membranes. We propose a novel pathway for SVformation that bypasses clrin and dyn 1/3, which is activated during intense synaptic activity. These findings have significant implications for our understanding synaptic plasticity and the mechanisms of neurotransmitter release.

**Title:** Identification of Circulating Biomarkers of Glucocortic Action: A Randomized Crossover Study in Primary Adrenal Insufficiency

**Research Question:** Can we identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocortic action in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency?

**Methods:** In a randomized, single-blind, crossover study, 10 patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and no other endocrinopathies were admitted to an in-patient clinic and studied during physiological glucortic exposure and withdrawal. Transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNA, and serum metabolomics were compared between interventions using integrated multi-omic analysis.

**Findings:** A transcriptomic profile from two tissues and multiomic cluster were predictive of glucortic exposure. MicroRNA (mi-122p) correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucortic exposure (p=0.009) and replicated in independent studies with glucortic exposure (0.01≤p≤0.05).

**Implications:** Our results provide the basis for discovery of biomarkers to measure glucortic effects, allowing individualize and optimize glucortic therapy, and shed light on disease etiology related to unphysiological glucortic exposure, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity.

**Conclusions:** This clinical biomarker study identified genes, miRNA, and metabolites differently expressed during GC exposure and withdrawal in subjects with Addison's disease. Multi-omic showed high coherence, and analysis transcriptomics and metabolites closely correlated. Association between mi-122p and GC exposure replicated in three independent groups. To identify putative biomarkers of GC in humans, a clinical study was the most appropriate setting. Addison disease or primary insuff a rare, unique model for biomarker due absent or low endogenous GC (Gan et al., 2014; Svik et al.). A multi-omic strategy combining gene expression in PBMC and adipose tissue with circulating miRNAs and metabolites identified putative biomarkers. Strongest biomarkers replicated in independent groups with GC exposure. A transcript profile under GC regulation in PB and adipose transcriptomes validated by published data cellular assays. A circulating mi, mi-122p, correlated transcript and metabolome, suggesting first functional GC action.

**Title:** Unveiling the Dynamics of mTORC1 Activation by Amino Acids: A Novel Insights into the Spatial and Temporal Regulation of mTOR1 Activity

**Research Question:** How do amino acids regulate the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in cells, and what is the role of the lysosome in this process?

**Methods:** We employed live-cell imaging of the mTOR component RAP and a fluorescent analogue of leucine methyl ester to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of mTOR1 translocation to lysosomes in response to amino acids. Additionally, we tested a series of leuc analogues for mTOR1 activation and expressed subunits of m1 tagged with GFP to follow localization in live cells.

**Findings:** Our results show that m1 translocation to lysosomes is a transient event, occurring within 2 minutes of amino addition and peaking at 5 minutes, temporally coupled with leuc appearance in lysosomes. Sestr2 and vacuolar ATPase are negative and positive regulators of m1 activity in our system. Phosphorylation of canonical m1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of1 from lysosomal surface targeting substrates elsewhere.

**Implications:** Our findings provide the first dynamic view of m1 activation in response to amino, highlighting the lysosome as a crucial locus for this process. The data support the idea that amino acids activate m1 in the cell interior, with multiple types of sensing and involved, including leuc, arginine, and possibly others.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals the spatial and temporal dynamics of m1 activation by amino, shedding light on the role of the lysosome in this process. The findings have implications for understanding the regulation of m1, a key regulator of cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and autophagy. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms of m activation, including the role of Sestr2, vacolar ATP, and other regulators.

**Title:** Glycosylation of Antigens Regulates Antigen Uptake and Intracellular Routing, Influencing Antigen Presentation and Immune Response

**Research Question:** How does glycosylation of antigens influence antigen uptake and intracellular routing, and subsequently affect antigen presentation and immune response?

**Methods:** We investigated the impact of glycosylation on antigen uptake and intracellular routing using Ovalbumin (OVA) conjugated with Lewis X (Le) glycan structure. We analyzed antigen presentation and immune response in wild-type (WT) and M1-deficient (M1KO) mice.

**Findings:** Glycosylation of OVA with Le directs O to the C-type lectin receptor M1 (M1), skewing CD4+ T cells towards Th1 differentiation and enhancing CD8+ T priming. Cross-presentation of native O requires high antigen and TLR stimuli, whereas Le modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and abolishes TLR dependence. O-LeX-induced CD8 T priming is M1-dependent, as shown by reduced effector cell frequencies in M1KO mice. M1-mediated cross-presentation of OLe neither requires T-transport nor Cathein-S and occurs after prolonged antigen storage in Rab+AMP+ compartments.

**Implications:** Glycosylation of antigens crucially influences intracellular routing, affecting antigen presentation and immune response strength. Modification of antigens with Le glycans can optimize current vaccination strategies.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates glycosylation of antig has a major impact on antigen uptake and intracellular compartmentalization, affecting antigen presentation and immune response. Conjugation of Le to O directs O to M1, enhancing CD8 T priming and Th skewing CD4 cells. O-Le immunization in M1 KO mice shows comparable effector cells as WT immunized with native O. These data show conjugation Le to O re-directs O to M1, enhancing CD8 T prim in vivo.

**Title:** Burkholderia thailandensis Utilizes Acyl-Homoser Lactone-Mediated Quorum Sensing to Regulate Hundreds of Genes, Including Cell-Contact Dependent Type VI Secretion Systems

**Research Question:** How does Burkholderia thailandensis utilize acylomoser lactone-mediated quorum sensing to regulate hundreds of genes, including cell-contact dependent type VI secretion systems?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of quorum sensing in Burkholderia thailandensis, a Gram-negative bacterium, and its impact on cell-dependent type VI secretion (TSS) systems. We used a quorum-sensing receptor mutant (BR) and its parent strain in cocultures to examine the effect of quorum on TSS1-mediated toxicity and immunity.

**Findings:** Our results show that quorum activates TSS1-mediated toxicity and immunity in Burkia thailandensis, allowing competent cells to police against BR mutants. In planktonic growth, where TSS1 does not function due to limited cell contact, BR mutants have a fitness advantage over wild-type, likely due to the cost associated with BR-dependent activities. Conversely, intact TSS1 apparatus is required for wild-type to outcompete BR mutants in agar growth.

**Implications:** This study defines a novel role for TSS in intraspecies control, where quorum-competent cells mitigate the cost of BR-BR regulation by hindering growth of mutants via regulation of cell-dependent toxin and immunity. This is a form of microbial policing, where QS-competent bacteria outcompete populations of signal non-operators in the absence of T-contact growth system.

**Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that Burkia thailandensis utilizes acylom lactone-mediated quorum sensing to regulate hundreds of genes, including cell-dependent type VI secretion systems. Quorum activates T1-mediated toxicity and immunity, allowing competent cells to police against mutants. In the absence of cell contact, mutants have a fitness advantage due to the cost associated with BR-dependent activities. Intact T1 apparatus is required for wild-type to outcomp mutants in agar growth. This work highlights a novel mechanism for limiting quorum mutant growth in groups and expands our understanding of T functions in Burkia thailand.

**Title:** Long-Range Coupling within Prefrontal-Hippocampal Networks Accounts for Cognitive Performance Emergence in Early Life: A Discontinuous Hippocampal Theta Bursts Drive Neonatal Prefrontal Oscillations

**Research Question:** How do long-range interactions between the prefrontal and hippocampal networks contribute to the emergence of cognitive performance in early life, and what is the cellular substrate of these interactions?

**Methods:** We employed optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of the dorsal and intermediate/ventral hippocampus in neonatal mice to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefront oscillatory entrainment.

**Findings:** Our results show that despite stronger theta and ripples in the dorsal hippocampus, the prefront cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus via phase-locking of neuronal firing via direct axonal projections. Theta-band activation of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1, transfected by utero with high-efficiency channelodopsin, boosts prefront oscillations.

**Implications:** Our data causally elucidate the cellular origin of long-range coupling in the developing brain, supporting the hypothesis that hippocal theta drives oscillatory entrainment of local circuits in the prefrontal cortex. The temporal delay of 10-20 ms between prefront and hippocal spike trains and estimated direction of information flow between areas suggest hippocal drives prefront oscillations.

**Conclusions:** We provide evidence that theta-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in CA area intermediate and ventral (iHP) but not dorsal (dHP) elicits broad oscillations in prefrontal cortex via axonal projections. Tight coupling and information flow from hippocal CA to prefront via axonal suggest HP acts at neonatal as a drive for prefront activation. Differences between dHP-PL and iHP communication argue for prominent driving force along septo-temporal hippocal axis. Our optogenetic protocol opens new perspectives for assessing adult readout of long communication in developing brain.

**Title:** Dynamic Post-translational Modification of RNA Polymerase II Coordinates Co-transcriptional Recruitment of Enzymatic Complexes Regulating Chromatin States and Processing of Nascent RNA

**Research Question:** How do post-translational modifications of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPI) regulate chromatin states and processing of nascent RNA during transcription?

**Methods:** We employed biochemical and genome-wide approaches to investigate postl modifications of the structurally-disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPI, which is composed of heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7. We generated antibodies specific to CTD-Kme1 and C-Kme2 and detected these modifications during earliest stages of transcription, preceding or accompanying phosphorylation of Ser-5 and Ser-7.

**Findings:** Mono- and di-methylation of Cys-7 residues (Kme1 and K2) are observed during earliest stages of transcription, preceding or accompanying phosphorylation of Ser-5 and Ser-7. In contrast, Kacetylation is associated with RNAPI elongation, Ser-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression. We identified an unexpected balance between RNAPI K methylation and acetylation at promoters, fine-tuning gene expression levels.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that postl modifications of C-7 residues modulate productive transcription, with methylation associated with less transcription and acetylation enriched at highest expressed genes. RNAPI binds to promoters in hypophosphorylated state, before C becomes phosphorylated at Ser-5 and Ser-7, marking earliest stages of transcription. Productive elongation characterized by increase phosphorylation of Ser- throughout gene bodies, with highest levels around transcription end sites.

**Conclusions:** Our findings indicate that postl modifications of C-7 regulate chromatin states and processing of nascent RNA, with methylation associated with early stages and acetylation with productive elongation. The balance between methylation and acetylation at promoters fineunes gene expression levels, suggesting a novel mechanism for regulating transcriptional control. These results have implications for understanding transcriptional regulation and chromatin dynamics, and highlight the importance of postl modifications in modulating gene expression.

**Title:** Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Satellite Cell Quiescence by Tristrapin and p38/β MAPK Signaling

**Research Question:** How do skeletal muscle satellite cells maintain their quiescent state and proliferate upon muscle injury to repair tissue and replenish the satellite cell population?

**Methods:** To investigate the mechanisms involved in maintaining satellite cell quies, we identified transcripts differentially expressed during satellite cell activation following muscle injury. We found that transcripts encoding RNA-binding proteins, particularly Tristetrolin, were significantly changed. Tristrol promotes the decay of MyD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment via binding to MyD 3' untranslated region. Upon cell activation, p38/β MAPK phosphorylates and inactivates Tristrol, stabilizing MyD mRNA.

**Findings:** Satellite cell-specific knockdown of Tristrol precociously activates cells in vivo, enabling My accumulation and differentiation into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by Tristrol appears to function as a critical post-transcriptional mechanism controlling satellite homeostasis.

**Implications:** MyD upregulates its own transcription, injury triggering a feed-forward loop resulting in MyD expression driving SCs to commit to myoblast. We propose that TTP may be involved in downregulating MyD and other T-target transcripts byoblast during initial formation of quies SC or reacquisition of quies following injury.

**Conclusions:** Muscle regeneration requires SCs to rapidly exit quies but also renew quies SC upon completion. We propose T suppresses transcripts for activation as a mechanism for immediate exit quies. Upon injury, pαβ MAP is rapidly activated phosphorylating T, suggesting T plays a role in maintaining quies. T is present in quies SC, inhibited by pβ MAP signaling within minutes of activation, and reduces half-life MyD mRNA. Loss of T from muscle preciously activates SC, promoting My expression and aberrant cycle entry.

**Key Findings:**

* Tristrol is a key regulator of satellite cell quies
* pβ MAP signaling inactivates Trist, stabilizing MyD mRNA
* Satellite cell knockdown Trist preciously activates cells, enabling My accumulation and myofib differentiation
* T suppresses MyD and other transcripts byob during quies formation or reacquisition
* pβ MAP phosphorylates T upon activation, suggesting role in quies maintenance
* T is present in quies, inhibited byβ signaling, and reduces MyD half-life

This abstract provides a clear and concise overview of the research question, methods, findings, implications, and conclusions of the study on the regulation of skeletal muscle satellite cell quies by Tristrol and p/β MAP signaling.

**Title:** Macrophage-Intrinsic Interleukin-10 Signaling Regulates Intestinal Homeostasis in Infant Mice and Prevents Early-Onset Colitis

**Research Question:** Does interleukin-10 (IL-10) receptor (ILR) signaling regulate lamina propria macrophage function during infant development, and is macrophage-intrinsic IL-10 signaling required to prevent colitis in infancy?

**Methods:** We conducted a time-series study using IL-10 deficient mice and their littermate controls, evaluating histology, inflammatory gene expression, cellular composition of the lamina propria, and luminal bacterial communities from birth to 14 weeks of age. We used clodron depletion to investigate the role of colonic macrophages in colonic inflammation that develops in IL-10 deficient mice.

**Findings:** Although signs of colitis were absent in IL-10 deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction began in the third week of life, concurrent with weaning and diversification of intestinal microbiota. IL-10 did not directly regulate microbial ecology during infant development. Macrophage depletion inhibited the development of colitis, while absence of IL-10 on macrophages sensitized infant mice to colitis.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that IL-10 mediated regulation of macrophage function during postnatal period is indispensable for preventing murine colitis, suggesting that macroph-intrinsic IL-10 signaling is critical for intestinal homeostasis in infancy. The absence of IL-10 on macrophages renders mice susceptible to colitis, highlighting the importance of IL-10 mediated macrophage function in preventing intestinal inflammation.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that macroph-intrinsic IL-10 signaling is required during a critical developmental transition, underscoring the importance of understanding factors that initiate colitis in infants with genetic IL-10 deficiencies. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the etiopathogenesis of infantile colitis and highlight the importance of IL-10/ILR pathway in mucosal homeostasis and prevention of intestinal inflammation in infancy.

**Title:** Identification of SIM-1, a Tudor Domain Protein, as a Key Regulator of the piRNA Pathway and Mutator Complex in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How does the piRNA pathway interact with the mutator complex to regulate transposons and germline genes in Caenorhabis elegans?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of SIM-1, a Tudor domain protein, in the regulation of the piRNA pathway and mutator complex in Caenorhabdis elegans.

**Findings:** We found that SIM-1 acts downstream of piRNA production and upstream of the mutator-dependent siRNA biogenesis, bridging the gap between the primary and secondary phases of the piRNA silencing pathway. SIM-1 localizes to distinct cytoplasmic foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, suggesting a role for perinuclear condensates in organizing the pi pathway and promoting regulation by the mutator complex.

**Implications:** This study identifies SIM-1 as a factor required for the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex and highlights the importance of perin condensates in mRNA regulation by the pi pathway and mutator. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of piRNA silencing in Caenor elegans.

**Conclusion:** The piRNA pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of transpos and germl genes in Caenorhab elegans, mediated by the mut complex synthesizing high levels of siRNAs through an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the steps between mRNA recognition by the pi pathway and siRNA amplification by the mut complex were unknown. Our study reveals SIM-1, a Tud domain protein, as a key regulator of the pi pathway and mut complex, acting downstream of pi production and upstream of mut-dependent siRNA biogenesis. SIM- localizes to distinct cytoplasmic foci adjacent to Pules and Mut foci, implicating perin condates in organizing the pathway and promoting regulation by the mut complex. This work sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of piRNA silencing in Caenor and highlights the role of SIM-1 in bridging the gap between primary and secondary phases of the pi pathway.

**Title:** In Vivo Bistability of Purkin Neurons in Larval Zebraf (Danio rerio): A Novel Insights into Cerebellar Function

**Research Question:** Do Purkin neurons exhibit bistability in vivo in unanesthetized larval zraf (Danio rerio)?

**Methods:** We recorded intracellularly from Purkin neurons in unanhetized larval zraf (Dan rerio) from 4 to 19 days post-fertilization (dpf) to investigate bistability in vivo.

**Findings:** We unequivocally demonstrate bistability in Purkin neurons in vivo. Tonic firing was observed in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolar membrane potentials. Purkin neurons could switch from one state to another spontaneously or with current injection. GABA or NMDA receptors were not required for bursting, but activation of AMP receptors by climbing fibers (CFs) was sufficient to trigger bursts. Recording Purkin membrane potential intracellular and motor spikes extracellular showed initiation of motor spiking correlated with increased CFs and depolarization. Bistability was observed soon after Purkin specification and persisted until late larval stages.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest bistability is a conserved feature of Purkin neurons from fish to mammals, as supported by conservation of structural and functional properties of the cerebellum. In vivo, Purkin neurons can be in tonic or bursting mode and toggle between states. This is the first demonstration of bistability in Purkin neurons in vivo in a vertebrate.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into cerebellar function and bistability in vivo. Bistability is a fundamental property of Purkin neurons in larval zraf, and likely conserved across vertebrates. Our findings have implications for understanding cerebellar function and motor control in vertebrates. Future studies should investigate bistability in mature cerebellum and its role in motor learning and plasticity.

**Title:** Force Generation by Actin Assembly Shapes Cellular Membranes: An Experimentally Constrained Multiscale Model Shows a Minimal Branched Actin Network is Sufficient for Internalization of Endocytic Pits Against Membrane Tension

**Research Question:** How does actin assembly contribute to the internalization of endocytic pits against membrane tension in mammalian cells?

**Methods:** We developed a multiscale model combining continuum mechanics and filament-based simulations of actin polymerization to investigate the role of actin in endocytosis. We used cryo-electron tomography to confirm the presence of bent actin filaments in endocytic pits and measured the number of Arp/3 complexes at clath-mediated endocyt sites.

**Findings:** Our results show that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endytic pits against physiological membrane tension. Actin self-organization and bending, arising from act-coat attachments around the endytic pit, enable the network to adapt to changing loads. Approximately 200 Arp/3 complexes accumulate at clath endocyt sites over time. Incorporating this number into our multiscale model, simulations revealed that actin self-organizes into a radial array with ends toward the base of the pit, with filaments bending between the coat and base. Elastic energy stored in bent filaments contributes to endytic internalization. Elevated tension directs filaments toward the base, increasing actin nucleation and bending force production.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that spatially constrained actin assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism for endocyt under varying physical constraints. In cells with low tension, endyt occurs with low Arp/3 activity, consistent with previous observations (Bant et al., 2011). We propose that actin self-organization from HipR distribution and filament bending allows the endytic network to change organization and force capacity under elevated loads.

**Conclusions:** Our multiscale model demonstrates that a minimal actin network composed of act, Arp/3, and capping, with attachments in clath and constrained by biochemical measurements, generates sufficient force for endytic internalization against mammalian membrane tension. Actin self-organization and bending enable the network to adapt to changing loads, facilitating endytic under physiological conditions.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Macropocytosis: A Novel Insights into the Formation and Regulation of Macropocytic Cups in Dictyostelium

**Research Question:** How do macropocytic cups form in Dictyostelium, and what is the role of signaling molecules in their formation?

**Methods:** We used lattice light sheet microscopy to examine the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SCAR and WAS with respect to signaling molecules P3 and Ras in Dictyostel.

**Findings:** Macropocytic cups in Dictyostel are organized around intense patches of P3, active Ras, and Rac. These patches are associated with a ring of active SCAR at their periphery, which is recruited by signaling and drives a ring of F-act to extend the walls of the macinocytic cup. Macinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting existing ones, and we propose that cup-shaped plasma structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP, which recruit a ring of actinators to their periphery.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of macocytosis, a fundamental process that allows cells to take up extracellular liquid into vesicles. We show that macocytic cups in Dictostel are organized around intense patches of P3, active, Ras, and Rac, which are associated with a ring of active SCAR at their periphery. We propose that this ring of SCAR is recruited by signaling and drives a ring of F-act to extend the walls of the macocytic cup. Our results suggest that macocytic cups form by splitting existing ones, and that cup-shaped plasma structures form from self-organizing patches of active/PIP, which recruit a ring actinators to their periphery.

**Conclusions:** We propose a new hypothesis for the formation of macocytic cups from the plasma membrane. Our results show that macocytic cups in Dictostel are organized around intense patches of P3, active, Ras, and Rac, which are associated with a ring of active SC at their periphery. We propose that this ring SC is recruited by signaling and drives a ring F to extend the walls of the macytic cup. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of macytosis, a process that is critical for cellular function.

**Title:** Structural and Functional Insights into the Role of Scc in Cohesin Loading and Localization during Sister Chromosome Segregation

**Research Question:** How does the Scc protein complex contribute to the loading of cohesin onto DNA and its localization across the genome, and what is the molecular basis for its recruitment to centromeres?

**Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of Scc bound to a fragment of S2, and used yeast genetics to investigate the role of Scc in cohes loading and localization.

**Findings:** The structure reveals a TPR array on S4 that envelops an extended S2 peptide, and a conserved patch on the surface of S4 is required to recruit S2/4 to centromeres and pericentere. Perturbation of this patch eliminates centrom localization of S2 in mitotic cells and reduces association of cohes subunit S1 with centrom and pericere, but not chromosome arms.

**Implications:** Our findings establish the role of S4 in determining cohes localization and provide a molecular basis for S/4 recruitment to centrom. The conserved patch on S4 is essential for targeting cohes to a specific locus, separable from its role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome.

**Conclusions:** Scc plays a crucial role in loading cohes onto DNA and determining its localization across the genome. Defects in cohes loading lead to chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, causing developmental defects in multicellular organisms. The S4-dependent cohes targeting pathway is conserved across eukaryotes, suggesting a general mechanism for cohes loading.

**Title:** Season of Birth Affects Growth, Fattening, and Winter Survival in Garden Dormice (Eliomys quinus): A Comparative Study of Early- and Late-Born Juveniles

**Research Question:** Does the timing of birth in the reproductive season influence growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival, and fecundity in early-born (EB) and late-born (LB) juvenile garden dormice (Eliysinus quinus)?

**Methods:** We investigated the growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival, and fecundity of EB and LB juvenile dormice in a controlled laboratory setting. We manipulated food availability (ad libitum vs. intermittently fasted) to examine its effects on growth and pre-hibern fattening, use of energy-saving strategies (daily torpor), body size and fat prior to hibernation, overwintering patterns, and mass, and fecundity in the following spring.

**Findings:** LB juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as EB individuals, with low tor use during growth, but increased during pre-hibern fattening. LB showed higher tor use, reached similar body sizes but lower fat content than EB before hibern. LB showed similar hibernation patterns, but higher proportion of breeders the following year than EB.

**Implications:** Our results suggest tor is incompatible with growth but promotes preibern fattening and consolidates preibern fat deposits in dormice. Being born late in the season is associated with a fast life history.

**Conclusions:** Our findings support the hypothesis that LB dormice grow and fatten at higher rates due to (i) higher tor use, (ii) reach preibern levels of body but lower fat, leading (iii) differences hibern patterns and mass overwinter, compared EB individuals. The use of tor seemed to be incompatible with growth but supports preibern fattening in the late season and preservation of fat previously deposited prior hibern. This was especially the case for EB that reached higher fat reserves prior hibern, compared LB. LB delayed onset hibern by 5 weeks.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) RNA Editing in Caenorhabditis elegans Neural Function: Identification of Critical Targets and Mechanisms**

**Research Question:** What are the neural targets and mechanisms underlying the chemotaxis defects in Caenorhabditis elegans lacking Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to) RNA editing enzymes (ADARs)?

**Methods:** We performed an unbiased assessment of the effects of ADR-2, the only A-to editing enzyme in C. elegans, on the neural transcriptome using publicly available software SAIL, identifying 736 A-to editing events across the neural transcriptome. We intersected the neuralome with ADR-2 associated gene changes, revealing edited cle-41, whose expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring cle-41 expression in ADR-2 deficient cells rescued chemaxis, providing evidence that phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered expression.

**Findings:** Our analysis of the C. elegans neural transcriptome revealed 736 A-to editing sites, including 104 novel genes, not observed in whole worm analysis. Intersecting with ADR-2 associated gene changes, we identified edited cle-41, whose expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring cle-41 expression in A- deficient cells rescued chemaxis, providing evidence that phenotypes AD mutants can be caused by altered expression.

**Implications:** This study provides the first link between phenotype loss of C. eleg AD enzymes and editing-dependent regulation of specific gene. Our data indicate aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack C. eleg ADR are result of altered expression rather than recoding events, contrary to AD roles in mammals.

**Conclusions:** This is the first study to dissect the tissue-specific role of ADR, in A-to editing and regulating gene in C. eleg. Combining neural isolation with RNA-sequencing and editing detection with SAIL, we identified over 730 A-to sites in C neural transcript, including novel genes. Our findings suggest changes may not be observed whole analysis. Previous studies have shown worms lacking- exhibit defects (Ton et al., 2002), yet mechanism yet determined. To elucidate ADR target RNAs important proper function, neuralome queried genes chemaxis locomotion.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Influenza A Virus-Induced Host Shutoff: Preferential Translation of Viral mRNAs and Dominance over Cellular mRNA Pool

**Research Question:** How does Influenza A virus (IAV) induce host shutoff, a strategy used by viruses to repress cellular mRNA translation and concomantly allow efficient translation of viral mRNAs?

**Methods:** We employed RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate the mechanisms utilized by IAV to induce shutoff. Our analysis revealed that viral mRNAs are preferentially translated, leading to a decline in cellular protein synthesis mediated by viral takeover of the mRNA pool.

**Findings:** Our measurements uncovered variability in levels of cellular transcript reduction, indicating that short transcripts are less affected by IAV. Interestingly, mRNAs refractory to IAV infection are enriched in maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Continuous phosphorylation activity is crucial for viral propagation.

**Implications:** Our results advance understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggest a mechanism facilitating translation of genes with housekeeping functions.

**Conclusions:** Our systematic and unbiased analysis demonstrates that viralRNAs are preferentially translated compared to host counterparts, and extensive translation of viral proteins result from viral takeover of mRNA in the cell. This is consistent with notion that NS is not required for shutoff host protein production. To access host machinery, viruses utilize sh mechanisms eliminating competition from cellular transcripts. Sh could be achieved by two mechanisms: direct-opting translation by forcing viralRN better than host counterparts, or takeover of mRNA pool. IAV employs the latter strategy, with viralRN taking over 53.8% of translation activity at 8 hours post-infection, while 57.3% mRNAs in cells are viral. Reduction in cellular expression is main cause shutoff during infection. Our findings concur that PA endonuclease plays dominant role in sh during IAV infection.

**Key Takeaways:**

* IAV induces sh by preferential translation of viralRN and takeover of mRNA pool
* Short transcripts less affected by IAV
* mRN refractory to IAV enriched in maintenance processes like oxidative phosphorylation
* Continuous phosphorylation crucial for viral propagation
* PA enduclease plays dominant role in sh during IAV

**Title:** Mechanisms of Gradient Formation of Signaling Proteins in Tissue Morphogenesis: A Novel Insights from Drosophila FGF Signaling

**Research Question:** How do signaling gradients of proteins induce tissue morphogenesis, and what are the underlying mechanisms of gradient formation?

**Methods:** We investigated the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, expressed at physiological levels from genomic knock-in alleles in Drosoph, focusing on the larval wing imaginal disc. We found that FGF produced in the wing disc moves to the air sac-primord (ASP) through FGFR-containing cilia that extend from ASP to contact the wing disc. The number of F-receiving cilia by ASP cells decreases with increasing distance from the source, generating a specific F gradient.

**Findings:** Acting as a morphogen in ASP, F activates concentration-dependent gene expression of Pointed1 at higher and Cut at lower levels. Transcription factors Pointed1 and Cut antagonize each other, differentially regulating FG-containing cilia formation, creating regions with higher-to-lower F-receiving cilia. These results reveal a mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific contours through feedback regulation of cilia-mediated dispersion.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific contours through feedback regulation of cilia-mediated dispersion. This contrasts with the traditional view that paracrine signals, such as FGF proteins, function as diffusible signals forming a gradient by passive extracellular dispersion. Our findings suggest that local cilia-mediated cell-cell communication can create long-range signals to regulate tissue morphogenesis.

**Conclusions:** This study addresses fundamental questions on gradient formation of Doph FGF protein, Branchless (B), which guides branching morphogenesis of tracheal epithelial tubes. We show that B diffuses from its source to form an extracellular gradient that guides directional migration of trache branches. However, our results indicate that B gradient shape adapts to diverse morphologies through feedback regulation of cilia. Our findings demonstrate that cilia-dependent signaling can provide precision and adaptability in shaping long-range gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.

**Title:** Discovery of a Novel α/β Coiled Protein Structure through Insertion of Two or Six Residues into the Heptad Repeat of a Trimeric Coiled Coil

**Research Question:** Can the insertion of two or six residues into the hept repeat of a trimer coiled coil lead to the formation of a novel protein structure, and what are the implications of this discovery on our understanding of protein folding and design?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of inserting two or six residues into the hept repeat of a trimer coiled coil using parametric equations to describe the backbone structure. Our results show that this insertion strains the supercoil, causing the formation of short β-strands that move 120° around the trimer axis, resulting in an α/β coiled structure retaining only one backbone bond per unit from the parent coiled.

**Findings:** Our study reveals the unexpected formation of a novel α/β coiled structure through the insertion of two or six residues into the hept repeat of trimer coiled. This structure retains only one backbone bond per unit from the parent coiled and forms a β-layer, a new supersecondary structure composed of short-strands. The α/β coiled is built of hexads with three residues in β and three in α regions of the Ramachran plot.

**Implications:** The discovery of α/β coiled structure expands our understanding of protein folding and design. α-helical coiled coils are ubiquitous, and their structure can be computed with parametric equations, making them ideal for design. However, insertions of 2 and 6 residues were thought to cause greatest strain on α-hical geometry. Our results show that these insertions break α-hices to form β-strands, which associate into β-layer, a novel supersecondary structure. The α/β coiled is a new class of fiber with alternating α and β-structure, a fold not previously described.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that minor mutations to known folds can yield novel structures within allowed regions of Ramach space. The α/ coiled is a minimalistic, retaining only single backbone bond from parent structure, built of hexads with three residues in β and three in α regions. β-layers are repetitive in natural coiled, forming regular fibers with alternating α and β-structure. The α/β coiled is a novel protein structure with potential applications in protein design and understanding.

**Title:** Elucidating the Evolutionarily Conserved Function of Epsin in Clath-mediated Endocytosis: A Critical Role in Clath Coat Dynamics

**Research Question:** What is the evolutionary conserved function of epsin in clath-mediated endocytosis, and how does it contribute to clath coat dynamics?

**Methods:** We generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional eps triple knockout (KO) mice to investigate the role of epsin in clath-mediated endocytosis. We observed a dramatic cell division defect and robust impairment in clath-mediated endocyt with accumulation of early U-shaped pits, correlating with perturbation of coupling between clath coat and actin cytoskeleton in a cell-free endocyt assay.

**Findings:** Our results indicate a key conserved function of eps, in addition to other roles, is a low affinity interaction with SNAREs, generating force leading to invagination and fission of clath-coated pits.

**Implications:** Our study provides conclusive evidence on function and sites of action of eps in endyt using gene strategy to eliminate all eps. Roles of eps in clath-independent endyt may be linked to actin regulation. Notably, we found a weak interaction of eps ENTH domain with SNARE synaptrev2/VAMP, essential for vesicle fusion with target membranes. However, our study suggests eps is critical at earlier stages of clath maturation, with accumulation of shallow U-shaped endytic clrin-coated pits in eps TKO cells.

**Conclusions:** Eps plays a critical role in coupling endytic clath coat to actin, facilitating invagination and fission of cl-coated pits. Our findings highlight the importance of eps in clath-mediated endyt, distinct from other endytic proteins, including clath itself, which have been implicated in mitoscaffolding (Royle et al., 2013; Kaur et al., 2014). Recent study using RNAi KD in fibrobl cells reported global impairment of clrin endyt, attributed to fission defect (Bourot et al.,2012). Our study provides conclusive evidence on function and sites of eps in endyt using KO strategy to eliminate all eps.

**Title:** Investigating the Risk Factors for Asthma among School-Aged Children in Urban Uganda: A Case-Control Study

**Research Question:** What are the risk factors associated with asthma among school-aged children (5-17 years) in urban Uganda?

**Methods:** A case-control study was conducted among 555 cases and 111 controls. Asthma was diagnosed by clinicians.

**Findings:** The main risk factors for asthma were:

* Tertiary education for fathers (adjusted OR (95% CI): 2.32 (1.71-3.16) and mothers (1.85 (1.38-2.48)
* Area of residence at birth, with children born in a town or city having increased risk compared to those born in rural areas (2.16 (1.60-2.92) and 2.79 (1.79-4.35) respectively
* Father and mother's history of asthma
* Children's own allergic conditions
* Atopy
* Cooking with gas/electric

**Implications:** Asthma is associated with a rural-urban risk gradient, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity. This study provides a basis for future studies to identify environmental/lifestyle factors responsible for increasing risk among children in urban in LMIC.

**Conclusion:** The risk of asthma among school children in urban Uganda is predicted by area of residence in life, particularly at birth, with highest risk among those whose life is spent in small towns and city. This increases in presence of other risk factors such as parental history of disease, children atopy, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity.

**Title:** Interactions between three pigment cell types are required to form the pattern of adult zebraf (Danio rerio), but their molecular nature is poorly understood. Mutations in leopard (leo), encoding connexin 41.8 (C41.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A dominant allele, leot3, leads to complete loss of pattern, suggesting dominant impact on another component of gap junctions.

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between three pigment cell types in adult zebraf (Danio) and how do mutations in connexin 41.8 (C41.8) affect pattern formation?

**Methods:** We conducted a genetic screen to identify the component of gap junction required for pattern formation in zraf and found connex 39.4 (C39.4). Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that C39.4 is required for stripe formation in zraf, but fins are not affected. Double mutants and chimeras show that leo and C39 are required in xanthores and melanores but not iridores, suggesting both connins form heteromeric gap junctions.

**Findings:** The phenotypes indicate that promote homotyp interactions between melanores and xanthores, respectively, and instruct patterning of iridores. Homozygous for leot3 (D) or trans-hetergous for leot3 le1 show identical phenotype of completely dissolved pattern. Individual melanores cluster together are still present, mostly associated with iridores (D and E). Mutations in connex 41.8 are highlighted in red.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that C41.8 and C.39 interact to form heterom gap junctions and these channels are responsible for some interactions among chromatoph while pattern is established. The homozyg le3 phenotype is stronger, indicating mutant C41.8 protein in le3 has dominant effect on further component involved in pattern formation, possibly another connin involved in heterom gap junction with C.41.8, notion previously suggested by analysis leq270 (Watan et al., 2006).

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions between pigment cell types in adult zraf and the role of connin 41.8 in pattern formation. The interaction between C.41.8 and C.39 form heterom gap junctions, promoting homotyp interactions between melanores and xanthores, and instructing patterning iridores. Mutations in C41.8 lead to loss of pattern, suggesting dominant effect on another component gap junction, possibly another connin involved in heterom junction with C.41.8.

**Title:** Evolution of the Olfactory System in Insects: Unveiling the Origins of Olfactory Receptors and Coreceptors

**Research Question:** How did the olfactory system evolve in insects, and what are the roles of olfactory receptors (OR) and coreceptors (Or) in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the olfactory systems of three insect species: the wingless bristail Lepismilis signata (Archaeognatha), the firebrat Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma), and the neopter leaf insect Phyllium sifium (phasoda). We analyzed the expression of OR and Or in these species using molecular biology techniques.

**Findings:** Our results show that Lepismilis lacks OR and Or, while Thermobia has three Or candidates, and Phium has a fully developed OR/Or-based system. We suggest that OR did not arise as an adaptation to terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Or present before OR.

**Implications:** Our study provides new insights into the evolution of the olfactory system in insects and the role of OR and Or in this process. We propose that Or evolved after the bristail split from its common ancestor with remaining insects, and the olfactory system relying on both OR and Or emerged after the emergence of wings.

**Conclusions:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of the olfactory system in insects and other animals. Insects provide an excellent model to study ancestral characteristics and building blocks of olfaction. Our results suggest that OR and Or are key components of the olfactory system, and that Or evolved after the brail split from common ancestor with remaining insects.

**Title:** Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Asymptomatic Malaria Infections in Villages Undergoing Mass Drug Administration in Myanmar: Evidence for a Herd Effect

**Research Question:** Can mass drug administration (MDA) of antimalarial drugs reduce the burden of asymptomatic infections and clinical episodes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in villages, and does non-adherence to MDA hinder elimination efforts?

**Methods:** We conducted a detailed spatial and temporal analysis of malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in four villages undergoing MDA in Myanmar, using microepidemiological and spatial data from a M trial in Kayin State, Myanmar. We investigated associations between individual and group-level participation in MDA, subclinical infections, and clinical episodes of P. falciparum post-M.

**Findings:** Individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-M compared to those from high-adherence neighborhoods, regardless of individual participation, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito rates, living with someone with malaria, or asymptomatic infection were predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to M, even in villages with high participation, may frustrate elimination efforts.

**Implications:** Our study provides empirical evidence for a herd effect of MDA in reducing asymptomatic and clinical P. falcum malaria, supporting the notion of a herd providing additional population protection. Non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high participation, may hinder elimination efforts. This study contributes to the evidence base for further research, intervention, and policy.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of MDA in reducing asymptomatic and clinical P. falc malaria, and highlights the importance of adherence to M for herd effect. Our findings suggest that non-adherence to M, even in villages with high participation, may frustrate elimination efforts. Further research is needed to understand the impact of non-adherence on M and develop strategies to improve adherence.

**Title:** Conservation of Transcription Factor Binding Specificity in Drosophila and Mammals: Implications for the Emergence of Novel Cell Types

**Research Question:** How do transcription factor (TF) binding specificities contribute to the emergence of novel cell types in Drosila and mammals?

**Methods:** To address this question, we determined the binding specificities of 242 Dophila TFs and compared them to human and mouse data. We used HT-LEX to characterize TF binding specificities in Dophila melanogaster.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed that TF specificities are highly conserved between Dila and mammals, and for ortholog TFs, the similarity extends to the level of subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. We found few TFs with divergent specificities in cell types not found in flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of cells.

**Implications:** The conservation of TF specificity suggests that binding specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift. Subtle binding preferences could change faster and independently of canonical DNA recognition, allowing TF to slowly drift in evolution.

**Conclusions:** This study extends the repertoire of Dila binding specificities by 122 high-resolution motifs and sheds light on features of Dila TF-binding characteristics. TFs belonging to the same family bind similar sites. We show that ortholog TF have identical DNA profiles, flanking sequences, and modes of binding, even though species diverged 600 million years ago. Our results suggest that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel cell types.

**Title:** Simultaneous Induction of Cardiac and Pulmonary Lineages from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells via Temporal Tuning of WNT and Nodal Signaling

**Research Question:** How can human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) be directed to simultaneously differentiate into both cardiac and pulmonary lineages, and what is the role of WNT and Nodal signaling in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a novel strategy to induce mesoderm-derived cardiac and enderm-derived lung epithelial lineages from hiSCs via temporal tuning of WNT and Nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D culture, we established concentric cardio-pulmonary microissues (μTs) and expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of W agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within dual-line μ effectively segregated from each other with initiation of cardiac contraction.

**Findings:** In 3D culture, cardio-p μ effectively segregated into separate cardiac and pulmonary Ts, which was inhibited by W activation. This study delivers an in vitro model for studying the mechanistic interplay between the heart and lung during human embryogenesis. Following withdrawal of W agon, concent cardio-p μ reorganized and segregated into cardiac-only and pulmonary Ts.

**Implications:** Our multiline differentiation model offers an experimentally tractable system for investigating cardio-p interaction and tissue formation during embryogenesis. The cardio-p mutual during organogenesis has been documented in mouse models (Peng et al, 2013; Hoff et al). This work provides a hiP-based model for investigating co-development and segregation during embry.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that simultaneous induction of cardiac and pulmonary lineages from hiSC via temporal tuning of W and Nodal signaling in absence of exogenous factors. This model offers a platform for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cardio-p co-development and tissue formation. Further investigation of morph and functional maturation of cardiac and lineages, as well as their interaction during this process, is required.

**Title:** Unveiling the Flexibility of Mutation Rates in Response to Selective Pressure: Hypermutation in Escherichia coli under Ethanol Stress

**Research Question:** How do organisms adapt to stressful environments, and what drives the evolution of mutation rates in response to selective pressure?

**Methods:** We investigated the dynamics of hypermutation in Escheria coli exposed to high ethanol stress, a model of near-lethal stress. We used a collection of mutators with distinct mutation rates to identify optimal rates for rapid growth under ethanol and experimental evolution to reveal the role of hypermutation in adaptation.

**Findings:** Contrary to the notion that mutation rate is a slowly-evolving parameter, we demonstrate unexpected flexibility in cellular rates response to changes in selective pressure. Hypermutation arose concurrently with increases in ethanol concentrations, but rapidly declined once cells adapted to the stress. We identified cellular mortality as the major driving force behind the evolution of mutation rates.

**Implications:** Our findings shed new light on the dynamics of mutation evolution and explain the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, including emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapses upon chemotherapy. We show that organisms balance robustness and evolvability help maintain high mutation rates in time.

**Conclusion:** While mutation rate is generally considered a slowly-evolving parameter, our study reveals flexibility in cellular rates matching changes in selective to avoid near-lethal stress. Bacteria undergoing antibiotic treatment or cancer cells exposed to chemotherapy are examples of cells exposed to stressful conditions. Hypermutation quickly arose with increases in ethanol, but rates declined once cells adapted. We identified mortality as the major force driving evolution of mutation. Our results explain why maintaining high rates is limited in time.

**Key Findings:**

* Hypermutation arose with increases in ethanol, but declined once cells adapted
* Cellular mortality drives evolution of mutation
* Robustness and evolv help maintain high mutation rates
* Emergence of antibiotic resistance and cancer relapse explained by hypermutation

**Title:** Identification of Arabidopsis Transcription Factor ZIP63 as a Key Regulator of Starvation Response and Direct Target of SnRK Kinase Phosphorylation

**Research Question:** How do plants adapt to changing environmental conditions and balance growth and defense responses to ensure survival?

**Methods:** We investigated the conserved AMP/Sn1/SnRK kinases, well-known metabolic regulators in low-energy response in animals and plants, and their role in transcriptional reprogramming in plants.

**Findings:** We identified Arabidopsis transcription factor ZIP63 as a key regulator of starvation response and direct target of Sn1 kinase phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of ZIP by Sn1 changed its dimer preference, affecting gene expression and primary metabolism. ZIP knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, complemented by wild-type ZIP, but not by version harboring point mutations in identified Sn1 target sites.

**Implications:**

1. ZIP is an important regulator, especially under stress/starvation conditions.
2 ZIP is phosphorylated at Sn1 sites in vivo in a sugar and energy-dependent manner.
3 Sn1 is a major kinase responsible for ZIP phosphorylation, targeting conserved serine residues in N- and C-terminus ZIP.
4 Phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for ZIP's dimer and activity in planta.

**Conclusions:**

1 ZIP is a direct target of Sn1 in transcriptional energy response.
2 ZIP's phosphorylation at Sn sites is important for its function in planta.
 ZIP's dimer activity is regulated by phosphorylation-triggered switch of dimer partners, regulating metabolic reprogramming.

**Key Findings:**

* ZIP is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo in a sugar and energy-dependent manner.
* Sn1 is one of the kinases responsible for ZIP phosphorylation, targeting conserved serine in N and C-terminus ZIP.
* Phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for ZIP's dimer and activity in planta.
* ZIP's dimer activity is regulated by phosphory-trigger switch of dimer partners, regulating metabolic reprogramming.

**Future Directions:**

* Investigate ZIP's role in other stress responses.
* Study ZIP's interaction with other transcription factors.
* Explore ZIP's potential as a target for improving plant stress tolerance.

**Title:** Identification of RNF10 as a Novel Synaptic Messenger for Bidirectional Communication between Synapses and Nuclei: Implications for Long-Term Potentiation and Dendritic Spine Plasticity**

**Research Question:** How do synapses communicate with the nucleus to regulate long-term potentiation and dendritic spine plasticity?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of R10, a novel synaptic protein, in bidirectional communication between synapses and nuclei, and its involvement in long-term potentiation (LTP) and dendritic spine plasticity.

**Findings:** We found that R10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits changes at the transcriptional level. R10 is enriched at excitatory synapses, where it associates with the Glu2 subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Activation of Glu2-containing MDARs and induction of LTP lead to translocation of R10 from dendritic segments and dendrites to the nucleus. Importantly, we provide evidence for import-dependent long-distance transport from syn-to-dendritic compartments to nucleus. R10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as L-dependent modifications of dendritic spines.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that R10 is a novel synaptic messenger responsible for long-lasting reaping of dendritic spines after specific synaptic stimuli and required for postsynaptic modifications to L induction. Impaired R10-mediated synuclear signaling and reduced R10 levels are responsible for dendritic density reduction following R10 silencing. Our findings suggest that the NAR complex is a source of messengers capable of trafficking to nucleus, encoding synaptic and extrasynaptic Gl2 NMD signals to nucleus and docking NAR-derived signalosome to nuclear sites in stimulus-dependent manner.

**Conclusions:** This study describes a novel syn-to-nucle signaling pathway linking synaptic activation of Gl2-containing MDs to gene expression. We demonstrate R10 is expressed in nucleus as well as synapses, part of NAR and directly interacts with cytoplasmic tail of Gl2 subunit of MDs. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of LTP and dendritic plasticity, highlighting R10 as a key player in bidirectional communication between synapses and nuclei.

**Title:** Structural Insights into the Mechanism of Swi/Snf2 ATPases: Crystal Structure of Mot1 Bound to TBP:DNA:NC Complex and Implications for ATP-Dependent Remodeling

**Research Question:** How do Swi/Snf ATPases remodel protein-DNA complexes, and what is the role of Mot1 in this process?

**Methods:** We used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 (MotNT) in complex with TATA-binding protein (TBP), DNA, and transcription regulator cofactor 2 (NC). We also employed electron microscopy and cross-linking to study the full-length Mot complex.

**Findings:** Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC interactions and unbends DNA compared to TBP:DNA:NC, suggesting Mot primes TBP:NC displacement in an ATP-independent manner. The Swi/Snf domain of Mot associates with upstream DNA and histone fold of NC, similar to nucleosome remodelers.

**Implications:** This study provides a structural framework for how Swi/Snf ATPase interacts with substrate protein-DNA complex. Sw/Snfases remodel protein-DNA by disrupting interface between nucleic and protein partners of target complex.

**Conclusions:** Our pseudoatomic view of Sw/Snf enzyme bound to protein-DNA substrate and detailed framework of Mot interaction with TBP:DNA:NC complex provide insights into mechanism of Sw/S ATPases. Association of Mot with TBP:DNA:NC induces conformation changes, priming complex for ATP-dependent disruption. Our study provides first pseudoatomic view of Sw/S ATPase in complex with protein-DNA.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of Cyclic Peptide Natural Products: Identification of Elongation Factor-1 as a Common Target for Cytotoxic Compounds

**Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism of action of the cytotoxic natural product ternatin, a cyclic peptide that inhibits adipogenesis, and how does it interact with its cellular targets?

**Methods:** Inspired by the partially elucidated structure and cytotoxic activity of cyclic peptide A, we designed and synthesized variants of ternatin, which exhibited up to 500-fold greater potency than the natural product. Using a tern-affinity probe, we identified the elongation factor-1 ternary complex (EF1·G·aminoacy-tRNA) as a specific target and demonstrated competitive binding by unrelated products didnin and cyrien. Mutations in domain III of EF1 prevented tern binding and conferred resistance to cytotoxic effects, implicating the hydrophobic surface as a functional spot for EF modulation.

**Findings:** Ternatin and its variants inhibit protein synthesis, with compound 4 showing the greatest potency. We identified the elongation factor-1 ternary complex (EF·G·amino-t) as a direct target of tern-related peptides. Tern inhibit synthesis potencies correlate with ability to block proliferation and photo-tern identified EF1 as a target. Surprisingly, photo-tern cross-linked to purified EF only in the context of ternary with G and amino-tRNA. To our knowledge, specific binding a molecule to EF ternary has not been reported.

**Implications:** This study reveals that elongation factor-1 and its ternary complex with G and amino-tRNA are common targets for cytotoxic natural products. Ternins may be attractive leads for medicinal chemistry due to structural simplicity and accessibility by synthesis. Unexpectedly, structurally unrelated products didnin and cyrien compete for binding to EF ternary complex.

**Conclusions:** We conclude that elongation factor-1 and its ternary complex with G and amino-tRNA are common targets for cytotoxic natural products. Tern and its variants are potent inhibitors of protein synthesis, with compound 4 showing greatest potency. The EF ternary complex is a direct target of tern-related peptides, and mutations in domain III of EF prevent tern binding and confer resistance to cyt effects, implicating the hydrophobic surface as a functional spot for EF modulation.

**Title:** Mutations in Inositol 5-Phosphatase OCRL Cause Lowe Syndrome and Dent's Disease: Unveiling the Role of OCRL in Clath-Mediated Endocytosis

**Research Question:** How do mutations in the inositol 5-phatase OCRL contribute to the pathogenesis of Lowe syndrome and Dent disease, and what is the role of OCRL in clath-mediated endocytosis?

**Methods:** We investigated the impact of OCRL loss on clath-mediated endytosis in Lowe patient fibroblasts using time-lapse microscopy and biochemical assays.

**Findings:** Absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endytic clath coat dynamics and results in endytic defect, leading to accumulation of clath-coated vesicles that fail to lose their coat. We found that SN9, a clath-binding protein associated with late-stage endytic cl-coated pits, directly binds OCRL, indicating that OC acts as an unating factor. Our results suggest that defects in clath-mediated endyt likely contribute to pathology in patients with OC mutations.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel role for OCRL in cl-mediated endytosis, a process required for normal progression of endytosis. The absence of 5-phat activity of OC delays endyt by stalling late-stage pits, impairs unating, and triggers nucleation of comets from clath vesicles that retain PI(4,5)P2 and fail to uncoat.

**Conclusions:** Mutations in the inos 5-phat OCRL cause Lowe syndrome and Dent disease by impairing clath-mediated endyt, leading to accumulation of cl-coated vesicles that fail to lose their coat. OCRL acts as anating factor, facilitating recycling of endytic factors required for normal endyt progression. Our study highlights the importance of clath-mediated endyt in disease pathogenesis and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Lowe syndrome.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel FAK/PYK/GSK3β216/β-caten Regulatory Axis in Colorectal Cancer: Implications for Therapeutic Interventions**

**Background:** Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-caten signaling pathway plays a crucial role in colorectal cancer, but the identification of effective Wnt inhibitors remains a significant challenge. Understanding the regulation of this pathway could reveal new therapeutic points of intervention.

**Research Question:** Does the FAK/PYK/GSKβ216/β-caten axis contribute to the activation of W/βaten signaling in APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of FAK and PY2 in adenomas APC/+ mice and human colorectal tissues using biochemical and pharmacological approaches.

**Findings:** FAK and PY2 were elevated in adenomas APC/+ mice and human colorectal tissues, redundantly promoting W/βaten pathway by phosphorylating G3β216 to reinforce β-caten accumulation and tumorigenesis. Phosphorylation of G3β216 was a determinant of G3 recruitment to βCP. Pharmacological inhibition of F/P2 suppressed adenoma formation APC/+ mice with reduced phospho-G3β216 and βaten levels.

**Implications:** The F/P2/G3β216 axis is critical for activation of W/aten signaling in APC-driven intestinal tumenesis.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel F/P2/G3β216/aten regulatory circuit in tumenesis. Our findings indicate that loss of APC induces F and PY2, F phosphorylates Gβ216 to stabilize βaten, initiating and supporting tumenesis. Phosphorylation of Gβ216 was discovered decades ago, but mechanisms unclear. We show that F is involved in APC-driven tumenesis through catalytic activity using the anti-tumogenic effects of dual F2 inhibitor PF562 in APC/+ mice, a model predisposed to adenoma formation due to aberrant W/aten signaling.

**Title:** Vestibular Control of Balance Transitions: Disengagement of Motor Policies during Motor State Transitions

**Research Question:** Do humans disengage vestibular stabilizing mechanisms before transitioning between motor states, as predicted by optimal feedback theory?

**Methods:** We investigated the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between standing postures in healthy subjects. Participants initiated and terminated locomotion while exposed to vestibular stimuli (EV) and the relationship between EV and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses.

**Findings:** Discontinuities corresponding to coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement and during locomotion termination, indicating humans interrupt vestibular balance mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change in motor control, as predicted by optimal theory.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that humans disengage vestibular stabilizing mechanisms before transitioning between motor states, indicating a general process that occurs between standing and other motor states. The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses is related to different sensory gains needed for whole-body movements by quiet and locomotor control policies.

**Conclusions:** Our findings support the optimal theory that transitions require disengagement of motor control before implementation. The vestibular system encodes head motion in space and is vital for maintaining stability during standing and locomotion. Vestib signals influence activation of muscles in posture control. Prior to transitions, vestibular influence on whole-body responses is suspended. The suspension of vestibular-evoked responses at movement starts while subjects maintain upright, before transition. The suppression of vestibular stabilizing is not specific to one type, suggesting a general process. Our results show humans stop balancing before moving and moving before balancing again.

**Title:** Circadian Regulation of Carbon Metabolism in Cyanobacteria: The Role of the Transcription Factor RPA in Anticipating Periodic Energy Limitations

**Research Question:** How does the transcription factor RPA regulate circadian oscillations in cyanobacteria, driving genome-wide mRNA abundance, and what are the implications of its deletion on cell viability in constant and cycling light/dark conditions?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the transcription factor RPA in regulating circadian oscillations in cyanobacteria by analyzing the effects of its deletion on cell viability in constant and cycling light/dark conditions. We examined the mechanisms underlying viability defects and demonstrated that the RPA- strain cannot maintain energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes for carbohydrate utilization at night.

**Findings:** Our results show that deletion of RPA has no effect on viability in constant light conditions but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark alternate. We found that accumulation and utilization of carbon reserves for energy during periods of darkness are defective in RPA strain, and correction of these defects restores viability. Our results provide insight into the role of circadian pathway in enhancing fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central metabolism with metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in environment.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that circadian output mediated by RPA is required for anticipatory accumulation of carbon during day as well as metabolic switching to catabolism at dusk. These adaptations allow cells to stimulate energy and sustain viability during periods of darkness that constrain resources for cyanobacterial growth. Our data support a model in which anticipation of periodic-induced limitation is an essential role of cyanobacterial circadian system. The output of oscillator, through regulation of RPA, temporally coordinates metabolism to prepare cells for metabolic demands of periods.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of circadian regulation in cyanobacterial metabolism, particularly in anticipation of periodic energy limitations. The transcription factor RPA, regulated by circadian clock, is critical for coordination of anabolism and catabolism and cell viability in light/dark cycles. Deletion of RPA prevents glycogen accumulation in light and renders cells unable to utilize glycogen at dusk, leading to alterations in cellular energy and previously observed reduction in fitness. Our results demonstrate the essential role of circadian system in enhancing cyanobacterial fitness through coordination of central metabolism with external demands.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism and Diversity of Heavy-Metal Transport in P-4-ATPases: Structural and Functional Insights into the Archetypal P-4-ATPase CoT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS-1

**Research Question:** Despite their crucial role in heavy-metal homeostasis and detoxification, the structural and functional properties of P-4-ATPases, the subclass with the broadest cargo scope, remain elusive. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transport in P-4-ATPases through structural and functional analysis of the archetyp P-4-ATase CoT from Sulfitacter sp. NAS-1.

**Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays to determine the structure and function of CoT, a member of the P-4-ATP family, and assessed its ATPase activity in vitro in the presence of various heavy metals using the Baginski assay.

**Findings:** The structure of CoT revealed an eight-helix domain configuration, devoid of classical heavy-metal binding domains (HMDs), and provided novel insights into the mechanism of heavy-metal transport. Notably, Co exhibited a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal ion counter of histidine. Moreover, the turnover of P-ATP was independent of potassium, contrasting many other P-type ATPases.

**Implications:** These findings open avenues for drug discovery, as P-ATases function as virulence factors in many pathogens. The structure and function of Co shed light on the topology of P-4-ATPases, highlighting the absence of HMDs in some members, and providing a framework for understanding the diversity of heavy-metal transport.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first structural and functional insights into P-4-ATases, a crucial for heavy-metal homeostasis and detoxification, and reveals novel features of heavy-metal transport. The results have implications for drug discovery and manipulation of heavy-metal accumulation in plants to prevent or enrich.

**Title:** Elucidating Mitotically Stable Allelic Expression (MAE) in Mammalian Genes through a Novel Chromatin Signature Approach

**Research Question:** Despite the prevalence of mitotically stable allelic expression (MA) in mammals, including genes critical to human diseases, little is known about its regulation due to the clonal nature of MA. This study aimed to develop an approach to distinguish MA genes in human cells with high accuracy.

**Methods:** We identified a chromatin signature consisting of chromatin marks associated with active (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3me3) simultaneously in the gene body, present in ∼20% of ubiquitously expressed and 30% tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among developmental genes with bivalent chromatin in pluripotent cells.

**Findings:** Applying this approach to various cell types, we estimate up to 20% ubiquously expressed and more than one-third tissue-specific genes showed chromatin of MA. Detection of MA signature does not rely on SNPs or clonality, making it feasible for analysis in primary samples, including comparisons normal and diseased tissue.

**Implications:** Our results lead to two conclusions: (a) among expressed genes, about 20 have chromatin characteristic MA in at least one tissue; (b) genes with tissue-specific as group, we estimate 39-48 have MA pattern. Genes with MA chromatin share features as group. Importantly, MA in clones is reflected by chrom in polycl sample. To test chromatin as predictor of MA state, we identified genes with MA pattern and assessed allelic in monoclonal lines. Calculated gene-body for H3me and H36 for autosomal Ref genes on ENCODEIP data GM78 lymphoblast cells.

**Conclusions:** Surprisingly, a large fraction of bivalent genes (>80) acquire MA chromatin in least differentiated types, higher compared to genes silent in ES. Observations indicate upon activation, master genes preferentially resolve into state with characteristic MA chromatin. Our findings open new approach to study MA independent polymorphisms and suggest MA linked cell differentiation.

**Title:** Unveiling the Regulatory Mechanism of AAA+ Chaper Clp: Coiled-Coil Mediated Inhibition and Activation

**Research Question:** How do coiled-coil domains regulate the activity of the AAA+ chaper Clp, a central to bacterial virulence and stress resistance, and what are the implications of this regulatory mechanism?

**Methods:** We employed cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and biochemical assays to investigate the structure and function of Clp, a AAA chaper widely distributed among Gram-positive bacteria, and its interaction with the adaptor protein MecA.

**Findings:** We discovered that coiled-coil middle domains (MDs) of Clp control its activity by sequestering Clp in an inactive state, forming a large helical assembly via head-to-head contacts. MecA converts this resting state to an active planar structure by binding to MD sites, relieving repression. Loss of Clp repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal an unexpected regulatory concept by coiled-coil MDs controlling AAA+ chaper activity, extending their role as regulatory devices controlling AAA protein activity. This mechanism is distinct from other AAA chaper systems, such as ClB/Hsp, where coiled domains repress ATPase activity by forming a belt around the ring.

**Conclusions:** Coiled-coil domains of Clp regulate its activity by sequestering it in an inactive state, restricting substrate and adaptor binding, and ATP hydrolysis. Mutating a key MD residue causes cellular toxicity, suggesting this mechanism is operational in other AAA chaper systems, such as ClE and ClL, making them targets for antimicrobials.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Stem Cell Quiescence and Reactivation: Insights from Drosila Muscle Precursors

**Research Question:** How do stem cells maintain their non-differentiated state and how are they reactivated?

**Methods:** We employed a Drosila model to investigate the in vivo behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the fruit fly's transient muscle stem cells.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that AMPs send out filopodia that contact neighboring muscles, maintaining association throughout their dormant state and proliferative phases, suggesting muscles play a role in AMP reactivation. Genetic analyses indicate muscles secrete inductive Dll6 signals activating the Insulin pathway in AMPs, leading to Notch activation, which regulates AMP proliferation via dyc.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that Dila AMP display homing behavior to muscle, and the niche-driven Insulin-Not-dyc cascade plays a key role in AMP reactivation. This is supported by previous research (2010). Our data reveal new features of Dila muscle stem cells, particularly direct contact with muscles, behaving as AMP niche. Muscles source local inductive Ins signals reactivating AMP, via canonical Notch and target dyc, inducing proliferation in larval stages.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides insights into the functional link between Insulin, Not, and dyc in AMP behavior. Analyzing activity in reactivated AMPs, we show dyc acts as a positive regulator of AMP reactivation, indicating proliferation is regulated by the same genes in Dila and vertebrates. To understand the link between Ins, Not, and dyc, we analyzed their activity in AMP. We previously characterized Dila stem cells, adult precursors (AMP) emerging mid-embryogenesis, expressing muscle-specific markers such as bHL transcription factor Twist (Fac et al., 2007,201). AMPs lie dormant embryonic and larval life, activated proliferating to provide myoblasts ensuring adult growth and regeneration subset thoracic muscles (200; Liao et al.,200; Ishikawa et al.,201). Myc promotes myoblast proliferation development and regeneration (Li et.,201). We tested dyc involvement in AMP reactivation Dila. Our data show dyc required AMP reactivation and proliferation. Genetic experiments show Not acts downstream Ins pathway andyc downstream Notch.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Tonic Firing in Substantia Nigra Pars Retic (SN) Neurons: A Role of the Sodium Leak Channel NAL

**Research Question:** What is the molecular basis of the depolarizing leak current that supports tonic firing in substantia nigra pars reticula (SN) neurons, a major output of the basal ganglia, and how does disruption of this mechanism contribute to basal ganglia circuit dysfunction?

**Methods:** We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual SN neurons and identified the sodium channel NAL as the highest expressed non-selective cation channel (NSC) in SN neurons. We further investigated the role of NAL in modulating excitability by glycolysis and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation.

**Findings:** SN neurons lacking NAL exhibit impaired spontaneous firing, suggesting NAL is crucial for tonic activity. Moreover, NAL is involved in modulation of excitability by glycol and activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Disruption of NAL may underlie severe motor deficits in humans carrying NAL mutations.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that disruption of NAL could impair basal gang circuit, contributing to motor disorders such as dystonia and Parkinson's disease.

**Conclusions:** We identified the sodium channel NAL as the molecular basis of depolarizing current in SN neurons, which is essential for tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. Disruption of NAL may contribute to basal gang circuit dysfunction, highlighting its potential therapeutic target for motor disorders.

**Title:** Unlocking the Potential of Uncultivated Microbial Diversity: A Novel Droplet-Based Microfluidic System for High-Throughput Antimicrobial Screening and Cultivation

**Research Question:** Can a droplet-based microfluidic system coupled with high-throughput antimicrobial screening enhance the discovery of novel antimicrobial compounds from uncultivated microorganisms?

**Methods:** We developed a modular droplet microfluidic platform for high-throughput cultivation and antimicrobial screening of uncultivated microorganisms. The system consisted of miniaturized droplets (200pL) containing single cells, allowing for long-term cultivation of 2 million compartmentalized cells in 1.5mL. Reporter strains were added to droplets to screen for antimicrobial activity.

**Findings:** Parallelized droplet cultivation from single cells resulted in higher bacterial diversity than standard agar plate cultivation. Strains inhibiting reporter strains were isolated from the system, and a variety of antimicrobial compounds were detected from selected producers. We verified our strategy by culturing a complex soil-derived community on a substrate and comparing to agar plate cultivation. One isolate showed antimicrobial activity in dro screening, and secreted metabolites were identified.

**Implications:** The droplet microfluid system provides genotype-phenotype linkage for secreted products, confining compounds to originating cells. Droplets can be stored and incubated under controlled conditions. High-throughput screening using reporter strains in droplets (Mahler et al., 2018) streamlines efforts towards new antibiotic development.

**Conclusions:** We devised an innovative microscale strategy utilizing modular dro-microfluid platform mimicking environmental conditions. The combination of strain discovery in-dro cultivation with selection of candidates for product through robust assay streamlines efforts towards new structures. Even axenic cultures of new species could not be maintained after standard isolation, but were used for high-quality genome information.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Leukotriene A Hydrolase (LTAH) Genotype in Tuberculous Meningitis Mortality and Response to Adjunctive Corticosteroids

**Research Question:** Does the leukotri A hydrolase (LH) genotype influence mortality in tuberculous meningitis and response to adjunctive corticosteroids, and can personalized glucocortic therapy be targeted to patients with specific genotypes?

**Methods:** This study analyzed two cohorts of patients with tuberculous meningitis, one from Vietnam and Indonesia, to investigate the association between leukotri A hyrolase (L) genotype and response to adjunctive corticosteroids. Patients were genotyped for the C/T variant in the L gene encoding leukot A hyrolase, an enzyme regulating inflammatory eicosanoids.

**Findings:** Adjunct corticoster reduced mortality by 30% in both cohorts, but the benefit was most pronounced in Vietnam patients with the L genotype. Patients with increased expression had increased survival, consistent with corticoids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, the Indonesia study did not find an L genotype benefit. Using Bayesian analysis, we found that L genotype confers survival that begins early and continues long-term in both populations, but is nullified in severe cases.

**Implications:** These findings support the model that mortality from TBM is due to distinct inflammatory states, and L genotype might be a determinant of inflammation and response to adjunctive treatment. If true, personalized glucoc therapy would be warranted, given only to TT patients. A previously unrecognized form of dysregulated inflammation might be caused by genetic variants in Indonesia, working through an inflammatory pathway less responsive to dexamethas.

**Conclusions:** The L effect of dexam on the TT group may not have time to play in Grade Indonesia due to severe disease presentation. Alternatively, Grade patients presented dysregulated in a manner not revealed by standard metrics, making cortoids no longer beneficial. Noting Indonesia presented more disease and died, we postulated that beneficial effects dexam for TT were nullified in severe. The concept of disease being too severe for outcomes to be influenced by intervention has precedent.

**Title:** Mechanistic Insight into Netrin-Induced Axon Guidance: Shoot1 Phosphorylation as a Critical Readout for Mechanoresponse

**Research Question:** How do growth cones navigate and decide their migratory direction by transducing local cues into protrusive forces?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Shoot1 in axonal projection in response to guidance cues, specifically focusing on its interaction with the axon molecule Netrin-1. We generated knockout mice lacking Shoot1 and observed abnormal projection of forebrain commiss axons, a phenotype similar to that of Netrin-1 knockout mice.

**Findings:** Netrin-1 elicited highly polarized Pak-mediated phosphorylation of Shoot1 within growth cones, which increased interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L-CAM. This, in turn, promoted F-act-adhesion coupling and concurrent generation of forces for growth cone migration. Spatially regulated Shoot1 phosphorylation within cones was required for ax turning induced by Netrin-1 gradients.

**Implications:** Our study defines a mechano-effector for Netrin signaling and demonstrates that Shoot1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for Netrin gradients resulting in a directional mechresponse axon guidance.

**Conclusions:** Our data show that Shoot1, through spatially regulated phosphorylation within growth, mediates the reading and mechresponse of Netrin-induced axon guidance. Shoot1 is expressed at high levels in developing brain commiss axons, and Shoot knockout mice display abnormal guidance of these axons, a phenotype similar to Netrin knockout. Notably, small differences in Netrin concentration elicited highly directional phosphorylation of Shoot within cones. Netrin-elicited Shoot phosphorylation promoted interaction between Shoot and L-C, generating traction for growth motility. Disturbance of spatial regulated Shoot phosphorylation within cones inhibited ax turning, but not outgrowth induced by Netrin gradients. Uncoupling F-act-adhesion by Shoot(1 inhibited Netrin-induced outgrowth and on lamin. These data indicate Netrin-induced guidance, mediated by Shoot-L-C interaction, is not limited growth on L-C. We analyzed the role of polarized phosphorylation within cones elicited by Netrin gradients.

**Title:** Elucidating the Biophysical Origin of Humming in Hummingbirds: Unveiling the Role of Oscillating Aerodynamic Forces

**Research Question:** How do the flapping wings of hovering hummingbirds generate unsteady aerodynamic forces and their characteristic humming signature?

**Methods:** We investigated six freely hovering Anna's hummingbirds using a 217 microphone array for near-field holography and a new aerodynamic platform to measure 3D aerodynamic forces in vivo. We developed an idealized acoustic model integrating aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics to predict the timbre of the hummingbird's hum.

**Findings:** Our results show that the humming's timbre arises from oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. Comparing birds and insects, we found that the characteristic timbre and radiated power of flapping wings originate from higher harmonics in aerodynamic forces supporting body weight. Our analysis across insects and birds reveals allometric deviations make larger birds quieter, elongated flies louder, clarifying bioacoustic behavior.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate the crucial role of oscillating aerodynamic forces in generating humming. The idealized model assumes rigid wings, neglecting auxiliary effects like wing flutter, feather, and vortex dynamics. Near-field measurements corroborate the predictive power of our model. Numerical simulations of the Fow Williams-Hawk aeroacoustic equation show far-field hum of flapping wings driven by aerodynamic fluctuation.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the biophysical origin of humming in hummingbirds, highlighting the importance of oscillating aerodynamic forces. Our findings have implications for understanding complex bioacoustic behavior in birds and insects. Future research should investigate effects of wing flexibility, feather, and vortex dynamics on humming.

**Title:** Unraveling the Roles of Chance, Contingency, and Necessity in Evolution: A Systematic Analysis of BCL-2 Family Protein Evolution

**Research Question:** How do chance, contingency, and necessity contribute to the evolution of protein-protein interaction specificities in the BCL-2 family over historical timescales?

**Methods:** We employed ancestral protein reconstruction and continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins in the B-lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family, replicating evolutionary trajectories from ancestral proteins to assess the impact of chance and contingency on sequence variation.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that contingency over long timescales erases necessity and chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation, with trajectories from phylogenetically distant proteins yielding no common mutations under identical pressures. Chance arises from multiple mutations at any point, while contingency arises from historical substitutions of these sets.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that present-day B-2 family proteins, and potentially others, are idiosyncratic products of unpredictable historical events, reflecting accumulated chance and necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and selection.

**Conclusions:** This study resolves the unresolved roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in evolution by demonstrating contingency's profound impact on B-2 family sequence evolution under selection for new functions. Our results indicate that contingency generated sequence change over phylogen times plays a significant role in B-2 protein evolution, even under identical pressures. We also found that additional biological dimensions of B- function imposed selective constraints on evolution, reducing functionally equivalent genotypes available to chance.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Contingency plays a significant role in B-2 sequence evolution over phylogen times, erasing necessity and chance as primary cause of sequence variation
* Trajectories from phylogen distant proteins yield no common mutations under identical pressures
Chance arises from multiple mutations at any point, contingency from historical substitutions of sets
Present-day B- proteins are idiosyncatic products of unpredictable historical events, reflecting accumulated chance and necessity
Additional biological dimensions of B function impose selective constraints on evolution, reducing functionally equivalent genotypes available to chance

**Future Directions:**

* Investigate contingency's role in other protein families
* Explore additional biological dimensions of B function and their impact on evolution
* Assess contingency's impact on protein evolution under different pressures

**Title:** Unraveling the Genetic Tapestry of Sub-Saharan Africa: A Genome-Wide Haplotype Analysis Reveals Ancestry Connections and Admixture Patterns

**Research Question:** Can genome-wide haplotype analysis elucidate the structure of genetic diversity and gene flow in sub-Saharan African populations, and identify historical connections between groups due to admixture?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide haplotype analysis on a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups to characterize genetic diversity and gene flow. Our results show that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 700 years, while Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo groups share ancestry with Central Africans as a result of recent expansions. Furthermore, most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups outside their current region due to gene flow within the last 400 years.

**Findings:** Our in-depth analysis reveals haplotype sharing across ethno-linguistic groups and movement of alleles into new environments, relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology. We provide a quantitative measure of costry between groups and identify dominant events shaping current diversity in sub-Saharan Africa.

**Implications:** This study provides insight into the movement of Eurasian ancestry into the continent as a result of admixture over various timescales, consistent with previous studies (Pagani et al., 2012; Pickrell et al., 2014; Gurdani et al., 2014; Hodgson et al.,2014; Llo et al.,2015). Our sample of 18 ethnic groups from eight countries, the Genome Variation Project (Gurdani et al.,2014; Li et al.,201), describes the influence of Eurasian and hunter-gather ancestry on sub-Saharan population history and movement of alleles and haplotype into the continent. However, questions remain the extent and timing of key events and impact on contemporary populations.

**Conclusions:** Our analysis reveals broad geographic patterns and finer scales, differentiates closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry (Tk et al.,2009 Bry et.,2010 Hodgson et.,2014). We describe patterns by measuring gene flow between populations and relate to historical movements into sub-Saharan. Adm occurs when ancestral groups mix, increasingly common feature human populations (Patterson et.,201; Hell et.,201; Bus.,201). Genome analyses refine models continent history and impact diversity.

**Research Question:** How does the mitotic spindle adapt to changing cell size during early development in Xenopus lae embryogenesis?

**Methods:** We established an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts from Xenopus embryos to recapitulate spindle size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37µm) and stage 8 (∼400 cells, 18µ). We identified kines-13/kifA as a driver of spindle scaling whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by transportin α and activated in stage 8 when import α partitions to membrane.

**Findings:** Kines-13/kA's microtub-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by transportin α and activated in stage 8 when import α partitions to membrane. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase but chromosome segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle in Xenopus is coupled to cell size through a rati mechanism controlling microtub destabilization.

**Implications:** This study elucidates a mechanism that coordinates spindle size with cell during X. lavis development through differential activation of kines-13/kA. We identified a physiological effector that operates to scale the spindle during embryogenesis. Modifying spindle size without perturbing spindle function allowed us to uncover an important role for spindle in maintaining orientation in large cells of Xenopus. This suggests that physical changes in cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical redistribution of activities.

**Conclusions:** This mechanism is consistent with gradual change from meiotic to mitotic morphology observed in early development and suggests that physical changes in embryonic size impact biochemical reactions that alter spindle architecture (Couris et al., 2012). In extracts, import α phosphorylation is thought to liberate from membrane into cytoplasm, promoting activity (Hach et al., 2004). Correcting nonspecific binding, we found kA could retrieve ∼10 more import α from stage 3 extracts than stage 8. This suggests sufficient import α partitioning to alter interaction kA (Figure 6, D). Identification of mechanism enabled us to test significance during development.

**Title:** Discovery of Tandem Guanine-Phosphoribospyrophosphate (PR) Riboswitches: A Novel Two-Input Boolean Logic Gate for Transcriptional Regulation in Bacteria

**Research Question:** How do riboswitches, a type of RNA-based regulatory systems, control gene expression in response to multiple signals, and what are the implications for the evolution of complex metabolic regulation in ancient RNA-based organisms?

**Methods:** We identified and characterized ribos aptamers for phosphoribos pyrophosphate (PR) that exist in singlet or tandem arrangements with guanine apters, capable of binding ligands independently or in combination, approximating an IMPLY Boolean logic gate to regulate transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis in bacteria.

**Findings:** We report the discovery of guanine-PR ribwitches, a novel two-input logic gate system, where tandem apters interact to stabilize or destabilize terminator and antitermin stems depending on guanine and PR concentrations. This is the first example of two apters with different lig specificities sharing the same platform, enabling a new logic function. Our results demonstrate complex sensing and regulatory functions, reflecting metabolite monitoring and regulation in ancient RNA organisms.

**Implications:** This discovery supports the hypothesis that RNA organisms managed complex metabolic states without protein factors, and suggests additional two-input logic gates may exist in modern cells. If PR was used by RNA organisms to generate biopolymer building blocks, apters that bound biosynthetic precursors might persist as ribos in modern cells. Our findings demonstrate complex devices can be formed purely from RNA.

**Conclusions:** The discovery of guanine-PR ribwitch expands our understanding of RNA-based regulatory systems and highlights the potential for complex logic in ancient RNA organisms. This study contributes to the understanding of RNA's role in metabolic regulation and evolution, with implications for the origins of life on Earth.

**Title:** Regulation of Synaptic Transmission Reliability by the Size of the Readily-Releaseable Pool of Vesicles**

**Research Question:** What determines the variability in the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential, which dictates the reliability of synaptic transmission and diversity across brain regions?

**Methods:** Using mouse brain slices, we investigated the regulation of the number of vesicles released by the size of the readily-releasable pool, upstream of vesicle probability.

**Findings:** Our results point to a model wherein protein kinase A and its ves-associated, synapsin, dynamically control release occupancy to dictate the number of ves released without altering probability. We demonstrate that the number of ves released is regulated by the size of the readily-releable pool, not vesicle probability.

**Implications:** These findings define molecular mechanisms that control multivesicular release and functional diversity of synaptic signaling.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals that the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles, controlled by protein kinase A and synapsin, dictates the number of ves released without altering probability. This challenges the prevailing view that ves release probability is the sole determinant of multives release, and highlights the importance of the readily releable pool as a fundamental parameter of synaptic function.

**Title:** Selective Packaging of HIV-1 Genome by HIV-1 Gag: A Mechanistic Insights into the Role of Self-Assembly and Membrane Interactions

**Research Question:** How does HIV-1 G selectively package its genome in the presence of excess cytosolic RNAs, and what is the role of self-assembly and membrane interactions in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 G, and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5' untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess RNA. Mutations in the CACT domain of G, which affect self-assembly, abrogated selectivity.

**Findings:** Mutations in the CACT domain of G, which affect self-assembly, abrogated selectivity. tRNA suppresses G membrane binding when G has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 G to selectively package its genome and self-assembly on membranes are interdependent.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a model for HIV-1 genome selection where the NC of G is necessary but not sufficient for selective packaging of the HIV-1 RNA.

**Conclusions:** Our results underscore the importance of membrane-localized G assembly in HIV-1 genome selection and packaging. We reconstituted the selective packaging of HIV-1 in a minimal system using GUVs, recomant myristoylated HIV-1 G and purified RN. Lattice contacts conferring G ability to multize on membrane are crucial for selective of viral RNA. The 5'UT is recruited membranes by multized G without changes its secondary structure. The association G with RNA serves to inhibit assembly.
