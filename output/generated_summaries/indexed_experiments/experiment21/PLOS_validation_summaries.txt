**Title:** Deciphering the Role of 3' End Regulatory Elements in Gene Expression Variation: A Genomic Survey of Lymphoblast Cells Reveals Polyadenylation and 3' Motifs as Predictors of Gene Expression

**Research Question:** How do DNA variants impact gene expression, and what is the role of 3' end regulatory elements in this process?

**Methods:** We conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblast cells from genetically distinct human individuals, mapping the cis-regulatory architecture of 3 gene ends and analyzing the relationship between polyadenylation signals, 3 motifs, and gene expression levels.

**Findings:** Transcript positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions, but preferentially flanked locations of 3 regulatory elements, including miRNA sites. Usage of transcript forms and motifs varied across individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation and 3 motifs were significant predictors of expression of genes. Single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyaden variants on steady-state expression and validated regulatory function of 3 cis-elements.

**Implications:** Our results underscore the importance of mechanisms at play in genetics of 3-end variation: usage of distinct 3- processing signals and effects of 3 elements determine transcript fate. Integrating 3-end positions with 3 motifs will be a critical tool in interpreting human variation.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the relevance of 3 regulatory as predictors of variation across individuals, when integrated with knowledge of transcript forms. We speculate many variants biologically effects by RNA 3-end remain to be discovered in human. Polymorphisms in 3 motifs govern transcript fate can predict steady levels of genes. This work investigates mechanisms of polyaden impacts expression and variation across individuals, using 3-end RNA-seq to maximize genomic coverage and measure expression levels. We hypothesized variation in RNA 3-end would underlie changes in gene levels, testing the relationship between single-nucleotide polymorphisms polyaden signals and expression across lymphlast cell lines. Our study establishes variation 3 can be a determinant of regulatory, but the majority of genes' importance remains unknown.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Protection Induced by the Live Attenuated Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (LASIV) Vaccine SIVΔf: A Comprehensive Analysis of CD8 T Cell Response and Epitope Escape**

**Research Question:** What are the underlying mechanisms of the remarkable protective efficacy of the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (LASIV) vaccine SIVΔf against wild-type lentiviral challenge, and how does epitope escape influence the evolution of the CD T cell response in SIVf-vaccinated animals?

**Methods:** We employed deep sequencing technology and CD8 cell epitope mapping to dissect the CD T cell response, identify regions of immune pressure and viral escape, and delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD T response in SIVf-vaccinated animals.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the initial CD T response in the acute phase of SIVf infection is predominantly mounted against variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape. Furthermore, we show that epit escape expands the CD T repertoire targeting conserved epitopes, defined anropic specificity, and generates de novo responses to escaped variants during vaccination. These findings correlate SIVf-induced protection with anropic specificity and increased response depth.

**Implications:** These results render SIVf, the gold standard in HIV/SIV research, a proof-of-concept vaccine, highlighting the significance of anropic specificity and repertoire in successful vaccine design.

**Key Findings:**

* Rapid escape of variable epitopes during acute SIV infection and maintenance of CD T responses for conserved epitopes in chronic infection
* De novo CD T responses against novel epit and escape variants during chronic infection
* Escaped S-specific T responses maintained as central memory T cells, contributing to increased breadth of T response at 20 post-vacc with Sf
* Epitope escape and de novo T responses to variants constitute deepening of T repertoire

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates concom evolution of virus and specificity of T response, resulting in T repertoire with anropic, wider, cumulative, rearranged immunodominance, and enhanced. These findings underscore the importance of anropic specificity and repertoire in vaccine design.

**Title:** Interleukin-1 Receptor Signaling Regulates Neutrophil Response and Prevents Fungal Dissemination in Murine Oropharyngeal Candidias

**Research Question:** How does interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling contribute to the host defense against Candida albicans infections in the oral mucosa?

**Methods:** We used a mouse model of orophngeal candidias (OPC) to investigate the role of IL-1R in the neutrophil response against C. albicans.

**Findings:** We found that IL-1R is critical for controlling the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels: (1) recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and (2) mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. IL-1-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in circulation in response to C. alb. Strikingly, endothelial cells were identified as the primary source of G-CS during OPC, responding to IL-α released from keratinocytes in infected tissue.

**Implications:** Our data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoies in the context of fungal infection. We identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating neutil response in the oral mucosa, critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination and protecting the host from disease.

**Conclusions:** IL-R signaling regulates neutil response against C. alb in two ways: (1) regulating production of neutil-chemactic factors by epithelial cells for recruitment of neutils from circulating pool to site and (2) mobilization of newly generated neutils from bone marrow. IL-1-deficient mice unable to control fungus and displayed increased fungal load in tongue day 3 post-infection. Our findings are consistent with previous reports of IL-1 signaling in antifungal defense in different settings, including systemic candidias, oral and invasive aspergilis.

**Title:** Quantifying the Economic Benefits of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPE): A Cost-Benefit Analysis of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) in 2000-2007

**Research Question:** What are the economic benefits of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphaticariasis (GPE) in terms of averting clinical manifestations, direct costs, indirect costs of labor, and healthcare system costs for individuals affected by lymphatic filariasis (LF)?

**Methods:** A cost-benefit analysis was conducted using multiple data sources, including published literature from the World Health Organization, International Fund, and Labour Organization to estimate the economic benefits of the GPE. The number of clinical manifestations averted was quantified and associated with disease prevention analyzed in the context of direct costs, indirect costs of labor, and healthcare for affected individuals.

**Findings:** The GPE delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via mass administration of anti-filar drugs (albendazole, iverectin, diethylbamazine) to at-risk for 4-6 years. An estimated $21.8 billion of economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million treated individuals during the first 8 years of GPE. This includes $2.3 billion from protection of nearly 3 million newborns and individuals from acquiring LF as a result of being born in areas of transmission. Additionally, 28 million already infected with LF benefit from G's halting progression, resulting in a lifetime benefit of $19.5 billion.

**Implications:** The GPE offers significant economic benefits, with favorable implementation largely due to sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry. The economic rate of return of GPE is extremely high, making it an excellent investment in global health.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a better understanding of the G's overall impact on society's most debilitating tropical disease. The economic assessment has not included the value of ancillary benefits on concurrent infections treated by anti-L drug regimens, but leads to a better understanding of G's true impact.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) Mutations in Gaucher Disease and Parkinson's Disease: A Novel Insights from a GBA- Medaka Model

**Research Question:** How do glucocerebrosase (GBA) mutations contribute to the development of Gaucher disease (GD) and Parkinson's disease (PD)?

**Methods:** We generated GBA mutant mice (G-aka) deficient in glucocerebrosidase (Case) activity to investigate the pathological mechanisms underlying GD and PD.

**Findings:** Contrary to perinatal death in humans and mice lacking Case activity, G-aka survived for months, enabling analysis of pathological progression. Gaka displayed neuronopathic phenotypes, including Ga cell infiltration, neuronal loss, and gliosis. Detailed findings revealed lysosomal abnormalities and alpha-syn accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophag. Unexpectedly, disruption of alpha-s did not improve lifespan, axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflamm in Gaka.

**Implications:** Our study reveals Gaka as a novel neuronopathic model, elucidating pathological mechanisms alpha-s accumulation by Case deficiency and minimal contribution alpha-s to pathogenesis neuronopathic GD.

**Conclusion:** Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal disease, is caused by homozyg mutations in glucerebrosase (GB). Mutations lead decreased enzymatic activity glucerebrosidase (Case), resulting in accumulation substrates glucerebro and glucylsphosine. Long-term survival of Gaka allowed observation of pathological progression, revealing Case causes lysosomal dysfunction and alpha-s accumulation in axonal swellings autag. Axonal transport alpha-s may play role in mechanisms GB mutations leading PD and therapeutic target. We demonstrate minimal contribution alpha-s pathogenesis neuronopathic inaka. Patients type GD have increased lifetime risk developing PD, carrying G mutations intraneuronal alpha-s accumulation, Lewy bodies Lew neurites, hallmarks sporadic PD.

**Title:** Listeria monocytogen's Subversion of the Innate Immune Response: A Novel Mechanism of Immune Evasion and Suppression**

**Research Question:** How does Listeria monocytogen, a facultative intracellular pathogen, evade the host immune response and induce long-lived CD8 T-cell mediated immunity, and what is the role of the phagosome in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between Lister monocytogen and the host immune system using two distinct strains of the bacterium: Act-L, which escapes the phagosome and enters the cytosol, and induces long-lived CD8 T-cell immunity, and L-L, which is confined to the phosome and suppresses the adaptive response.

**Findings:** Our results show that the impaired response to L monocogen confined to the phosome is not due to inefficient antigen presentation, but direct suppression of the adaptive response. This suppression affects not only the response to vacuolated L monocogen but also negates the response to bacteria within the cytos. Co-infection with phosome-confined and cytos L monocogen prevented the generation of acquired immunity and expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to cytos L monocogen alone. Bacteria confined to phosome suppressed production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to MyD-dependent production of IL-10. Blockage of IL-10 or absence of MyD during primary restored protective immunity.

**Implications:** Our studies demonstrate that presence of microbes within phosome can directly impact innate and adaptive response by antagonizing signaling pathways for inflammation and generation of CD T cells. The presence of L-L within phosome alters the inflammatory landscape and potency of Lister-specific T response. The impact of cytokines on T potency is complex, dependent on location, context, and concentration. IL-10 acts as a negative regulator of T potency in CD T cells while a positive regulator of cellular immunity via effects on other cell types.

**Conclusions:** The presence of L-L within phosome negatively impacts primary CD and CD T response to cytos Act-L as well as protective immunity. The innate response during infection plays a critical role in shaping the adaptive response. Our findings are significant to microbial pathogenesis and vaccinology, understanding how microbes interact with innate and adaptive system is critical controlling pathogenic effects.

**Title:** Identification of SIX Gene Variants Associated with Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: Implications for Ocular Development and Disease Progression

**Research Question:** What are the genetic variants in the SIX gene associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and how do they impact ocular development and disease progression?

**Methods:** We sequenced the SIX coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls, identifying six nonsynonymous variants, including rare and common AsnHis (rs12345), significantly associated with PO (OR=1.27, p=4.2×10-10) in NEIGH/GLUG datasets. We tested these variants in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation assay, evaluating ocular metrics such as eye size and optic structure. Five variants, primarily in PO cases, were hypomorphic or null, while one, only in controls, was benign. One variant in SIX enhancer increased SIX expression and disrupted regulation.

**Findings:** Our results, in combination with previous SIX work, lead to hypothesize that SIX variants disrupt development, leading to reduced retinal ganglion cells, increasing glcoma vision loss. We identified a clinical feature in PO patients dependent on SIX genotype: those homozygous for SIX risk allele (His) have thinner retinal nerve layer than homozyg for non-risk (As) allele.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest SIX is a candidate gene in POAG, contributing to ocular development and disease progression. Variants in SIX may lead to reduced retinal ganglion, increasing risk of glcoma vision loss. This is the first time a feature in PO patients dependent on SIX genotype has been identified.

**Conclusions:** Our study contributes to understanding POAG, a complex disorder with multiple genetic associations. SIX variants may be a key factor in ocular development and disease progression. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore potential therapeutic applications.

**Title:** Regulation of Flagellar Motility and Toxin Production in Clostridium difficile: Identification of a Flagellar Switch and its Role in Virulence

**Background:** Clostridium difficile, a human intestinal pathogen, utilizes flagella to adhere to epithelial cells and produce glucylating toxins, essential for diarrheal disease development. Flagellar gene expression impacts toxin production, suggesting that factors regulating the flB operon influence both motility and toxin production.

**Research Question:** What is the mechanism of flagellar regulation in Clostrid difficile and its impact on virulence?

**Methods:** We identified a flagellar switch, a 154 bp invertible sequence flanked by 21 bp repeats, upstream of the flB operon containing early flagellar genes. Bacteria with the switch in one orientation (fl ON) expressed flagellum, produced flagella, and secreted toxins, while those with the inverse orientation (OFF) were attenuated for flagellar gene expression, aflagate, and decreased toxin secretion. Orientation is reversible in vitro.

**Findings:** The flag switch regulates flagellar transcription post-initiation, requiring a C. difficile-specific factor to destabilize/degrade early flagellar mRNA when in OFF. Mutagenesis and characterization of flag phase isolates revealed tyrosine recomase RecV, catalyzing inversion at cV switch, also responsible for flagellar inversion in both directions. Phase flagellar motility and toxin production are variable, suggesting both advantageous and detrimental effects during infection.

**Implications:** The flag switch affects transcription of toxin genes via σD, impacting glucyl toxin production and cytotoxicity. Regulation occurs post-initiation. RecV, also controlling cell wall protein cV variation, is responsible for flagellar inversion in both directions.

**Conclusions:** Flagellar ON bacteria and RecV mutants with switch in ON display perich flagella, swim, produce glucyl toxins. Flag OFF and Rec mutants with switch in OFF are attenuated for flagellar genes, aflagate, nonmotile, and toxin production. Motile retain switch in OFF orientation based on PCR sequencing. Toxin production in RecV ON and OFF mutants was evaluated by western blot, showing enriched OFF produced less Tcd than ON. These data demonstrate flag switch controls production in addition to biosynthesis and motility, indicating major virulence factors coordinately variable in C difficile.

**Title:** Conservation and Divergence of Sporulation Sigma Factors in the Intestinal Pathogen Clostridium difficile

**Research Question:** This study investigates the function and regulation of sporulation sigma factors in the intestinal pathogen Clostrid difficile, an obligate anaerobe, where endospores are central to the infectious cycle, and compares them to the model organism Bacillus subtilis.

**Methods:** Morphological characterization of mutants for spor sigma factors in parallel with fluorescence reporter gene expression analysis unraveled deviations from the B. subtilis paradigm.

**Findings:** While the main periods of activity of sigma factors are conserved, we show that σE activity is partially independent of σ, σ activity is dependent on σ, and σ activity does not require σ. We also show σ is not strictly required for heat spore formation. Our results indicate reduced temporal segregation between activities of early and late sigma factors and reduced requirement for σ-to-σ, σ-to-σ, and σ-to- cell signaling pathways.

**Implications:** Our results support the view that the level of endosulation network is conserved in evolution, with sigma factors acting as key regulators of the pathway established 2.5 billion years ago at the base of the Firmutes Phylum.

**Conclusions:** The conservation of sporulation sigma factors suggests their role and sequential activation is maintained across species. However, differences in roles and time of activity of sigma during spore morphogenesis in Clostrid species, such as σ and σ active prior to division in C. acetutyum and C. pering, and σ in pre-division cells of C. botum, indicate divergence from the B. subtil paradigm. Our study highlights the importance of understanding sporulation in Clostr species, particularly C. difficile, where endores are central to the infectious cycle.

**Title:** Modeling Allosteric Multisite Phosphorylation with a Single Variable: A Framework and Application to a Budding Yeast Checkpoint Pathway**

**Research Question:** We investigate a novel framework to model alloster multisite phosphorylation using a single variable, which closely replicates the steady-state behavior of detailed multisite systems, such as the Monod-Wy-Change alloster model. We aim to explore the conditions under which optimal ultrasensitivity is achieved and apply this framework to a newly discovered signaling pathway in budding yeast.

**Methods:** We introduce a compact framework to describe the dynamics of alloster multisite phosphorylation, which approximates the behavior of multiple sites with a single variable. This reduction becomes increasingly precise as the number of sites increases, with good estimates for four or more sites. We apply this framework to a mechanistic model of a cell size checkpoint in budding yeast, which involves multisite phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase and dephosphorylation by a phosphatase.

**Findings:** Our results show that the components of this pathway form a hysteretic switch, incorporating a signal proportional to bud size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an-or response only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating sufficient growth. We demonstrate that multisite phosphorylation can give rise to ultras dose responses, not possible in single-site systems.

**Implications:** This framework is useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems where multis proteins interact simultaneously. It can be extended to other types of multis modification, such as ligand binding, multisite transcription regulation, multis methylation, acetylation, ubiquination, etc. The versatility of this tool can be tested by implementing it in actual biochemical systems.

**Conclusions:** Alloster multisite phosphorylation is a complex due to multiple sites having significant effects on dynamics, while introducing auxiliary phospho variables can be cumbersome in realistic models. Our framework provides a one-variable quasi-stead state reduction, similar to the Mon-WChange alloster system, and can be applied to other covalent modifications and noncovalent lig binding. We demonstrate its application to a budding yeast checkpoint pathway, showing a hysteretic behavior and ultras response. This work contributes to understanding multisite phosphorylation and its role in regulatory processes, such as bistability, hystis, and limit cycles, requiring nonlinear interactions and feedback.

**Title:** Deciphering the Mechanisms of Quorum Sensing in E. coli: Unraveling the Complexity of Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) Quorum Sensing System through Experimental and Mathematical Modeling Approaches

**Research Question:** How does the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum sensing system in E. coli enable multicellularity and confer a selective advantage to bacterial populations, and what are the underlying mechanistic underpinnings of this phenomenon?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches to investigate the connectivity and signal transduction in the AI-2 quorum system of E. coli. We separated the network into sub-networks to examine negative and positive feedback mechanisms, hypothesized a new negative interaction, and tested it via a simple model, and revealed the importance of the Lsr regulator and its role in the E. coli "switch".

**Findings:** Our results show that the auto-regulatory network coupled with a double negative motif provides a population-based response, known as quorum sensing (QS). We analyzed the connectivity and propagation of the native molecule AI-2 in the system. Regulatory motifs of the network were studied in isolation by constructing mutant strains and combined to represent the system as a complete network. Analysis of this architecture shed light on regulatory pathways within bacterial metabolic networks and may guide phenotypes in new ways quorum switches are incorporated into biotechnological applications.

**Implications:** Our model, based on experimental results and incorporating the new element, captured predictions and simulated the intact and sub-systems using the proposed architecture. Importantly, we revealed the mechanistic basis for Lsr-mediated "switch" of E coli circuitry in the native system. The AI- uptake mechanism, one of two modules in AI-mediated system E coli, was taken apart and sub-systems analyzed in isolation, leading to speculation of regulatory within network coli-AI- system. We showed a bottom-up approach isolating regulatory elements effective analyze natural network when positive and negative exist within architecture, and construct hypothetical system simulations predict existence mechanisms.

**Conclusions:** This study unravels the mechanistic understanding interplay among regulatory substructures and their contributions to native network functioning. A "bottom-up" approach in gene regulation will unravel complex QS architectures and lead emergent behaviors. Our findings have implications for understanding regulatory pathways within bacterial metabolic networks and guide phenotypes in biotechnological applications.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Schistosomiasis and Soil-Transmitted Helminths (STH) on Plasmodium falciparum Infection in School-Age Children in Rural Gabon

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the effect of schistosiasis and soil-transmitted helmin (STH) on the prevalence and incidence of Plasium falcum infection in school-age children in rural Gabon.

**Methods:** A longitudinal survey was conducted in two rural communities in the vicinity of Laméné, Gabon. Thick smear microscopy, urine filtration, and Kato-K technique were used to detect malaria, S. haobium, and ST eggs, respectively. P. falcum carriage was assessed at inclusion, and incidence of malaria and time to first event recorded in correlation with Schosia status. Stratified multivariate analysis using generalized linear model assessed risk Plmod infection interaction with ST, and analysis time to malaria.

**Findings:** The overall prevalence at enrolment was 30% for S. haob, 23% for P. falcum, and 9% co-infection with both parasites. Results showed that schosias increased risk of Plmod infection, combined with Trichuris trichi or hook infection increased risk (OR=3.9 [95%CI:1.7-9.2]. Incidence over time 0.51[95%:0.45-0.57] per-year was higher in Schia-infected compared to non-inf group (0.61 vs.0.43, p=0.02), with significant delay time-to-malaria only in children 6-10 years old infected Schia.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that ST enhance risk for P. falc in schias-positive children, and that schias enhances susceptibility to malaria in young children but not older. This study provides evidence of effect of schias on Plmod infection, supporting previous findings. However, conflicting results in literature on schias-malaria co-infection suggest potential confounding factors need to be considered. In areas where schias is endemic, effect on malaria outcome is a concern. Our study reveals up to 11% school children co-inf with P. falc and S. ha parasites, compared to 15% pregnant co-inf in Cameroon or 23% co-inf with S. mans in co-endemic North-West Tanzania.

**Conclusion:** Schias and ST co-infections cumulatively impact malaria outcome in school children, and should be accounted for when designing malaria programs. In co-endemic areas, STH and schias control should be considered an additional tool for malaria control. This longitudinal study addresses issue in area where S. ha and P are main species, and assesses effect ST.

**Title:** IRF-5-Mediated Inflammation Regulates Antigen-Specific CD8+ T Cell Responses during Leishmania donovani Infection: A Novel Immune Evasive Mechanism for Persistent Infection

**Research Question:** How does IRF-5-mediated inflammation influence antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania donani infection, and what is the role of HIF-α induction in dendritic cells in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during Leish donani infection using IRF5-/- mice and HIF-α conditional knockout mice. We analyzed the impact of H-α induction in dendritic cells on CD8 T cell expansion, effector function, and parasite burden.

**Findings:** IR-dependent inflammation induced by Leish during the first week of infection inhibits CD8 T expansion and development of short-lived effector cells (SLECs) by inducing H-α in dendritic cells. H-α induction in dendritic cells resulted in decreased IL-12 and increased IL-10 expression. Depletion of H-α in dendritic cells led to higher frequency of SLECs, enhanced CD8 T expansion, and reduced parasite burden.

**Implications:** IR-mediated inflammation by Leish at early stages plays a detrimental role in protective CD8 T responses. H-α induction in dendritic represents an immune-evasive mechanism by Leish to establish chronic infection.

**Conclusions:** IR5 participates in limiting antigen-specific CD8 T expansion at early stages by inducing Hα in dendritic. Upregulation Hα in dendritic resulted in decreased IL-12 and increased IL-10. Depletion Hα in dendritic led to higher SLE, enhanced CD T expansion, and reduced parasite burden. Hα induction can be induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines or TLR ligation. Leish promastigotes Hα in macrophages.

**Title:** Identification of Prognostic Factors for Unfavorable Outcomes in Visceral Leishmanias: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Studies in Latin America

**Research Question:** What are the prognostic factors associated with unfavorable outcomes in visceral leishmanias (VL) in Latin America, and how can they be used to identify patients at higher risk of poor clinical evolution and mortality?

**Methods:** A systematic review of 14 studies conducted in Latin America was conducted to identify prognostic variables associated with adverse outcomes in VL, including death and clinical evolution despite treatment. Studies were analyzed using a tool assessing methodological quality and prognostic variables were synthesized through meta-analysis. Variables were grouped by strength of evidence, heterogeneity, and multivariate analyses.

**Findings:** Jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and >40 years, neutropenia, dyspnea, bacterial infections, edema, and low hemoglobin concentration were associated with unfavorable outcomes. The strongest predictors identified were jaundice, thromocytopenia, and HIV coinfection.

**Implications:** Integration of results from investigations over 10 years enabled identification of consistent prognostic variables useful for recognizing patients at risk of unfavorable outcomes. Development of externally validated prognostic models should be prioritized in future research.

**Conclusion:** Visceralishias is a serious public health problem in endemic regions, associated with poverty and scarce effective treatments. Identification of prognost factors can be a valuable tool for clinical practice. The Ministry of Health recommends platelet transfusion for patients <10,000 platelets/mm3. Leish-HIV coinfection was a prognostic factor for adverse evolution, with coinfected individuals having higher risk of poor prognosis. The lack of reduction in fatality rates in Brazil can be explained by limitations therapy, diagnosis, and inadequate management of individuals at risk. Undernutrition is not a risk factor for severity, but a consequence of wasting in VL. Control of Leish replication by immun system, particularly Th cells, undernished patients explains lack of association.

**Limitations:** Absence of validation for prognost models developed so far.

**Title:** Investigating Antimony Susceptibility of Leishmania Isolates in Algeria: A 30-Year Epidemiological Study

**Research Question:** What is the level of antimony susceptibility among Leish isolates in Algeria, and how has it changed over the past 30 years?

**Methods:** We analyzed 106 Leish isolates, including 88 collected between 1976-2013 from humans, dogs, rodents, and phleomines, and 18 from dogs in France. We determined the 50 inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of antimony tartrate (Sbivalent form) and sodium stibogluconate (pentavalent form) in promastigotes and intramacroph amastigotes. The epidemiological cutoff (EFCO) allowed us to differentiate Leish species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmanias susceptible (S+) or insusceptible (S) to trivalent antimony.

**Findings:** We report a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in VL isolates during the 30-year period. In contrast, an increase in frequency of S-phenotypes isolates causing CL was observed during the same period. Our study shows emergence of S-phenotypes correlates with inclusion of L. kili (L. trop) isolates causing cutaneous leishiasis that emerged in Algeria last decade.

**Implications:** Our results provide insight into spatiemporal dynamics of Leish antimony susceptibility in Algeria. We highlight need for future implementation of effective methodology to determine antimony status of Leish isolates to detect emergence and prevent dissemination of drug-resistant strains.

**Conclusion:** This study is the first to address occurrence of transmission of Leish isolates with low susceptibility to antimony in Algeria. Leishios classified by WHO as neglected diseases, with limited resources for chemotherapy. Preserving therapeutic efficiency of antimonials to cure leishios by preventing emergence of drug-resistant organisms is of interest. We determined antimony profile of Leish isolates for prevalent species in Algeria, responsible for visceral (L. infant) or cutaneous (L. infant, L. major, L. kili syn. L. trop). Lack of well-defined ant-resistant Leish isolates and limited samples allowed us to determine ECO value, threshold between susceptible (S+) and insuscept (S) populations. This epidemiological value clarifies classification of Leish isolates according to ant-susceptibility status. Origins of isolates compiled in Table 1. Prior drug assays, species reconfirmed by isoenzyme electrophis and PCR-RP. Susceptibility of Leish strains to ant determined in vitro passages from thaw.

**Title:** Investigating the Link between Acute Gastroenteritis and Crohn's Disease: A Novel Insights into the Role of Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIE) in Disease Onset

**Research Question:** What is the mechanistic basis for the increased risk of Crohn's disease (CD) following acute gastroenteritis, and can adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIE) play a role in this relationship?

**Methods:** We developed two novel models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhurium or Citrobacterium in mice colonized with AIE, a bacterial pathogen linked to CD. We used a co-infection model that leveraged a model of colonization of wild-type mice with AIE strain NRGc25, isolated from a Crohn disease patient, to study the link between acute gastroenteritis and susceptibility to CD.

**Findings:** AIE-colonized mice that developed gastroenter in response to either S. Tyurium or Citrobium had a worsened outcome compared to AIE-naive animals exposed to the same stimuli. We found that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenter was driven by tissue-associated expansion of the AIE pathion, with attendant increase in immunopathology defects and delays in mucosal restitution following path clearance. These features required AIE resistance to host peptides and fulant inflammatory response to enteric path.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that individuals colonized by AIE at the time of acute gastroenter may be at risk for CD onset. Importantly, our data identify AIE as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following gastroenter in-risk individuals.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the mechanistic basis for increased risk of CD following acute gastroenter and highlights the potential role of AIE in disease onset. Our findings have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat CD in individuals at risk following gastroenter.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Cell Fate Determination in Flowering Plant Gametophytes: A Novel Insights from the lis-1 Mutant of Arabidopsis

**Research Question:** How are the fates of gametic and accessory cells determined in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying this process?

**Methods:** We isolated the lis-1 mutant of Arabidopsis, which forms supernumerary egg cells, and investigated the fate of gametic and accessory cells in lis-1 gametophytes. We analyzed the temporal and spatial expression pattern of LIS, a regulator of egg fate, and its homology to yeast splicing factor PR4.

**Findings:** In lis-1 mutants, accessory cells differentiate gametic fate, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism preventing accessory cells from adopting gametic fate. The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggest this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. LIS is homologous to yeast splicing factor PR4, indicating components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions. We found that all cells in the gamet are competent to differentiate gametic fate and LIS is involved in a mechanism repressing gametic fate in accessory cells. Interestingly, the gam central cell in lis-1 gamophy adopted egg fate, suggesting a LIS-dependent suppresses cell fate in central.

**Implications:** The lis-1 mutant reveals two levels of cell regulation: one between gametic and accessory, and one between egg and central. The initiation of cell-specific genes indicates Arabid distinct fates are manifested after cellularization of gametes. Our results suggest that all aspects of accessory and gametic fate are not mutually exclusive.

**Conclusions:** The formation of gametes is a critical step in the lifecycle of sexually reproducing organisms. In flowering plants, egg and sperm cells develop within haploid gamophytes. The female gamophyte of Arabid originates from a haploid spore through nuclear cycles. The syncytium of nuclei cellularizes and differentiates four distinct fates. Our data, with ectopic expression of egg marker in synergids, indicate lis- mutant synergids differentiate egg attributes at expense syner cell. We found several morphological features distinguish lis-1/L plants from wild became pronounced over time. Our results suggest during specification lis mutant gamophy, accessory cells become recruited gametic. We mapped lis- mutation to At2g00 locus, encoding protein with WD repeats.

**Title:** Understanding the Role of Footwear in Preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs): A Qualitative Study in a Rural Ethiopian Highland Community

**Research Question:** What are the social, behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors influencing the use of footwear in a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoiosis, and how can these findings inform the implementation of footwear programs to prevent Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs)?

**Methods:** A qualitative study using the PRECE-DE-PRO model was conducted in a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoiosis. Data was gathered from 242 respondents through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and case studies.

**Findings:** Shoe-wearing norms are changing, with going barefoot increasingly seen as shameful. Shoes are thought to confer dignity as well as protection against injury and cold. However, practical and social barriers prevent the desire to wear from being translated into practice. Limited resources mean people are unable to purchase more than one pair of shoes to ensure longevity or afford of quality. As a result, shoes are preserved for special occasions and not provided for children until a certain age. While some barriers (e.g. fit, fear of labeling) may be specific to certain diseases, underlying barriers related to poverty (e.g. price, unsuitability, low perception) are likely relevant to a range NTDs.

**Implications:** Established models of health behavior adoption identify barriers to shoe-wearing amenable to intervention, which will benefit those considering NTD prevention through shoe distribution.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of targeting individuals' beliefs and attitudes about shoe-wearing, how these influence perceived capabilities to prevent podoiosis, and whether shoes can reduce risk for the condition. While respondents aspire to wear, reality is different. Many possess shoes, but not worn regularly. Barriers include financial, access to footwear for activities, and low disease risk perception. Podoiosis patients face additional barriers: difficulty finding sizes, fear and stigma.

**Title:** The Role of Us9 Protein in Targeting Viral Glycoproteins to Axons of Sympathetic Neurons: A Critical Association with Lipid Rafts

**Research Question:** How does the Us9 protein facilitate the targeting of viral glycoproteins to axons of sympathetic neurons, and what is the role of lipid rafts in this process?

**Methods:** We used non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), to investigate the association of Us9 with lipid rafts and its role in targeting viral glyrote to axons.

**Findings:** We found that Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) of non-polar and polarized PC cells, and this enrichment is critical for Us-mediated targeting of viral glyrote to axons. Reducing the affinity of Us for lipid ra inhibited antograde transmission of infection from sympathetic to epithelial cells in vitro.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that association of Us with lipid ra is key for efficient targeting of viral glyrote to axons, and as a consequence, directional spread of PR from pre-synaptic to postynaptic neurons in the mammalian nervous system.

**Conclusions:** Our data demonstrate that Us is associated with lipid rafts, and this association is critical for Us-mediated targeting of viral glyrote to axons. We propose a model where viral glyrote and membrane traffic together in ax as mature particles within vesicles. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that glyrote g, g, g, g, and g are associated with lipid ra on infected swine cells and monocytes. Overall, our study highlights the importance of lipid ra in Us-mediated targeting of viral glyrote to axons and directional spread of PR in the mammalian nervous system.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Genetic Heterogeneity in Yeast Growth and Acute Stress Tolerance

**Research Question:** What is the molecular basis of genetic heterogeneity in yeast growth and acute stress tolerance, and how can it be manipulated to make cells more susceptible to treatment?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic perturbations and high-throughput single-cell assays of growth and gene expression in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase (PKA) pathway and its transcription factors M2 and M4.

**Findings:** Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, as shown by direct comparison of cAMP concentration in subpopulations enriched for slower vs. faster cells. Concordantly, an endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. Paralogs M2 and M4 differ in their roles in heterogeneity in a way that demonstrates slow growth and stress are not inevitably linked. Heterogeneity in growth requires each, whereas M2 is required for heterogeneity expression of T1, a subunit of trehalose synth that contributes acute-stress. Perturbing heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway or culturing wild-type with cell-perme cAMP 8-bromoAMP or PK inhibitor H89 significantly impacts survival acute stress.

**Implications:** Perturbations increase intracellular cAMP reduce slower subpopulation and increase susceptibility acute stress, whereas PK inhibition slows growth decreases susceptibility acute stress. Loss M2 reduces but not eliminates correlation individual between rate and acute-st survival, suggesting major role M2 in heterogeneity but residual slow growth.

**Conclusions:** Our results shed light on genetic control of heterogeneity and suggest possible means defeating pathogens or tumor cells by making them uniformly susceptible to treatment. The Ras/cAMP pathway acting M2 and M4 underlies heterogeneity yeast growth and stress, and manipulating cAMP or PK or its transcription factors alters growth and acute tolerance in consistent way. Discrepancies with model do not negate conclusion that Ras/cAMP pathway underlies beted strategy in yeast.

**Title:** Evolutionary Dynamics of Chikungunya Virus (CHV) in the Americas: A Study of Genetic Diversity and Adaptation in a Naïve Populations

**Research Question:** How has Chikunya virus (CHV), an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, evolved during its rapid spread from Asia to the Americas in 2013, and what are the implications for its ongoing epidemic in naïve populations?

**Methods:** We employed deep-sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines to analyze viral diversity in CHV-infected individuals from Guadelou and Martinique, two epicenters of the outbreak, and constructed an infectious clone with a novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure not previously found in nature.

**Findings:** We observed changes in consensus sequences and diverse minority variants at various levels in the population, with reduced diversity after single passages in cell lines. The 3'UTR structure led to increased replication in insect cells. Intrahostasis analysis revealed novel variants and 3'UTR in infected individuals, suggesting rapid evolution in a short time.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the need for continuous viral surveillance as the epidemic evolves to understand CHV's evolutionary potential. Whole-genome analysis from high-vire samples may bias observed diversity.

**Conclusion:** This study provides an in-depth look at minority variants during ongoing CHikunya epidemic, identifying novel structural elements and constructing an infectious clone for future study pathogenesis and adaptation. Results agree with previous studies, placing viruses in Asianage CHV and clustering with St. Martin strain CN202. Deep-sequencing identified unique high-frequency variants and synonymous differences with reported strain. We sequenced 25 strains from Martinique and Guadelpe patients (70% from Martinique, 2013-2014) and identified 3'UTR duplication unique among circulating CHV worldwide.

**Title:** UBT, a Novel Regulator of mTOR Signaling, Modulates Cell Growth and Neoplasia

**Research Question:** How does UBT, a previously unannotated gene, regulate cell growth and neoplas via mTOR signaling pathways?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of UBT in regulating cell growth and neoplas using cultured cells, zebraf, and xenograft models.

**Findings:** Reduction of UBT function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promoted neurite outgrowth, while UBT depletion activated mTOR signaling and promoted cell growth. Conversely, UBT overexpression suppressed colony formation in cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed UBT stabilized DEOR, a component of the mTOR complex, inhibiting mTOR signaling. In zraf models, ubtor disruption upregulated mTOR and promoted HRAS (G12)-mediated neoplas.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate UBT regulates cell growth and neoplas via mTOR signaling. UBT depletion promoted tumor growth and mTOR signaling in xenograft mice, supporting its role in neoplas.

**Conclusions:** UBT, an unannot gene in vertebrates, encodes a protein without known domains, regulates cell growth and neop via mTOR signaling. UBT stabilizes DEOR and regulates DEOR's ubiquitination, inhibiting mTOR. Disruption of ub gene in zraf increased mTOR activity and aggravated HRAS (12)-induced neoplas. UOR depletion promoted tumor growth and m signaling in xenograft mice. These findings highlight UBT as a novel regulator of cell growth and neop mTOR pathways.

**Key findings:**

* UBT promotes neurite outgrowth and cellular growth in cultured cells
* UBT overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines
* U stabilizes DEOR, a component of mTOR complex, inhibiting m signaling
* Disruption of ub gene in zraf upregulates mTOR and promotes HRAS (12)-mediated neoplas
* UOR depletion promotes tumor growth and m signaling in xenograft
* UOR stabilizes DEOR and regulates DE's ubiquination

**Future directions:**

* Investigate UOR's role in HRG12-mediated tumor formation in homozygous zraf mutant
* Examine UOR's effect on xenograft growth of UOR-depleted UMG cells in nude mice
* Study U's induction by NGF in PC cells and its relation to m signaling

**Title:** Systematic Mapping of Protein-Protein Interactions in the Procyclic Stage of Trypanosoma brucei Reveals Unprecedented Insights into the Parasite's Biology and Pathogenesis**

**Research Question:** The functions of the majority of trypanosomat-specific proteins remain unknown, hindering our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of Trypanosomatidae. To address this knowledge gap, we aimed to systematically map protein-protein interactions in the procyclic stage of Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan parasite responsible for human trypanosomiasis.

**Methods:** Using in-depth biochemical fractionation, we interrogated co-complex interactions of over 335 protein groups in the procyclic stage of T. brucei. Our rigorous methodology led to the identification of 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 protein groups, including 635 groups lacking experimental annotation.

**Findings:** The complexes correlate with known pathways and proteins co-expressed across T. bruce life, providing functions for a large number of previously uncharacterized proteins. We validated functions of novel proteins associated with RNA-editing machinery, identifying a candidate involved in post-transcriptional regulation of T. bruce.

**Implications:** This study presents the largest proteomics interaction map of tryosid parasites to date, providing a resource for formulating biological hypotheses and experimental leads. We showcase the utility of this map by revealing factors in post-transcription regulation of T. bruce, validated by independent experiments.

**Conclusions:** This study provides an unprecedented view of protein map T. bruce, serving as a reliable resource for characterization tryosid proteins. Our results are available at www.TryNet.org.

**Title:** Dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection in Thoracic Lymph Nodes: A Comparative Study of Cynomolgus and Rhes Macaques

**Research Question:** How does Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection affect the structure and function of thoracic lymph nodes (LN) in cynolgus andhes macques, and what are the implications for disease progression and persistence?

**Methods:** We used PET scans to track inflammation in thoracic LNs of M-infected cynolg andhes macques, analyzing bacterial burden, LN structure, and immune function. We correlated FDG avidity with the presence of live bacteria at necropsy. LNs showed different trajectories (increasing, decreasing) in activity over time within the same animal.

**Findings:** LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection, but also serve as sites for persistence of significant numbers of Mtbilli. TB grows to the same level in cynolg andhes mac L, however, cynolg mac control Mtb later post-infection whilehes do not. Compared to granulomas, LNs are poor at killing Mtb, even with treatment. Granulomas in L lack B-rich lymphoid structures, disrupt LN structure, push out T and B cells, introduce macrophages that serve as niches for M, and destroy vasculature.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that mycobacterial involvement in thoracic L is dynamic and PET-detected FD uptake associated with bacterial in L. We found variation in thoracic L infected among macques and differences in pathology and burden between cynolg andhes macques. Our study addresses the question of LN dynamics and differences between species, using PET imaging to track inflammation in thoracic L following M infection. Cynomus macques are more susceptible to TB due to extensive pathology, with more infected LNs, higher burden, and pathology thanhes macques. Extensive disease leads to LN enlargement impinging on airway, lung collapse.

**Conclusions:** Our comprehensive study of thoracic L in M-infected cynolg andhes macques shows that LNs increase PET-measured activity early infection, at necy almost all FD-avid L contained M or persistent M DNA. TB grows same level in L of both species, however, cynolg L control better thanhes. Compared to granulomas in lung, thoracic L poor at killing M. Granomas in L disrupt structure, associated with higher M burden.

**Title:** Unveiling the Diversity and Ubiquity of Microsporidian Infections in Nematodes: A New Insights into Host-Parasite Coevolution

**Research Question:** How widespread and diverse are microsporidian infections in Caenorhabditis elegans and other related nematodes in the wild?

**Methods:** We isolated and cultured 47 nematode strains with microidian infections, and identified the most common microidian infecting C. elegans as Nematida paris. Additionally, we described six new species in the Nematida genus and performed phylogenetic analysis to identify two subclades distinct from Nematida, named Enteropra and Ptospora.

**Findings:**

* Nematida paris is the most common microidian infecting C. elegans in the wild.
* Six new species in the Nemat genus were identified, including Enterop and Ptos, which belong to the main clade of microidia that includes human pathogens.
* All microidia are horizontally transmitted and specifically infect intestinal cells, except Ptospora, which replicates in the epidermis of C. elegans.
* Subcellularly, infected cells of Enterop show apical distribution and exit via budding, whereas Nemat exit via exocytosis.
* Host specificity is broad for some microidia, narrow for others, with some microidia infecting Osche but not Osche, and vice versa.
* Nauseli fails to induce C eleg transcription of genes induced by other Nemat species, suggesting evolved mechanisms to prevent host response.

**Implications:**

* Our findings illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microidian infections in nemodes and provide a resource to investigate host-parite coevolution in nemode hosts.
* Microidia are obligate intracellular parasites with tight association with hosts, highlighting the importance of studying their biology and ecology in natural environments.
* C elegans, a major biological model species, has been used for 50 years, yet little was known about its natural biology and pathogens until recently.

**Conclusions:**

* Nematodes, a huge phylum with 25,000 species, have few studies on microidian infections reported.
* Our collection of 47 nemode strains with microidian infections provides new insights into diversity and ubiquity of microidian in nemodes.
* Nematida paris and Nauseli are dominant species in our collection, with 17 and 10 strains, respectively, found in several Eleg group nemodes.
* Remaining microidian have Nemat as top hit in GenBank, with similarity 81-86% SS rDNA and 74-84 β-tulin genes.
* Microidian infecting nemodes have been described, but extent and diversity sparsely reported.
* Our study provides a rich resource for investigating host-parite coevolution in nemodes and understanding microidian biology ecology.

**Title:** Unveiling the Structural Complexity of Chemokine Receptor Homo- and Heterodimers: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations

**Research Question:** How do chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), form homo and heterodimers and interact with cholesterol, and how do these interactions modulate their function?

**Methods:** We employed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the homo and heterodimerization of chemine receptors CXCR, CCR, and CCR, and their interactions with cholesterol.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that closely related chemine receptors CCR and C share similar homodimerization patterns, differing from those of CXCR. Cholesterol modulates homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemine heterodimers display distinct dimer patterns for CXCR/CCR and CXCR/CCR, with CXCR/CR exhibiting increased cholesterol-sensitivity compared to CX/CCR.

**Implications:** This study provides a comprehensive overview of the complex network between chemine receptors and heterodimerization, highlighting how interactions with the membrane diversify the function of related GPCRs. Our findings suggest that cholesterol plays a crucial role in modulating chemine receptor function and heterodimerization, influencing the dynamic range and versatility of transmembrane receptors.

**Conclusions:** This work elucidates the structural details of chemine receptor homo and heterodimers, shedding light on the role of cholesterol in modulating their interactions. Our results have implications for understanding chemine receptor function, particularly in cancer and HIV infection, and highlight the importance of considering heterodimerization in GPCR research.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Form of Systemic Leishmanias: An Atypical Presentation with Masked Immune Dysfunction**

**Research Question:** Can systemic leishiasis present with a broader spectrum of symptoms and signs than previously suspected, and is it more common than previously diagnosed?

**Methods:** We conducted a retrospective study of 160 patients referred to our immunology laboratory with suspected immune deficiency, who underwent specialized immune function tests, including microscopic examinations and cultures on various media. 19.4% of patients had normal laboratory profiles but exhibited macrophages laden with Leishmania parasites.

**Findings:** We identified a novel form of systemic leishias, referred to as "atypical", characterized by masked immune dysfunction, predisposing patients to recurrent infections with diverse clinical manifestations. Among 31 patients, adults were affected, indicating systemic leishias is not limited to pediatric age group.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest systemic leishias presents a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously thought, and is more common than diagnosed. We recommend diagnosing atypical systemic leishias in patients with unexplained immunity and no obvious immunologic defect.

**Conclusions:** Systemic leishias has a protean clinical picture with diverse symptoms, beyond classical fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting. The atypical form presents masked immune dysfunction, leading to recurrent infections with various signs and symptoms. Our study highlights the importance of considering atypical systemic leishias in patients with unexplained immunity and no obvious immunologic defect.

**Background:** Systemic leishias, also known as Kala-azar, has a well-defined clinical picture, but recent evidence suggests a broader symptomatology. Cases with variable illness have been reported based on positive serology. Our study found patients with typical immune deficiency and normal profiles harbored Leish organisms, unlike subclinical cases with mild or no symptoms. A novel picture of visceral leishias emerged.

**Discussion:** Diagnosis of systemic leish depends on immune reaction to Leish antigens, not always demonstrated by tissue examination or cultures. In our area, 72 pediatric leish cases were reported. Visceralishias (VL) is characterized by fever, cachexia, hepatosplenomegaly, wasting, pancytopenia, and is fatal if untreated. Literature suggests two types of systemic leishias, but our study reveals a third, atypical form with masked immune dysfunction.

**Recommendation:** Diagnose atypical systemic leish in patients with unexplained immunity and no immunologic defect.

**Title:** Leveraging Homologous Variants in Paralog Proteins to Identify Disease-Causing Polymorphisms: A Novel Approach to Predicting Phenotypic Consequences

**Research Question:** Can homologous variants in paralog proteins be used to predict disease-causing polymorphisms with phenotypic consequences?

**Methods:** We assembled a dataset of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and HGMD, and identified pairs of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralog human proteins. We analyzed the distribution of variants in paralog proteins and found that disease-causing variants tend to co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. This suggests that variantairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

**Implications:** This study provides a novel approach to predicting phenotyp consequences of sequence variants, complementing computational methods such as SIFT and PolyPhen. We propose that functional constraints in paralog proteins restrict disease-causing variants to few homolog positions, where amino substitutions produce the phenotype.

**Conclusions:** Homologous variants in paralog proteins can be used to identify disease-causing polymorphisms with phenotyp consequences. This approach extends existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization and provides candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Further research on paralogs of disease genes can identify new candidates and uncharacterized variants likely to have phenotyp consequences.

**Title:** Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Altered Gene Expression in Plasmodium falciparum Parasites Associated with Severe Malaria

**Research Question:** How do Plasium falcum parasites respond to and adapt to the host environment in severe malaria, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms driving disease severity?

**Methods:** We employed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze gene expression in 44 parasite isolates causing severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papua New Guine patients.

**Findings:** Transcriptomes of parasite isolates associated with severe malaria showed decreased glycolysis, activation of compensatory pathways, altered chromatin structure, and transcriptional regulation through histone methylation, reduced expression of Pf1 surface antigens, and down-regulation of multiple chaperone proteins. RNA-seq also identified novel associations between disease severity and Pf1 transcripts, domains, and confirmed previously reported associations between expressed Pf sequences and disease.

**Implications:** These findings inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and indicate how parasites adapt to or are selected by host environment in severe malaria. Contrary to previous reports, we observed decreased expression of genes encoding proteins involved in Pf surface expression in severe malaria, with 17 genes down-regulated, including skeleton protein 1, directly involved in Pf surface expression.

**Conclusions:** Parasites causing severe malaria had lower levels of antibodies to Pf1 and recognized fewer Pf1 than uncomplicated patients, consistent with circulating parasites being older in uncomplicated than severe patients. Downregulation of genes in Pf surface expression explains why immunity to severe is acquired more rapidly than immunity uncomplicated. Expression of conserved Pf1 by parasites causing severe explains why immunity to severe is acquired more rapidly than uncomplicated. Some Pf1 domains bind host receptors and are expressed in severe have been identified at finer resolution than whole Pf1.

**Title:** Long-term Delivery of Potent Neutralizing Antibodies via AAV Vectors: A Promising Approach for HIV-1 Prevention

**Research Question:** Can long-term delivery of broadly neutralizing antibodies via adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors prevent HIV-1 infection in rhesus macaques?

**Methods:** AAV vectors were used to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in IgG form to rhes macaques, achieving persisting levels of mAb as high as 270 μg/ml. However, host responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration of delivered antibody that could be achieved.

**Findings:** Following repeated intravenous challenge with difficult-to-neutralize SIVmac, six monkeys in the AAV-5 Ig1 group showed protective effects despite absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the virus. Protective effects included lowering of viral load peak, lowering viral load set point, and delay in time to peak viral load from time of infectious exposure. All effects were statistically significant. The monkey with highest delivered 5m completely resisted successive SIV challenges, including a final challenge of 10 infectious units.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate the continued promise of this approach for HIV-1 prevention in humans. However, antibody responses need to be understood for this approach to be effectively realized.

**Conclusions:** AAV-mediated delivery of full-length immunoglobulins tohes maca and protective effects of non-neutralizing 5 Ig1 against SIV challenge were observed. Appearance of anti-antibody responses post-infection obviated ability to measure delivered m at post-infection points. Humoral responses to A-delivered m were measured by ELISA. Current availability of human m with potent-neutral activity against HIV-1 envisions prevention scenarios with cocktails could provide steril barrier against majority HIV-1 strains. However, passive delivery of purified m over years is not feasible. AAV proteins can persist for years and have proven safe effective in human therapy against diseases. More than dozen broadly neutral anti-HIV monoclonal have been characterized, human-derived, effectively neutralizing 90% HIV-1, representing range specificities.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Linearity of Protein Response to Thermal and Ligand-Induced Perturbations: A Study on Myosin and Kinesin KIF1 Motor Proteins

**Research Question:** Can the traditional assumption of linearity in protein response to thermal and ligand-induced perturbations accurately describe conformational motions in proteins, particularly in motor proteins like myosin and kines KIF1?

**Methods:** We employed the coarse-grained elastic network model (ENM) approximation to investigate conformation relaxation properties of myos and KIF1 in response to ligand binding and hydrolysis.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the linearity assumption is deficient for lig-induced conformation motions and even thermal fluctuations, particularly in KIF1, where normal mode description fails to describe mechanochemical motions. In contrast, myos conformation relaxation can be qualitatively characterized by normal modes.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that fundamental assumptions of protein dynamics theory need reconsideration, as neither single mode nor superposition of modes approximates strongly nonlinear dynamics.

**Conclusions:** Our analysis of conformation processes associated with ligand binding and hydrolysis in myos and K1 reveals nonlinearity in both macromolecules. Normal description breaks down for K1, yet ordered mechchemical motions persist. Large conformation changes occur due to lig binding, often considered within linear theory and normal approximation. However, our results show nonlinearity plays essential role in both proteins, with K1 exhibiting dominant mechchemical motions qualitatively different from normal predictions.

**Title:** Caveolar Proteins Regulate Clath-Independent Endocytosis through Inhibition of the CL/GEE Endytic Pathway

**Research Question:** How do caveolar proteins regulate clath-independent endocytosis, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of caveolar proteins in clath-independent endocyt using a combination of biochemical, cell biological, and imaging techniques. We expressed caveolar proteins in cells and analyzed their effects on the clath-independent/GPI-AP early endosomal (CL/GEE) endytic pathway. We used quantitative electron microscopy, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), and biochemical assays to study the effects of caveolar on CL/GEE endocyt.

**Findings:** We found that caveolar proteins, specifically Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, inhibit the CL/GEE endytic pathway in a process independent of cave formation. Overexpression of caveolar reduces the formation of early CLEE carriers, detected by electron microscopy. The CLEE pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV/Cavin-1 or reduced expression of Cavin and Cavin. Inhibition by caveol can be mimicked by isolated caveolin scaffolding and associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid components, revealed by FRAP studies. In absence of caveins and caveol, CAV is endocyted preferentially through the CLEE pathway, but loses polarization and sorting with consequences for membrane dynamics and endytic in migrating cells.

**Implications:** Our results provide new insights into the regulation of caveolar clath-independent endocyt by specific proteins, illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between pathways. We show the first role for caveins regulating the CLEE pathway, a new tool to study this pathway, identify cave-independent functions of caveins, and a novel mechanism for inhibition of CLEE by caveolin.

**Conclusions:** Caveolar proteins, independent of caveol, inhibit CL endytosis, but when incorporated into caveol, there is also potent inhibition of CL endyt. Our results suggest a general role for Cavin in regulation of endytic trafficking. Co-expression of caveolar in cells generated caveol and regulated the CLEE pathway. Association of caveins and cave with caveol does not perturb inhibitory activity, identifying caveins, caveins, and caveol as regulators of endyt.

**Title:** Discovery of Aspartate-Less Receiver (AL) Domains: A Novel Subclass of Atypical Two-Component Signaling Systems in Bacteria and Archaea

**Research Question:** Despite the ubiquity of two-component signaling systems in bacteria and Archaea, the functional roles and regulation of divergent Receiver (REC) domains lacking the conserved aspartate (Asp) residue remain unclear.

**Methods:** We compiled a comprehensive dataset of REC domains missing the phosphorylatable Asp residue, renaming them Aspart-Less Receiver (AL) domains. Bioinformatics, structural, and biochemical analyses of the AL archetype ALR from Streptococcus pneumoniae revealed that AL domains have reorganized their active pockets to accommodate constitutive regulation or input signals other than phosphorylation, while retaining canonical phosphorylation mechanisms and dimer interface.

**Findings:** Our results show that AL domains are surprisingly common and enriched with rare effector outputs. The most common AL substitutions at the conserved phospho-Asp site are Ser, Thr, and Tyr, which are known to be phosphoregulated by bacterial Ser/Thr kinases. Some AL domains have diversified to accommodate signaling inputs, including small molecules and Ser phosphorylation through eukary-like Ser kinases and cognate PP phosphatases, regulating cell envelope functions and virulence in microbes.

**Implications:** Our study defines AL as an atypical REC subclass, providing insights into mechanisms of activation between AL and REC domains. The frequency of substitutions suggests that up to 4% of REC domains do not possess the conserved phosphorylatable residue. We propose the Aspart-L Receiver (AL) domain as a novel subclass of atypical RECs, comprising ~4% of all REC domains in bacteria and ~2% in completed genomes.

**Conclusions:** The discovery of AL domains expands our understanding of two-component signaling in bacteria and Archae, highlighting the plasticity of REC domains to accommodate diverse inputs and regulatory mechanisms. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution, function, and regulation of two-component systems in microbes, as well as the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these systems.

**Title:** Efficacy of Fully Virulent HER2-Targeted Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Viruses in Immunocompet Mice: A Novel Immunotherapeutic Approach for Cancer Treatment

**Research Question:** This study investigates the efficacy of fully virulent HER2-targeted oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) in immunocompet mice, with a focus on their ability to elicit a local immune response, lymphocyte migration, and activation, and distant immunotherapeutic efficacy.

**Methods:** We employed two fully virulent HER2-targeted HSVs, R-113 and R-115, armed with IL-12, in immunocom C57/BL/6 mice and HER2-transgenic mice. The viruses were injected intraperitoneally, and tumor growth of primary HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma-1 (HER-LL1) was monitored.

**Findings:** Both R-113 and R115 inhibited tumor growth, with R115 being more efficacious. All mice that survived primary tumors were protected from contralateral tumor growth, and long-term survivors were protected from secondal tumor, indicating absc immunotherapeutic effect. Analysis revealed R115 unleashed immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inducing immunomodulatory cytokines and Th1 polarization of tumor-infiltrating cells.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the potential of fully virulent HER-targeted oHSV as a novel immunotherapeutic agent for cancer treatment, with high safety profile and efficacy in immunocom mice. The results underscore the need for further investigation of this approach in clinical trials.

**Conclusions:** Fully virulent HER-target oHSV armed with IL-12, exemplified by R115, elicits local immune response, lymphocyte migration, and activation, and distant immunother efficacy in immunocom mice. The study highlights differences between retargeted oHSV and deleted/attenuated oHSV in clinical use, with retargeted oHSV replicating in tumor cells while sparing others. The results provide evidence for absc immunotherapeutic effect and underscore systemic vaccine response.

**Title:** Differential Susceptibility of Vector-Specific CD4 T Cells to HIV Infection: Implications for HIV Vaccine Development

**Research Question:** The recent Adenovirus 5 (Ad)-based HIV vaccine trials have highlighted the importance of understanding host responses to vaccine vectors and susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells to HIV. Our study investigated the susceptibility of ALV-specific CD4 cells induced by ALVAC, a canarypox viral vector in the Thai RV144 trial, compared to Ad5-specific CD4 cells in HVT204.

**Methods:** We analyzed PBMC from RV144 and H204 vaccine recipients for HIV susceptibility to R5 and X4 HIV in vitro and phenotyped vector-specific CD4 cells for surface markers and cytokine production.

**Findings:** ALV-specific CD4 cells in RV144 were less susceptible to both R5 and X HIV compared to Ad5 CD cells in H204. Lower susceptibility was associated with reduced expression of HIV co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on AL-specific CD4 cells. Phenotypic analysis showed AL-specific CD4 cells displayed a Th1 phenotype with higher IFNγ and CCL4 (M-β) but little IL-17. Notably, ALAC and Ad vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs CD T-cell proliferative responses in PB, with ALAC preferentially inducing CD8 proliferation while Ad5 induced CD4 proliferation. Depletion of ALAC, but not Ad5, CD8 cells in PB led to increased HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 cells, suggesting a role of ALAC-specific CD8 in protecting ALAC CD4 from HIV.

**Implications:** Our data provide strong evidence for distinct susceptibility of CD4 cells induced by different vectors, highlighting the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination. While Ad vectors have been employed for vaccine development due to potent immunogenicity, advantages may be dampened by high susceptibility of CD4 cells induced. Unlike Ad, ALAC vector-specific CD4 cells are less susceptible to HIV, suggesting potential benefits of using ALAC as a vector.

**Conclusion:** Our study demonstrates that vector-specific CD4 cells manifest differences in susceptibility to HIV, with ALAC CD4 cells being less susceptible than Ad CD5 cells. Phenotypic and cytokine profiles differ between groups, with ALAC CD4 displaying Th1 and Ad CD5 CD4 Th2. These findings have implications for HIV vaccine development, emphasizing the need to consider vector-specific responses in vaccine design.

**Title:** Evolutionary Dynamics of X Chromosome X Inactivation: A Theoretical Analysis of Dominance, Linkage, Recombination, and Sex-Differential Selection

**Research Question:** What are the underlying evolutionary processes that account for the diversity of X chromosome inactivation strategies among therian mammals, and how do dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection influence the evolution of X inactivation?

**Methods:** We performed a theoretical population genetic analysis of X inactivation evolution, considering conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection to investigate the evolutionary trajectories of X inactivation.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that a critical interaction between allelic dominance and sexifferential selection can select for a broad range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between matern and patern inherited chromosomes. Random X inactivation (RX) is favored over paternal X inactivation (PX) as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are recessive, and the criteria for RX evolution is more restrictive when variation is sexually antagonistic (i.e., deleterious to females are beneficial to males). Evolution from PX to RX generally increases relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness.

**Implications:** These findings provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and lead to several predictions that motivate future studies of allele-specific expression variation. Species-specific properties of mutation and genetic variation predictably affect patterns of selection for different inactivation. Sexual and sex-based mutation rates likely vary among species, influencing transmission of deleterious alleles between matern and patern X. Because inactivation is female-limited, selection favors preferential inactivation of the chromosome with greater probability of carrying deleterious alleles.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest conditions for evolving biased inactivation patterns are permissive. Stronger selection against deleterious in males compared to females decreases the proportion of deleter alleles on patern X. We also examine whether sex-differential might favor biased inactivation and predict the magnitude of biases to evolve. Our results indicate conditions for biased inactivation are extremely permissive.

**Title:** Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein ZAP Restricts Japanese Encephalitis Virus Infection through 3'-5' Exosome-Mediated RNA Degradation

**Background:** Zinc finger antiviral protein Z (ZAP) is a host factor that restricts the infection of various viruses through RNA degradation, translation inhibition, and innate immune responses. However, only one flavivirus, yellow fever virus, has been reported to be Z-resistant. Here, we investigated the antiviral potential of human ZAP isoforms Z-L and Z-S against three flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis (JEV), dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIK) viruses.

**Research Question:** What is the antiv potential of ZAP against JEV, DENV, and ZIK viruses?

**Methods:** We overexpressed ZAP in A549 cells and measured viral replication, translation, and innate immune responses. Depleted endogenous Z to enhance JEV replication. Precipitated Z with anti-V antibody pulled down JEV RNA, indicating association between Z and JEV.

**Findings:** JEV, but not DENV or ZIK, was blocked by Z overexpression. Depletion of endogenous Z enhanced J replication. Z hampered J translation and targeted viral RNA 3'-5' exosome degradation. Zinc-finger motifs of Z were essential for RNA targeting and anti-J activity. JEV 3'-UT, especially region with dumbbell structures and high CG content, was mapped to bind Z and confer sensitivity to Z.

**Implications:** We identified JEV as the first Z-sensitive flavivirus. Z may act as intrinsic antiv factor through RNA binding against J infection.

**Conclusions:** Our data suggest that 3'-5 RNA degradation by exosome is involved in antiv mechanism Z against J infection. Addressed whether Z boosted innate responses during J infection, measured mRNA of type I IF and inflammatory cytokines in A549 with or without Z overexpression.

**Title:** Comparative Analysis of Host Response to Wild-Type and Attenuated Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) Strains in C57/BL6 Mice: Implications for Pathogenesis and Vaccine Development

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the clinical and immune responses to wild-type Z501 and attenuated MP-12 strains of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVV) in C57/BL/6 mice, with a focus on understanding the correlation between host response and pathogenesis.

**Methods:** Adult C57/6 mice were infected with either live-attenuated MP12 or wild-type Z501 RVV, and monitored for clinical signs of disease, cytokine response, and histopathological changes. A panel of cytokines and chemokines were evaluated in tissues and serum over the course of infection.

**Findings:** Mice infected with MP12 survived productive infection with minimal disease and cytokine response, whereas Z501 infection was lethal, characterized by lymphocyte and platelet depletion, and strong cytokine response correlating with high virus titers and tissue pathology. Lymphopenia and platelet depletion were indicators of disease onset, with lymphocyte recovery correlating with G-CS production. RVV was hepatotropic, with significant clinical and histological data supporting findings, but no pro-inflammatory response in the liver. Infection resulted in chemokine response with immunactive cells, such as neutrophils, supported by histological data. Brains of Z501 infected mice showed chemine and pro-inflammatory response, but little pathology indicating meningoencephitis.

**Implications:** These findings suggest RVV pathogenesis in mice is associated with liver function loss due to necrosis and hepatitis, with long-term disease being neurologic in nature, supported by human and BAL/c mouse observations. The study highlights differences between host response to wild-type and attenuated RVV strains, with significant implications for vaccine development.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that RVV strain MP12 infects and replicates in C57/6 mice without disease, while wild-type Z501 is highly pathogenic and causes innate response. The 11 amino differences between MP12 and Z548, and high homology between Z501 Z548, highlight the impressive differences in host response. These findings have significant implications for understanding RVV pathogenesis and vaccine development, particularly in non-endemic regions.

**Title:** Therapeutic Resistance in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC): Unveiling the Role of C Motif Chemokine Ligand 20 (C20) in Taxane Chemoresistance

**Research Question:** The mechanisms of taxane chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have not been well elucidated, hindering the improvement of patient survival. We investigated the role of C motif chemokine ligand 20 (C20) in taxane chemoresistance in TNBC.

**Methods:** We analyzed the expression of C20 in breast cancer patients undergoing tax-containing chemotherapy with non-pathologic complete response and explored its effects on breast cancer stem cells (BCs) and chemoresistance.

**Findings:** C20 was significantly elevated in tax-containing breast cancer patients with non-pathologic response. C20 promoted self-renew and maintenance of BCs through activation of protein Cζ (PK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP)mediated p65 factor B (NF) pathway, increasing tax resistance of BCs. Moreover, C20 increased ATP-binding subfamily member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug 1 (DR) expression, leading to extracellular efflux of taxane.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that chemotherapy-induced C20 mediated chemores via upregulation of AB1. Additionally, NF activation increased C20 expression, forming a positive feedback loop between NF and C pathways, sustaining chemores in cancer cells.

**Conclusions:** C20 can be a predictive marker for taxane response, and blockade of C or its pathway may reverse tax resistance in breast cancer. Our studies offer a novel strategy to improve chemotherapeutic efficacy in TNBC by combining tax treatment with adjuvant pharmacological inhibition of AB1.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Toxoplas gondii Effector Protein Transport Across the Parasitophorous Vacuole Membrane

**Research Question:** How do Toxoplas gond effector proteins, specifically GRA16 and GRA24, traverse the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PV) into the host cells, and what proteins facilitate this process?

**Methods:** To address this question, we screened Tooplas mutants defective in cyc-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 into the host. We identified novel proteins, MYR2 and MY3, which play a crucial role in the translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host.

**Findings:** MY2 and MY3 are secreted into the PV and co-localize with PV membranes MY1. Consistent with predicted transmembrane domains, all proteins are membrane-associated, with MY3 stably associating with MY1's N- and C-terminal fragments via disulfide linkage. Intrinsically disordered effectors fused to a DH domain block transport, consistent with a translo-based model of effector transport.

**Implications:** These findings reveal a complex at the PV essential for effector translocation into the host. MY2 and MY3 are novel components of this machinery, and their interaction with MY1 is critical for effector transport.

**Conclusions:**

Tooplas gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, infects virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blood animals. Its ability to infect and manipulate host cells depends on effector proteins secreted from unique organelles called dense granules. GRA proteins have diverse roles in Tooplas intracellular lifecycle, including hijacking host functions like cell cycle and MAP kinase. Some GRAs, such as GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into the parasoph vacuole (PV) and transported across the PV membrane (PVM) into host, but the process is not well understood. We previously showed TMY1, cleaved by TASP into fragments, localizes PVM and is essential for GRA transport into host. Here, we identify MY2 and MY3 as novel proteins necessary for effector transport. MY and MY are secreted PV and co-localize with PVM. Consistent predicted transmembrane domains, all proteins are membrane-associated, with MY3 stably associating MY1's N and C-terminal via disulfide. Intrins dis effectors fused DH domain block transport, consistent translo model effector. These results reveal complex PV essential effector translocation host.

**Title:** The Role of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) in Papillomavirus (PV) Replication: A Novel Insights into the Regulation of Viral Genome Amplification

**Research Question:** What is the role of the Origin Recognition Complex (OR) in the replication of Papillomavirus (PV), a double-stranded DNA virus that resembles a mini-chromosome in infected cells?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between PV E2 protein and ORC, a pre-replication complex (pre-RC) factor, and its involvement in viral replication stages: initial amplification, cell cycle maintenance, and differentiation.

**Findings:** We found that PV and bovine PV-1 E2 proteins bind to OR2, however, OR2 was not detected at the viral origin. Depletion of OR2 enhanced replication in transient model and keratinocytes maintaining viralomes, while no effect on copy number in cell with integrated genomes. Occupancy of E and E at viral increased following OR2 silencing.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that OR2 is not necessary for activation of PV by E and E but suppresses E replicative function. We also observed that over-expression of HPV2 decreased OR2 occupation at mammalian origins, suggesting E restricts pre-OR assembly that otherwise compete host complexes for viral amplification.

**Conclusions:** We infer that OR2 complex with E restricts replication in maintenance phase of viral program and elevated E levels during differentiation subvert OR loading and DNA synthesis at cellular origins.

**Key Findings:**

* PV and BP-1 E proteins bind to OR2
* OR2 not detected at viral origin
* Depletion OR2 enhances replication in transient model and keratinocytes maintaining viralomes
* No effect on copy number in cell with integrated genomes
 Occupancy E and E increased following OR2 silencing
 Over-expression HPV2 decreases OR2 at mammalian origins

**Title:** Detection of Brucella DNA in Bovine Milk in Urban and Periurban Areas of Dushbe, Tajikistan: Implications for Zoonotic Disease Control and Surveillance

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the presence of Bruc DNA in bovine milk in urban and periurban areas of Dush, Tajik, a region known hotspot for bruclos, and assess its implications for zoonotic disease control and surveillance.

**Methods:** A total of 570 cow milk samples were collected from 326 herds in 21 villages, with GPS coordinates recorded. DNA was extracted from 564 samples, and Bruc DNA detected using IS-based real-time PCR. Sequence analysis of the rB gene was performed to identify Bruc species.

**Findings:** Bruc DNA was detected in 10.3% of 564 milk samples, with 100% of seropositive cows and 8.3% seronegative cows positive. Sequence analysis revealed one cow infected with B. abortus and another likely infected with B. melensis. Discrepancies between serology and real-time PCR highlight need for complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false negatives in Bruc surveillance and control.

**Implications:** Consumption of unpasteurified dairy products is common in the region, increasing risk of Br transmission. Vaccination of cattle with S19 and small ruminants Rev1 may be needed to control Bruc infections. Further research on Bruc isolation required for comprehensive understanding Bruc spp. circulating in livestock.

**Conclusions:** This study shows widespread Bruc DNA in bovine milk U area Dush, highlighting need for zoon disease control and surveillance. Results suggest one cow infected B. abort and another likely B. melensis. Bruc DNA detected in both seropitive and serative cows, indicating need for complementary diagnostic strategies. Vaccination of cattle and small ruminants may be necessary to control Bruc. Further research on Bruc isolation required for comprehensive understanding Br spp.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Heterochromatin in Genome Stability in the Pathogenic Fungus Zoseptoria trici: A Study of Histone Methyltransferases KMT1 and K6

**Research Question:** What is the role of heterochromatin in maintaining genome stability in the pathogenic fungus Zoseptoria trici, and how do histone methyltransferases KMT1 and K6 contribute to this process?

**Methods:** We generated mutants of histone methyltransferases K1 (KMT1) and K6 (K6) in Z. trici, responsible for trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (HK9) and lysine 27 (27) (HK27), respectively, and analyzed their impact on genome and chromatin structure, gene expression, and stability in vitro and in planta using whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq.

**Findings:** Deletion of HK9 resulted in dramatic chromatin reorganization, with HK27 relocalized to regions enriched in HK9 in wild-type, accompanied by genome rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes, and activation of transposable elements. In contrast, loss of HK27 increased stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions, without large changes in gene expression.

**Implications:** HK9 is crucial for maintaining genome stability by preventing HK27 in constitutive heterochrom, while HK27 reduces overall stability, generating a metastable state for quasi-essential regions of the genome.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide a basis for future studies on influence of heterochatin on structural rearrangements using Z. trici as a model. Unlike HK9, absence of HK27 is linked to genome instability, surprisingly, loss does not result in overt phenotypic changes or transcriptional activation in Z. trici.

**Summary:** Accessory chromosomes in fungi differ from core by higher repeat and lower gene density, show transcriptional silencing due to heterromatic structure with HK27 enrichment and HK9 on repetitive sequences. Centromeres and telomeres are structural components. Presence of K1 and HK9 is essential for genome integrity, TE rearrangements may drive genetic variability in Z. trici isolates and evolution in species.

**Title:** Enhancing Accessibility and Affordability of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for Rabies Vaccination: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Intradermal (ID) Administration

**Research Question:** Can switching from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration of post-exposure prophylaxis (PE) rabies vaccination improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, leading to a reduction in human rabies deaths and cost-effectiveness for healthcare providers?

**Methods:** We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of different PEP regimens, evaluating their relative costs and benefits for victims and healthcare providers. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of dollars per rabies death averted, considering direct medical costs from the healthcare provider's perspective.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed that P vaccination is an extremely cost-effective intervention, with a cost-effectiveness of less than $60 per death averted. Switching from IM to ID administration resulted in significant savings in vaccine volume required to treat the same number of patients, mitigating shortages and reducing costs. We found ID delivery to be more cost-effective than IM in terms of averting rabies and saving lives, especially under realistic constraints such as poor compliance.

**Implications:** A universal switch to ID delivery would improve affordability and accessibility of P for bite victims, leading to likely reduction in rabies deaths and cost-effectiveness for healthcare providers. We propose financing mechanisms to make P more accessible, subsidize costs for those in need, and support existing rabies prevention programs.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the need to prioritize increasing accessibility, reducing costs, and delays in delivery of P, particularly for the poorest sectors most at risk and burdened by rabies. We conclude that a switch to ID administration would improve affordability and accessibility of P, leading to reduction in human rabies and cost-effectiveness for healthcare providers.

**Title:** Toxoplas Exploits Host Lipid Droplets for Intracellular Replication and Survival

**Research Question:** How does Tooplas, an obligate intracellular parasite, exploit host lipid droplets (LD) for nutrient acquisition and replication within parasitophorous vacuoles (PV)?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between Tooplas and LD in mammalian host cells, focusing on LD biogenesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid catabolism, and the role of intravacolar network (IV) in lipid uptake.

**Findings:**

1. Tooplas replication is reduced in host cells depleted of LD or impaired in lipolysis/fatty acidolysis.
2. Infected cells exhibit increased LD numbers and expression of LD-associated genes (ADP, DG2).
3. PV are surrounded by LD throughout infection.
4. Toop accesses lipids from LD and incorporates them into its membranes and LD.
5. Exogenous oleic acid stimulates LDogenesis, leading to accumulation of neutral lipids in large LD inside parasite.
6. To intercepts and internalizes LD within PV, some associated with Rab7, wrapped by IV.
7. Mutant parasites in IV formation display diminished lipid uptake from LD.
8. Parasites lacking IV-localized phospholipase 2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from LD in PV.

**Implications:**

* Toop relies on host LD for intracellular development and scavenging neutral lipids from LD.
* IV plays a major role in host processing LD in PV and lipid release.
* To has endocytic structures containing lipid material from PV lumen.

**Conclusions:**

This study highlights Toop's reliance on host LD for intracellular development and its capability to scavenge neutral lipids from LD. The mechanism of delivery of lipids from LD to PV and parasite awaits further investigation. Exogenous addition of oleic acid reveals Toop's ability to salvage lipids from host compartments, including LD. The sensitivity to inhibition of host lipolytic enzymes suggests Toop takes advantage of host lipolytic activity and fatty acid-oxidation in mitochondria. Redistribution of LD to PV suggests Toop takes advantage of host LD stores and metabolic properties.

**Title:** Identification of Novel Chalcone Inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica Cysteine Proteases as Potential Therapeutic Agents against Fasciolosis

**Background:** Fasciolosis, a zoonotic disease caused by the liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, has emerged as a significant public health concern due to increasing human infections. Chemotherapy is the primary control measure, with tricendazole being the preferred drug of choice, but resistance has been reported in several countries, necessitating the search for new chemical entities and molecules to control fluke infections.

**Research Question:** We investigated a library of flavonoids for inhibitors of key Fasciola hepatica cystine proteases (FCL3 and F1) to identify novel therapeutic agents against fasciolosis.

**Methods:** We screened 39 synthetic flavonoids from our library, including chalcones with phenyl and naphthyl groups, flavones, and natural flavon quercetin for inhibitory activity against F3 and F1. One compound, C34, emerged as a potent inhibitor of juvenile F3 with an IC50 of 5.6 μM.

**Findings:** C34 is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the C-H catalytic dyad and S2 S3 pocket residues, determinants of substrate specificity of cystine proteases. Interestingly, C induces a reduction in the ability to migrate through the gut and loss of motility leading to death in vitro, while non-toxic to bovine cells.

**Implications:** These findings open avenues for development of novel agents to control fluke infection and other helminthic diseases. Chalcones are novel inhibitors of main catheins secreted by juvenile and adult flukes, with one compound C highly active against the enzyme reducing larval ability to penetrate the gut and decreasing viability in vitro.

**Conclusions:** This study identified chalcone inhibitors of Fasciola catheps with fasciolic activity, contributing to the design of novel drugs to control fluke infection. Flavonoids have been reported to inhibit cystine protease enzymes, but this is the first report of in vitro screening non-peptid inhibitors of Fasc catheps or synthetic chalcon with fascolic activity.

**Title:** Deciphering the Dynamics of Visual Signal Transmission in the Retina: Unveiling the Role of Presynaptic Compartments in Temporal Filtering and Adaptation**

**Research Question:** How do bipolar cells in the retina transmit information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate pathways, and what role do presynaptic compartments play in this process?

**Methods:** We employed in vivo imaging and electrophysiology to investigate how bipolar cells transmit signals to the inner retina. We found that the volume of the presynaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to temporal filtering, with smaller terminals generating faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher gain, followed by profound adaptation. Smaller terminals transmitted higher frequencies more effectively.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments directly contribute to differences in response dynamics. Presynaptic calcium signal was strongly rectifying of light intensity, causing graded increase with contrast. Voltage-dependent calcium channels in terminals were responsible for non-linear transformation of the signal. Smaller terminals responded to step light with higher release rates, but resolution was too low to detect modulations > 1 Hz. Synaptic output showed rectification due to increase in variance with stimulus.

**Implications:** These findings reveal how one neuron can transmit different temporal components of the signal through terminals with varying geometries and adaptational properties. Presaptic compartments play a crucial role in filtering the output from the synapse.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of presaptic compartments in temporal filtering and adaptation in visual signal transmission. Smaller terminals are more effective at transmitting higher frequencies, while larger terminals are more effective at lower frequencies. These results have implications for understanding neural processing in the retina and visual pathway.

**Title:** High-Throughput Structural and Molecular Profiling of Synaptic Populations: A Novel Probabilistic Synapse Detection Method for Multiplex Fluorescence Microscopy Images

**Research Question:** How can we develop a reliable and efficient method for detecting and analyzing individual synapses from multiplex fluorescence microscopy (FM) images, a crucial for understanding the vast synaptic networks of the brain?

**Methods:** We employed a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detecting synapses from multiplex FM image data, utilizing conjugate array tomography (AT) datasets, which provide voxel-conjugate FM and electron microscopy (EM) annotated images of the same synapses. Our probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as queries and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents a synapse.

**Findings:** We evaluated our method by comparing it to EM-annotated data and examining its capacity to reproduce known features of cortical syn distributions. Results show that our algorithm detects synapses from FM data as accurately as human annotators seeing only FM, and reproduces architectural features of cortical syn distributions. This opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and density.

**Implications:** Our probabilistic synapse detector will be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images where EM-validation is impractical. Reliable high-through methods for large-scale syn detection will help analyze images containing neural arbors, discerning relationships between synapses and parent neurons.

**Conclusions:** We introduce a novel image analysis method for automated detection and measurement of individual synapses and single-syn molecular profiling of syn populations from multiplex FM data. Our probabilistic synapse detector addresses challenges of detecting synapses in immunofluorescence images and has closest precedent in probabil detectors for Focused Ion Scanning Electron Microscope (FSEM) images. Single-syn profiling diverse populations poses formidable challenges; our method may be useful for widely available confocal and super FM images.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of ZnT, a Proton-Coupled Zinc Transporter Responsible for Vesicular Zinc Accumulation and Secretion during Lactation

**Research Question:** What is the mechanism of action of ZnT, a proton-coupled zinc transporter responsible for vesicular accumulation and secretion of zinc during lactation?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of computational modeling and experimental approaches to investigate the mechanism of ZnT. We used functional transport assays to demonstrate that ZnT is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. Bafilomycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase, abolished ZnT-dependent transport into intracellular vesicles. Additionally, we used Lyso Red and Ly-pfluorin to show that transient overexpression of ZnT in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc resulted in vesicular alkalization due to proton-zinc antiport, which was reversed in the presence of TP, a specific chelator. Computational calculations revealed that Zn functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2+/Zn+.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that ZnT is a proton-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm.

**Implications:** This study provides new insights into the mechanism of Zn, a crucial for physiological processes including nucleic acid metabolism, regulation, gene expression, signal transduction, cell division, immune and nervous functions, wound healing, and apoptosis. Impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupts cellular functions leading to various pathologies. Understanding the mechanism of Zn is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to address zinc-related disorders.

**Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that Zn is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter responsible for vesicular accumulation and secretion of zinc during lactation. Computational and experimental evidence support a stoichiometry of 2+/n for Zn. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of Zn, a vital for various physiological processes and highlights the importance of maintaining zinc homeostasis.

**Title:** 14-3 Proteins Regulate Replication Fork Stability and Progression through Exonuclease 1 Phosphorylation and Interaction

**Research Question:** How do 14-3 proteins regulate replication fork stability and progression in response to DNA stress?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between 14-3 proteins and Exonuclease 1 (Exo) in yeast and mammalian cells using co-immunoprecipitation and bi-dimensional electrophoresis. We also examined the effects of 14-3 deficiency on replication fork stability and checkpoint activation in yeast cells treated with hydroxyurea (HU).

**Findings:** 14-3 proteins interact with Exo in both yeast and mammalian cells and regulate its phosphorylation status. 14-3-deficient cells accumulate Exo-dependent single-strand gaps at stalled forks, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects. Under limiting nucleotide conditions, 14-3 proteins promote fork progression. We propose that 14-3 assist in controlling Exo phosphorylation and additional targets, promoting fork stability and restart in response to DNA stress.

**Implications:** 14-3 proteins play a central role in regulating Exo activity and fork stability in response to replication stress, acting as a platform for Ex phosphorylation control. This study sheds light on processes at stalled forks, proposing 14-3 as integrators of signals regulating fork stability and processing. Future challenges include identifying replisome components and 14-3 targets, as well as elucidating 14-3 modulation of Exo phosphorylation activity.

**Conclusions:** 14-3 proteins regulate replication fork stability and progression through Exo phosphorylation and interaction. Their deficiency leads to accumulation of ssDNA gaps, persistent checkpoint activation, and recovery. Under limiting nucleotide conditions, 14-3 promote fork progression. We propose 14-3 assist in controlling Ex phosphorylation and additional targets, promoting fork stability and restart in response to DNA stress.

**Title:** The Role of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells in HIV-1 Infection and Pathogenesis: A Novel Insights from a Humanized Mouse Model

**Research Question:** The role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis remains unclear. We investigated the role of pDC in HIV-1 infection using a humanized mouse model.

**Methods:** We developed a monoclonal antibody (15B) that specifically depletes humanDC in lymphoid organs in humanized mice. p were depleted prior to HIV-1 infection with either a highly pathogenic CCR5/CX4-tropic HIV-1 or standard C5-tropic HIV-1 isolate.

**Findings:** Depletion of p abolished IF-I and interferon-stimulated gene (IS) induction during acute HIV-1 infection. Consistent with anti-viral role of IF-I, HIV-1 replication was upregulated in p-depleted mice. Cell death induced by highly pathogenic HIV-1 was reduced in p-de mice. During chronic HIV-1, depletion p also reduced IF-I and IS induction, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-induced cell death in lymphoid organs was reduced despite increased replication.

**Implications:** p play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and promoting HIV-induced immunopathogenesis. These findings suggest p-depletion and IF-I blockade as novel strategies for treating HIV-1 non-responsive patients with persistent activation despite antiretrov treatment.

**Conclusion:** Our study highlights the critical role of p in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis. p produce IF-I to inhibit HIV-1 replication, but enhance HIV-induced cell death of leukocytes, including CD T cells. These findings have implications for understanding HIV pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutic strategies.

**Title:** Sulforaphane (SF) Inhibits HIV Infection in Macrophages through Nuclear Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2) Activation

**Research Question:** Does Sulforane (SF) inhibit HIV infection in primary macrophages through the activation of nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)?

**Methods:** We investigated the impact of SF on HIV infection in primary macrophages and other cell lines using luciferase reporter assays and siRNA-mediated depletion of N2.

**Findings:** SF blocks HIV infection in primary macroph but not in primary T cells. SF blocks infection in P-differentiated promocytic lines but not in other lines. siRNA depletion of N2 boosted HIV infectivity in primary macroph and reduced anti-viral effects of SF treatment.

**Implications:** Our results support a model in which anti-viral activity is mediated through N2 mobilized by SF. SF treatment blocks infection after reverse transcription but before 2-L circle formation, similar to type I interferon-induced proteins SAM1 and MX. However, neither SAM nor MX were upregulated.

**Conclusions:** This study shows for the first time that N2 can potently block HIV infection and highlights a novel way to trigger inhibition. SF, acting through N2, triggers a strong block against HIV in myel-derived cells, including macroph, but not primary cells. In the absence of SF, depletion of N2 caused a significant increase in lucifer activity, indicating N2 is detrimental to HIV in macro and the basal level of N2 present in macro is sufficient for some anti-v activity. Cells transfected with non-targeting siRNA, SF significantly reduced lucifer activity, confirming SF triggers a block to HIV of macro.

**Title:** Prevalence and Risk Factors of Geohmin Infections among Pregnant Women in Rural Western Kenya: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Survey

**Research Question:** What is the prevalence and risk of geohmin infections among pregnant women in rural Kenya, and what are the associated factors and effects on symptoms, anemia, nutritional status, and malaria?

**Methods:** A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among pregnant women in rural western Kenya. Participants provided blood and fecal samples, hemoglobin was measured, and blood slides examined for malaria. Geohmin infections were identified using the Kato-Katz method.

**Findings:** Among 390 participants, 76.2% were infected with at least one geohmin, 52.3% with Ascaris lumicoid, 39.5 with hookworm, and 29.0 with Trichuris trura. Infection with at least geohmin was associated with unprotected water source (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3) and lack of water treatment (OR 1.8, 95 CI 1.1-3). Geohmin infections were not associated with symptoms or body mass index. Hook infection was associated with lower upper arm circumference (adjusted decrease 0.7 cm, 95 CI 0.3-1.2). Hook infections with egg count ≥100/gram were associated lower hemoglobin (adjusted decrease 1.5 g/dl, 95 CI0.3-2.7). Among gravid 2 and 3, with A lumicoid were less likely have malaria (OR 0.4, 95 CI 0.2-0.8) compared to without A lumoid.

**Implications:** Geoh infections are common in this population, but few detrimental effects observed. Routine antihelmin treatment during antenatal visit recommended, but evaluation of impact on pregnancy, malaria, and outcome useful.

**Conclusion:** Geoh infections are a global health burden, with 3.8 billion infected, 720 clinical cases, and 135,000 deaths attributed annually. In pregnancy associated with iron deficiency, anemia, impaired status, decreased birth weight, intrauterine retardation, and outcomes. Interaction between geoh, particularly A lumoid, and asymptomatic malaria in pregnancy unclear.

**Title:** Mycolone, a Macrolide Produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, Suppresses Inflammatory Responses of Sensory Neurons, Schwann Cells, and Microglia: Implications for Analgesia and Neuroinflammation

**Research Question:** Does mycolone, a macrol produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, affect the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia involved in pain perception and transmission and maintenance, and modulate neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain?

**Methods:** We investigated the cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects of mycolone on isolated sensory neurons, Schw cells, and microia from mice in vitro, and its effects on neuroinflamm in a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve.

**Findings:** Prolonged (>48h) exposure to myone induced cell death at concentrations >10ng/ml, while nanomolar concentrations suppressed production of pro-inflammatory mediators without affecting viability. Notably, myone prevented pro-inflammatory polarization of microia, which contribute to neuroinflamm. In vivo, myone injected in the spinal canal decreased local production of inflammatory cytokines without detectable cytotoxicity.

**Implications:** This study provides in vitro and vivo evidence that myone suppresses inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schw cells, and microia without affecting viability. Together with previous studies using peripheral leukocytes, our work suggests myone-mediated analgesia may be partially explained by anti-inflammatory properties.

**Conclusion:** Myone, a macide produced by Myacterium ulcerans, suppresses inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schw cells, and microia involved in pain perception and transmission, and modulates neuroflamm associated with chronic pain. Our findings support the hypothesis that myone-mediated analgesia is, at least partially, due to its anti-inflammatory effects.

**Title:** Investigating the Association between Genetic Polymorphisms and Clinical Outcomes of Human African Trypanosomiasis in West Africa

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms and clinical outcomes of African Trypanosomias (AT), a lethal disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambense, in human populations from West Africa.

**Methods:** A total of 425 individuals, comprising 232 AT cases, 79 subjects with long-term positive serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls, were sampled from three AT foci in Guinea. Genotypes of 28 SNPs in eight genes passed quality control were used for association analysis.

**Findings:** Our results showed that IL6 rs1819 allele (p = 0.001, OR = 0.39, CI [0.24-0.63], BF = 0.003) was associated with lower risk of progressing from latent to active disease, while MIF36071 allele (p = 0.023, OR 1.65, CI [1.07-2.53], BF 0.669) was associated with increased risk, but not significant after Bonferr correction. MIF12459 allele (p = 0.007, OR 1.86, CI [1.18-2.95], BF 0.215) was associated with latent infections. We confirmed earlier observations that AP1G2 allele DEL (p = 0.001, OR 2.70, CI [1.49-4.91], BF 0.030) was associated with higher risk and AP1 polymorphism (p = 0.000, OR 0.45, CI [0.29-0.70], BF 0.012) with lower risk of developing AT. No associations were found with other candidate genes.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that host genes modulate Tryosoma bruce gambense infection in infected individuals from Guinea, with IL1819 being associated with lower risk of progressing to AT. These results enhance understanding of host-parasite interactions and may lead to development of new control tools.

**Conclusion:** This study is part of Tryo project to investigate genetic basis of susceptibility to trypaniasis and samples archived in Tryo Biobank CDES for approval from Guinea ethics committee (1-22/2013). Study carried out in three AToci (Dubka, Boff, Foreiah) in mangrove areas Guinea.

**Title:** Unveiling the Genetic Diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore through Whole-Genome Sequencing: Insights from the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP)

**Research Question:** What is the genetic structure and diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore, and how does it compare to other Asian populations?

**Methods:** We conducted whole-genome sequencing of 38 individuals from the Singapore Indian population with a target coverage of 30X as part of the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP). We compared the genetic diversity of these samples against samples from the Sequencing Malay Project and Phase 1 of the 1,000 Genomes Project.

**Findings:** Our results show that SSIP exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and higher heterozygous-homozygous genotype ratio than other Asian populations. When compared to a panel of well-defined Indians, the genetic makeup of SS samples was closely related to South Indians. However, SS samples clustered distinctly from Europeans in global structure analysis with autosomal SNPs, and were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans with higher European admixture. Analysis of relatedness between SS and archaic humans (Denisovan, Neander) revealed higher ancient admixture in East populations than SS.

**Implications:** This study provides a valuable resource for understanding the genetic diversity of Asian in Singapore, complementing existing data from Southeast Malays and 1,092 samples from Phase 1 of the 1,000 Genomes Project. Our findings highlight the genetic heterogeneity of Indians from northern India and homogeneity of those from southern regions. Independent analysis with Gujarati Indians from the Genome Variation Project showed a third cluster with Singapore Indians. The SSIP aims to provide insights into the structure and diversity of Asian in Singapore.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the genetic diversity of Asian in Singapore through whole-genome sequencing, providing a valuable resource for the scientific community. Our results show that SS exhibits greater genetic diversity and higher heterozygosity than other Asian populations, and is closely related to South Indians. However, distinct from Europeans in autosomal SNPs and with higher European admixture. Analysis with archaic humans reveals ancient admixture in East populations.

**Title:** Investigating the Molecular Mechanisms of Aminoglycoside Susceptibility in Burkholderia pseudalle Strains 708, 218a, and 379a

**Research Question:** We aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying aminogcoside susceptibility in Burkholderia pseudalle strains 708, 218a, and 379a, which exhibit intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides.

**Methods:** We employed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) to investigate the expression of amr transcripts in these strains. Serial passage on increasing gentamicin concentrations yielded mutants of 218 and 379a that became resistant to other aminlycosides and macides, whereas mutants could not be obtained with 708. Transcript analysis revealed that resistance in 218 and 379 was due to upregulation of amr-opA expression by unknown mechanisms. PCR walking strategy revealed the amr-opA operon was missing in 708, associated with a deletion of more than 70 kb genetic material. Rescue of the amr-opB region from a 708 fosmid library and sequencing showed a large chromosome deletion (131-141 kb) compared to K43 and 10.

**Findings:** The deletion removed amr-opA operon and entire clusters for malleactin and cobal synthesis genes, as well as anaerobic arginine deiminase, putative type 1 fimbria, and secreted chitinase genes. Whole-genome sequencing and PCR confirmed absence of these genes in 708. Despite missing putative virulence genes, 708 was fully virulent in murine meloid model.

**Implications:** Strain 708 may be a candidate for genetic manipulation experiments using Agent compliant antibiotics, validating the use of laboratory-constructed Δamr-opA mutants in experiments.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the molecular mechanisms of amincosusceptibility in B. pseudalle strains 708, 218, and 379. The absence of amr-op operon in 708 and reduced expression in 218 and 379 resulted in amincosusceptibility to aminlycos and macides. The deletion of am-op operon in 708 removed entire clusters for mallein and cobal synthesis, as well as anaobic arginine deaminase, type 1 fimbria, and secret chitin genes. Despite missing virulence genes, 708 was fully virulent in murine model.

**Title:** Deciphering the Interplay between Extracellular Cytokines and Intracellular Transcription Factors in CD4 T Helper Cell Differentiation

**Research Question:** How do extracellular cytokines and intracellular transcription factors interact to drive the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into Th1 and Th2 lineages?

**Methods:** We investigated the early differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th1 and Th2 states using single-cell transcriptomics and immunofluorescence analysis. Contrary to mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, we observed ubiquitous co-expression of Tbet and Gata in individual cells at high levels distinct from basal co-expression during priming. Cytokines were expressed in a small subpopulation of cells, independent of transcription factor expression in these cells. Cell-to-cell variation in cytokine expression during the early phase of T cell differentiation was larger than in the fully differentiated state.

**Findings:** Inhibition of cytok signaling led to mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors, revealing an intracellular network overruled by strong extracellular signals. Our results suggest that CD T cells acquire a mixed Th1/2 state instructed by extracellular cytokines. The interplay between extracellular and intracellular components in Th2 differentiation may be a strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.

**Implications:** This study delineates the interplay between extracellular cytokines and intracellular transcription in single cells using CD4 T cells as a model. Contrary to previous studies where fate was artificially biased, we explored spontaneous differentiation in the absence of exogenously added cytokines. Our results postulate that transcription may be responsible for deconding cytok during activation CD cells. Insights shed light on the interplay extracellular and intracellular on fate of single cells. Mixed phenotypes were also observed by other groups using different approaches.

**Conclusions:** Early CD T cell differentiation lacks mutual exclusivity not only Tbet and Gata, but also Foxp and Rγ. Ubiquitous T and Gata co-expression must be associated with Th and Th produced CD cells upon activation, since cytok were not supplied exogen. We investigated expression in CD cells. Revisiting the network governing Th2 during CD differentiation, If is transcribed in rare cells independently T and Gata levels, induction If by T and repression by G can be neglected early stages, similar applies Il4.

**Title:** PAQR-2, a Transmembrane Receptor, Regulates Fatty Acid Metabolism and Membrane Fluidity during Cold Adaptation in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How does PAQR-2, a transmembrane receptor, regulate fatty acid metabolism and membrane fluidity during cold adaptation in Caenorhabditis elegans?

**Methods:** We screened for novel PAQR-2 suppressors and identified mutations in genes involved in phosphatidcholine synthesis (cpt-1, pt-1, s-1) and fatty acid metabolism (ech-7, hac-1, m-15, n-49, sb-1). We investigated the genetic relationship between PAQR-2, phosphidcholines, sb-1, and Δ-desatases in regulating membrane fluidity at low temperatures.

**Findings:** PA-2, phosphidchines, sb-1, and Δ-desases form a regulatory pathway that increases unsaturated fatty acids necessary for membrane fluidity at low temperatures. PA-2 suppressors normalize saturated fatty acid levels, and low detergent concentrations that increase fluidity rescue PA-2 mutant.

**Implications:** PA-2, a transmembrane receptor, regulates fatty acid metabolism and membrane fluidity during cold adaptation in Caenorhabis elegans. PA- dependent increase in unsaturated fatty acids is essential for adaptation to 15°C. Our findings conflict with Murray et al. PA-2 is important for metabolic regulation, PA-2 mutant shows abnormal fatty acid composition, excess lipid droplets with PA-1 mutation, and synthetic lethal with loss-of-function mutations in sb- and n-49, homologs of SRE and H.

**Conclusions:** PA-2, transmembrane receptor, regulates fatty acid metabolism and membrane fluid during cold adaptation in Caenorhabis elegans. PA- dependent increase in unsaturated fatty acids is essential for adaptation to 15°C. Our findings suggest PA-2 is a transmembrane protein regulating Δ-des during cold via modulation PC, sb- levels.

**Title:** Unveiling a Hidden Feature of the Herpesvirus Genome Packaging Machinery: A Cryo-Electron Microscopy Reveals a Portal-Vertex Connection in Herpes Simplex-1 Virions

**Research Question:** Despite extensive research on herpesviruses, the mechanisms of genome packaging and release in these complex, double-stranded DNA viruses remain poorly understood. Tailed bacteriophages, sharing a common evolutionary origin with herpesviruses, exhibit a well-characterized genome release machinery involving a portal and a tail apparatus at the vertex. We investigated the structure of human herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1) virions using cryo-electron microscopy to identify a previously unknown feature at the vertex.

**Methods:** Cryo-electron microscopy was employed to visualize HSV-1 virions, revealing an unsuspected feature extending from the portal across the tegument, connecting the capsid to the viral membrane.

**Findings:** The HSV-1 portal occupies a similar position and subunit organization as tailed bacterophages, suggesting equivalent machinery may be present in herpesviruses. This feature, analogous to tailed bacterophages, may mediate interactions between the vertex and cellular components at key points in the viral life cycle.

**Implications:** The discovery of a portal-vertex connection in HSV-1 virions has significant implications for understanding genome release into the nucleus and virion architecture. Human herpesviruses cause a range of diseases, including cold sores, chickenpox, congenital defects, and cancer. HSV-1, a well-characterized virus, comprises a ∼200 MD icosahedral caps containing dsDNA, surrounded by tegument and glycoprotein envelope. The lack of evidence for a tail-like structure in herpesvirions suggested an unnecessary in eukaryotic cell environment. However, DNA delivery by herpesviruses may be analogous to tailed bacterophages.

**Conclusions:** The portal-vertex connection in HSV-1 virions, analogous to tailed bacteroph, may play a crucial role in genome release into the nucleus and virion architecture. Further research is needed to elucidate the function and significance of this feature in the herpesvirus life cycle.

**Title:** Parasitic Helminths Evade and Dampen Human Immune Responses: Implications for HIV-1 Transmission and Disease Progression**

**Research Question:** This study investigates the effects of soluble egg antigen (SEA) from Schistosoma mansoni on modulating HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro, and its potential consequences for HIV-1 transmission and disease progression.

**Methods:** We analyzed the binding of SEA to DC-SIGN and its impact on DC-mediated HIV-1 transfection, as well as the effects of SEA-exposed DCs on T-cell populations' susceptibility to HIV-1 infection. DCs were matured under Th2, Th1, or Th1/Th2 conditions and co-cultured with naïve T-cells to assess T-cell responses.

**Findings:**

* SEA, specifically kappa-5, potently binds to DCIGN and blocks DC-mediated HIV-1 transfection (p < 0.05).
* DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th2 conditions induce T-cells that are less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection (p < 0.05) compared to unexposed DCs, whereas HIV-1 X infection is unaffected.
* T-cells induced by SEA-exposed DC demonstrate reduced capacity to produce IF-γ and M-β.
* Infection of T-cells with HIV-1 R is not associated with down-modulation of CCR5 surface expression.
* DCs matured under Thmix exposed to recombinant ω-1 (r-1) induce T-cells that are less susceptible to HIV-1 R (p 0.05) but not X infection, associated with reduced IF-γ and M-β, and CCR expression.

**Implications:**

* Parasitic helminth infections may modulate HIV-1 infectivity, potentially influencing disease course in co-infected individuals.
* SEA and r-1 can modulate HIV-1 infectivity through multiple mechanisms.
* These findings suggest helminthic infections may be beneficial considering HIV-1.
* Deciphering mechanisms may provide means to modulate immune responses beneficial for limiting transmission or reducing viral loads.
* Results should be considered in the context of HIV-1 trials in regions where S. mansoni is endemic.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that SEA and r-1 can modulate HIV-1 infectivity through multiple mechanisms, influencing disease course in coinfected individuals. These findings highlight the potential benefits of helminthic infections for HIV-1 and the need to consider them in vaccine trials.

**Title:** Modeling the Mechanisms of Extracellular Space (ECS) Shrinkage in Response to Neuronal Stimulation

**Research Question:** What are the underlying mechanisms responsible for the ∼30% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and astrocytes in grey and white matter under experimental conditions?

**Methods:** We developed a dynamic model that accounts for experimental data related to the shrink phenomenon in wild-type and gene knockout individuals, incorporating neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride, passive channels of the Na+/K+/P pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane.

**Findings:** Our model reveals that the release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride, passive channels of the Na+/K+/P pump, and osmotically transport of water through the astrocy membrane are sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage. However, taking into account ECS and astrocy ion concentrations in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of Na+/+/Cl- (NKCC) and Na+/HCO- (NBC) cotransporters are critical for achieving observed levels of ECS shrink.

**Implications:** The model provides a detailed framework to guide future experiments and pave the way for comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models in normal and pathophysiological situations.

**Conclusions:** Our model identifies the need for measuring ECS, membrane potential, and astrocy ion concentrations (potassium, sodium, and chloride) in wild as well as NK1-/- and A4/- individuals in baseline and excited conditions, and obtaining data on water, sodium, and chloride uptake during activation. The model assumes ECS shrink is due to redistribution of water and ions within neuronal, astrocy, and ECS compartments, disregarding effects such as spatial buffering where K+ ions entering ECS during activity are released glia at distant neurons quiet. Our ECS-glia system assumes shrink is accompanied by astrocy swelling, and no water exchange with neurons. Calculations show osm ECS does not change much during shrink, assuming Na and K flow in out of neuron approximately 1:1 during excitation, significant import water into neuron not likely.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of siRNA-Mediated Transcriptional Gene Silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana: A Role of SPTLTF and AGO in Chromatin Recruitment

**Research Question:** How do siRNAs, AGO, and chromatin modifying enzymes interact to silence gene expression in Arabidopsis thalian, and what is the role of SPTLTF in this process?

**Methods:** We employed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to investigate the interaction between SPTLTF, AGO, and chromatin in Arabidopsis thalian.

**Findings:** We found that SPTLTF, a silencing factor and homolog of elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcription silencing, downstream of RNAase V but independently of 24-nt siRNA. SPTL and AG4 are recruited to chrom in parallel and independently of each other. Binding of both AG4 and S5LTF is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications at several loci.

**Implications:** Our results propose that the coordinate binding of S5 and AG4 creates a platform for direct or indirect recruitment of chrom modifying enzymes to chromatin.

**Conclusions:** This study resolves the mechanism of siRNA recruitment of chrom modifying enzymes to chromatin and the function of S5 in this process. S5 is not required for AG4 recruitment to chrom, but enhances AG4 chrom binding. Alternatively, loci may be occupied by two pools of AG4, one S5-dependent and recruited independently of S5. We conclude that S5 is not required for recruitment of pool AG4 to chromatin and does not work upstream AG4 in siRNA-mediated silencing pathway.

**Title:** The Role of the Rpo Regulon in the Tick-Phase of Borrelia burgdorferi Enzoot Cycle: A Novel Insights into Lyme Disease Transmission

**Research Question:** What is the contribution of the Rpo regul to the tick-phase of the Borrelia burgorferi enoot cycle, and how does it impact Lyme disease transmission by nymphs?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of Rpo-dependent genes in larval and nymphal stages of Borrelia burgorferi using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and observed morphological changes in Rpo-deficient spiroes during nymph feeding. We also examined the role of Coenzyme disulf reductase in round body formation in vitro.

**Findings:** Our results show that Rpo is required for transmission of Lyme spiroes by nymphs, as R-deficient spes are confined to the midgut and transform into round bodies during the later stages of the blood meal. Round formation is reversible and appears to be attributable to reduced Coenzyme disulf reduct, which provides NAD+ for glycolysis. We also found that spiroes default to an R-independent program for round formation when transmission energetics are unfavorable.

**Implications:** This study establishes the importance of the R regul during the tick-phase of the enoot cycle, highlighting the need to define the spiro's transcriptome within ticks. Our findings reveal a novel role for RSB in physiological adaptations for tick-mamm transmission and a default survival mode (round formation) when spes are unable to produce energy for dissemination.

**Conclusions:** The R regul plays a crucial role in the tick-phase of the enoot cycle, enabling Lyme transmission by nymphs. R-deficient spes exhibit aberrant morphology, round bodies, which are reversible and linked to Co disulf reduct levels. Our data suggest a default R-independent program for round formation when transmission energetics are unfavorable. Further research is needed to delineate the spiro's transcriptome within ticks.

**Title:** Hierarchical Regulation of Stamen Development by Gibberellin (GA) and Jasmonate (JA) Signaling Pathways in Arabidopsis

**Research Question:** How do gibberin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) signaling pathways regulate stamen development in Arabidopsis, and what is the relationship between these two pathways?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of GA and JA in stamen development. We analyzed the expression of MYB genes, which are known to be involved in stamen development, in GA-deficient and JA-deficient mutants. We also examined the effect of exogenous application of GA and JA on the expression of MYB genes and stamen development in these mutants.

**Findings:** We found that MY21, MY24, and MY57 are GA-dependent st-enriched genes, and loss-of-function of DELL RGA and R2 restored the expression of these MY genes together with restoration of stamen growth in GA-deficient plants. Genetic analysis showed that myb21 my24 my57 triple mutant exhibited a short st phenotype leading to male sterility. Further studies demonstrated that GA suppress DELL to mobilize the expression of the JA biosynthesis gene D1, consistent with the observation that JA content in young buds of GA-deficient quadruple mutant ga3 gai r2 r1 is lower than WT. We conclude that GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MY21, MY24, and MY57.

**Implications:** Our results establish a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA in modulation of stamen development, with GA regulating JA biosynthesis as one of the prerequisites for normal st development in Arabidopsis. This study highlights the importance of cross-talk between hormone signaling pathways in plant development and provides new insights into the regulation of stamen development.

**Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that GA and JA signaling pathways interact to regulate stamen development, with GA promoting JA biosynthesis as a key step in this process. We also show that MY21, MY, and MY are necessary but not sufficient for GA-mediated floral development, indicating that other GA-regulated JA-independent factors are required for normal stamen development. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex regulation of stamen and highlights the importance of hormone interactions in plant development.

**Title:** Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1) Modulates Lifespan Extension in Caenorhabditis elegans through the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress Pathway

**Research Question:** Does hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (H-1) play a role in modulating lifespan extension in Caenorhabditis elegans, and if so, how does it interact with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of H-1 in modulating lifespan in C. elegans using a modified diet restriction (DR) method based on variation of bacterial concentrations on agar plates. We found that H-1 deficiency resulted in extended lifespan, overlapping with inhibition of RSK-1/S6 kinase, a key component of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway.

**Findings:** H- loss-of-function extended lifespan under nutrient-rich conditions but failed to show extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, increasing H- activity, diminished lifespan under DR. This was rescued by tissue-specific expression ofegl-9 in neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by H- was dependent on the ER stress regulator inos-requiring-1 (IRE-1) and associated with lower ER stress levels.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for H- in lifespan extension involving the IRE-ER pathway, suggesting that H acts downstream of the nutrient-responsive TOR pathway to modulate lifespan in C. elegans.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel role for H- in modulating lifespan in C. elegans through the ER stress pathway, highlighting the importance of ER signaling in determining lifespan. Our findings support the hypothesis that H acts downstream the nutrient-responsive TOR pathway to determine lifespan in C. elegans.

**Title:** Transcription Factor GRHL and Chromatin Modifications Underlie Irreversible Lineage Commitment and Reversible Cell Migration in Keratinocytes

**Research Question:** How do transcription factors and chromatin modifications regulate irreversible lineage commitment and reversible migration in keratinocytes?

**Methods:** We investigated the chromatin landscape of human keratinocytes undergoing differentiation and migration using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ATAC-seq. We identified unique enhancers and super-enhancers associated with each state and found that GR3, a transcription factor promoting differentiation and migration, binds preferentially to super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes and promoters in migrating keratinocytes.

**Findings:** GR3 regulates divergent gene programs in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes by switching chromatin binding locations in enhancer landscapes distinct for each state. GR3 suppresses the formation of non-kerocyte super-enh in differentiating keratinocytes and relocates GR3 binding to enhancers to regulate irreversible commitment of progenitor keratin to differentiation and reversible transition to migration.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the reciprocal relationship between transcription factor GR3 and chromatin domains, including super-enhancers, regulating not only cell specification but also migration, a reversible state. A single transcription factor like GR3 can regulate transitions between kerocyte states through distinct mechanisms. GR3 is essential for normal keratin migration during eyelid closure and wound healing, modulating gene programs promoting keratin movement and suppressing progenitor differentiation.

**Conclusions:** This study provides mechanistic insight into how a single transcription factor controls gene expression in different physiological states within the same cell. GR3 regulates divergent expression in differentiating and migrating keratin by switching chromatin binding in enhancer landscapes distinct for each state. Our findings suggest a novel role for GR3 in regulating enhancer formation, particularly suppression of nonkerocyte in differentiating keratinocytes.

**Title:** Evolutionary Dynamics of Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) and Their Role in Restricting Exogenous Retroviral Infections in Sheep

**Research Question:** How do endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) influence the evolution of exogenous retroviruses and their hosts, and do they act as restriction factors to block pathogenic retroviral infections?

**Methods:** We investigated the evolutionary history and molecular biology of 27 endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs) in sheep, which coexist with exogenous (horizontally transmitted) oncogenic retroviruses, Jaagsiek sheep retrovirus and Enzoot nasal virus, and related biologically active endogenous retroviruses. We isolated and characterized JS proviruses, which have been in the host genome for 5-7 million years, and two proviruses (JS56 and JS-20) that entered the genome within 3 million before and during speciation of genus Ovis.

**Findings:** Two transdominant proviruses, JS56 and JS-20, acquired defective gag protein resulting in transdominant phenotype able to block replication of exogenous retroviruses. These proviruses became fixed in genome before sheep domestication (~9,000 years ago). Interestingly, a provirus escaping transdom JS has emerged recently, likely within last 200 years.

**Implications:** Our study reveals distinct events indicative of evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. This suggests endization and selection of ERVs as restriction factors used by host to fight retroiral infections.

**Conclusions:** This study provides unique insight into complex interplay between endogenous and exogenous retrovir during evolution. Our data show sequential coadaptive changes between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses that favor either host or virus. Identification of ER (JS-26), which integrated in genome last 200 and escapes transdom JS, suggests antagonism between endogenous exogenous retrovir in sheep is continuous, not equilibrium. Data suggest ER used by host to fight exogenous pathogenic retroiral infections. Transdominantir might defend host against ER colonizing genome rather than pathogenic exogenous retrovir, increasing host fitness.

**Title:** Evaluation of Real-Time Schistoma PCRs for the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Schistosomiasis: A Comparative Study with Microscopic and Serological Methods

**Research Question:** This study aimed to evaluate the performance of real-time Schistoma PCRs targeting Schistosoma mansoni (Sm) and Schistos haematobium (Sh) in stool, urine, biopsy, and serum samples as tools for diagnosing active infections and monitoring treatment efficacy in schistosomiasis.

**Methods:** A total of 412 samples (124 urine, 86 stools, 8 biopsies, 194) from patients with suspected schosiasis before antiparasitic treatment were analyzed using Schist PCRs and compared to microscopic examination and serological assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect hemagglutination (HA), and Western blot (WB) assay.

**Findings:** Compared to microscopy, Schist PC significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis from 4% to 10.5% and 33.7 to 48.8% for Sh in urine and Sm in stools, respectively. The overall sensitivity of PCR on serum was 72.7% and 94.1 in patients with positive microscopy. The specificity of PCR was 98.9. After treatment, PCR positivity declined from 93.8 at 30 to 8.3 at 360, whereas detection remained positive after 1 year.

**Implications:** Schist PC clearly outperforms standard microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of reference methods with WB-based serology, which remains gold for initial diagnosis. When ser assays are positive and microscopy is negative, PCR provides information to guide clinical exploration. Biomarkers such as DNA and antibodies are limited for early monitoring but PCR could be useful at least 1 year to confirm cured.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that real-time Schist PC is a valuable tool for diagnosing and monitoring schosiasis, especially in cases where microscopy is inconclusive. Its high sensitivity and specificity make it suitable for use in combination with serological methods, particularly when serology is positive and microscopy is negative. Additionally, PCR can be useful for monitoring treatment efficacy at least 1 year post-treatment.

**Research Question:** Can machine learning algorithms be used to estimate potential energy surfaces and accelerate molecular dynamics simulations of structurally complex molecules, such as the natural product Archazolid A, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar ATPase from Myxobacterium Gephyrae?

**Methods:** We employed Gaussian process regression, a Bayesian non-parametric machine learning method, to model the relationship between molecular structure and quantum mechanical (QM) properties of Archaz A. A simple molecular representation, based on nuclear charges and interatomic distances, was used to encode conformations sampled from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Predictive variance was used to assess whether a conformation was in the interpolation region, allowing a trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational speed. Energies of relaxed conformations at the density functional theory (DFT) level, D/BP3LYP/def2TZ, achieved mean absolute errors less than 1 kcal/mol.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that machine learning models can be developed for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, enabling considerable speed-ups in simulations of larger structures. The study shows that Gaussian process regression is suited for modeling relationships between molecular and QM properties, even for complex compounds. The simple representation proved sensitive to structural variations in geometries, enabling correlations between conformations and computed values at the DFT/B3P/def-TZ level.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms integrated with molecular dynamics to access long-term simulations of challenging chemical and biomolecular systems. We made a first step in this direction using myobacterial Archolid A as an example. Trained models captured the relationship between Archolid conformations from MD and DFT energies. Conformations were encoded using a simple representation based on charges and interatomic distances, the same as first principles. Off-diagonal elements of the matrix were computed, where atom indices and main elements semiempirical simulations were carried out with VAMP using the AM Hamilton. Starting structure Archolid was modeled using NMR published by Farès et al. This was then minimized with constraints using the MMFFx force in MO and refined to match the conformation of N-derived Archolid structure.

**Conclusions:** This study shows that machine learning can be used to estimate potential surfaces and accelerate dynamics of structurally complex molecules, such as Archolid A. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for larger, more complex systems. The study contributes to the development of predictive models for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, enabling speed-ups in simulations of larger structures.

**Title:** Non-invasive Detection of Ebola Virus Antibodies in Wild Apes: Implications for Disease Management and Conservation

**Research Question:** Can we develop a non-invasive method to detect Ebola virus (EBO) antibodies in wild ape feces, and what are the implications for disease management and conservation of great apes?

**Methods:** We developed a non-invasive immunological assay to detect EBO antibodies in ape feces, using a sensitive and specific method to detect multiple EBO species with minimal false positives. We collected fecal samples from wild apes in the DCO region, a high-risk area for E exposure, and tested for EBO antibodies using immunoblot.

**Findings:** We detected EBO antibodies in 5/35 (14.3%) ape fecal samples, with a prevalence of 10% overall, indicating E exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in gorillas. Antibodies were also found in apes previously thought unexposed to EBO, protected by topological barriers of transmission.

**Implications:**

1. **Early detection of exposure**: Our method enables early detection of E incidence, identifying immunologically naïve at-risk populations for vaccination.
2. **Vaccine efficacy tracking**: Our approach provides means to track vaccine efficacy if intervention deemed appropriate.
3 **Public health impact**: Identifying ape outbreaks can reduce human EVD cases, linked to contact with infected carcasses, with case-fatality rates up to 88%.

**Conclusion:** This study is the first to detect EBO in wild ape fecal samples, crucial for ape management and survival. Strategies to protect apes against E infections, including vaccination, are being explored. Our nonvasive assay contributes to prospective epidemiological E studies in wild ape populations.

**Title:** Characterization of a Novel Type III Effector Xop from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria Exhibiting E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Activity and Inducing Plant Cell Death and Subverting Immunity

**Research Question:** How does the type III effector Xop from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesia exhibit E ubiquitin ligase activity and induce plant cell death and subvert immunity?

**Methods:** We employed in vitro and in planta assays to investigate the E ubiquitin ligase activity of Xop and its role in plant cell death and immunity.

**Findings:** Xop exhibits E ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in planta, inducing plant cell death and subverting immunity. The E3 ligase activity is associated with the C-terminal region of Xop, which interacts with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and mediates K11-linked polyubiquitin formation. The crystal structure of the X-terminal domain revealed a novel fold, termed XL-box, not present in any characterized E3 ligases. Mutation of amino acids in the cavity of XL disrupts E ligase activity and prevents Xop-induced cell death.

**Implications:** The unique fold of the E ubiquitin ligase domain within Xanthas Xop is unprecedented, highlighting variation in bacterial pathogen effectors mimicking eukary-specific activity.

**Conclusions:** Characterization of the pathogen effector Xop uncovered a novel E ubiquitin ligase fold, part of the pathogen repertoire to mimic an otherwise eukotic function such as ubiquination. This underlines the variety of E ligases evolved in pathogenic for subverting host biology.

**Title:** Preserving Follicular Helper T Cell Function in Acute HIV Infection: Implications for Early Antiretroviral Treatment

**Research Question:** This study investigated the impact of early antiretroviral treatment (ART) on helper T cell responses in HIV-infected individuals, focusing on the function of circulating follicular helper (cTfh) cells and their interactions with B cells.

**Methods:** The RV cohort of 254 HIV-infected individuals in acute stages 1 and 2 (early) and stage 3 (late) was used to examine the function of cTfh cells and cfh/B cocultures. Phenotyping of cfh and B cell populations revealed impaired cfh function in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2. c/B cocultures showed lower cell survival and IgG secretion in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with increased IL-10 and TN-α and inflammation.

**Findings:** Elevated viral load in stage 3 correlated with decreased cfh-mediated B cell Ig production, indicating a role for viremia in cfh impairment and humoral response. Phenotypic perturbations were evident in the mature B compartment, notably decreased resting cells in stage 3 compared stage 1/2, coinciding with viremia. Cocultures suggested intrinsic B defects contributed to impaired response at lower level. cfh B responses were significantly altered stage 3 compared stage 1/, coinciding increased inflammation and reduction B cells.

**Implications:** These data suggest early ART for HIV-infected individuals could prevent dysregulation while preserving cfh function and cell memory. Stage 1/ individuals had lower viral load than stage 3 and less HIV-specific Ig terminally differentiated cells compared stage 3. Increased vire affects B response hyperammlobulinemia [9, 10]. cfh interactions with memory cells in follicular microenvironment are not fully established.

**Conclusions:** cfh cells are impaired in providing B help as early stage 3 (~18 days) of HIV infection. Results indicate cfh B response is preserved at earliest HIV infection and identifying early has potential to preserve cfh-dependent cell. HIV microenvironment affects cfh differentiation and phenotype, and cells from chronicire individuals are dysfunctional providing B help compared controllers or healthy [6].

**Title:** Pharmacological Profiling of the Schistosome Serotonin Receptor (Sm5-HT) as a Novel Target for Next-Generation Anthelmintics

**Research Question:** Despite the prevalence of schistosomiasis affecting over 200 million people worldwide, current therapy relies on a single drug (prazantel) with suboptimal features, underscoring the need for next-generation anthelmics. However, validating physiologically relevant targets and pharmacologically profiling them is challenging.

**Methods:** We pharmacologically profiled the schosome serergic receptor (Sm-HT) as a downstream modulator of PZ efficacy in a miniaturized assay compatible with high-throughput screening employing a luciferase biosensor sensitive to cellular AMP levels resolving proximal kinetics of GPCR in intact cells.

**Findings:** Divergent pharmacological signature between the paras serergic receptor and closest human homolog (s-HT) supports optimizing parasitic pharmacores ligands and series with potency and selectivity for Sm-HT over s-HT identified in vitro and validated in vivo against schosomules and adult worms. Sm-HT displayed irreversible inactivation, a phenomenon at s-HT, enhancing its appeal as a abundantly expressed parasite GPCR target.

**Implications:** These data underscore feasibility profiling flatworm GPCRs in high-throughput format resolving classes of G modulators and promise Sm-HT as chemotherapeutic node for next-generation anthelmics.

**Conclusions:** This translation in vitro to activity against parasite life stages supports rational development antiparas drugs at schosomal GPCRs. Despite divergence in pharmac selectivity between human and schosome-HT GPCRs, highlighting similarity between receptors may boon anthelm development. Unbiased profiling flatworm targets underscored visualization dataset divergence lig specificities schosome-HT and closest hom (~30 amino acid). Data conservation receptor phenomenology conserved Sm-HT, most dephanized GPCR adult schosome, evaluated receptor level and organism assays. Predominant expression this GPCR organism, conservation provides target weakness anthelm development.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Germ Layer Separation during Gastrulation: A Novel Insights into the Role of Ephrin/Eph Signaling in Ectoderm-Meserm Boundary

**Research Question:** How do ectoderm and meserm layers separate during gastrulation, and what is the role of Ephrin/Eph signaling in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the separation of ecterm and mes layers during gastrulation in various organisms, including fly, fish, and amphibians, and found that the ectodermeserm boundary not only separates the layers but also serves as a substrate for mesoderm migration.

**Findings:** Ephrin/Eph signaling plays a crucial role in regulating cell detachment and tissue separation at the ectodermes boundary. Multiple Ephrin ligands and Eph receptors are expressed on both sides of the boundary, and tissue separation depends on forward signaling across the boundary, involving redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and Rho. This mechanism differs from simple adhesion-based germ layer formation, involving localized responses to signals at the boundary and attachment/detachment cycle allowing cell migration across a substratum.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that separation is not based on permanent adhesion differences between cells but transient contact-dependent reactions. This contrasts with Stein's Differential Adhesion Hypothesis, which posits simple adhesion is sufficient for separation and positioning of germ layers.

**Conclusions:** The Ephrin/Eph mechanism of tissue separation is conserved in zebraf gastrula and Drosophila gastrulation, but not in Xenopus or mouse gastrula, where a well-developed basal lamina physically separates ecterm from meserm. Rho and Rac are downstream effectors of Eph/Eph signaling, modulating cytoskeletal dynamics, and Rho activity in meserm has been implicated in separation, but role of Rho in ecterm and Rac in both tissues not addressed.

**Title:** Multivariate Analysis of Folate-Dependent One-Carbon and Transulfuration Pathway Metabolites Distinguishes Autism Spectrum Disorder from Neurotypical Participants with High Accuracy

**Research Question:** Can biochemical measurements of folate-dependent one-carbon and transulfuration pathway metabolites accurately distinguish individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) from neurotypical peers, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnoses?

**Methods:** This study analyzed blood samples from 83 participants with ASD and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers to identify metabolite concentrations of the folate-dependent one-carbon and transulf pathways. Discriminant analysis classified participants as ASD or neurotyp, achieving 96.1% accuracy for neurotyp and 97.6% for ASD. Partial least squares regression predicted adaptive behavior, measured by Vineland Adaptive Composite score, using 5 metabolites of pathways with R2 0.45 after cross-validation.

**Findings:** Multivariate analysis of folate-dependent one-car andulf pathway metabolites distinguished ASD from neurotyp participants with unprecedented 96.1% and 97.6% accuracy, respectively. Partial least squares regression predicted Vineland Adaptive score with R2 0.45, outperforming other approaches in the field, indicating strong correlation between metabolites and ASD diagnosis.

**Implications:** Incorporating biochemical data into ASD diagnosis may enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses. Multivariate analysis offers potential for extracting information from complex biochemical sets, highlighting the importance of considering multiple metabolites in understanding ASD.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the power of multivariate analysis in distinguishing ASD from neurotyp using folate one-car andulf pathway metabolites, offering a promising approach for earlier and more accurate diagnoses. The high accuracy of classification and prediction suggests strong correlation between metabolites and ASD diagnosis, underscoring the importance of biochemical data in understanding the disorder.

**Title:** Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Cutaneous and Visceral Leishmanias in Brazil: A Bayesian Geostatistical Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of cutaneous and visceral leishmanias in Brazil using Bayesian geostatistical models to identify the most important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors of the diseases.

**Methods:** We employed Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models to analyze reported incidence data of cutaneous and visceral leishias in Brazil covering a 10-year period (2001-2010). Particular emphasis was placed on spatial and temporal patterns. The models were fitted using integrated Laplace approximations to perform approximate Bayesian inference. Bayesian selection was employed to determine the most important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors of cutaneous and visceral leishias.

**Findings:** For both types of leishias, precipitation and socioeconomic were identified as important factors. The predicted number of cases in 2010 were 30,189 (SD: 7,676) for cutaneous leishias and 4,889 (SD:288) for visceral leishias. Our maps predicted the highest numbers of infected in the states Minas and Par for visceral and cutaneous leishias, respectively. Spatially explicit, high-resolution maps identified areas where leishias control efforts should be targeted to reduce incidence.

**Implications:** This study provides a deeper understanding of the determinants of cutaneous and visceral leishias in Brazil, highlighting the importance of precipitation and socioeconomic factors. Our results can inform leishias control efforts to target high-risk areas and reduce incidence.

**Conclusion:** This study employed Bayesian geostat models on available data from the Ministry of Health in Brazil, using variable selection to identify environmental and socioeconomic predictors. We produced high-resolution maps for leishias and estimated the number of infected at the state level. Our results can inform leish control efforts to target high-risk areas and reduce incidence.

**Title:** Age-Related Differences in Clinical Features and Complications of Dengue Infection: A Prospective Observational Study in Southern Vietnam

**Research Question:** To investigate the differences in clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcomes of dengue infection in adults and children admitted to a single hospital in southern Vietnam.

**Methods:** A prospective observational study was conducted on 647 adults and 881 children with confirmed deng admitted to a hospital in southern Vietnam. Clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcomes were compared between the two age groups.

**Findings:** Vascular and shock manifestations were more frequent and severe in children, while bleeding and organ involvement were more common in adults. Adults experienced more severe thrombocytopenia. Secondary infection serotype was independently associated with thrombocytopenia, with a smaller effect than age. Age-group effect on platelet count was apparent several weeks after recovery, indicating adults had intrinsically lower counts than children.

**Implications:** Clear distinctions exist between adults and children in the pattern of complications seen with deng infection, partly due to age-dependent physiological differences. Understanding these differences is crucial for research on disease pathogenesis and development of age-specific management guidelines.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates age-related differences in clinical features and complications of deng infection, reflecting intrinsic physiological differences between adults and children. Given the clinical and financial risks of prophylactic platelet transfusions, formal studies are needed to establish this as standard care. The lack of guidelines on blood product use for asymptomatic thromocytopenia in adults with deng is a concern. Prophyl platelet transfusions are routine in some d-endemic countries, without evidence of benefit.

**Title:** Alternative Entry Pathways of SIVsm Infection in Sooty Mangabeys: Implications for HIV and AIDS Research

**Research Question:** We investigated the role of CCR5 in SIV infection in sooty mangabe (SM) and its implications for HIV/AIDS research.

**Methods:** We identified a novel C5 allele with a 2-base deletion (Δ) encoding a truncated molecule not expressed on the cell surface and not supporting SIV entry in vitro. The allele was present at 26% in a large SM colony, along with 3% for C5Δ24 deletion that abrogating surface expression. 8% of animals were homozygous for C5 and 41% heterozygous.

**Findings:** CD8+ and CD4 T cells displayed a gradient of C5 expression across genotype, highly significant for CD8 cells. The prevalence of SIVm infection was not significantly different in animals lacking C5 compared to heterozygous and homozygous wild-type. Animals lacking C5 had robust viral loads modestly lower than wild-type. SIVm isolates infected homozyg mutant and wild PBMC in C5-independent manner in vitro. Envs from C-null and wild infected used CX6, G15, and G1 in addition to C5 transfected cells.

**Implications:** SIVm relies on C-independent pathways in SM homozyg for C5, while the extent of alternative use in SM with C5 type is uncertain. SIVm tropism and host targeting in vivo defined by distribution and use of pathways in addition to C5. SIV entry through alternative in vivo raises possibility of C-negative cells more expendable than C+ and enable virus to replicate without disease in face restricted C expression in SM and other natural species.

**Conclusion:** Our findings suggest that SIV uses alternative entry pathways in addition to C5 in SM, which may enable the virus to replicate without causing disease in the face of restricted C expression in SM and other natural species. This has implications for HIV/AIDS research, where C5 antagonists provide powerful protection against HIV-1 infection in humans.

**Title:** Unveiling the Dual Role of MEF2 in Tumorigenesis: A Novel Insights into the Interaction with Class II HDACs in Leiomyosarcoma

**Research Question:** The contribution of MEF transcription factors (TFs) to tumorigenesis remains enigmatic, with evidence suggesting both pro-oncogenic and tumor-suppressive activities. This study aimed to elucidate the role of M2 in leiomyarcoma (LMS), a rare soft tissue sarcoma, and its interaction with class II histone deacetylases (HDACs).

**Methods:** We investigated the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of M2 in LMS, focusing on its interaction with class II HDs, and their impact on tumorigenesis.

**Findings:** Our results revealed two distinct M2 phenotypes in LMS: one with low proliferation and low M2 levels, possibly due to SK2-mediated degradation, and the other with high M2 and class II HD expression. In the latter, M2 acts as a transcriptional repressor, whereas in the former, it promotes tumorigenesis. Class II HDs, particularly HD4 and HD9, are overexpressed in 22% of LMS, inversely correlating with overall survival. Knockout of HD9 suppresses the transformed phenotype by restoring M-target locus transcription and demethylating H3Kme3 at M-target promoters. Notably, class II HDs do not bind regulatory elements bound by M2, allowing for coexistence of transcribed and repressed M-targets in poised chromatin.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that class II HDs, especially HD9, are druggable targets for therapeutic intervention in LMS, addressing the genetic heterogeneity and low incidence of these malignancies.

**Conclusions:** This study clarifies the dual role of M in tumenesis, unveiling its interaction with class II HDs in LMS. We propose that L can be clustered into two groups based on M dysfunctions, with high M and II HD levels detrimental for patients' survival. The M2-HDAC axis manipulation impinges on the transformed phenotype in vitro. Our results are expected to be confirmed in other cancer types, providing novel insights into the enigmatic contribution of M to tumenesis.

**Title:** Unveiling the Atomic Structure of Hydrophobin Films at the Air-Water Interface: A Combined Experimental and Computational Study of HFBI and HFBII from Trichoderma rei

**Research Question:** What is the atomic-level structure of hydrophobin films composed of class II hydrophobins HF and HFB produced by Trichoderma rei, and how do they assemble at the air-water interface?

**Methods:** We employed a multidisciplinary approach combining protein-protein docking, molecular dynamics, and cryo-electron microscopy to investigate the structure of hydroobin films at the air-water interface. We studied the structures of HF and HFB from Trichma re, for which have high-resolution structures available [23-27].

**Findings:** Our results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins with P symmetry, while computational simulations indicate P symmetry with a unit size of 56 Å. However, experimental results show P symmetry with a unit size of 56 Å. We propose an alternate structure with P symmetry and a smaller unit size, supported by Monte Carlo simulations of a spin model representing the hydroobin film. This metastable structure may increase the rate of surface coverage by hydroob films, indicating a mechanism of significance to both biology and nanotechnology.

**Implications:** Hydroobins are crucial for filamentous fungi to interact with their environment and promote growth, and their surface properties have numerous applications. Our findings provide insight into the atomic structure and assembly of hydroob films at the air-water interface, shedding light on the cooperative effects stabilizing interactions between interlocking proteins in the surface network. This understanding is essential for industrial applications of interfacial assemblies of hydroobins.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of combining experimental and computational methods to investigate complex biological systems. The metastable structure of hydroob films may play a key role in their unique macroscopic properties, arising from cooperative effects stabilizing interactions between proteins in the surface network. This research has implications for both biology and nanotechnology, where hydroobins have been used in self-assembly models and industrial applications.

**Title:** Characterization of Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase LThr (dRS) from Leishmania donovani: A Potential Target for Antileishial Drug Discovery

**Research Question:** What is the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase LThr (dRS) in Leishmania donani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, and can it be a potential target for antileishial drug discovery?

**Methods:** Recombinant LThr (rLThr) was expressed in E. coli, purified, and kinetic parameters were determined. Subcellular localization of LThr was done by immunofluorescence analysis. Heterozygous mutants of LThr were generated in Leish promastigotes. Genetically manipulated parasites were checked for proliferation, virulence, aminoacylation activity, and sensitivity to Thr inhibitor borid.

**Findings:** Recombinant LThr displayed aminoacylation activity and was possibly localized to both cytos and mitochondria. Heterozyg parasites showed restrictive phenotype and attenuated infectivity, and were more susceptible to inhibition by borid. Several attempts to obtain Thr homozyg null mutants were unsuccessful, indicating its essentiality for Leish parasite. Borid showed strong affinity (KD: 0.04 μM) and inhibited aminoacy activity of rLThr (IC50:0.06 μM). Borid inhibited promast (IC50:21M) stage parasites.

**Implications:** LThr is essential for Leish survival and likely binds small drug-like molecules with strong affinity, making it a potential target for drug discovery.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates Thr as a new class of targets in antileman drug discovery and characterizes enzyme Leish donani Thr (LThr). Genetic validation of LThr by gene replacement in promast stage parasites shows its essentiality for parasite survival. Recomb LThr displayed catalytic efficiency similar to T. brucei. Subcell localization of LThr in cytos and mitochondria provides opportunity to disrupt protein synthesis in two compartments simultaneously. Bioinform analysis predicted cytos localization of LThr. Gene knockdown of Thr by RNAi in T bruce showed growth and phenotyp changes, suggesting potential for drug development.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Recognition by Toll-like Receptor 3 (TLR3) through the Identification of a Novel Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) Motif

**Research Question:** How does Hepatitis C virus (HCV) trigger the innate immune response through Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognition, and what are the structural attributes of the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motif responsible for this recognition?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between HCV RNA and Toll-like receptor 3 (TL3) using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, including RNA structure-function analysis, protein binding assays, and immune response induction studies.

**Findings:** We identified a novel PAMP motif in HCV RNA, consisting of a 5'-phosphate (5'-pp) and a 34 nucleotide polyuridine core within the 3' poly/U tract, which is essential for recognition by Toll-like receptor 3 (TL3) and subsequent activation of the innate immune response. Interspersed ribosine nucleotides between poly-U sequences in the RNA were required for optimal TL3 induction. 5-pp-polyU RNA variants stimulated TL3 efficiently in vitro, and interaction with the repressor and helicase domains of TL3 was necessary for signaling. Appended 5-pp RNA lacking PAMP activity, the polyU-core sequence conferred non-recognition of RNA and innate signaling by TL3. Importantly, H polyU RNA variants strongly activated TL signaling triggered potent anti-H responses in vitro and hepatic immune responses in vivo using a mouse model.

**Implications:** These findings define a multi-mot P signature of non-recognition by TL that incorporates 5-pp with polyuridine composition and length. The H P motif drives TL signaling to induce the innate response to infection. Our studies provide a basis for non-discrimination by TL and insights into antiviral therapeutic potential of TL activation.

**Conclusion:** Hepatitis C virus (H) evades the host immune response through multiple mechanisms, while Toll-like receptors (TL) target critical regions of viral RNA or protein to suppress H replication. Understanding the virus-host interface regulating immunity against H is necessary to develop new therapies and restrict infection. We found that 5-pp and 34 poly core within H polyU tract are required non-recognition H RNA by TL.

**Title:** Eosinophils Promote Trichinella spiralis Larval Growth in Skeletal Muscle through an IL-4-Dependent Mechanism

**Research Question:** This study investigates the role of eosinophils in promoting the growth of Trichinella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle and the underlying mechanisms involved.

**Methods:** The study used IL-4 competent and IL-4 deficient mice to determine the necessity of IL-4 in larval growth. Eosinils from IL-4 mice were sufficient to support larval growth in the absence of adaptive immunity. Gene expression in skeletal muscle showed a regenerative response and shift in energy source in infected tissue. Eosin suppressed local inflammation and influenced nutrient homeostasis in muscle. Redistribution of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and phosphorylation of Akt were observed in cells, consistent with enhancement of glucose and glycogen storage by larvae.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that IL-4 and eosophils are necessary for normal larval growth. Eos from IL-4 mice are sufficient to support growth in the absence of adaptive immunity. Gene expression in muscle showed a regenerative response and shift in energy in infected tissue. Eos suppressed local inflammation and influenced nutrient homeostasis muscle. Redistribution of GLUT4 and phosphorylation of Akt were observed in cells, consistent with enhancement of glucose and glycogen by larvae.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest a novel interaction between parasite and host in which worms have evolved a strategy to co-opt an innate cell response to facilitate growth. Eos-derived IL-4 promotes larval growth by limiting interferon-driven responses that alter nutrient metabolism in muscle.

**Conclusions:** This study documents a novel interaction between parasite and host in which worms have evolved a strategy to co-opt an innate cell response to facilitate growth. Eos-derived IL-4 promotes larval growth by limiting interferon-driven responses that alter nutrient metabolism in muscle.

**Title:** Revisiting the Replication Kinetics of Mammalian Genomes: A Genome-Wide Analysis of DNA Replication Kinetics in Human Cells

**Research Question:** Do mammalian genomes consist of megabase domains of coordinated origin firing separated by large originless regions, or are replication origins spaced at smaller intervals and fire in clusters?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in HeLa cells using DNA combing and multi-scale analysis of genome replication profiles.

**Findings:** Contrary to previous studies, our results show that HeLa cells lack large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Temporal transition regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at an increasing rate during S phase, and replication gradients are set by the delay and spacing between origin firings rather than the velocity of single forks. Activation of internal origins in a temporal region is demonstrated by DNA comb of the IGH locus in He cells. Analysis of published origin maps in He cells and replication and comb data in other cell types corroborate these findings, except embryonic cells where regions of unid fork seem more abundant.

**Implications:** Our findings shed new light on the replication program of mammalian genomes and provide a model for their kinetics. Replication origins are spaced at ∼40 kb intervals, fire in clusters, and fork velocity remains constant through S. Global fork density increases during S because more clusters and origins become active. Origins fire in correlated and at increasing rate during S, and speed depends on velocity and proportion of right and left moving forks. A broad distribution of speeds is observed, with 1% replicating at ≤2/min, 53 in 2-10/min, and 46 >10/min.

**Conclusions:** Replication in He cells does not occur by unidirectional progression of a single fork, but rather by activation of multiple origins in a region. This is supported by DNA comb of IGH locus and analysis of origin maps and replication data in other cell types, except embryonic cells. Our results can be explained by origins firing independently under long-range chromatin control or forks stimulating initiation in unrep DNA.

**Title:** Temporal Stability in Object Recognition: A Biologically Realistic Implementation of the "Slown" Approach

**Research Question:** How can the "temporal stability" or "slown" approach, which enables the nervous system to recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables such as perspective or lighting, be implemented within biologically realistic spike-based learning rules?

**Methods:** We investigated the feasibility of implementing slow analysis, an algorithm based on the "own, in continuous and spiking neurons using modified Hebbian learning and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We analyzed the learning dynamics of STDP and derived learning windows that implement slow analysis and the trace rule.

**Findings:** Our results show that slow analysis can be implemented in continuous neurons by a modified Hebbian rule, providing a link to the trace rule, another implementation of theown. For spiking neurons, STDP can be interpreted as an implementation of theown with a specific learning window. Analytically, we found that the outcome of ST learning is governed by the convolution of the learning window with the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) rather than the window alone. We derived ST windows that implement slow analysis and the trace, compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the window can be split into two functionally different components sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of input statistics.

**Implications:** Our study offers a novel interpretation of the role of ST in physiological neurons, indicating that irreversible statistics favor stable distributions but generate oscillatory weight dynamics. We found that ensemble-averaged ST can reproduce the behavior of continuous neurons by STDP, suggesting that the outcome is not governed by the window but the convolution with EP. The learning that realizes slow can be calculated analytically. We propose a new interpretation of the ST window as an implementation of theown that compensates for neuronal low-pass filters such as EP.

**Conclusions:** Our research demonstrates that biologically realistic spike-based rules can implement theown approach, enabling the nervous system to recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables. We provide a novel interpretation of the role of ST in physiological neurons and propose a new understanding of the ST window as an implementation of theown. Our findings have implications for understanding early sensory processing, such as visual fields invariant to microaccades small translations.

**Title:** Cooperative Adaptation to Therapy: A Novel Mechanism of Cancer Resistance to Chemotherapy

**Research Question:** How do phenotypically diverse cancer cells within a tumor interact with each other to withstand chemotherapy pressure?

**Methods:** We employed a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit to engineer phenotypically diverse non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) cells with mutations in Dicer, a type III cytoplasmic endonuclease involved in non-coding RNA genesis. We monitored three-dimensional growth of fluorescently-labeled mutant and wild-type cells in co-culture using a substrate-free NanoCulture system under stimulated or drug conditions. Integrating flow cytometry, we characterized growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures using a mathematical model of intra- and interspecies competition.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that co-cultures of wild-type and mutant cells allowed beneficial growth in drug-sensitive cells despite drug pressure via induction of cell transitions described by cooperative game-theoretic change in fitness. Leveraging flow cytometry data, we estimated the model's parameters to show that combination of WT and mutants co-cult allowed for growth in previously drug-sensitive cells.

**Implications:** These findings present a paradox in drug resistance implicating non-genetic cooperation among tumor cells to thwart pressure, suggesting that profiling druggable targets (i.e. mutations) alone may be insufficient to assign therapy.

**Conclusions:** Our study introduces a novel mechanism of cancer resistance, cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), where cancer cells induce resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells exposed to therapy. This highlights the importance of understanding how phenically distinct cells within a tumor interact to promote resistance, suggesting that targeting a single druggable target may not be sufficient for effective therapy.

**Title:** Seroprevalence of Spotted Fever Group (SFG) Rickettsiae in the Rural Population of Mbeya Region, Southwestern Tanzania: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Research Question:** What is the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Group (S) ricketiae in the rural population of Mbeya Region, South Tanzania, and what are the associated socioeconomic and environmental risk factors?

**Methods:** A cross-sectional serreval study was conducted on 1,228 participants aged ≥ 5 years from nine communities in Mbeya Region, stratified by age, altitude, and ownership of domestic mammals. Serology (indirect immunofluorescence) was performed at a dilution 1:64.

**Findings:** SFG-serositivity in the cohort was 67.9% (range 42.8-91.4%). Multivariable analysis revealed associations with age (PR 1.08; 95% CI 1.06-1.10), warmer temperatures (PR 1.38; 1.11-1.71), gender (1.08;1.00-1.16), and low population density (0.96 0.94-0.99). Higher elevations were associated with higher cattle density.

**Implications:** SFG ricketial infection is common in the rural population of Mb Region. Spread is limited by temperature and elevation. Examination of S contribution to febrile illnesses warranted in prospective study to estimate disease burden and causative pathogens.

**Conclusion:** Our findings are compatible with previous descriptions and information on risk factors for S ricketios in southwestern Tanzania. Future studies should detect pathogen in acute infection and describe local cycle to validate identified factors. Comparing to typhus group ricketial (T) antibodies, it is evident T and S serositivity occur different patterns, with higher in areas sparse or dense population T.

**Title:** Uncovering the Role of Monounsaturated Fatty Acid Oleate in the Innate Immune Response of Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** What is the role of monounsaturated fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode model organism?

**Methods:** We conducted an RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify regulators of innate defense genes in C. elegans and identified two stearl-CoA desaturases that synthesize oleate, a monounsaturated fatty acid. We examined the necessity of oleate for pathogen-mediated immune gene induction and found that C. elegans deficient in ole production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse pathogens, which can be rescued by exogenous ole addition.

**Findings:** Our results show that oleate is necessary for innate immune activation and resistance to bacterial infection in a manner distinct from polyunsaturated fatty acids γ-linolenic acid (GL) and stidonic acid (SA). We demonstrate that oleate is among the most abundant fatty acids in C. elegans and that its effect on immune activation is not dependent on metabolism to GL and SA. Supplementation of exogenous ole rescued the R-mediated immune defect in fat-6 RNAi animals in a dose-dependent manner. Our data indicate ole and polyunsaturated fatty acids affect effector expression and pathogen resistance by different mechanisms.

**Implications:** These findings add to the health-promoting effects of monounsaturated fatty acids and suggest an ancient link between nutrient metabolism and susceptibility to bacterial infection. Our study defines a role for ole in C. elegans innate immune activation and highlights the importance of ole in host-pathogen interactions.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that oleate is necessary for innate immune activation and resistance to bacterial infection in a distinct manner from polyunsaturated fatty acids GL and SA. We show that ole is among the most abundant fatty acids in C. elegans and its effect on immune is not dependent on metabolism to GL and SA. Supplementation of exogenous ole rescued the immune defect in fat-6 RNA animals in a dose-dependent manner. Our data indicate ole and polyunsaturated fatty acids affect effector and pathogen resistance by different mechanisms.

**Title:** Targeting Guanine Riboswitches: A Novel Approach to Designing Antimicrobial Compounds against Nosocomial Pathogens

**Research Question:** Can guanine ribwitch-targeting compounds be used as a novel antimicrobial agents against nosocomial pathogens?

**Methods:** We identified a pyrimidine compound (PC1) that binds to guanine ribwitch and exhibits bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens. We used molecular modeling to design pyrim-based molecules that fit the guanine ribwitch aptamer site and tested their bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. RT-PCR experiments revealed that guA, a gene for GMP synthase, is under the control of guanine ribwitch in S. aureus.

**Findings:** PC1 showed bactericidal activity only against bacteria using gu ribwitch to control guA expression, even when grown in rich medium. This suggests that targeting gu ribwitch can inhibit bacterial growth. Pyrim-based molecules can be designed to bind guwitch and inhibit bacterial growth. RT-PCR identified guwitch controls four-gene operon in S. aureus, placing guA and guB under guwitch control.

**Implications:** This work establishes the possibility of using structural knowledge to design guwitch-targeting antibiotics as antimicrobial compounds. The finding of new guwitch target is crucial as community-acquired bacterial infections have emerged.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the potential of guwitch-targeting compounds as antimicrobial agents against nosial pathogens. Guwitch-targeting compounds can be rationally designed to inhibit bacterial growth by binding to guwitch. This approach offers a novel strategy to combat nosial infections.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Gaze in the Construction of Mental Space in Primates: A Study of Navigation, Visual Exploration, and Hippocampal Activity in Macaques in a Virtual Reality Maze

**Research Question:** How do primates, like macaques, construct their mental representation of space during navigation in a virtual reality environment, and what role does gaze play in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity of macques as they searched a virtual maze for a reward, examining how cells responded to variables such as head direction, point of gaze, and context. We used a virtual reality setup to control the environment and task demands.

**Findings:** Hippocamp activity was best fit by a fine-grained state comprising current position, view, and context. Cells fired at the sight and in anticipation of a landmark in a viewpoint-dependent manner, encoding the animal's situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Many cells were sensitive to one or more variables like direction, point of gaze, or task. Our findings indicate that rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in the construction of space.

**Implications:** This conjunct type of coding is ubiquitous in mammals, as our findings are consistent with encoding task-related demands by hippocamp neurons in rodents. We show that space in primates embodies self-position to the target of gaze and carries cognitive information to the current trajectory to goal. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of variables controlling hippocamp cells, bridging the gap between studies in rodents and primates, including humans, in real and virtual environments.

**Conclusions:** Hippocamp cells in primates code the target of gaze in an informed manner, embedding self-position to elements in the environment and context. Our data suggest the counterpart of cells in prim, compared to rodents, is expressed activity to point in conjunction with other navigation variables, such as position and identity of elements at instants of planning. Recent rodent studies in VR provide a framework to our findings and cross-species comparisons.

**Title:** Deciphering the Regulatory Network of Gene Expression at the Mid-Hind Boundary in Vertebrate Development

**Research Question:** How do transcription and secreted factors interact to establish and maintain the characteristic gene expression patterns at the mid-hind boundary (MHB) in vertebrate development?

**Methods:** We employed a Boolean analysis of spatial gene expression patterns at the murine MHB using computational techniques for minimization of Boolean functions to predict regulatory interactions in the network. Additionally, we used mouse neural plate/tube explant cultures to experimentally validate the role of Fgf on Wnt expression.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed key interactions in the regulatory network, including a maintaining rather than inducing effect of Fgf on Wnt expression, which was previously unclear. We found that F8 only maintains, but does not induce ectopic Wnt expression in explants. Combining this with validated interactions, we constructed a regulatory network of transcription and secret factors at the M. Boolean differential equation and reaction-diff models of this network confirmed its ability to explain stable M maintenance and expression patterns under wild-type and knock-out conditions.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates that spatial expression patterns can be used to infer regulatory networks. We show that patterns around the M help understand the maintenance of this boundary on a systems level.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the regulatory network at the M and its role in vertebrate development. We propose a methodology for systematic inference of regulatory by logical analysis of spatial expression, which can be applied to other biological systems. This study highlights the importance of spatial patterns in understanding complex biological processes.

**Title:** Theileria annulata Exploits Host Cell Cytoskeleton Dynamics through a Novel Interaction with EB1 via a Bona-fide SIP Motif

**Research Question:** How does Theileria annata, a protozoan parasite, interact with the host cell cytoskeleton to induce uncontrolled proliferation and clonal expansion of parasitized cells?

**Methods:** We employed in vitro experiments to investigate the interaction between Theileria annata schizont and host microtubules (MTs) during mitosis and cytokinesis. We focused on the protein machinery associated with MT plus ends, specifically EB1, a key regulator of host MT dynamics.

**Findings:** We identified T. annata104, a polymorphic antigen on the schizont surface, as a genuine EB-binding protein that recruits EB in the absence of other parasite proteins. Binding depends on a consensus SIP motif in the C-terminal region of 104. Interaction with host EB is cell cycle-regulated. This is the first description of a pathogen-encoded protein interacting with EB via a bonaide SIP motif.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new insight into the mode of interaction between Theiler and host cytoskeleton. Theiler schizont taps into the dynamic MT network, and interaction with host MT during mitosis and cytokinesis is crucial for persistence in the host. EB might facilitate initial interaction of MT plus ends with schizont, but additional molecules of parasite or host origin are required to stabilize MT at schizont surface. Preliminary observations suggest host CL1, a protein with MT-stabilizing activity, contributes to stabilization at parasite surface.

**Conclusions:** Theiler annata exploits host cytoskeleton dynamics through a novel interaction with EB via a bonaide SIP motif. This interaction is essential for schizont distribution between daughter cells during cytokinesis. The molecular mechanisms of MT recruitment and stabilization at schizont surface are largely unknown. By associating with mitotic apparatus during mitosis and cytokinesis, parasite secures equal distribution schizont between new cells. This involves recruitment and stable association of de novo astral and central MT with schizont surface.

**Title:** Constitutive DNA Damage and Telomere Lengthening in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: A Role of Replicative Ligase Cdc9 and Phosphorylation of P1

**Research Question:** How does replicative ligase Cdc9 deficiency in Saccharomy cerevisiae lead to constitutive DNA damage and telomere lengthening, and what is the role of phosphorylation of P1 in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of replicative ligase Cdc9 deficiency in Sacomyces cerevisiae on DNA damage and telomere length, using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We analyzed telomere length in cdc-1, c44, and r3 mutants, and examined the role of P1 phosphorylation in BIR and telomere elongation.

**Findings:** Replicative ligase C9 deficiency in Sacomy cerevisiae resulted in a population of cells with persistent DNA damage, likely due to broken replication forks, constitutive activation of DNA checkpoint and teleres. Telom length required telerase, DNA signaling Mec-Rad-Rad53, and BIR pathway components Rad51, 52, 32, and P1. Phosphorylation of P1, necessary for inhibition of telomerase at double strand breaks, was also important for P1 role in BIR and telom elong in c-1 cells. Two other mutants with impaired replication, c44 and r3, showed similar telom phenotype dependent on P1 phosphorylation locus.

**Implications:** We propose a model where passage of B forks through telomeres promotes telerase activity, leading to telom length. DNA-induced phosphorylation of P1 promotes telom-stabilizing telom extension while repressing deleterious de novo telom events at breaks, funneling broken DNA into genome-preserving pathways. DDR in c-1 is required for repair of broken forks via BIR, causing additional telom length. This mechanism may explain previous reports of r3 mutants with replication pausing and break constitutive activation Rad53 and telom.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that constitutive damage and telom length in Sacomy cerevisiae may result from constitutive generation of DNA damage. DNA-induced phosphorylation of P1 promotes telom-stabilizing tel extension while repressing deleter de novo telom events at breaks, funneling DNA into genome-pres pathways. We propose that this mechanism may explain previous reports of r3 mutants with replication pausing and break constitutive activation Rad and telom. Additionally, we show that P1 phosphorylation is required not only for inhibition telom at DSBs but also for P1 function in B. Activation of B in cells with damage leads to telom length, providing an additional layer of protection against DNA machinery. Cells lacking P1 possess longer telom and elevated de novo telom to Ds.

**Title:** Evaluation of Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS) for Rapid and Specific Diagnosis of Onchocercias Infection Caused by Onchercavolus volulus

**Research Question:** Can luciferase immunrecitation systems (L) be used as a rapid, specific, and standardized assay for diagnosis of Onocercavulus infection?

**Methods:** Four recombinantly produced Onocavulus antigens (Ov-AR-1, Ov-AP-1, Ov-MS-1, and OvPI-1) were tested on a large cohort of sera comprised of uninfected controls and patients with proven parasitic infections, including Onoculus (O), Wucher bancrofti (W), Loa (L), Strongloides storal (S), and other cross-reactive infections.

**Findings:** Antibody responses to the four antigens allowed unequivocal differentiation between infected and uninfected sera with 100% sensitivity and 100 specificity. Analysis of antibody titers to each antigen in infected sera revealed they were markedly different and did not correlate with each other. Compared to infected, patients with W, L, S, and other conditions had lower geometric mean titers to each antigen. The simplified method using a mixture of four antigens in standard or 15-minute format (QL) showed 100% sensitivity and specificity distinguishing infected from unected sera.

**Implications:** The multi-antigen L assay can be used as a rapid, high-throughput, specific tool not only to diagnose individual infections but also as sensitive point-of-care for early detection of recrudescence in areas control and mapping new transmission.

**Conclusion:** The luciferase immunrecitation systems (L) can be used as a rapid, specific, and standardized assay for diagnosis of Onocav infection. The multi-antigen assay showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing infected from unected sera, and 76%, 84, and 93 for distinguishing from W, L, and S-infected sera. This method can be used as a rapid, high-through, specific tool for diagnosis and early detection of recrudence in areas and new transmission.

**Title:** Evaluation of Weekly Iron-Folic Supplementation and Deworming Initiatives to Reduce Anemia, Iron Deficiency Anemia, and Soil-Transmitted Infections in Women of Reproductive Age in Rural Vietnam: A Prospective Cohort Study

**Research Question:** Can weekly iron-folic supplementation and deworming interventions effectively reduce anemia, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted infections in women of reproductive age in rural Vietnam, particularly in resource-constrained settings?

**Methods:** A prospective cohort study was conducted in a rural province of northern Vietnam, enrolling 389 women aged 16-45 years. Participants received weekly-folic acid supplementation and dewing for 54 months. Hemoglobin, anemia, iron deficiency, and soil-transmitted infections were assessed at baseline and post-intervention.

**Findings:** After 54 months, 76% (95% CI [68, 84]) of participants took ironolic supplement and 95 (95% CI [93, 98]) received dewing. Hemoglobin rose from 122 g/L (95 CI [120, 124] to 131/L (95 CI [128,134]) and anemia prevalence fell from 38% (95 CI [31, 45] to 18 (95 CI [12,23]). Iron deficiency decreased from 23 (95 CI [17,29] to 8 ( CI [4,12]) and iron deficiency anemia from 4 (95 CI [1,7] to 0. Prevalence of hookworm infection reduced from 76 (95 [68,83] to 11 (95 [5,18]) and moderate or heavy infestation of soil-transmitted helth below 1%.

**Implications:** Population-based interventions can efficiently reduce anemia and practically eliminate iron deficiency anemia and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted infections, maintaining below public health concern level.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of weekly-folic supplementation and dewing in reducing anemia, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-trans infections in rural women of reproductive age in Vietnam, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Compliance with dewing and ironolic remained high, hemoglobin stabilized, and serum ferritin increased. Anemia, iron deficiency, and iron anemia significantly reduced to non-significant public health threats.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Immune Evasion Mechanism: Epstein-Barr Virus Glycoprotein 150 Inhibits Antigen Presentation to Both Classical and Non-Classical CD1 Molecules

**Research Question:** How do herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), evade cell-mediated immunity during the replicative phase of infection, and what is the role of glycoprotein 150 (gp150) in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated antigen presentation by EBV-producing cells, focusing on the late phase of infection when most antigens are expressed to activate T and NKT cell immunity. We identified the heavily glycosylated EB protein gp150, encoded by the BDL3 gene, as a novel viral immune evasion molecule unique to EBV and related Rhes lymphocytovirus (LCV).

**Findings:** EB gp150 interferes with recognition of HLA I, II, and CD1/Ag complexes at the cell surface through a glycan-dependent mechanism, representing a novel evasion mechanism in herpesviruses. Unlike most herpesvirus structural glycoproteins, EB gp150 is non-essential for viral entry, assembly, or egress, and its function remained enigmatic until now. We provide evidence supporting a model where gp shields surface HLA molecules through abundantly sialated glycans to escape T cell activation.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that EB gp150 prolongs the lifespan of viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the viral cycle. This is unprecedented in herpesvirus biology and supports the notion that herpesviruses use diverse ways to evade not only T cells but also NKT immunity. Evasion from CD1-mediated presentation supports an essential role NKT in anti-EB immunity, inferred from devastating effects of EB infection in XLP patients.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel immune evasion mechanism in herpesviruses and highlights the importance of NKT cells in fighting EB infection. EB gp150's broad target range could impact beyond T cell activation. Importantly, cells with a gp-null EB displayed rescued levels of antigen presentation by HLA I, II, and CD, supporting NKT's role next to classical cells in EB infection.

**Title:** Conservation of the Actin-Recruiting Phosphoprotein T (Tarp) among Pathogenic Chlamydial Species: A Critical Role in Host Cell Invasion

**Research Question:** What is the role of the actin-recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp) in the pathogenicity of Chlamydial species, and is its actin binding domain conserved among different species?

**Methods:** We generated a peptide antiser specific to the actin binding domain of Tarp and examined its effect on actin polymerization in vitro and Chlamial entry in vivo. Sequence analysis of T orthologs from various Chlamial species revealed multiple putative actin binding sites. GST-Tarp fusions from multiple Chlamial species were tested for their ability to bind and nucleate actin.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that T mediated actin binding and nucleation is conserved among diverse Chlamial species and plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells. All Chlamial species examined harbor at least one to four actin binding domains, and recombinant Tarp from Chial species nucleated actin formation in vitro. A peptide antiser to the actin domain prevented T mediated actin nucleation and reduced host susceptibility to Chlamial infection when delivered into cells.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that T mediated actin polymerization is a conserved feature among diverse Chlamial species, and the actin domain plays a critical role in bacterial entry. The act nucleating activity of T is required for C. trachatis invasion. All pathogenic Chial strains and serars examined harbor T effector. The sequence of T orthologs is divergent between Chial species, but the actin domain is present in all examined strains.

**Conclusions:** The conservation of T mediated actin binding and nucleation among Chial species highlights the importance of this mechanism in Chlamial pathogenesis. The actin domain of T is a potential target for therapeutic intervention to prevent Chlam infection. Our results also suggest that multiple actin domains on a single polypeptide may utilize a hybrid mechanism of nucleation involving monomer binding and oligomerization by upstream proline domain.

**Title:** Development of a Novel Formalin-Ethylate Sedimentation-Digestion (F-SD) Technique for Enhanced Visualization of Schistosoma japonicum Eggs in Bovine Feces

**Research Question:** What is the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma japon in mammalian hosts, particularly water buffaloes, in the People's Republic of China, and can be accurately determined using a novel formalin-ethyl acetate sediment-digestion (F-SD) technique?

**Methods:** A new procedure, F-SD, was developed to visualize S. japon eggs in bovine feces. The technique involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation steps prior to microscopy. This method removes nearly 70% of debris from fecal samples, rendering the remaining debris translucent and allowing accurate microscopic visualization of S. japon eggs.

**Findings:** The F-SD technique was effective in identifying and quantifying S. japon eggs in fecal samples from naturally infected Chinese buffaloes (Bubalis bubalis) and carab water buffalo (Bubalis caraban) in the Philippines. The method was as efficient as real-time PCR (q) for determining schosome prevalence in boines but less costly to implement.

**Implications:** The F- method is a valuable tool for surveillance of animal reservoirs of S. japon, particularly in areas with low to high intensity or suspected schosiasis japonica elimination. The technique eliminates the problem of cellulose material obscuring schosome eggs, enabling accurate estimation of infection in boines and ruminant hosts.

**Conclusions:** The F- technique is an improved method for visualizing schosome and determining prevalence and intensity of S. japon in boines. It is a valuable tool for controlling schosias japon transmission, particularly in areas with low to high intensity or suspected schias elimination. The F- method is efficient and less costly than real-time PCR, making it a suitable for use in resource-limited settings.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Proly 3-Hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) and Cartilage Protein Associated Protein (CRTAP) in Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI): A Novel Insights from a Knock-in Mouse Model

**Background:** Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage protein (CRT) and proly 3-hydroxylase 1 (PH, encoded by LEP1) have been identified as the primary causes of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). These proteins, along with cyclophilin (encoded PIB), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a proline on the α1 chain (Pro986) and exhibits cis-trans isomerase peptidase activity essential for collagen folding. Recent studies suggest that proly 3-hydrolation of Pro986 is not required for collagen stability, but its absence may disrupt protein-protein interactions, leading to collagen overmodification.

**Research Question:** To distinguish between the contributions of 3-hydroxylation and peptidase activities to the OI phenotype, we generated a knock-in mouse carrying a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic site of PH (Lep1H662).

**Methods:** We created a novel mouse model (LepH/H) harboring a knock-in mutation in the catalytic domain of PH, which inactivated the 3ydrolyase activity of PH and resulted in loss of 3-H at Pro in collagen chains.

**Findings:** Knock mice showed absence of proly 3ydrolation at Pro of α chains but no overmodification at other residues. They exhibited normal appearance, growth, and cartilage plate histology but decreased trabecular bone mass, recapitulating elements of the bone phenotype of OI but not cartilage growth phenotypes caused by loss of proly 3ydrolation complex.

**Implications:** Our observations suggest differential tissue consequences due to selective inactivation of PH hydroxylase versus ablation of proly 3ydrolation complex.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of the complex in collagen modification and maintenance of bone mass. Null mutations in either LEP or CRT can result in recessive forms of OI with identical features, PH and CRT were hypothesized to stabilize each other. Our findings provide new insights into the role of PH and CRT in OI and suggest that selective inactivation of PH hydroxase may have distinct effects on bone and cartilage phenotypes.

**Title:** Rapid Invasion and Adaptation of the P-Element in Drosophila simulans: A Case Study of Selfish Genetic Element Evolution

**Research Question:** How does the P-element, a selfish genetic element, invade and adapt in Drosophila simul, a species closely related to Drosoph melanogaster, and what are the implications of this invasion on the species' fitness?

**Methods:** We conducted a survey of 181 D. simul strains collected over 27 years and 3 continents for the presence of P-element, and used genomic and transcriptomic data to associate the element with hybrid dysgenesis phenotype. We also used next-generation sequencing and PCR to identify the P-element in D simul.

**Findings:** We found that P-element invaded D simul rapidly and simultaneously across regions, with strains containing elements rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Importantly, strains from the latter phase of invasion adapted to suppress the element's effects, evidenced by resistance to hybridgenesis. In contrast to D melanogaster, simul showed lower rates of P-induced gonadal dysgenesis and sterility.

**Implications:** This study highlights the evolutionary challenge posed by selfish elements on species fitness, underscoring the need for adaptation to ameliorate their effects. The rapid invasion and adaptation of P-element in D simul, compared to D melanogaster, suggests species-specific differences in response to selfish elements. The lower rates of sterility in simul may hamper the spread of P-element, reducing its fitness.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the rapid invasion and adaptation of P-element in D simul, a closely related species to D melanaster, and highlights the evolutionary challenge posed by selfish elements on species fitness. The rapid adaptation of simul to suppress the element's effects underscores the importance of species-specific response to selfish elements. The lower rates of sterility in simul compared to melanaster suggest species-specific differences in response to selfish elements.

**Title:** Evaluation of Rhodamine B as a Marking Agent for Assessing Mating Success and Competitiveness of Sterilized Males in Aedes aegypti

**Research Question:** Can Rhodamine, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, be used as a marking agent to assess mating success and competitiveness of sterilized males in Aedes aegipty and Aedes albopitus populations?

**Methods:** Rhodamine was administered via sugar-feeding to males at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% (w/v) in 50% honey solutions during flight. After 4 days of feeding, males were knocked down and inspected for rhamine presence in body and seminal fluid. Females were inspected for rhamine in burs and spermathec and presence of sperm. Free-flight competitiveness assays were performed in semi-cages (17.5 x 8.7 x 4) with minimal chance of cross-contamination.

**Findings:** Rhamine marking achieved >95% transfer to females and body after 4 days feeding, with 0.4 and 0.8 solutions producing longest body marking. Rhamine had no effect on male competitiveness. Proof-of-principle field releases demonstrated transfer of marked fluid to females and recapture of marked males. Rhamine labelling may be advantageous over fluorescent powders.

**Implications:** Rhamine is a potentially useful method for male-based IT control strategies and viable marking for male-release experiments without negative effects of traditional methods. As standalone for mating assays, rhamine is less expensive than PCR and stable isotope labelling, and less time-consuming than fertility assays.

**Conclusions:** Rhodamine is a useful marking agent for assessing mating success and competitiveness of sterilized males in Aedes aegi and A alb populations. It can be used in male-based control strategies and marking without negative effects of traditional methods.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Action of Bacterial Superantigens: A Novel Role of CD28 as a Receptor for Superant Toxins

**Research Question:** How do bacterial superantigens, a family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm leading to lethal shock, and what is the role of CD28 in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between superantigens and CD28, a homodimer expressed on T cells that functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response, using biochemical and structural analysis.

**Findings:** We show that superigens bind directly to the dimer interface of CD28 to elicit inflammatory cytokine expression and toxicity. Preventing access of superigen to CD28 suffices to block lethality. Mice were protected from lethal superigen challenge by peptide mimetics of the CD dimer interface and peptides that compete with superigen for binding to CD28. Structural analysis revealed that superigen uses a conserved β-strand/α-helix domain to engage CD28. Mutation of this domain abolished inflammatory gene induction and lethality.

**Implications:** Our findings identify CD28 homimer interface as a critical receptor for superigens. The novel role of CD28 as receptor for a class of microbial pathogens, superigens, broadens the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that CD28, a costimulatory molecule, is co-opted by superigens as receptor. Superig must bind directly to homimer of CD to elicit toxicity. Blocking access superigen to CD is sufficient to block toxic shock. Peptide mimetics of CD dimer inhibited induction of Th cytokines and protected mice from superigen exposure. These findings reveal CD28 as direct sensor of class microbial, superig toxins, broadening pathogen recognition mechanisms.

**Title:** Understanding the Mechanisms Regulating Cell Cycle Proliferation and Potency of Pluripotent Stem Cells: The Role of Wnt/β-caten Signaling Pathway in Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs)

**Research Question:** How does the Wnt/β-caten signaling pathway regulate cell cycle proliferation and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs)?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Wnt/β-caten pathway in regulating cell cycle and pluripotency in ES using a combination of molecular biology techniques, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), RNA interference (RNAi), and gene expression analysis.

**Findings:** Our results show that Wnt/β-caten pathway controls cell cycle and plurotency in ES through non-overlapping functions of distinct Tcf factors. Specifically, we found that W-eff Tcf1 is recruited to the promoter of Ink/Ar tumor suppressor locus, leading to activation of mitogenic pathway in somatic tissues. In contrast, Tcf is recruited to palindromic motif in promoter of cell repressor genes, such as pInk4, pIn4, and pAr, mediating W-dependent anti-proliferative effect in ES. Furthermore, ablation of β-caten or T1 expression impairs W-dependent cell regulation.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that W/βaten pathway triggers anti-proliferative effect in ES via T1 activity, contrary to its mitogenic effect in somatic cells. We also show that ES have unique cycle defined by absence of CD inhibitors, and that T1 is recruited to promoter of Ink/Ar locus. These data demonstrate GSK inhibition βaten transcriptionally regulates expression of Ink and Ar family members in T-independent manner.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into mechanisms regulating cell cycle and plurot in ES, highlighting the role of W/βaten pathway and Tcf factors. These findings have implications for safe use of ES in clinic, as well as understanding of W signaling in development and cancer.

**Title:** Characterization of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells (pDC) Activation during Dengue Virus (DENV) Infection and their Antiviral Role

**Research Question:** What is the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in the immune response to Dengue virus (DENV) infection, and how do they contribute to the outcome of the disease?

**Methods:** We investigated the activation of pDC in patients with Dengue fever (DF) and healthy controls using flow cytometry (FC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). pDC from DF patients exhibited higher frequencies of membrane-bound TRAIL (mTR) compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IF-α and soluble TR were increased in mild compared to severe DF patients, correlating with p activation. FC experiments showed that in vitro exposure to DENV-2 induced mTR expression on p. Three-dimensional microscopy highlighted TR relocalization from intracellular to plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited DENV-induced TRlocalization and IFα production by p. Endosomal degradation by chloro allowed viral antig detection inside p.

**Findings:** Our data suggest endocyt pathway activation by DENV in p. Coculture of p/DENV-infected monocytes revealed dramatic antigen reduction by FC. Viral antigens in monocytes were also observed after exogenous IFα treatment. Thus, p effect on viral load was mainly dependent on IFα production.

**Implications:** This study characterizes pDC activation during DENV infection and their antiral role in vitro. We propose TR-expressing p may have an important role in disease outcome.

**Conclusion:** The present study describes p activation ofDC during DENV infection and its importance for disease. We characterized, for the first, an activated profile of p from DF patients using TR expression as marker. Moreover, we observed, in vitro, activated p exerted antiral in human primary monocytes. Thus, p may contribute control viral clearance and diminish severity disease.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TN) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) Infection: A Computational Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** What is the role of tumor necrosis factor (TN) in host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M) in both active and latent phases of infection, and how do anti-TNF therapies impact TB reactivation?

**Methods:** We extended our previous mathematical models to investigate the roles of soluble (sTN) and transmembrane TN (tmTN) in Mtb infection. We analyzed the effects of anti-T therapy in virtual clinical trials (VCTs) by simulating two commonly used therapies: anti-T antibody and TN receptor fusion.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that bioavailability of TN following anti-T therapy is the primary factor causing reactivation of latent infection, while even low levels of TN are essential for infection control. Using a mathematical model, we distinguished mechanisms of action of anti-T treatments and gained insights into the role of TN in TB control and pathology.

**Implications:** Our study suggests that a TN-modulating agent could be developed to balance reduction of inflammation with maintenance of resistance to infection. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-T therapy could be modified to prevent incidents of primary TB in areas of high exposure.

**Conclusions:** TN plays a crucial role in host defense against M in both active and latent phases of infection. Anti-T therapies increase the risk of TB in accordance with animal studies. Our study provides insights into the mechanisms of action of anti-T treatments and the role of TN in TB control and pathology.

**Title:** Investigating Retroduplication Variations in Human Populations: A Novel Insights into Genetic Variation and Expression

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the presence and expression of retroduplication variations (RDVs) in human populations, a class of polymorphisms characterized by the presence or absence of a retrocopy in individual genomes. Specifically, we examined the loss of ancestral retrocopies shared with other primates among different human populations and retrocopy expression levels using RNA-Seq data from the Illumina Body project and lymphoblast cell lines from the Geuvis Consortium.

**Methods:** We utilized the results from Phase 1 of the 100 Genomes Project to analyze genomic data from 1,092 individuals across 14 populations. We developed a novel approach to detect retrocopies absent from the human reference genome and experimentally confirmed their existence and presence in 17 populations. Additionally, we analyzed RNA-Seq data from the Illumina Body project and lymphoblast cell lines from the Geis Consortium.

**Findings:** We detected 193 RDVs, the majority resulting from retro deletion, most of which had not been previously reported. Experimentally confirmed expression of 11 ancestral retrogenes underwent deletion in certain individuals, with low frequency of deletion, except for one, suggesting potential functionality. We also found differences in retro expression between populations, 9 undergoing statistically significant expression.

**Implications:** This study highlights the value of RD polymorphisms as markers for population history and ongoing evolutionary processes. Our approach complements previous studies, which mainly focused on recent retro events, while revealing RD from deletion. We found orthologs for 56 retro missing in some human genomes. The availability of RNA-Seq data allowed us to consider functional implications of retro variations.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of RD in understanding human genetic variation and evolution. Our novel approach to detect undiscovered retroduplications in the genome provides new insights into ongoing evolutionary processes. The low frequency of deletion and conservation of some retro may suggest functionality, aside from presence or absence.

**Title:** Tissue-Specific Inflammatory Responses to Taenia solium Cysticerci in the Central Nervous System: A Comparative Study of Parenchymal, Meningeal, and Corticomeningeal Locations

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the tissue-specific inflammatory responses to Taenia solium cysticerci in the central nervous system, specifically comparing parenchymal, meningeal, and corticomeningeal locations, and the effects of anthelmintic treatment on these responses.

**Methods:** Histological specimens from 196 brains of 11 pigs naturally infected with Taenia solium cysterci were analyzed. Four pigs were sacrificed after 2 and 5 days of praziquantel treatment, while three did not receive treatment. All pigs were intravenously injected with Evans blue to assess blood-brain barrier disruption. The degree of inflammation was estimated using a histological score (ISC) based on the extent of pericyst inflammation assessed in photomicrographs at 40 amplification.

**Findings:** Parenchym cysterci provoked significantly higher peric inflammation (ISC) after anthelmint treatment compared to meninge and cortic cysterci. ISC of meningeal cysti was not affected by treatment. Cortic cysti increase ISC correlated with extent of cystic adjacent to parenym. Disruption of blood-brain barrier associated with treatment in parenym tissue. Inflammatory response to cysti in meninges significantly decreased compared parenym cysti.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that tissue-specific characteristics modulate inflammatory responses to Taenia sol cysterci in the central nervous system. The suboptimal inflammatory response to cystidal drugs may explain subachoid NCC refractory to treatment compared parenym NCC.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of considering tissue location of cysterci in inflammation after anthelmint treatment. Tissue-specific characteristics may explain differences in inflammation in experimental models and severity of reaction when parasite degenerates naturally or after anthint therapy. The results have implications for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of neurocystercosis.

**Title:** Investigating the Re-emergence of Yaws in Ghana: A Cross-Sectional Study of Treponemal Infections and PCR in Children with Ulcerative Lesions

**Background:** Yaws, caused by Treponema pallidum s. pertue, is reportedly endemic in Ghana, with mass azithromycin distribution being the cornerstone of the WHO eradication campaign. However, ongoing reporting of y raises the possibility that resistance may have emerged in T. pallum. pertue or alternative infections may be responsible for some reported cases.

**Methods:** We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 30 communities in 2 districts of Ghana where DA for trach had previously been conducted. Children aged 5-17 with ulcerative lesions compatible with y were enrolled. Samples for treponal serology and PCR were collected from all children. 90 with 98 were enrolled. Syphilis serology was negative in all. PCR T. pallum s pertue was negative in children, but Haemophil duyi DNA detected in 9 lesions.

**Findings:** In communities previously treated for trach, no evidence of ongoing y transmission was found. H. duyi was associated with a proportion of lesions, but majority remain unexplained. Integration of diagnostic into both pre- and post-DA surveillance is required to inform y control programmes.

**Conclusion:** This study in Northern Ghana found no evidence of active or latent y. Patients had negative treponal and non-treponal serology, indicating never infected with y. Both districts had completed rounds of azithycin M for trach in preceding decade. T. s. pertue or alternative may be responsible for some or all cases in regions. Current suggests Ghana major focus y worldwide, implications for WHO eradication campaign.

**Implications:** Accurate data on y epidemiology is needed to guide eradication efforts. Ongoing y in Ghana, despite rounds azithycin M, raises possibility resistance emerged T. s. pertue. Azithycin mass administration for trach between 2001-2008 in Northern and Upper regions, both report y through surveillance. Y is re-emergent treponal caused T. s. pertue. Early papillomat and ulcer skin, late skin, bony involvement, rarely nasary. Azithycin 30/kg effective, central WHO y strategy.

**Key Findings:**

* No evidence of ongoing y transmission in communities previously treated for trach
* H. duyi associated with proportion of lesions, but majority unexplained
* Integration of diagnostic into pre and post-DA surveillance required
* No evidence of active or latent y in Northern Ghana
* T. s. pertue or alternative may be responsible for some or all cases in regions
* Accurate data on y epidemiology needed for eradication efforts

**Title:** Targeting the Jak-STAT Pathway to Overcome HIV Persistence: A Novel Therapeutic Strategies to Eradicate the Reservoir

**Research Question:** Despite the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV persistence remains a significant challenge due to the establishment and maintenance of the viral reservoir, primarily driven by T cell homeostasis. We investigated the role of the Jak-STAT pathway in HIV persistence and evaluated the efficacy of two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxitin, to block reservoir seeding and maintenance in vitro.

**Methods:** We analyzed the involvement of the Jak-STAT pathway in HIV persistence in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, and evaluated the impact of Jak inhibitors on viral production from infected cells, cytokine-induced reactivation, and transmission to bystander cells. We monitored STAT5 phosphorylation following cytokine stimulation in CD4 T cells and subsets in the presence or absence of inhibitors.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that Jak inhibitors block viral production from infected cells, inhibit cytokine-induced reactivation, and transmission to bystander cells, reducing the frequency of CD4 T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA. We show that Jak-STAT dysregulation is associated with persistence in vivo and that inhibitors target key events downstream cytokine (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15) ligation to receptors, impacting the reservoir magnitude in all CD T subsets. Importantly, inhibitors impede cell activation and proliferation critical for HIV replication and reservoir seeding without affecting effector CD8 responses.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is a key driver of HIV persistence and that inhibitors represent a therapeutic modality to prevent key events of cell activation that regulate persistence. Blockade of these events may be integrated into future curative strategies. We show that Jak inhibitors confer STAT-mediated block homeostasis and inflammation-driven reservoir expansion, effects that may be advantageous as an alternative intervention in curative.

**Conclusions:** Our results confirm the inhibitory impact of ruxitin orfacitin on the Jak-STAT pathway in all CD4 T subsets known to harbor HIV. We demonstrate the association between Jak-STAT and HIV persistence in a cohort of aviremic participants, highlighting the in vivo relevance of Jak-STAT in reservoir establishment and maintenance. These findings provide a novel therapeutic strategy to target HIV persistence and may be implemented in future curative approaches.

**Title:** Investigating the Immune Response of Spodoptera exigua to Baculovirus Infection: Unveiling the Role of Gut Microbiota in Viral Pathogenesis**

**Research Question:** How does Spodoptera exigua respond to baculirus infection, and what is the role of gut microbiota in viral pathogenesis?

**Methods:** We employed microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in S. exigua cells challenged with species-specific baculirus (SeNPV) and generalist baculirus (AcNP). Results revealed a balanced up- and down-regulation of genes in the first 36 hours post-infection, contrasting the expected transcription shut-off during baculirus infection. Immune-related genes, including pattern recognition, signaling, and effector proteins involved in melanization were down-regulated.

**Findings:** Down-regulation of immune genes was confirmed in the larval gut, affecting gut microorganisms responsible for growth and development. We hypothesized that this downregulation affects gut microbiota. An increase in bacterial load was observed, attributed to viral infection. Subsequent experiments in the presence/absence of microbiota revealed gut enhanced baculirus virulence and pathogenicity.

**Implications:** Our study highlights host response pathways affected by baculiruses and the role of gutota in viral infection. Insect immunity was thought to respond to bacteria and fungi, but recent studies show involvement in viral infections. Gene analysis revealed immune-related genes downregulated after baculirus infection, indicating involvement in response. Baculiruses reach gut, a main barrier for systemic infection establishment.

**Conclusions:** Gut microbiota cannot be ignored in studying virus infection. Assuming virus influences immunity for benefit, a question arises: what mechanism baciruses manipulate host responses? Studies show bacir encode microRNAs targeting viral and host genes. Our study extends previous works on lepidoptan species on differential gene expression after bacirus infection.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Apomix: Asexual Reproduction through Mitosis in Arabidopsis thaliana

**Research Question:** How does the replacement of meiosis with mitosis in Arabidopsis thaliana lead to asexual reproduction, and what are the implications for apomis engineering?

**Methods:** We isolated and characterized a novel gene controlling the entry into the second meiotic division, and combined it with mutations affecting key meiotic processes to create the genotype Mi, where meiosis is replaced by mitosis. This resulted in plants producing functional diploid gametes genetically identical to their mother.

**Findings:** In the Mi genotype, meiosis is completely replaced by mitosis, leading to the production of diploid gametes identical to the mother plant. The Mi plants exhibit a fully penetrant apome phenotype, with mit-like division replacing meiosis, and are fertile with quasi-wild-type levels of viable ovules and pollen grains. In contrast, previous reports of apomis in Arabidopsis resulted in only 0.2% viable gametes, making it unusable for apis engineering.

**Implications:** The creation of the Mi genotype and apome phenotype is a crucial step towards understanding and engineering apis. Apis can be separated into three components: absence or alteration of meiosis (apome), fertilization-independent embryo development from the egg (parthenogenesis), and endosperm initiation without fertilization. Our results show that fully penetrant apome can be induced in sexual plants when mit-like division replaces meiosis in the Mi genotype.

**Conclusions:** The replacement of meiosis with mitosis in Arabidopsis leads to asexual reproduction, retaining the parent's genetic information in the gametes. The Mi plants undergo mit-like division instead of normal meiosis without affecting subsequent sexual processes. Meiosis replaced by mitosis results in ploidy doubling with each generation. The Mi genotype and apome provide a valuable tool for understanding and engineering apis, with potential applications in agriculture.

**Title:** Enhancing Gene Prioritization of Disease-Causing Genes with Tissue-Specific Protein-Protein Interaction Networks

**Research Question:** Can incorporating tissue-specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks improve the prioritization of disease-causing genes in the post-genomic era?

**Methods:** We constructed tissue-specific PIs for 60 human tissues by integrating gene expression data with P information and evaluated their prioritization power. We compared the performance of tissue-specific PIs with generic P networks using cross-validation.

**Findings:** Tissue-specific PIs significantly outperformed generic P in prioritization, yielding higher area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and correct gene ranking. We also inferred novel disease-tissue associations, revealing subclinical effects that may escape detection.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of incorporating tissue-specific information in gene prioritization, especially when disease-related genes are expressed in associated tissues. We demonstrate that tissue-specific PIs can improve prediction accuracy and identify novel disease-tissue associations.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first large-scale assessment of tissue-specific contribution to gene prioritization. Our results show that tissue-specific PIs are superior to generic P networks in prioritizing disease-causing genes and predicting diseaseissue associations. We propose tissue-specific PIs as a valuable tool for identifying subclinical effects and improving disease diagnosis.

**Title:** A Flexible Two-Locus Model for the Spread of Insecticide Resistance in Mosquitoes: Investigating the Merits of Sequential and Mixture Deployment Strategies

**Research Question:** How do sequential and mixture deployment strategies of insecticides affect the spread of resistance in mosquito populations that transmit human diseases such as malaria?

**Methods:** We developed a two-locus model that allows for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide, and varying selection pressures and dominance values depending on insecticide concentration. We applied this model to investigate the relative merits of sequential versus mixture deployment to minimize resistance spread over 500 generations (approximately 40 years).

**Findings:** In 24% of runs, mixtures outperformed sequential use, while 56% favored sequential and 44 favored mixtures. Mixtures were favored when insect effectiveness was high and exposure was low. If insecticides did not reliably kill homozygous genotypes, sequential was more robust. Resistance spread slower when insect used in mixture, although insufficient to outperform sequential (e.g., mixture lasted 5 years, individually 3-4 years, overall lifespan 7 years).

**Implications:** Our model can identify control strategies to minimize resistance spread. Deploying new insecticide with low-resistance levels may delay resistance spread. Results depend on attributes of insect, application, behavior, and genetics. Mixtures favored when effectiveness is high, which may be case with new insecticides under development.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates applying modern modeling techniques to questions raised by Curtis. Results indicate performance depends on attributes of insect, application, behavior, and genetics. We do not advocate mixtures or sequential as universal policy, but show how powerful techniques can be applied to research questions. Timeframe is arbitrary, and effectiveness and exposure affect time to resistance (Fig. 9). We focused on genetic arguments (minimizing spread) and neglected operational implications (e.g., cost, impacts on non-vector species, environment, commercial, risk).

**Title:** Elucidating the Salivary Proteome of Triatoma neglectus, a Vector of Chagas Disease: Insights into Hematophagy and Vector-Host Interactions

**Research Question:** What is the composition of the salivaryome of Triatoma neglectus, a hematophagous insect vector of Chagas disease, and how do its secreted proteins interact with vertebrate hosts?

**Methods:** Next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics were employed to investigate the salivaryome of Trioma neglectus. A total of 4,230 DNA sequences were deposited in GenBank, and 636 putative secretory proteins were extracted from assembled reads, 73 of which were confirmed by proteomic analysis.

**Findings:** The salivome of Trioma neglect was characterized by the presence of serine proteases, lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, antigen-5 metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding proteins. Notably, serine proteases were the most abundant protein family, with only one detected by proteomic analysis, despite high number of transcripts assigned to this subclass.

**Implications:** This study expands our understanding of hematophag arthropod salivomes and the complex interplay among vectors and vertebrate hosts. Analysis of salivary secret products of Trioma might be involved in vector-host interactions shares similarity with other triine species, which can be infected and transmit protozoan. Deep sequencing increases possibilities of finding new biological molecules in saliva of blood-sucking insects, offering new substances to be investigated and functionally characterized.

**Conclusions:** The salivome of Trioma was organized into subclasses, including known families present in hematag saliva, such as lipin, nitrophin, antigen-5, and families not reported in triine, such as serine and disintegr (Table 3). Putative secreted proteins present in Trioma highlighted the remarkable finding of serineases in this group. Other soluble proteins predicted secreted by arthropods were metalloproase, antigen-5, serpin, and tryp-like protease, with least observation. The expression of putative tryp-like serases in Trioma correlates with blood sources this species triine, their role and conserved secreted proteins in hematagy should be analyzed in future.

**Title:** Investigating the Functional Significance of Differentially Expressed Genes in Caenorhabitis elegans in Response to Bacterial Environments

**Research Question:** Do differentially expressed genes in Caenorhabitis elegans in response to bacterial environments predict their functional importance in those environments?

**Methods:** We employed Caenorhabitis elegans as a model organism to investigate the interaction between nematodes and bacteria in soil. We isolated bacteria from grassland soils and exposed C. elegans to different bacterial environments using transcriptional profiling to identify candidate genes regulated in response. Mutations in 21 of the identified genes were used to determine their contribution to lifespan and fitness in bacterial environments.

**Findings:** Many regulated genes were predicted to affect metabolism and innate immunity, suggesting they influence nemat community dynamics in natural systems. Regression analysis showed that the degree of differential expression between environments predicted the magnitude of gene loss-of-function effect on life traits in those environments.

**Implications:** This study addresses the expectation that differential expression is predictive of functional importance. Although C. elegans is not abundant in grass soils, it is related to relevant nemat taxa, making it an excellent model for understanding nemat-bacterial interactions. Our results demonstrate that changes in food source, as occur in environmental disturbances, have large effects on gene expression and fitness.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the significance of differentially expressed genes in C. elegans response to bacterial environments and their potential influence on nemat community dynamics in natural systems. The use of C. elegans as a model for conserved genes involved in nemat-bacterial interactions provides insights into naturally occurring nemat-bacterial interactions in soil.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Stochasticity in the Establishment of the Inner Cell Mass and Trophoectoderm in Mammalian Embry Development

**Research Question:** What is the role of stochasticity in the establishment of the inner cell mass (ICM) and trophoectoderm (TE) in mammalian embryo development, and how does it contribute to the robustness of these structures?

**Methods:** We employed multi-scale modeling to investigate the design principles responsible for the establishment of these structures. We used quantitative imaging to validate our predictions.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that stochasticity in the expression of critical genes promotes plasticity and plays a crucial role in accurately organizing the developing blastocyst. Asymmetry in levels of variation (fluctuation) of Cdx2 and Oct4 provide a means to gain the benefits of noise-mediated plasticity while ameliorating the detrimental effects of stochasticity. By controlling the timing and pace of cell specification, the embryo temporally modulates plasticity and creates a window during which cells can continually read their environment and adjust their fate.

**Implications:** These results suggest that noise has a crucial role in maintaining plasticity and organizing the blastocyst. Our findings support the hypothesis that gene expression has a substantial influence on TE/ICM organization and adds robustness to the correct arrangement of blastysts.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that noise has a critical role in helping the mechanism deal with ambiguities and imperfections of positional information central to the regulative model. Asymmetries in noise sources, predicted and confirmed by gene quantification, provide a mechanism to promote noise-mediated plasticity without overwhelming dynamics. Mammalian fate specification is a gradual, rather than switch-like process, providing a time for noise to fix inevitable errors. We conclude that noise-induced plasticity has the capacity to improve organization.

**Research Question:** Can germl-encoded antibodies exhibit polyspecific binding to diverse antigens, and if so, what are the structural basis for this recognition?

**Methods:** We computationally redesigned antibodies encoded by a common VH gene, but binding to different antigens, using the Rosetta multi-state design process to predict sequences for the entire heavy chain region, including framework, CDR, and CDR mutations. We compared the predicted sequences to germl gene sequences and found remarkable similarity, revealing residues enabling polyspecific binding.

**Findings:** The Rosetta design captured aspects of antibody-antigen recognition, and identified key positions in VH encoding CDR, CDR, and immunoglobulin framework critical for polyspecificity in germl antibodies. In contrast, designing to bind a single antigen, similar to mature sequence was returned, mimicking natural maturation in silico. Sets of antibody-antigen complexes incorporating antibodies from common germl VH were input into Rosetta multi-state design, recovering optimal sequence to bind all antigens simultaneously. These sequences were inherently flexible, accommodating diverse conformations to bind multiple antigens.

**Implications:** Our approach predicts germl and mature sequences in silico without prior knowledge, an important step towards rational design. Polyspecific antibodies are largely encoded by germl sequences, and designing for polyspecific sequences recovered germl gene-encoded, while monospecific to single returned mature. This trend increased with somatic mutations accumulated, optimizing the antibody.

**Conclusions:** Germl-encoded antibodies exhibit polyspecific binding to diverse antigens due to structural flexibility in the germl gene. The Rosetta multi-state design captures antibody-ant recognition and identifies key positions in VH, CDR, C, and immunoglobulin framework contributing to polyspecificity. Our approach predicts germl and mature in silico without prior knowledge, enabling rational design of polyspecific antibodies for diverse epitope binding.

**Title:** Modeling the Emergence of Locust Hopper Bands: A Quantitative Analysis of Phase Transition from Solitar to Gregarious Behavior

**Research Question:** How do locusts transition from solitary to gregarious behavior, leading to the formation of destructive hopper bands, and what are the conditions necessary for this transition to occur?

**Methods:** We developed a partial integrodifferential equation model incorporating the interplay between phase change and spatial movement at the individual level to predict the dynamics of hopper formation at the population level. We analyzed the stability of our model to reveal conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large transition to the gregar phase.

**Findings:** Our model enables the quantification of the dynamics of each phase, the proportion of the population that will gregarize, and the time for this to occur. Numerical simulations describe the aggregation's structure, revealing transient clumps of gregar insects. Predictions of aggregation and gregar suggest possible future biological experiments.

**Implications:** This study addresses the problem of collective gregarization, a key process before locust outbreak emergence, by linking individual-level phase change and interphase interactions to the gregar hopper band as a whole. We investigate the onset of outbreak by constructing a continuum model of behavioral for gregar and solitar locusts, classifying dynamics in wide parameter space. We find that low densities, both phases are spread and solitar dominates, while large populations, a dense gregar patch emerges, and solitar becomes scarce. We identify loc clustering at high densities with hop band onset. Analysis yields critical density for gregar forms and ratio gregar to solitar.

**Conclusions:** Our model provides a framework for understanding the transition from solitary to gregar behavior, necessary for destructive locust outbreaks. By linking individual-level phase change and interphase interactions, we predict the dynamics of gregar hop bands, enabling the quantification of temporal and spatial structure. Numerical simulations illustrate rapid transitions once gregar initiated, dense gregar packs form and sweep solitar in vicinity. This study has implications for understanding locust biology, ecology, and potential management strategies to prevent destructive outbreaks.

**Title:** Dissecting the Flavivirus Fusion Pathway: A Novel Insights into the Mechanism of Viral Membrane Fusion**

**Research Question:** How do flaviviruses mediate membrane fusion, and what are the intermediate structures involved in this process?

**Methods:** We used tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) as a model to dissect the class II flavivirus fusion pathway and structural rearrangements of the envelope protein E. We employed an in vitro liposome fusion assay with pyrene phospholipid-labeled and unilamellar liposomes at pH 5.4, 8.0, and 10.0 to investigate the effect of alkaline pH on the fusion process.

**Findings:** Exposure to alkaline pH (pH 10.0) traps particles in an intermediate conformation where E dimers dissociate and interact with membranes via fusion peptide without proceeding to merger. Subsequent treatment to low pH (pH 5.4) leads to fusion, suggesting these monomers correspond to an elusive intermediate required to convert prefusion dimer to postfusion trimer.

**Implications:** The use of non-physiological conditions allows dissection of the flavivirus fusion process and identification of two separate steps: membrane insertion of multiple E monomers precedes formation of hair-like trimers. This sequence provides new insights into the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel intermediate in the flavivirus fusion pathway, where E monomers interact with membranes before formation of hair-like trimers. This challenges current models of viral fusion and highlights the importance of intermediate structures in initiation and completion of the process. The use of non-physiological conditions enables dissection of the flavivirus process, providing a new understanding of the dynamic of viral membrane fusion.

**Title:** Unraveling the Drivers of Plant Extinction in a Biodiversity Hotspots: A Case Study of the Cape Flor of South Africa

**Research Question:** What are the underlying drivers of extinction risk in plant species in the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot, and how do they differ from those recognized for vertebrates?

**Methods:** We compared the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk between the British and South African floras, using Red List data, and constructed a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape to reveal phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant extinctions. We analyzed the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades to suggest that mode of speciation best explains the phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages in the Cape and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. Critically, we find that the most vulnerable species are marching towards extinction at a rapid pace, independently from anthropogenic effects. The taxonomic distribution of extinction differs significantly between regions, inconsistent with a simple, trait-based model of extinction.

**Implications:** Our findings have important implications for conservation priorities and cast doubts on the utility of Red List criteria for plants in regions like the Cape, where speciation has been rapid. Our aim is to maximize preservation of the tree-of-life.

**Conclusions:** Our results show that explanations for elevated risk in plants of the Cape flora differ from those recognized for vertebrates. In contrast to vertebrates, where traits such as body size, fecundity, and geographic range are predictors of vulnerability, young and fast-evolving plant lineages are at higher risk in the Cape. Our study highlights the need for detailed knowledge of interspecific phylogen relationships to estimate the impact of extinctions on the loss of evolutionary history across the angperm tree-of-life.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav in Dectin-1 Mediated Phagocytosis of Candida albicans

**Research Question:** How do Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (B) and Vav interact with Dectin-1 to facilitate phagocytosis of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of BTK and Vav in Dect-1 mediated phocytosis of C. albicans using RAW-Dect1 macrophages, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and BTK or Vav-deficient mice. Immunofluorescence and immunoblot were used to analyze protein localization and expression during phocytosis.

**Findings:** BTK and V1 are recruited to phagytic cups containing C. alb yeasts or hyphae but absent from mature phagosomes. B and V localize to cuff surrounding hye while Dect-1 lines full phagosome. B and V colocalize with PI (3,4,5)P3 and F-act at phytic cup but not diacylglycerol (DAG) which marks mature phosomal membranes. Selective B inhibitor shows B contributes to DAG synthesis at phytic cup and subsequent PK recruitment. B or V-deficient macrophages display defect in C. alb phocytosis. Bone marrow macrophages lacking B or V show reduced C. alb uptake comparable toect-1 deficient cells. B or V-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C infection.

**Implications:** This study identifies an important role for B and V in immune responses against C. Our findings suggest that B and V interact withect-1 to facilitate phytosis through PI3,4,5P3 formation and F-act recruitment.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the significance of B and V in D-1 mediated phocytosis C. Our results demonstrate that B and V interact withect-1 to facilitate phyt through PI3,4,5P formation and F- recruitment. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of D-1 mediated phytosis and highlight the importance of B and V in immune responses against C.

**Title:** Environmental and Behavioral Factors Contributing to Rift Valley Fever Transmission in Madagascar: A Mixed-Methods Study

**Research Question:** What are the environmental and behavioral factors contributing to Rift Valley Fever (RV) transmission in cattle and humans in Madagascar, and which areas are at high-risk for transmission?

**Methods:** We employed a mixed-methods approach combining Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) to characterize Malagasy environments and Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to analyze cattle and human serological data at the national level. Serological status (cattle or human) was the response variable, and FA factors, as well as potential risk factors (cattle density, behavior) were explanatory variables.

**Findings:** Our results showed that humid environments (p<0.001) and high cattle density (p<0.01, OR=2.6) were positively associated with cattle seroprevalence. Frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection (OR=1.6). We identified eastern, western, and northwestern parts as high-risk areas for RV transmission in cattle.

**Implications:** Our integrated analysis of environmental and human datasets provides new insights into RV transmission patterns in Madagascar. The association between serrevalence, humid environments, and cattle density suggests concomitant vector and direct transmissions are critical for enzootic transmission. In at-risk environments western, northwestern, and eastern areas, suitable Cule and Anophe mosquitoes vector transmission probably occurs in both cattle and human. The relative contribution of vector or direct transmissions can be assessed by modeling.

**Conclusion:** Our study highlights the importance of understanding the roles of direct and vector transmissions in human and cattle, which vary among eco-climatic areas. Madagascar has experienced two major RV outbreaks: 1991 in eastern-coast highlands and 2009 in south, north highlands. There is a need to provide insight into the two transmission routes and adapt control measures. Our objectives were (i) to identify environmental factors favorable RV transmission to cattle and human and (ii) human behaviors in Malag contexts. Our prediction is based on cattle infection attributed to local larger-risk areas western Madagascar. The discrepancy between our study and Anyamba et al. may be methodological differences. Our M classification is in accordance Malag ecosystems.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Prion Transmission between Non-identical Proteins: A Study of the Rq1 Prion System in Yeast

**Research Question:** The transmission of prion state between non-identical proteins, such as homologous proteins from different species, is frequently inefficient, and barriers attributed to sequence differences in prion proteins. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study aims to explore the nature of transmission barriers using a yeast Rq1[PIN]-based system.

**Methods:** We employed a yeast Rq1[PIN]-based system to investigate the transmission of the prion state between Rq1, a common in wild and laboratory yeast strains, which facilitates the appearance of other prions. The R1 prion domain carries four Q-rich regions, and we analyzed the role of these regions in amyloid formation in vitro and transmission in vivo.

**Findings:** Our results show that R1 encompasses multiple prion determinants that independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the prion state in vivo. Subsequent analysis of PIN transmission between R1 fragments with different pr determinants established that: (i) one Q-rich region is required and sufficient for transmission; (ii) despite identical sequences of QNs, transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength. The existence of barriers in the absence of amino mismatches in regions indicates that pr domains multiple pr determinants cooperatively attain the pr conformation, and transmission determined by cooperative fold.

**Implications:** This study reveals that R1 prion domain carries multiple determinants capable of independently supporting the pr state, and that transmission is determined by cooperative fold. The Q1 region, located in the C-terminus, is not essential for maintenance of pr state, suggesting that R1 prion carries multiple determinants capable of independently supporting pr state. Furthermore, Q1 inability to maintain pr state is not unexpected, as Q1 region lacks oligopeptide repeats and residues hypothesized to facilitate fragmentation of amy aggregates.

**Conclusions:** This study provides insights into the mechanisms of prion transmission between nonident proteins, highlighting the importance of cooperative interactions between pr determinants in attaining pr conformation and transmission. The findings have implications for understanding prion diseases, which manifest distinct pr conformations of same protein, despite amino sequence, and transmission barriers. The R1 prion system, found in industrial and pathogenic yeast isolates, stands out as a model for studying prion transmission.

**Title:** Leveraging Deep Learning for Likelihood-Free Inference in Population Genetics: A Novel Framework for Joint Inference of Demography and Selection

**Research Question:** Given the computational infeasibility of computing likelihood for complex population genetic models, we introduce a novel likelihood-free framework using deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique, to infer population parameters from genomic data.

**Methods:** We employ multilayer neural networks to learn a feature function from input (e.g., hundreds of correlated statistics) to output (e.g., genetic parameters of interest). We demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning for population inference and feature learning from data.

**Findings:** We apply our method to 197 Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia, inferring demography and regions under selection. We find regions with hard sweeps, soft, and balancing selection, with soft and balancing occurring closer to the centromere. Demographic inference suggests previously estimated bottlenecks are too extreme.

**Implications:** Deep learning provides a new framework for population analysis, distinguishing informative from uninformative statistics. We present two methods for extracting statistics from trained networks. Deep has been applied in neuroscience and biology, but not population genetics. Our method accommodates complex models and complements existing likelihood-free inference.

**Conclusions:** Deep learning is a promising for population genetics, providing a complimentary approach to ABC and other likelihood-free methods. It can select statistics for ABC or other methods. We see it as an extension, not replacement, of ABC or SVM. Hybrid approaches could be fruitful, extending generality and usefulness. We will apply to wider scenarios in genetics.

**Title:** Persistent Expression of High-Risk HPV Oncogenes Necessary for Anogenital and Oropharyngeal Cancers: Mechanisms of Disrupting the Fanconi Anemia DNA Repair Pathway

**Research Question:** How do high-risk HPV oncogenes, such as E6/E7, contribute to the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers by disrupting the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, leading to genomic instability and resistance to cisplatin therapies?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of E/E7 expression on the FA pathway using a combination of biochemical and cell biological approaches, including Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and cell fractionation.

**Findings:** Our results show that E/E expressing cells are hypersensitive to cisplatin and have defects in DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair. Importantly, we elucidated how E/E attenuates the FA pathway by increasing Fanc2 monoubiquination and foci formation, but inhibiting the completion of repair by multiple mechanisms. E/E impaired Fanc2 colocalization with double-strand breaks (DSB), hindering the recruitment of downstream protein Rad51 to DSB in E cells. Further, E expression delayed F2 deubiquination, an essential for ICL repair. Delayed F2 deubination was associated with chromatin retention of F, hindering US1 deubiquinating activity and persistently activated ATR/CHK-1/p565 F signaling. E mediated p53 degradation did not hamper the cycle process of F2 modifications but abrogated repair by disrupting F deubination. Additionally, E reduced expression and foci of Pal2, a protein downstream of F2.

**Implications:** These findings uncover unique mechanisms by which HPV oncogen contribute to genomic instability and response to cisatin therapies. Our results provide a mechanistic framework for HR-HPV oncogen disruption of the FA pathway.

**Conclusions:** The persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogen, such as E/E, is necessary for the development of anital and oraryngeal cancers by disrupting the FA pathway, leading to genomic instability and resistance to cisatin therapies. Our study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms by which HPV oncogen contribute to cancer development and resistance to therapies.

**Title:** Interruption of Onchocercias Transmission in the Southern Chiapas Focus, Mexico: Epidemiological and Entomological Evidence

**Research Question:** Can semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin for 11 years lead to the interruption of onchercias transmission in the Southern Chiapas focus, Mexico?

**Methods:** In-depth epidemiological and entomological assessments were conducted in six sentinel communities with 2 rounds of iverectin treatment per year and three extra-sent communities with 4 rounds iverin treatment per year. Simulium ochrace s. l. flies were collected and tested for parasite DNA using PCR-ELISA, and serological testing for Onocerca volulus exposure was conducted on 4,230 children under 5 years.

**Findings:** None of 67,924 Simium ochrace s. l. collected during the dry season 2011 contained parasite DNA, with an upper bound of 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of infective rate of 0.06/2,000 flies examined. Serological testing revealed 2/4,230 individuals (0.05%) exposed to O. volulus.

**Implications:** The in-depthological and entological findings meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community. The goal of the Onocercias Elimination Program for the Americas is to eliminate ocular morbidity caused by O. volulus and transmission in all 13 foci in Latin America. The population at risk in Southern Chiapas (114,024) comprised 21% of total at-risk in Americas.

**Conclusions:** Semiannual iverect treatment for 11 years has led to the interruption of onerc transmission in the Southern Chi focus, Mexico. This achievement is a significant milestone in the Onercias Elimination Program for the Americas. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of mass iverect treatment in reducing transmission and highlights the importance of continued efforts to eliminate ocular morbidity caused by O. volulus.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel Peptide Pherone, pPA, Secreted by Listeria monocytogen that Enhances Escape from Host Vacuoles and Facilitates PrA Activation

**Background:** Listeria monocytogen is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular pathogen that invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cytos. The gene products required for intracellular growth and spread are regulated by a transcriptional activator, PrA. However, the signal that stimulates PrA activation has not been defined.

**Research Question:** What is the role of a novel peptide pherone, pA, secreted by L. monocytogen, in enhancing escape from host vacoles and facilitating PrA activation?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of pA lipoprotein and pA peptide in L monocytogen physiology and mammalian infection using mutational analysis and experimental approaches.

**Findings:** We found that pA lipop is dispensable for pathogenesis, but bacteria lacking pA peptide are significantly attenuated for virulence in mice and have reduced efficiency of escape from vacoles of non-professional phagoc cells. Mutational of PrA restores virulence and eliminates need for pA-dependent signaling. Experimental evidence suggests pA peptide helps L monocogen signal its presence within host vacole, stimulating expression of products contributing to vacole escape and facilitating PrA to promote growth within cytos.

**Implications:** Our data propose a working model for role of pA in monocogen pathogenesis: L monocogen produces basal pA secreted through general secretory pathway. Following PrA activation, pA is cleaved and processed to p peptide, enhancing escape from host vacoles and required for full virulence.

**Conclusions:** We identified a novel peptide pherone, p, secreted by L monocogen, that enhances escape from host vacoles and facilitates Pr activation. Our findings suggest pA may signal L monocogen presence within host vacole, stimulating expression of products contributing to vac escape and facilitating Pr to promote growth within cytos. This study provides new insights into L monocogen pathogenesis and highlights the importance of pherone signaling in bacterial virulence.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Vibrio cholera's Adaptation to Reactive Oxygen Species during Infection: A Whole-Genome Transposon Sequencing Analysis

**Research Question:** How does Vibrio cholera, the causative agent of cholera, adapt to combat host-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) during infection?

**Methods:** We employed whole-genome transposon sequencing (T-seq) to compare gene requirements for colonization in adult mice with and without treatment of the antioxidant N-acetyl cystine (NAC) to dissect the molecular mechanisms utilized by V. cholera to overcome ROS in vivo.

**Findings:** Mutants of the methyl-directed repair (MR) system, such as MutS, displayed significant colonization advantages in untreated, ROS-rich mice but not N-treated mice. Further analyses suggest the accumulation of catalase-producing and rugose variants in N- mice was the cause of Mut mutant enrichment by oxidative stress during infection. Rugose variants could revert to smooth colonies upon aerobic in vitro. The mutation rate of wildtype colonized in N mice was significantly higher than in N+ mice.

**Implications:** These findings support a paradigm in which V. cholera employs a temporal strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes. Moreover, ΔS passage and complementation can be used to model hypermutation in diverse pathogens to identify stress mechanisms.

**Conclusions:** Our T-se screen revealed that V cholera genes involved in ROS resistance during colonization. Deletion of Mut, a key component of the MR system, results in a colonization advantage in ROS mice. We propose that V cholera utilizes increased mutation rates as a strategy to adopt advantageous phenotypes during ROS infection. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of V cholera's adaptability, enabling it to overcome hostile environments.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Mlh-M3 in Meiotic Recombination and Mismatch Repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

**Research Question:** How does Mlh-M3 function in both meiotic recombination and mismatch repair (MMR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Mlh-M in meiotic recombination and MMR by analyzing five new Mlh alleles in baker's yeast. Five alleles specifically disrupted MMR, while one (Mlh-32) specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. Mlh-M representatives from each class were purified and characterized. Both Mlh-M32 (MR+, crossover-) and Mlh45 (MR-, crossover+) displayed wild-type endonuc activities in vitro. M2sh-M, an SH complex that acts with M-M in MMR, stimulated endon activity of M32 but not M45, suggesting M45 is defective in SH interactions.

**Findings:** Whole-genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type, M+ crossover, MR-, endonuc defective, and M mutants in S288/Y789 background. Compared to wild-type, all M mutants showed increases in number of non-crossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative pathways.

**Implications:** Our results provide a structure-function map for M that highlights the importance of protein-protein interactions regulating M's enzymatic activity. They also illustrate how defective meiotic components can alter fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing insights into how meiotic pathways are regulated.

**Conclusion:** Mlh-M plays a crucial role in both meiotic recombination and MMR, and its enduc activity is required for both functions. Protein-protein interactions are essential for M's enzymatic activity, and defects in these interactions can lead to aberrant meiotic recombination. Our findings have implications for understanding how meiotic recombination is regulated and how defects in meiotic components can lead to aberrant recombination.

**Title:** Heterogeneity in Host Contact Structure Modulates the Reversion Dynamics of Antibiotic Resistance in Pathogens

**Research Question:** How does the heterogeneity in host contact structure influence the reversion dynamics of antibiotic resistance in pathogens, particularly in the context of tuberculosis, malaria, Staphylococcus aureus, and gonorrhea?

**Methods:** We employed a mathematical modeling approach using a non-limiting susceptible-infected-susible (SIS) model on a heterogeneous contact network to investigate the impact of host contact structure on the reversion dynamics of antibiotic resistance. We simulated the dynamics of resistance emergence during treatment and competition between resistant and sensitive strains after treatment discontinuation.

**Findings:** Our results show that heterogeneity in host structure plays a crucial role in reversion dynamics, both during and after treatment. Contact structure leads to non-random distribution of resistant strains among the population and affects competition, resulting in mitigation of fitness advantages. Consequently, we observed lower rates of reversion and lower probability of reversion to sensitivity on the population level after treatment is stopped. Simulations revealed that impact of heterogeneity is maximal in biologically plausible range, when fitness costs of resistance are small.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of host structure in reversion dynamics, particularly when costs of resistance are small, a common in many pathogen-drug combinations. Modulating effects of host structure on reversion probability is strongest in biologically relevant when fitness differences between sensitive and resistant strains are small. This framework allows studying emergence of resistance during treatment and competition between resistant and sensitive strains after treatment is discontinued.

**Conclusions:** Heterogeneity in host structure modulates reversion dynamics of antibiotic resistance pathogens, particularly when fitness of resistance is low. Our findings have implications for understanding and managing antibiotic resistance, particularly in diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, Staphlococcus aureus, and gonorrhea, where resistance has led to discontinuation of older drugs.

**Title:** Investigating Combinatorial Effects of Genetic Variants in Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Drosophila Model Reveals Synergistic Interactions between Candidate Genes

**Research Question:** Despite the high heritability of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and the identification of numerous highly penetrant gene variants, the causal role of combinatorial effects from multiple loci remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the synergistic interactions between candidate genes affected by de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals with ASD.

**Methods:** We examined synaptic and circadian phenotypes resulting from dosage of human-fly orthologs in Drosila, observing synergistic interactions between pairs of informatically-identified candidate genes orthologs jointly affected by large CNVs. CNs were found in the genomes of individuals with autism, including a patient with 22q11.2 deletion. We demonstrated dosage alterations of Dila orthologs of candidate genes from CNs displaying single gene defects similar to previously reported Dila models of ASD variants.

**Findings:** Pairwise changes in the set of orthologs of genes affected by the same human CN showed significant synergistic effects following simultaneous change of gene pairs from CN. Phenotypic variation at Dila synapse resulting from interacting variants supported concord phenotypic outcome across interacting pairs following direction of gene number change. We observed specificity and transitivity between interactors within and between CN candidate sets, supporting distinct genetic etiologies. Different interactions affected divergent processes demonstrating distinct molecular etiologies.

**Implications:** This study illustrates mechanisms through which synergistic effects from structural variation contribute to disease. Acknowledging the limited Dila orthologs, we investigated inform-proposed presence of effects in vivo, not exhaustively ascertaining combinator effects between all copy changed genes in autism.

**Conclusion:** Understanding interactions between genes in autism requires tractable, high-throughput in vivo system, particularly as patients possess variants many genes, generating exponential interactions. We modelled effects of gene changes Dila readouts using sets from multigen CNs identified in autism, focusing on orthologs affected by CN whose products participate ASD network and neural functioning. Many CNs affect same pathway and proportion simultaneously multiple interact within pathway, raising possibility combined copy change causally contributes autistic phenotypes.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Brain-Infiltrating CD8+ T Cells in the Development of Experimental Cerebral Malaria during Plasmodium berghei Infection

**Research Question:** Despite the established role of CD8+ T cells in the development of cerebral malaria, the mechanisms through which they mediate their pathogenic activity during infection remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the behavior and interactions of brain-infiltrating CD+ T cells during Plasium berghei infection in C57/6 mice.

**Methods:** Utilizing intravital two-photon microscopy and detailed ex vivo flow cytometry, we investigated the accumulation and behavior of brainfiltrating CD+ T cells in the brains of mice infected with ECM-inducing (P. berg AN) and non-inducing (P. berg NK) infections.

**Findings:** Brainfiltrating CD+ T cells accumulated in the perivascular spaces of mice infected with both ECM-inducing and non-inducing infections. However, periv T cells displayed arrested behavior specifically during P. berg AN infection, despite exhibiting comparable activation phenotypes during both infections. We observed long-term cognate interactions between T cells and CXCR1-bearing antigen-presenting cells within the brains during P berg AN infection, but abrogation of this interaction by depletion of APCs failed to prevent ECM development. Pathogenic CD+ cells colocalized with apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, within the brain during ECM. However, apoptosis was rare and did not result in loss of vasculature or disruption.

**Implications:** Our data indicate that arrest of T in perivascular compartments is a signature of ECM-inducing infection, implying an important role in the development of ECM syndrome.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the behavior and interactions of brainfiltrating CD+ cells during Plasium berg infection, highlighting the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of pathogenic activity during ECM-ind malaria.

**Title:** Investigating the Burden of Tungias in Viga County, Kenya: A Cross-Sectional Study of Prevalence and Associated Factors

**Research Question:** What is the burden of Tungias in Viga County, Kenya, and what are the socio-demographic and environmental factors associated with its occurrence?

**Methods:** This cross-sectional study was conducted in 21 villages in 3 sub-locations of Viga County, Kenya. A total of 437 participants aged 5 years and above were clinically examined for the presence of Tungias after consenting to participate. Diagnosis was made using standard methods. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to assess socio-demographic factors, housing, presence of animals, and knowledge and practices related to Tias. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analysis. GIS was used to map the geographic distribution of Tias in the area.

**Findings:** The overall prevalence of Tias was 21.5% (95% CI 17.7-25.3). Cases were visualized in a map. Multivariate analysis suggested that occurrence of Tias was associated with variables indicating low economic status (monthly income ≤ Ksh 100, adjusted OR 27.85; 95% CI 4.13-187.59, floor 0.36; 0.13-1.024, lack of facilities 4.27 0.82-22.34, age ≤14 27.414 10.02-74.99, no use of closed footwear 1.98 0.987-3.97, and resting inside house 1.93 0.96-3.89.

**Implications:** Tungis is an important health problem in Viga occasioned by low status of people. Factors point to poverty contribute to occurrence ofias. These suggest need design strategies forias cost-effective and accessible.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the burden of Tias in Viga County, Kenya, and associated factors contributing to its occurrence. Understanding these factors is crucial for designing effective control measures. Further research is needed to understand the geographic distribution and burden ofias in other areas.

**Title:** Regulation of Auxin and Cytokinin Signaling in Arabidopsis Roots: A Computational Modeling and Experimental Insights

**Research Question:** How do auxin and cytokinin interact to regulate patterning in Arabidopsis roots, and what is the role of PIN and AUX/LAX auxin transporters in this process?

**Methods:** We developed a computational model of auxin transport in Arabidopsis roots, considering regulation of auxin transporters by aux and cytokinin, and cell shape and polarity. We analyzed the model's predictions and experimentally verified the role of PIN and AUX/LAX transporters in patterning.

**Findings:** Our model reveals that auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response, rather than variations in cytokinin levels, allow for feedbacks that amplify and stabilize auxin maximum. Simulations demonstrate the importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for robustness. We predict and experimentally verify a role of AUX and LAX aux influx transporters in patterning, and show that localisation of PIN generates an aux flux that stabilizes accumulation within the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for aux to accumulate in xylem-pericycle cells, an early step in lateral root initiation. Pericycle cells on xylem poles compete for aux accumulation, consistent with lateral roots not initiated opposite each other.

**Implications:** Our study provides insights into the dynamics of transverse aux transport in Arabid roots, essential for constructing three-dimensional models of aux transport and growth. We show that even cytokinin distribution activates PINs for efficient aux transport to xyle axis patterning, and a gradient around cytok biosynthesis sites is not required. Our results demonstrate the difficulty generating cytokin gradient via diffusion on Arabid root scale. The mutually inhibitory aux-cytokin loop maintains aux maximum in xyle axis, but in reality, aux becomes confined protoxyle, while simulations show sustained aux throughout xyle axis.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of hormonal regulation of aux efflux for robust patterning and the role of PIN and AUX/L transporters in this process. We demonstrate that localisation of PIN generates an aux flux that stabilizes accumulation within xyle axis and provides mechanism for aux to accumulate in xyle-pericycle cells, an early step in lateral root initiation. The model reveals pericycle on xyle poles compete for aux accumulation, consistent with lateral roots not initiated opposite each other. These findings will inform future attempts to construct three-dimensional models of aux transport and growth in Arabid roots.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of Environment-Induced Behavioral Plasticity: CRE-B as a Key Mediator of NPF/NO Signaling in the Migratory Locust

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity in migratory locusts, and how does the neuropeptide F (NPF)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway regulate locomotor activity?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of conserved transcription factor CRE-B (cAMP element-binding protein B) in the NPF/NO signaling pathway and its involvement in phase-related locomotor plasticity in the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria.

**Findings:** We found that CRE-B directly activates brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression by interacting with the N promoter region, and phosphorylation at serine 110 of CRE-B changes in response to population variation and is negatively controlled by N2. RNA interference (RNAi) experiments and behavioral assays validated the involvement of CRE-B in N2-regulated locomotor plasticity. Additionally, protein kinase A (PKA) mediates the effects of N2 on CRE-B phosphorylation and N transcription.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a precise cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity, highlighting the role of CRE-B as a key mediator in the N/NO signaling pathway regulating phase-related locomotor plasticity in migratory locusts. The essential role of CRE-B in locomotor plasticity is achieved through direct control of N transcription under N2 regulation, and PK transmits the effects of N2 on CRE-B phosphorylation.

**Conclusions:** This study extends previous findings by uncovering key components CRE-B and PK in the NNO signaling involved in phase-related locomotor plasticity, shedding light on the regulatory mechanism of N transcription in insects and the contribution of neuromodulator/effector gene to environment-induced behavioral plasticity. The NPY/PKA/CRE-B cascade may represent a common mechanism underlying behavioral plasticity in animals.

**Title:** The Maternal Proteins and mRNAs Drive Early Developmental Stages in Metazoans: Uncovering the Role of Zelda in Maternal-to-Zygotic Transition

**Research Question:** How do maternally deposited proteins and mRNAs regulate early developmental stages in metazo, and what is the role of the zinc-finger protein Zelda (Z) in this process?

**Methods:** Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (Ch-Seq) was used to map regions bound by Zelda (Z) in Drosila embryos at three timepoints: mitotic cycle 8, 13, and 14, during the maternal-to-zyotic (MT) transition.

**Findings:** Although only a handful of genes are transcribed prior to mitotic 10, thousands of regions are bound by Z at cycle 8, most of which remain bound through mitotic 14. Early Z-bound regions include promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this stage, but also Z is bound to promoters of genes whose transcription does not occur until MT and enhancers of transcription factors that regulate gene activation during MT. The association between Z binding and MT is strong, suggesting Z can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with specificity.

**Implications:** This unexpected observation suggests Zelda plays a role in regulating genome activity at MT, not just early transcriptional activation.

**Conclusions:** Zelda is not only required for earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating genome at MT. The strong association between Zelda binding and MT suggests Zelda can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with specificity. This study highlights the complex role of Zelda in early developmental stages of metazo and its potential as a key regulator of genome activity during MT.

**Key Findings:**

* Zelda is bound to thousands of regions in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic 14
* Early-bound regions include promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this stage
* Zelda is also bound to promoters of genes whose transcription does not occur until MT and enhancers of transcription factors that regulate gene activation during MT
* Association between Zelda binding and MT is strong, suggesting Zelda can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with specificity
* Zelda plays a role in regulating genome activity at MT, not just early transcriptional activation

This study provides new insights into the role of Zelda in early developmental stages metazo and its potential as a key regulator of genome activity during MT. The findings suggest Zelda is not only required for earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating genome at MT. The strong association between Zelda binding and MT suggests Zelda can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with specificity. This study highlights the complex role of Zelda in early developmental metazo and its potential as a key regulator of genome during MT.

**Title:** Unveiling the Dynamics of Circadian Protein-Protein Interactions: A Novel Insights into the Temporal Regulation of Cellular Physiology

**Research Question:** What are the dynamics of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among circadian clock proteins, and how do they contribute to the temporal regulation of cellular physiology?

**Methods:** We employed a yeast-two-hybrid approach to identify 109 novel PIs among circadian clock proteins, and constructed a dynamic circadian PI network predicting PI timing using circadian expression data. Systematic circadian phenotyping via RNAi and overexpression revealed crucial components involved in dynamic interactions.

**Findings:** Among the novel PIs, the interaction of phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL resulted in BM1 destabilization. Our dynamic PI network analysis revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, likely restricting interactions to specific phases. Moreover, we predict that circadian PIs dynamically connect many cellular processes (signal transduction, cell cycle, etc.), contributing to temporal organization of physiology in an unprecedented manner.

**Implications:** This study provides a systems-wide view of circadian PI dynamics, highlighting the importance of precisely timed PIs for circadian function. Our findings suggest that circadian PIs are essential for temporal regulation of cellular processes, including transcription, translation, and post-translational modifications, sustaining normal circadian rhythms.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the fundamental role of PIs in circadian clockwork, but highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of the PI network among circadian proteins and their dynamics. The extent of regulation of circadian processes via time-dependent PIs is largely unknown, emphasizing the need for further investigation.

**Title:** Structural Characterization of a Novel Lipid-Binding Protein from Nematodes: Implications for Parasitology and Immunology

**Research Question:** What is the structure and function of Nemat polyprotein allergens (NPAs), a class of lipid-binding proteins found in nematodes, and how do they relate to parasitology and immunology?

**Methods:** The study employed nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the structure of ABA-1, the most common repeating unit of NPA in Ascaris su, a parasitic nematode of humans.

**Findings:** ABA-1 adopts a novel seven-helical fold comprising a central helix and two four-hel bundles on either side, with discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles. Recombinant A-1 contains a tightly-bound ligand of bacterial origin in one of its binding sites.

**Implications:** This is the first mature, post-translationally processed unit of a naturally-occurring tandemly repetitive polyprotein to be structurally characterized from any source and belongs to a new class. NPs have no counterparts in vertebrates, representing potential targets for drug or immunological intervention. The nature of the unidentified ligand may be pertinent to this, as characterization of the unusual sites.

**Conclusions:** Nemat polyprotein allergens are central to transport and distribution of hydrophobic compounds between nemat tissues, may play roles in nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation, and IgE antibody responses in infection. Immune responses to NPs are associated with naturally acquired resistance in humans, the repertoire is under genetic control. The structure of A-1 may contribute to elucidation of a consensus for infection-associated allergens. NPs are of interest for parasitology and protein science.

**Title:** Investigating the Prevalence and Impact of Ciguater Poisoning in Pacific Island Communities: A 25-Year Retrospective Study

**Research Question:** What is the extent of cigu poisoning in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PITCs) and its impact on human and ecosystem health, and how has it changed over time?

**Methods:** A questionnaire was sent to health and fisheries authorities in 17 PICTs to quantify cigater cases from 1998-2008. Data were analyzed using t-test, incidence ratios, correlation, and regression.

**Findings:** 39,677 cases were reported, with a mean annual incidence of 194/100,000 across the region, a 60% increase from 1973-1983. Estimated 500,000 islanders may have suffered cigater in the last 35 years, exceeding global and local estimates.

**Implications:** Ciguater is a major public health concern, expected to increase with environmental change. Well-funded multidisciplinary research is needed to translate advances into practical solutions.

**Conclusion:** Ciguater is a tropical disease underapprecited cause of acute and chronic disease in island communities, increasing in incidence due to vulnerabilities (poverty, warming, eutrophication). Cigu is caused by consumption of coral fish contaminated with cigatoxins from dinoflagates and cyanobacteria. Cigu bioaccumulates in the food web, causing severe neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, and chronic neurologic lasting weeks to months. Cigu can only be detected in fish and Gambdisc, diagnosis in humans based on symptoms, hampering management. Factors associated with cigater include cigato dinlag presence, climate change, coastal degradation, and resource exploitation.

**Research Question:** This study investigates the role of CD4+CD+ T cells in chronic Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, and the impact of benidazole treatment on this subset of cells.

**Methods:** Thirty-eight chronic Chagas patients (20 asymptomatic and 18 symptomatic) and twelve healthy controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble T. cruzi antigens to analyze cytokine and cytotoxic molecule production by CD+CD+ cells before and after benidazole treatment. Expression and co-expression of inhibitory receptors in patients after treatment were studied using multiparameter flow cytometry.

**Findings:** The frequency of CD+CD+ cells was higher in Chagas patients compared to healthy donors. A higher ratio of CD+CD/CD was observed in Chagas patients than donors. CD+ cells from patients expressed co-expressed higher inhibitory receptors in proportion to disease severity. Benidazole reduced frequency CD+ cells and decreased ratio CD/CD. Co-expression of inhibitory was reduced after treatment with enhancement multifunctional capacity CD+ cells. After treatment, increase in frequency T. cruz antigen CD+ cells expressing IL-2 and TN-α was observed.

**Implications:** CD+ cells play a role in controlling T. cruz infection as they produce effector molecules for parasite control. Benid treatment partially reversed exhaustion caused by T cruz infection in cells with improvement T antigen-specific CD+ responses.

**Conclusions:** CD+ cells are an important component of immune response against T cruz during chronic phase Chagas disease. Treatment improves antigen-specific CD+ responses and reverses exhaustion of cells. Results add knowledge concerning immune against T infection, providing tool to analyze benid treatment efficacy in chronic Chagas patients. Degrees co-expression inhibitory observed indicate mixture of functional and exhausted CD+ cells. CD exhaustion in Ch patients associated with T antigen persistence during chronic phase.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Phosphatidylinositol-Specific Phospholipase 2 (PLC) in Phosphoinide Metabolism and Stress Response in Arabidopsis thaliana

**Research Question:** What is the role of phosphatidyospecific phospholipase 2 (PLC) in phosphoinide metabolism and stress response in Arabidopsis thalian, and how does it contribute to seedling growth and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress?

**Methods:** We isolated and analyzed multiple mutants of AtPL isoforms in Arabidopsis, and performed lipomic profiling of phosphoinides to identify the primary phospholase in phosphoin metabolism. We also examined the expression and localization of AtC in different tissues and cell types, and assessed seedling growth and ER stress responses in plc-1 mutants.

**Findings:** Our results show that AtC is the primary phosphase in phosphoin metabolism, involved in seedling growth and ER stress responses. Lipomic profiling of plc mutants revealed increased levels of substrates phosphidyositol 4-phosphate and phosphidyositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating impaired phosphoin metabolic pathway. At displayed distinct expression and localization at the plasma membrane in different cell types, where phosphosignaling occurs. Seedlings of plc-1 showed growth defects complemented by heterologous expression ofC, suggesting phosphospecific phospholase activity byC is required for seed growth. Moreover, plc-1 showed hypersensitivity to ER stress, evidenced by changes in phenotypes and gene profiles.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal the primary enzyme in phosphoin metabolism, its involvement in seedling growth, and emerging link between phosphosignaling and ER response. Given the ER's role in phosphid biosynthesis, phosphosignaling may be associated with ER function. Our results highlight the importance of phosphospecific phospholase in ER tolerance, suggesting a link between phosphosignaling and ER response.

**Conclusions:** AtC is the major phosphase in phosphoin metabolism and seed growth in Arabid, and important for ER tolerance, indicating a link between phosphosign and ER response. This study addresses the issue of multiple AtPL isoforms and their roles in phosphoin metabolism, and highlights the importance of phosphos phosphase in ER stress response, distinct from animal research. Plants may possess a regulatory mechanism to transduce phosphosign under ER stress.

**Title:** Challenging Reductionism: Emergence of Causation at the Macro Level through Intrinsic-Effect Power

**Research Question:** Does the reductionist assumption that causation occurs exclusively at the micro level, excluding emergence at the macro level, hold true? Can macro-level systems exhibit higher intrinsic-effect power than their micro constituents?

**Methods:** We employed a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic-effect power-integrated (Φ) to evaluate systems across spatial and temporal scales, considering all possible black-box elements consisting of one or more micro elements with one or more updates. Cause-effect power was assessed based on inputs and outputs, ignoring internal elements supporting input-output functions.

**Findings:** Our results show that black-box elements can have more inputs and outputs than corresponding micro elements, revealing emergent mechanisms and constraints not apparent at the micro level. Macro-box systems can exhibit higher Φ than micro constituents with more interconnected mechanisms and higher integration. For a given system, local maxima of Φ can be identified across spatiotemporal scales.

**Implications:** Our findings refute the reductionist assumption that causal power resides exclusively at the micro level, as intrinsic-effect captures causal power. Evaluating black systems across spatiemporal scales reveals local maxima of macro-effect, where integrated information decreases to zero. Local max capture emergent roles of black macro elements, corresponding to system descriptions as NOR, OR, AND, or MAJ elements.

**Conclusions:** Our framework demonstrates a theoretical approach to evaluate cause-effect and cause properties of black systems. Emergent properties include increased intrinsic power and relationships between elements (mechanisms) only apparent at the macro. Quantifying intrinsic power and mechanisms at micro and macro levels using the interventional counterfactual framework of integrated theory [23, 24] supports our results.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Reductionism's assumption challenged by intrinsic-effect power-integrated measure
* Macro systems can exhibit higher intrinsic power than micro constituents
* Local maxima of macro-effect identified across spatiemp scales
* Emergent properties captured by intrinsic power and relationships between elements
* Theoretical framework for evaluating cause-effect and cause properties of black systems

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Reactive Oxygen Species Production in the Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain: A Theoretical and Experimental Insights

**Research Question:** How do reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in the mitochondrial respiratory chain modulate cellular adaptation to environmental conditions and contribute to cellular damage under hypoxia/reoxygenation relevant to various diseases, and what are the determinants of ROS production?

**Methods:** We extended a rule-based model of complex III to account for electron transport in the respiratory chain coupled to proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical generation, TCA reactions, and substrate transport to mitochondria. We measured respiratory fluxes in rat mitochondria fueled by succinate, pyruvate, and mal, and dynamics of N+ reduction by reverse transport from succ through complex I.

**Findings:** Fitting of measured characteristics provided insight into mechanisms governing formation of free radicals that transfer unpaired electrons to oxygen, producing superoxide and initiating ROS. Our analysis revealed association of ROS production with specific electron transporters and combinations in complexes I and III. The phenomenon of bistability, previously observed in complex III, remained valid for the whole respiratory chain. Conditions for switching to a state with high free radicals in III were predicted theoretically and confirmed.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insights into mechanisms of ROS production in the respiratory chain. The model describes various states formed in electron transport, including those containing free radicals, which could be responsible for passing unpaired electrons to oxygen, forming superoxide and ROS. Contributions of radicals to ROS remain unknown; we compared production and levels predicted by the model for the same conditions.

**Conclusions:** ROS are products of electron transport in the respiratory chain, a component of energy transformation in mitochondria. Generation starts with superoxide as result of interaction oxygen and free radicals, e.g. semiquone. This active can be deactivated through superoxide dismutase. A change in radical and ROS indicates accordance between the model and process, validating the model. Inhibition of reverse transport by roten decreases ROS in succ-fueled mitochondria. Our measurements ROS was inhibited after roten addition. Sets of parameters fit data similar patterns for radicals in I and III, providing insight into respiration and ROS without precise evaluation.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Mutations in Motor Proteins on Intracellular Transport: A Semi-analytical Analysis of Cargo Transport by Multiple Motors

**Research Question:** How do mutations in motor proteins affect intracellular transport, particularly in the presence of wild-type motors, and what are the implications for neurodegenerative diseases?

**Methods:** We developed a semi-analytical method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors with distinct properties, enabling computation of biologically relevant quantities like velocity and run-length without Monte Carlo simulations. This technique determines transition rates between various configurations of motors carrying cargo using transition rates between absolute configurations.

**Findings:** Results indicate that mutants with altered stall forces determine average velocity and run-length even when outnumbered by wild motors in ensemble. Mutants gain competitive advantage and increase expected run-length when load in vicinity of mutant's stalling or multiple stalling force.

**Implications:** Mutations in motor proteins, such as phosphorylation of kines motor domain at serine residue, are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's. Our study reveals emergent transport behaviors when cargo transported by multiple motors, some mutated, some not. Analyzing impact of Ser-175 kines mutation on transport in presence of wild motors informs understanding of mutant impact on intracellular transport and disease onset.

**Conclusion:** Disruptions motor functions linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular disorders, heart disease, utine complications, high blood pressure. Mechano-chemical behavior single motor along microtub substrate transport cargo well understood. Our semi-analy method introduces alterations parameters model mutation ser residue compute effect on carried mixture wild and mutant-proteins.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of CAC1 Gene in Learning: A Novel Insights into Behavioral Strategies and Implications for Psychiatric Disorders

**Research Question:** How does the selective ablation of the CAC1 gene modulate the learning process in mice, and what are the implications for psychiatric disorders?

**Methods:** We employed a detailed analysis of individual-level learning on an operant cue task in terms of behavioral strategies, combined with Bayesian computational models estimated from empirical data to examine the effect of CAC1 knockout on learning in mice.

**Findings:** Our results show that CAC1 knockout does not impair learning in general, but has a specific effect: majority of C1 knockout mice managed to increase reward across trials by adapting an outcome-based strategy, while majority controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight a specific role of a single gene in learning and suggest that more mechanistic insight can be gained by examining patterns in a repertoire of potential behavioral strategies. The results also have implications for treating psychiatric disorders, as CAC has been implicated in pathophysiology of disease.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that genetic variation determines animal's learning and performance in terms of behavioral strategies. We show that C1 knockout mice adapt to learning by outcome-based strategy, while controls adopt cue-association. Our results suggest that C1 plays a specific role in learning, and that examining behavioral repertoire of strategies can provide mechanistic insight.

**Title:** Temperature-Dependent Interactions of Wolbachia Infections in Aedes aegypt Mosquitoes: Implications for Arbovirus Suppression

**Research Question:** How do different Wolbachia infections (wMel, wMelB, and wMel-CLA) in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes respond to diurnal cyclical temperatures, and what are the implications for their potential invasion and persistence in the field?

**Methods:** We reared Aedes aegpt larvae infected with wMel, wB, and w-CLA under diurnal cyclical temperatures (26-37°C) and measured Wolbach density, cytoplasmic incompatibility, and transmission to the next generation.

**Findings:** wMel and w-CLA infections exhibited reduced cytoplasm incompat and Wolbach density at 26-37°C, and were not transmitted to the next generation when exposed to this temperature across their lifecycle. In contrast, wB infection maintained high density, complete cytoplasm incompat, and was transmitted with high fidelity at 26-37.

**Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of temperature control in rearing Wolbach-infected mosquitoes for arvirus suppression, as high temperatures can reduce Wolbach density and cytoplasm incompat. This has implications for the success of Wolbach interventions in different environments.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the first that cyclical temperatures (26-37) reduce cytoplasm incompat in w and w- infections, and diminish Wolbach density. We also show that these infections are not transmitted to the next generation when exposed to this temperature across their lifecycle. These results have significant implications for the use of w-infected mosquitoes in arvirus control and the importance of temperature control in rearing.

**Title:** Shedding of Adenoviruses in Non-Human Primates: Implications for Zoonotic Transmission and Vector Design

**Research Question:** What is the natural history of adenovirus infections in non-human primates, particularly in great apes and macaques, and what are the implications for zoonotic transmission and vector design?

**Methods:** We analyzed stool samples from 568 non-human primates from zoos and primate facilities for the presence of adenirus using the CPE assay. We purified and sequenced 30 novel adeniruses from apes and 3 adeniruses macques. We compared ape adenirus sequences with 4 chimpanzee adenirus previously reported and 22 adenirus genomes from GenBank.

**Findings:** Shedding of adenirus was observed in 18% of non-primate samples, with similar frequencies among chimpanzees, bonos, gorillas, and orangans (22-38%). Shedding in asymptomatic humans was less frequent, comparable to previous reports. Ape adenirus could be classified into species corresponding human adenirus B, C, and E, with evidence of intraspecies recombination and high phylogenetic relatedness across primate hosts, suggesting zoonotic transmission. Persistent and latent adenirus infections in the gut should be considered in human and non-primate studies with adenirus vectors.

**Implications:** The high asymptomatic shedding of adenirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoon transmission warrants caution in primate handling and housing. The presence of persistent and latent adenirus infections in the gut should be considered in design and interpretation of human and non-primate studies with adenirus vectors.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the natural history adenirus in non-human primates, highlighting the need for caution in primate handling and housing and consideration of persistent latent adenirus in gut infections in adenirus vector design.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mystery of Nucleosomal DNA Unwrapping: A Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study**

**Research Question:** What is the atomic-level mechanism of nucleosomal DNA unwrapping, a crucial for cellular processes such as chromatin remodeling and transcription?

**Methods:** We employed molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA, using the adaptively biased molecular dynamics (AB) method combined with the multiple walker method.

**Findings:** Our simulations revealed a free energy change of 11.5 kcal/mol for unwrapping, consistent with single-molecule experiments. We observed a variety of conformational states, indicating multiple paths to superhelical unwrapping, with a dominant asymmetric path. Unwrapping initiated at one end with 5bps, followed by 5bps at the same end with increased energy, then started at the other end with 10bps unwrapped. Further unwrapping involved 15bps, advancing at one end, then the other.

**Implications:** These results provide insight into nucleosome construction, disruption, and repositioning, essential for ongoing cellular processes.

**Conclusions:** Our study unravels the atomic mechanism of nucleosomal DNA unwr, shedding light on the dynamics of chromatin remodeling and transcription. The dominant asymmetric unwr path contradicts the pseudo-symmetric nucleosome structure and symmetric DNA sequence, highlighting the significance of histone tails, to be investigated further. Our findings align with single-molecule experiments and theoretical models, providing a comprehensive understanding of nucleosomal unwr.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Lipocalin Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) in Lysosomal Homeostasis and Neuroprotection against Oxidative Stress

**Research Question:** How does Lipocal Apipoprotein D (Apo) exert its neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress in the nervous system, particularly in astrocytes and neurons?

**Methods:** We performed a comprehensive analysis of Apo intracellular traffic and its role in lysosomal homeostasis upon paraquat-induced oxidative stress using single-lysosome in vivo measurements and immunodetection.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that Apo is endocyt and targeted to a subset of vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner, where it is functionally stable and necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalin in both astrocytes and neurons. This is accomplished by preventing lysosomal permeabilization and maintaining lysosomal membrane integrity.

**Implications:** Our results reveal a previously unknown function of Apo, a member of the evolutionary conserved family of extracellular Lipins, in regulating lysosomal membrane integrity. This mechanism is critical for the outcome of various neurodegenerative diseases.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides a mechanistic insight into Apo's neuroprotective actions, uncovering its role in lysosomal homeostasis and membrane stabilization under oxidative conditions. We identify ApD as a marker for vulnerable lysosomes to oxidation and demonstrate its function in maintaining lysosomal pH gradients in astrocytes and neurons. These findings open therapeutic opportunities for repairing lysosomes in pathological situations and provide a new route for understanding neurodegenerative diseases.

**Key findings:**

* Apo is endocyt and targeted to vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner
* Ap is functionally stable in acidic environment and maintains lysosomal integrity
* prevents lysosomal permeabilization and maintains lysosomal pH gradients in astrocytes and neurons
* required for lysosomal biological processes myelin phagocytosis and autophagy in Drosila model

**Implications for neurodegenerative diseases:** Our results set lipoprotein-mediated regulation of lysosomal integrity as a new mechanism at the hub of cellular functions, critical for the outcome of various neurodegenerative diseases.

**Title:** Susceptibility of Phlebotus orientalis to Leishmania donovani: A Comparative Study of Two Colonies from Endemic and Non-Endemic Sites in Ethiopia

**Research Question:** This study investigates the susceptibility of Phlebotus orientalis to Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, in East Africa, using two colonies from endemic and non-endemic sites in Ethiopia: Addis Zemen (AZ) and Melka Wer (MW).

**Methods:** Life cycle parameters, larval food, and humidity requirements, and pupation were compared between the two colonies. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAP) PCR and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI genes were used to assess genetic differences. Susceptibility of P. orient to L. donani was studied using experimental infections with varying infective doses.

**Findings:** Marked differences in life cycle parameters were observed between the two colonies, with distinct requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, no genetic differences were found using RAP PCR and DNA sequencing. F1 hybrids showed higher fecundity than parental colonies. Susceptibility of P. orient to L donani was high, with even the lowest infective dose (2×10^3 per ml) sufficient for successful establishment in 50% of P. orient females. Higher infective doses resulted in 90% infection rates for both colonies. Leish development in P orient was fast, with metacyclic promastigotes in thoracic midgut and stomal colonization by homonads recorded in P orient females by 5 days post-feeding.

**Implications:** Both AZ and MW colonies of P. orient were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donani strains. Average blood-meals taken by P orient females were 0.7 µl, infective at lowest dose 1-2 L. don promastigotes per blood-me. Development of L don was similar in P orient colonies, hence absence of visceral leishias in non-endemic Mel Wer cannot be attributed to susceptibility local P orient populations.

**Conclusions:** Susceptibility P orient to L don is crucial for visceral leishias epidemiology. Natural infections P orient with L don were reported from various foci in Africa, but once in south Ethiopia. Our findings suggest non-endemic Mel Wer cannot be explained low susceptibility local orient to don. Accurate vector competence assessed by infections with L strain 374 in early stage (day 2BM) parasites developed similarly (p>0.05). Day 5-6BM infection rates high (90%) and intensity slightly higher in AZ (p=0.048). Sand fly rearing conditions should be optimized individually for each colony. This study first describes L don development in orient under lab conditions, proving P orient highly susceptible with low parasites needed for establishment.

**Title:** Estimating the Quality of Life and Disability Weight of Advanced Schistosomiasis Japonica in China: A Patient-Based Evaluation

**Research Question:** Despite being listed as a leading health priority by the Chinese government due to its significant health and economic impacts, schistosomiasis has not been included in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study estimates. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of life and disability (QoL) of advanced schosomias japonica cases in a schistomia-endemic county of the People's Republic of China.

**Methods:** A patient-based QL evaluation was performed on suspected or registered cases of schom japon in a schom-endemic county using a questionnaire and physical examination. Disability and morbidity were assessed in confirmed cases using the EQ-5D questionnaire, ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. Age-specific QL of schom japon was estimated based on patients' self-rated scores on a visual analogue scale. Relationships between health status, morbidity, and QL were explored using multivariate models.

**Findings:** Of 506 candidates, 215 were confirmed as schom japon and evaluated. Most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort (90.7%), usual activities (87.9%), and anxiety/depression (80%). Overall QL was 0.447, and age-specific Q ranged from 0.378 (30-44 years) to 0.510 (≥60 years). QL was positively associated with loss capacity, abnormality, ascites, and hepatitis B, while splenectomy and albumin were protective.

**Implications:** These patient-preference estimates provide updated data for revision of the GBD and evidence-based decision-making in China's schom control program.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the significant impact of schom japon on QL and morbidity, emphasizing the need for its inclusion in GBD estimates. The overall Q of sch japon was 0.447, with age-specific ranging from 0.378 to 0.510, indicating substantial disability and morbidity. Impairments were common, with 90.7% reporting pain/discomfort, 87.9 usual activities, and 80.9 anxiety/depression. Factors associated with QL included loss capacity, abnormality, ascites, and hepatitis B, while splenectomy and albumin were protective.

**Title:** Estimating Vulnerability to Human African Trypanosomiasis in Kenya's Tset Belts using National Census Data: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Research Question:** Can national census data be used as a tool to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's tset belts, where tset flies are vectors of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African Trypanosomias (AT) and Human Trypanosomias (H)?

**Methods:** This retrospective cross-sectional study utilized national census data from 1999 to assess the likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, within tset fly habitats of varying levels of poverty, in Kenya's 7 tset belts. A multilevel design estimated the likelihood of disability in residents and recent migrants of working age. Tset fly's impact on disability was conceptualized via two pathways: direct exposure to pathogenic tset fly bites resulting in H infection and indirect impact on agricultural production diseased livestock leading to morbidity and mortality, nutritional deficiencies.

**Findings:** Tset belts significantly associated with increased disability prevalence were identified through direct and indirect exposure pathways. Incorporating reports from the census is a promising tool for future H surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa. Combined burdens of H and A and costs of production in A areas are likely contributors to disability in tset-infested regions.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the potential of national census as a surveillance tool to enhance H programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Future research will assess changes in relationships between tset infestation and disability following the 2009 census at local level.

**Conclusion:** This study is the first to utilize census data to assess vulnerability and disability in tset regions, warranting further investigation. Kenya's 7 tset belts host 8 species, with 92.36% immigrants from Uganda, 40% infested with tset flies, and 70% livestock at risk of tryosomiasis. In 199, rural areas lacked public health infrastructure for passive surveillance and care, justifying alternative approaches.

**Title:** Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) Induces HIV Production in Chronically Infected Cells by Activating the PI3K/Akt Pathway and Releasing Positive Transcription Elongation Factor (P-TEb)

**Research Question:** How does Hexamethyleneacetamide (HM) induce HIV production in chronically infected cells, and what is the underlying mechanism of its action?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of HM on chronically infected cells, focusing on the PIK/Akt pathway, phosphorylation of HEX1, and release of PTEb from its transcriptionally inactive complex with HEX1 and 7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA).

**Findings:** HM transiently activates the PI/Akt pathway, leading to phosphorylation of HEX1 and subsequent release of active PTE from its complex with HEX1 and 7snRNA. As a result, PTE is recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription and production. Despite continuous HM presence, released PTE rapidly reassembles with 7sn and HEX1. In contrast, mutant HEX1 that cannot be phosphorylated and released via PI/Akt pathway antagonizes HM-mediated induction of viral production.

**Implications:** Our studies reveal how HM induces HIV production and suggest modifications in equilibrium between active and inactive PTE contribute to cell differentiation. Inhibition of PI/A pathway and expression of mutant HEX1 that cannot be phosphorylated and released via Akt antagonize HM-mediated induction of viral production. We provide a mechanism by which HM targets pivotal co-factor PTE for reactivation.

**Conclusions:** HM activates viral production in chronically infected cells via transient release of active PTE from its complex. Events depend on transient activation of PI/A pathway leading to phosphorylation of HEX. Released PTE is recruited to HIV promoter to stimulate transcription. Importantly, inhibition of PI/A pathway in chronically cells or expression of mutant HEX that cannot be phosphorylated by Akt antagonizes HM-mediated induction of transcription. Our studies reveal how HM releases PTE to reactivate production from latency. HM disrupts complex in PI-dependent manner to release PTE that is recruited to HIV promoter and elongates transcription.

**Title:** Development of a Novel Diagnostic Tool for Detecting Leishmania RNA Virus (LRV) in Leishmanias: Implications for Mucosal and Disseminated Leishmanias

**Research Question:** Can a novel anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody (J2) be used to detect Leish RNA (LRV) in various Leish strains, including L. braziliensis, L. panensis, and L. guyanensis, and predict the risk of mucosal and disseminated leishmanias?

**Methods:** We evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of J2 in immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot techniques for LRV detection in various Leish strains, including freshly isolated patient samples and murine biopsies.

**Findings:** J2 successfully detected LRV in L. brazensis, L. panensis, and L. guyensis strains, demonstrating its potential as a diagnostic tool for LRV-related complications in cutaneous leishiasis.

**Implications:** LRV is associated with mucosal and disseminated leishias, causing significant morbidity through hyper-inflammatory response and destruction of nasophary tissues and ulcerated skin lesions.

**Conclusions:** LRV detection is crucial for assessing LRV-related risk in cutaneous leishias, and J offers a novel approach for LRV quantitation, independent of prior knowledge of viral sequence divergence.

**Background:** Leishias is a major human protozoan disease, with 12 million infections and 350 million at risk worldwide, presenting in two forms: cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL). LRV exacerbates disease in L. guyensis murine models through TLR3 recognition.

**Methods:**

1. **Immunofluorescence:** J2 detected LRV in L. brazensis, L. pan, and L. guyensis strains.
2. **ELISA:** J detected LRV in L. braz, L. pan, and L. guyensis.
3 **Dot blot:** J detected LRV in L. braz, L. pan, and L. guyensis.
4 **Nucleic acid purification:** J detected LRV in L. braz, L. pan, and L. guyensis.
5 **Real-time PCR:** J detected LRV in L. braz, L. pan, and L. guyensis.

**Results:** LRV was detected in freshly isolated L. braz, L. pan, and L. guy samples, and murine biops, demonstrating ease of use for field application.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Pedestal Formation in Enterohemorrhagic and Enteropathogenic Escherichia (EHE and EPEC) Colonization of Polarized Epithelial Cells

**Research Question:** The precise function of pedestal formation in the colonization of polar epithelial cells by Enterohemorrhagic (EHE) and Enteropathogenic (EPEC) Escherichia coli (E) remains unclear, despite its correlation with bacterial colonization in animal models.

**Methods:** We investigated the colonization properties of HE and EPEC during infection of polar epithelial cells, focusing on the role of tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir and multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU in pedestal formation.

**Findings:** Both HE and EPEC formed distinct bacterial communities or "macroies" that encompassed multiple host cells, with Tir and Esp, as well as the Arp/3 complex, critical for expansion over time. Unexpectedly, Esp accelerated formation of larger macroies compared to EPEC, as Esp-mediated actin assembly drove bacterial motility to junctions, where bacteria formed a pedestal on a neighboring cell, allowing one daughter to disengage and infect the second.

**Implications:** These data reveal Esp enhances epithelial colonization by actin-based motility and efficient cell-to-cell transmission, highlighting similarities between HE and E pedestal pathways in motility on non-polar cells.

**Conclusions:**

1. Pedestal formation plays a crucial role in HE and E colonization of polar epithelial cells.
2. Esp enhances colonization by increasing actin motility and promoting efficient cell-to-cell transmission.
3. HE mechanism of pedestal assembly provides colonization advantage over EPEC pathway in polar epithelial infections.
4. Tir and Esp contribute to spreading across cell monolayer, a process never directly visualized.

**Key Findings:**

* HE and E form distinct macroies encompassing multiple cells.
* Tir and Esp critical for expansion over time.
* Esp accelerates formation of larger macro compared to E.
* Esp-mediated actin assembly drives bacterial motility to junctions, forming secondary pedestal on neighboring cell, allowing daughter to disengage and infect second.
* Similarities between HE and E pedestal pathways in motility on non-polar cells.
* Parallels between Esp- and phospho-Tir pedestals in macrophage and fibroblast infections.
* Target cells for HE and E are polar epithelial.

**Future Directions:**

* Characterize the role of HE Tir in colonization.
* Assess individual and combined contributions of Tir and Esp to colonization.
* Study colonization kinetics on polar epithelial exposed different outcome of HE and E pedestal pathways.

**Title:** Comparative Evaluation of Differential Centrifugation (DC) and Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) for the Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) from Excretory-Secretory Products of Fasciola hepatica

**Research Question:** What is the most effective method for isolating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the excretory-secretory products of Fasciola hepatica, a parasitic helminth, for downstream studies and applications?

**Methods:** EVs were isolated from culture media of F. hepatica using DC and SEC, and characterized by transmission electron and atomic force microscopy, protein quantification, Western blotting, and proteomic analysis.

**Findings:** SEC-purified EVs were smaller and less diverse than DC-purified EVs, with higher purity of excretory-secretory protein (ESP) yield, reduced soluble cathepsin proteases, and less tegument proteins.

**Implications:** DC and SEC methods do not isolate equivalent EV populations, caution should be taken in choice of EV purification method for functional studies. SEC should be used for EV purification prior to downstream studies.

**Conclusion:** This study challenges the widely accepted DC method for helmin research, suggesting SEC has higher purity to yield, reduced contamination, and maintained EV characteristics. F. hepatica, a pathogenic helmin, was used as a case study to compare SEC to DC. SEC resulted in smaller, lower diversity, higher purity, less proteome, and gene profiles compared to DC. 2.6 fold more protein identifications in DC, many in ESP and tegument proteomic studies. Separation of EV from pathogen components is vital for assessing role in host-pathogen communication and immunity. Given EV function in promoting or inhibiting host immunity, reliable protocols for isolation from ESP are necessary for studies and development. This work assessed DC with SEC for helmin path EV analysis, highlighting SEC as choice for studies and development in absence of standard method.

**Title:** Reverse Engineering Post-transcriptional Regulation in Drosophila melanogaster: Unveiling the Role in Spatio-temporal Pattern Formation

**Research Question:** Can post-transcriptional regulation play a crucial role in the formation of spatio-temporal patterns in the early embryo of Dophila melanogaster?

**Methods:** We employed a reverse-engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation in the expression of gap genes Krpp, knps, and gt in D. melanogaster. We used detailed, quantitative datasets of mRNA and protein expression to fit a model of postcription regulation and establish its structural and practical identifiability.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that postcription is not required for patterning in this system, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. We show that the uniqueness and specificity of the fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal formation, increasing the potential of reverse engineering for study of development and other complex biological processes.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of postcription regulation in spatio-temporal patterning, challenging the conventional focus on transcriptional regulation. The reverse-engineering approach provides quantitative and specific insights into the problem of postcription, only if fit to data in a rigorous and reproducible manner. We demonstrate that models can be formulated to have a unique solution, and fitted to protein data using mRNA patterns as inputs or boundary conditions. If models reproduce protein patterns, we conclude postcription is not required; if fail, we identify features relying on postcription processes.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of reverse engineering in understanding complex biological processes, particularly in the context of spatio-temporal formation. Our results show that postcription plays a crucial role in controlling protein levels, not patterning. The methodology used can be applied to other complex biological problems, increasing our understanding of development and regulation.

**Title:** Age-Dependent Epithelial Innate Immune Response to Rotavirus Infection: A Key Role of Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) in Susceptibility

**Research Question:** What is the role of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection in mice and humans?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of TLR3 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of mice at different ages and its correlation with rotavirus susceptibility, shedding, and histological damage. We also examined the role of TLR3 and its adaptor molecule TRIF in rotavirus recognition and antiviral defense in neonatal and adult mice.

**Findings:** TLR3 expression was low in suckling mice but increased postnatally, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in TLR3 or TRIF exhibited higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial proinflammatory and antiral gene expression compared to wild-type. In contrast, neon mice deficient in TLR or TRIF did not display impaired stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Using chimeric mice, we detected a major contribution of non-hematopoietic compartment in TR-mediated antiral response in adult animals. Significant age-dependent T3 expression was detected in human intestinal biops.

**Implications:** Upregulation of epithelial T3 expression during infancy might contribute to age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. TLR-TR mediated immune significantly influenced epithelial cytokine, chemokine, antiral effector cell, and viral shedding in adult but not neon mice. Our results identify postnatal increase in epithelial T3 as a key factor in age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus.

**Conclusions:** Age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus correlates with low epithelial T3 expression and responsiveness. Protection in adult IEs relies on TLR-TR mediated innate activation, whereas antiral defense in suckling is TR independent. We provide evidence that intestinal T3 in humans also exhibits age-dependent upregulation, contributing to rotavirus susceptibility in infants. Together, our data confirm age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus and show that susceptibility correlates with low T3 and responsiveness in epithelial cells.

**Title:** Investigating the Genetic Architecture of Autism Spectrum Disorders through Whole-Exome Sequencing: A Large-Scale Analysis of 1,039 Cases and 870 Controls

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the genetic architecture of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) through whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 1,039 cases and 870 controls from the National Human Genome Repository (NH) with similar ancestry to cases. We compared data from two sequencing centers using different methods to produce and call variants, ensuring the distribution of rare variation was similar across centers.

**Methods:** We filtered variants by fraction of missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative reads to reference. Seven samples were sequenced at both centers, and results were evaluated using association study. We addressed how to combine data/results from centers: gene-based association or meta-analysis or mega-analysis. Due to the nature of gene-based tests, simulations showed mega-analysis had better power than meta-analysis. Before analysis, we explored the impact of population structure on rare variants in data. Principal component analyses were sufficient to control for ancestry and produce test distributions.

**Findings:** Using gene-based tests and meta- and mega-analysis, we found no new risk genes for ASD in this sample. Our results suggest gene tests require larger samples cases and controls for effective discovery, even for a disorder like ASD.

**Implications:** Rare variants are important constituents of ASD genetic architecture, but analysis has produced most findings implicating genes in liability (e.g., genes). Exome sequencing has potential for identifying novel genes and treatment implications. However, published candidate studies have not reported p-values for ex-wide significance. Rare effects are strong, but single tests have little power. Variants must be combined, such as within or across, for association to reach power.

**Conclusions:** This large-scale whole-exome sequencing study of 1,039 cases and 870 controls found no new risk genes for ASD. Our results suggest gene tests require larger samples and controls for effective discovery, even for a disorder like ASD.

**Title:** Investigating the Association between Chitinase Polymorphisms and the Incidence of Madure Mycetoma in a Sudanese Population

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the genes encoding chitin-degrading enzymes, chitriosase and AMCase, and the incidence of Madure myetoma in a Sudanese population.

**Methods:** A case-control study was conducted among 112 patients with Madure myetoma and 103 matched controls. DNA was isolated from blood and genotyped using PCR-RFLP. Histological staining confirmed the presence of chitin in the fungal grain. Polymorphisms in the chitrios gene (rs1317) and AM gene (rs566) were studied, resulting in impaired and decreased chitinase activity, respectively. Additionally, polymorphs in the 5'UTR of the AM gene (rs) and a 10-b insertion in the AM gene (rs) were studied, resulting in increased AM activity.

**Findings:** Polymorphism in the chrios gene, resulting in impaired chitinase activity, was associated with increased odds of Mad myetoma (OR 2.9, p=0.004). No association was found for polymorphisms in the AM gene. Decreased chitase activity was associated with increased risk of Mad myoma.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates that chitin is present in the grain of Madure myoma and that polymorph in the chrios gene, resulting in impaired chase, is associated with increased risk of Madoma. These findings suggest that chase activity plays a role in the development of myoma caused by Madure myet.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that chitin is present in the grain of Mad myoma and that polymorph in the chrios gene, resulting impaired chase, is associated with increased risk of myoma. These findings have implications for understanding the role of chase in the development of myoma caused by Madure myet. Further research is needed to investigate the mechanisms by which chase contributes to the development of myoma.

**Title:** Challenging the Paradigm of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Latency: Evidence of Lytic Gene Expression during Latency**

**Background:** Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has long been a prototype for viral latency, characterized by distinct acute and latent phases. However, recent studies have questioned the quiescence of latency, suggesting that lytic genes can be transcribed in this state. Immunological studies have shown that activated T cells persist in the nervous system during latency, but direct evidence of lytic gene expression has been lacking.

**Research Question:** Do lytic promoters drive protein expression during latency in HSV-1 infection?

**Methods:** We employed a highly sensitive Cre-reporting model to investigate lytic and latent phases. We found that half of HSV spread to latently infected sites occurred beyond initial infection, and direct evidence showed lytic promoters drive protein expression during latency.

**Findings:** Our experiments provide the most direct evidence to date that HSV-1 lytic promoters are capable of generating protein during latency. Using promoters associated with immune recognition, we linked CD+ T activation in latently-infected DR with viral expression during latency. This is consistent with either a) stochastic ly gene expression integral to latency or b) early presentation of proteins to CD+ cells providing opportunity for reactivation halted by immune mechanism.

**Implications:** Our findings challenge the paradigm of HSV latency, suggesting that lytic expression is not solely restricted to acute phase. This has implications for understanding adaptive immunity and viral expression through phases of HSV-1 infection. To explore this relationship, we examined a virus driven by ICP promoter, which showed lytic expression after first week of infection. Notably, no marking was noted during latency, consistent with results for I0 promoter.

**Conclusions:** Our studies using Cre-report models reveal ly gene expression during latency, contrary to immunological studies. Yet, no promoter driving major anti-HSV CD+ cells has been tested. An operational definition of HSV latency is viral persistence in absence infectious virus. Mouse models have been mainstay HSV research, latency profound with reactivation difficult induce in vivo. Historically, transcription during latency considered restricted to family RNA, latency transcripts (LAT). Our findings suggest lytic expression integral to latency, warranting reevaluation of latency mechanisms.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Misfolded Proteins in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Comparative Analysis of Prion Strains and Neuroinflammation

**Research Question:** How do different prion strains influence the accumulation of misfolded proteins and neuroinflammation in the brain, and what are the implications for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, frontotemporal dementia, and prion diseases?

**Methods:** We used dual-staining immunohistochemistry to compare the specificity of PrSc accumulation in the brains of mice infected with three scrapie strains that differ in regional pathology. We also studied the expression of genes involved in neuroinflamm using mRNA from the thalamus at preclinical times.

**Findings:** PrSc from each strain had a distinct pattern of cell specificity: Strain 22 was mainly associated with astroglia, strain ME with neurons, and neuropil in thalamus and cortex, and strain RML similar to 22 in substantia nigra and ME in thalam. Despite differences in PrSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all strains, with variations correlating with early disease tempo. Gene upregulation correlated with activation of astrogl and microglia before vacolar pathology or clinical signs. The profile of upregulated genes in scrapie differed from viral CNS diseases Larosse and polytropic retroirus.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of understanding the role of misfold proteins in neurodegener diseases and the need for common therapeutic strategies against seeded polymer events. Prion diseases are progressive, fatal, characterized by vacu in gray matter, gli involving astrogl and microia, and deposition of aggregated protease isoforms PrSc derived from host-encoded pr protein PrP. Neurodegener diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson, frontemp, and pr are characterized by accumulation of misfold proteins.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that prion strains have distinct patterns of PrSc association with brain cells, influencing neuroinflamm, and disease tempo. Despite differences in PrSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all strains, with variations correlating with disease tempo. The profile of upregulated in scrapie differed from viral CNS diseases, indicating distinct mechanisms of neuroinflamm. This study contributes to understanding of prion pathogenesis and development of therapeutic strategies against seeded polymer events.

**Title:** Coarse-Grained Modeling of Chromosome Organization and Dynamics: A Novel Approach to Investigating Gene Expression and Function

**Research Question:** How can we develop an efficient and accurate coarse-grained model to simulate the 3D organization and dynamics of chromosomes, accounting for entanglement and volumic density, to study gene expression and function?

**Methods:** We proposed a generic strategy to develop coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, accounting for polymer entanglement and volumic density. Our scheme captures steady-state and dynamical properties of the system and tracks dynamics at different coarse-graining scales, offering a power-law gain in numerical efficiency and a systematic way to define coarse-grained models for chromosomes.

**Findings:** Using our formalism, we investigated the evolution of 3D organization of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in Drosophila during one cell cycle (20h). A combination of coarse-graining with a one-parameter copolymer integrating epigen-driven interactions quantitatively reproduced experimental data at chromosome-scale and predicted chromatin is dynamic during the cycle.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate the necessity to adequately account for the evolution of organization in chromosome models, especially in higher eukaryotes where chromosomes are topologically constrained. Neglecting topological constraints may lead to erroneous fine-scale descriptions, while supplementary interactions may misinterpret observations. Our approach offers a systematic way to develop coarse-gr models for chromosomes and investigate epigen-driven interactions in folding dynamics.

**Conclusions:** Our coarse-graining strategy is generic and can be applied to any self-avoiding polym and off-lattice systems, emphasizing the importance of accounting for entang and volumic in chromosome models. We demonstrated the utility of our approach in studying chromatin organization in Dophila and discussed results in the context of chromosome and chromatin biology.

**Title:** Elucidating the Causal Mechanisms of Cell-Specific Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) through Integrative Analysis with Cis-Regulatory Element (CRE) Data

**Research Question:** How do genetic variants in cis-regulatory elements and transacting factors influence the quantity and spatial distribution of gene expression, and can we predict the cell specificity of quantitative trait loci (eQTL) using cis-regulatory element (CRE) data?

**Methods:** We performed eQTL analysis on 11 studies across 7 cell types, integrated eQ data with CRE from the ENCODE project, and built classifiers to predict the cell specificity of eTL. We analyzed the relationship between eTL SNP-CRE overlap and cell specificity eTL, and demonstrated the feasibility of predicting cell specificity eTL using a random forest classifier with CRE-SNP overlap features.

**Findings:** eTLs associated with hundreds of cell-specific CRE classes, including enhancers, promoters, repressive chromatin marks, open chromatin, and DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating cell-specific eTL and regulation. Using CRE from trait-associated cell types, we annotated GW associations in the absence of eTL data for that type.

**Implications:** Integrative predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our understanding of the mechanistic basis of human phenotypic variation.

**Conclusions:** Our study addresses the need for improved understanding the genetic and causal mechanisms of cell specificity eTL. We demonstrate the feasibility of predicting cell eTL using CRE-SNP overlap and show that CRE from trait-associated cell can be used to annotate GW associations in the absence of e data. This integrative approach will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of complex phenotyp variation.

**Key Findings:**

* eTL SNPs overlap with cell-specific CRE are enriched for cell-specific eTL
* CRE-SNP overlap can predict cell eTL in the absence of additional expression or genotype data
* GW associations are enriched in DNase hypersensitive sites and eSNPs
* GW follow-up studies mechanistically tied disease associations to misregulation of expression
* eTL provide mechanistic interpretations for human associations, but cell specificity presents a problem

**Future Directions:**

* Quantify mechanisms generating cell-specific e
* Use CRE-SNP to predict e in absence of e or genotype data
* Annotate GW associations in absence e data

**Title:** Development of a Stable CHO Cell Line for the Production of Glycan-Optimized HIV-1 Envelope Immunogens through CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Editing

**Research Question:** Can a stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line be engineered to limit N-glycosylation to Man5 or earlier intermediates, enabling the production of glycan-dependent HIV-1 envelope (Env) immunogens that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (NAb)?

**Methods:** We employed the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to introduce a mutation in the Mannosyl Alpha-1,3-Glycoprotein Beta-2-N-Acetylglucosyltransferase (MGAT) gene in CHO cells, resulting in a cell line that limits glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-glycosylation pathway.

**Findings:** Monomeric gp120 produced in the MG1 CHO line exhibited improved binding to glycan-dependent NAb epitopes, including V1/V (e.g., PG9) and V3 (e.g., PGT and 10-107), while preserving glycan-independent epitopes (e.g., V01). The MG CHO line's ability to limit glycosylation to early intermediates without impairing doubling time or growth at high cell densities suggests it will be useful for biopharm production of HIV-1 immunogens.

**Implications:** The discovery of glycan-dependent NAb epitopes on HIV-1 Env has shifted thinking on how to produce vaccine immunogens. Traditional CHO cell lines incorporating complex glycosylation may not be suitable for glycan-dependent epitopes. A cell line limiting glycosylation to high-mann forms may be useful for gp120 immunogens.

**Conclusions:** The development of a stable CHO line that limits glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-glycos pathway addresses a major challenge in biopharm production of HIV-1 immunogens. The ability to produce glycan-optimized gp120 will aid in the design and manufacture of HIV vaccines.

**Title:** Elucidating the Structure-Function Relationship of Trehalose-6-Phosphatase from Brugia malayi: Implications for Anthelmint and Antibacterial Therapeutics

**Research Question:** What is the molecular basis for the essentiality of trehal-6-phosphatase (TPP) in Brug malayi, a parasitic nematode responsible for lymphatic filariasis, and how can this knowledge inform the design of high-affinity inhibitors?

**Methods:** We determined the X-ray crystal structure of TPP from B. malayi, revealing a stabilizing N-terminal MIT domain and catalytic C-terminal C2-type H phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses with a competitive inhibitor, trehal 6-sulf, identified five residues crucial for binding and catalysis. Computational modeling of the TPP-trehal 6-phosphate complex revealed a substrate-binding mode driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions, distinct from sucrose-6-phosphatase.

**Findings:** The trehal binding site is dominated by hydrophobic residues, unlike other carbohydrate-binding proteins. Conservation of key residues among TPP from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria suggests a common strategy for TPP inhibitor design, applicable to antibiotics and anthelmics. We constructed a model of TPP with trehal 6-phosphate bound, providing a platform for inhibitor design.

**Implications:** High-affinity inhibitors exploiting substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl pocket and non-native binding to trehal pocket may be effective. Conservation of key residues enforcing the shape of the substrate pocket in TPP enzymes suggests broad-spectrum anthelmic and antibacterial therapeutics employing this platform may be possible.

**Conclusions:** Understanding the structure-function relationship of TPP from parasitic nemodes is crucial for the development of small-molecule anthelmics. Our results provide a basis for the design of TPP inhibitors, targeting the essential enzyme in B. malayi, a major cause of lymphatic filariasis. The conservation of key residues among TPP from parasitic nemodes and pathogenic bacteria indicates a common strategy for TPP design, applicable to antibiotics and anthelmics.

**Title:** A Novel Computational Framework for Simulating Tumour Vascular Heterogeneity to Optimize Anti-Cancer Therapies

**Research Question:** How can we develop a computational framework that incorporates the inherent spatial heterogeneity of tumours to optimize anti-cancer therapies?

**Methods:** We present a novel computational framework that simulates blood and interstitial fluid transport in tumours using whole, realistic tumour-extracted ex vivo data. Our model couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, respectively, and incorporates spatially heterogeneous blood lumen and interstitial permeabilities to generate accurate predictions of tumour fluid dynamics.

**Findings:** We applied our framework to orthotopic murine glioma (GL261) and human colorectal carcinoma (147) and performed sensitivity analysis to understand key mechanisms determining tumour transport. We found that incorporating realistic vasculature is key to modelling fluid response between tum samples. Contrary to literature, reducing tumour interstitial pressure is not essential to increase interstitial perfusion; instead, therapies should develop interstitial pressure gradient. We hypothesize stabilizing vessel diameters and permeabilities are key responses to vascular normalization, altering interstitial conductivity.

**Implications:** Normalizing interstitial microenvironment may provide more effective increase interstitial perfusion within tumours.

**Conclusions:** Our framework enables highly-controlled experiments to provide insight into tum vascular heterogeneity's contribution to tum fluid transport. We demonstrate its application to large vascular networks (>2cm^3, >10^5 vessels), permitting whole tumour dynamics incorporating architectural heterogeneities at micron-scale. Incorporating tum vasculature is key to predicting flow heterogeneities induced by vessels. Our results suggest developing interstitial pressure gradient is key response, not reducing tumour interstitial pressure. We hypothesize vascular normalization alters interstitial conductivity within tumours.

**Title:** Dissecting the Efficacy of Neutralizing Antibodies and Entry Inhibitors in Cell-to-Cell Transmission of HIV**

**Research Question:** The relative importance of cell-to-cell transmission in HIV infection and the vulnerability of this mode to neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors remains unclear.

**Methods:** We employed tailored experimental strategies to discriminate between free and cell-to-cell transmission, investigating the activity of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and entry inhibitors.

**Findings:** Neutralizing activity of mAbs and entry inhibitors varied depending on their mode of action. gp41-directed agents remained active, while CD4-binding site (CDbs) inhibitors, including potent mAb VRC01, lost potency during cell-to-cell transmission. This suggests CDbs mAbs preferentially block free transmission, allowing HIV to spread through cell contacts.

**Implications:** Our findings provide evidence that neutralizing antibodies, depending on mode, differ in blocking free and cell transmission. HIV relies on both modes to maintain infection in vivo. Therefore, efficacy of entry and neutral antibodies to block cell transmission should be considered.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the distinct effect of cell transmission on CD4-Ig2 and T-20 activity, raising the question whether epitope specificity or neutral mechanism determines activity during cell transmission. We investigated a panel of neutralizing antibodies and inhibitors for potencies against free and cell-associated virus. Our results have implications for neutral antibody-based HIV vaccine and entry design, as it remains uncertain whether both free and cell spread must be blocked equally or only the dominant mode targeted.

**Title:** Mechanistic Model of Attentional Modulation: Explaining Top-Down Effects on Neural Responses and Receptive Fields

**Research Question:** How can top-down attentional modulation in higher visual areas of the visual hierarchy produce the observed effects on neural responses and receptive fields?

**Methods:** We propose a simple mechanistic model that requires the existence of modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range inhibition within each area, redistributing top-down modulation to lower areas and altering inputs of higher cells, including those not initially modulated.

**Findings:** Our model reproduces attentional effects on response rates (response gain, input, gain, competition scaled to receptive field) and receptive structure (shifts, resizing in spatial and feature space) without modifying parameters. Additionally, it predicts attention effects on response curves shift from gain to contrast as focus drifts away from cell.

**Implications:** Our model suggests that attentional effects arise from feedback between higher and lower areas interacting with short-range inhibition within each area, contrasting with existing models positing attention through input modulation.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that effects of attention on neural responses can be explained by a simple mechanism invoking modulatory connections and lateral inhibition. Feedback redistributes top modulation to lower areas, altering inputs of higher cells, including those not initially modulated, producing effects on responses, receptive expansion towards focus. Our model makes novel prediction that attention effects on curves shift from gain to contrast as focus drifts away from cell.

**Title:** Regulation of JAK/STAT Signaling in Drosophila Hematopoiesis: A Novel Role for the Short-Range Cytokine Receptor Latran in Immune Response

**Research Question:** How does the short-range cytokine receptor Lat control JAK/STAT signaling in Doph hematopoietic progenitors, and what is its role in the immune response to parasitism?

**Methods:** We generated a Lat knockout by homologous recombination and used in vivo and in vitro assays to investigate the function of Lat in J/STAT signaling and hematopoiesis.

**Findings:** We show that Lat is required for switching off J/STAT signaling in hematopoietic progenitors, a prerequisite for differentiation into lamlocytes upon parasism. Lat forms heteromers with Domeless, a Doph type cytokine receptor related to mammalian GP130, and antagonizes Dome activity in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo, we observed a decrease in cytokine mRNA levels in the gland followed by an increase in Lat/Dome ratio, leading to complete inhibition of J/STAT activity.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel mode of regulation of J/STAT, based on tissue-specific expression of signaling and antagonist receptors, crucial for Doph to mount a dedicated immune response. The function of Lat is the first in vivo example of a non-signaling receptor controlling a specific immune response, raising questions about the role of short-range receptors in vertebrate cellular immunity.

**Conclusions:** Our data propose that the sequence of events leads to complete inhibition of J/STAT, allowing proocytes to differentiate into lamlocytes upon parasism. This is in contrast to previous findings that upregulation J/STAT triggers lamloc differentiation. Together, these data highlight the complexity of J/STAT regulation in Doph hematies and its role in immune response to parasism.

**Title:** Investigating Recombination Patterns in Begomoviruses: Unveiling the Role of Sequence Similarity, Structure, and Selection in Genome Evolution

**Research Question:** How do recombination patterns influence the evolution of begomiruses, particularly in the single-stranded DNA virus family Geminiridae, and what factors contribute to the viability of recombinant genomes?

**Methods:** We conducted a 120-day experimental infection of tomato plants with Tomato yellow curl virus (TY) and Tomato leaf curl virus (TO) and analyzed recombination patterns between these viruses.

**Findings:** Our results show that recombination patterns between TY and TO can be complex, with clear evidence that local sequence similarity, not secondary structure, influences recombination breakpoints. We also found that selection against recombinants with disrupted intra-genic interactions, such as protein-protein and nucleic acid folding, strongly influences overall recombination patterns. Notably, selection favors preservation of co-evolved protein-protein and DNA interactions is so strong that it can be used to identify exact sequence tracts involved in these interactions.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of sequence similarity and selection in shaping recombination patterns in begovir genomes. Unlike previous experiments, our results reflect the complexity of fitness landscape encountered by TY, TO, and their recombinant progeny. Begomir are ideal subjects for studying recombination due to emergence of numerous crop pathogens attributed to inter-species recombination and well-characterized intra-protein, interprotein, and protein-DNA interactions.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that local sequence similarity, not secondary structure, influences recombination breakpoints in begov genomes. Once recombinants are produced, natural selection profoundly influences overall recombination patterns, favoring preservation of co-evolved protein-protein and DNA interactions. Our findings have implications for understanding recombination in begir evolution and can be used to identify sequence tracts involved in these interactions.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Nucleosomes and Genome Evolution: A Comparative Analysis of Eukaryotes and Archaea**

**Research Question:** How do nucleosomes, the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin, influence the evolution of eukotic genomes, and what is the relationship between nucleosome positioning and sequence divergence between eukotes and archaea?

**Methods:** We analyzed the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence in humans and the archaeon Haloferaxii, a model organism with well-characterized nucleosome organization. We compared substitution patterns around nucleosome footprints in humans to substitution dynamics in the Halofer clade, a group of halophilic archaea.

**Findings:** Contrary to the idea that nucleosomes are unique to eukotes, histone proteins have been discovered in archaeal genomes. However, archaeal nucleosomes differ from eukotic counterparts in many respects, including assembly into tetramers rather than octamers and lack of N- and C-terminal tails. Despite these differences, the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence is strikingly conserved between humans and Halofer. Unexpectedly, neither mutation nor selection can explain the observed association between nucleosomes and divergence. Instead, we demonstrate that nucle-associated patterns are consistent with a model where sequence results in repositioning nucleosomes during evolution. We show that nucle repositioning is both necessary and sufficient to explain the association between current nucle positions and biased patterns.

**Implications:** This finding highlights the importance of considering directionality between genetic and epigenetic change. Our results suggest that repositioning nucleosomes in response to sequence changes is a key driver of evolution, rather than mutation or selection. This has implications for understanding the evolution of eotic genomes and epigenetic regulation.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into the relationship between nucleosomes and evolution, challenging the idea that nucleosomes are unique to eukotes. Our findings suggest that repositioning nucleosomes in response to sequence changes is a key driver of evolution, rather than mutation or selection. This has implications for understanding the evolution of eotic genomes and epigenetic regulation, and highlights the importance of considering directionality between genetic and epetic change.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Conformational Diversity in Protein Function through Ligand Binding: A Novel Method for Identifying Key Positions Mediating Conformation Change

**Research Question:** How do conformational diversity and ligand binding interactions modulate protein function, and what positions are the key residues involved in this process?

**Methods:** We developed a novel procedure to identify positions sustaining conformation diversity associated with ligand binding using normal mode analysis on a coarse-grained protein model. We applied this method to a refined dataset of 188 paired protein structures in bound and unbound forms. Normal modes involved in conformation change were selected based on overlap with structural distortions introduced by lig binding. Subspace defined by these modes was used to analyze effect of point mutations on conformation diversity.

**Findings:** We found a negative correlation between effects of mutations on normal subspaces associated with lig-binding and evolutionary conservation from multiple-structure alignments. Positions altering these subspaces were identified as key, dynamically mediating lig-conformation change. These positions were mostly conserved, buried aliphatic residues in regular regions like β-sheets and α-helix.

**Implications:** Conformation diversity plays a central role in modulating protein function, with ligand binding shifting conformation equilibrium through high-affinity conformers. Intramolecular vibrational dynamics guarantee conformation transitions, crucial for evolutionary conserved traits. Our method identifies key positions mediating this process, providing insights into protein function and evolution.

**Conclusions:** We present a novel procedure to identify key positions affecting conformation associated lig binding. Our results highlight the importance of conformation diversity in protein function, with conserved positions mediating lig-conformation change. These findings have implications for understanding protein-ligand interactions and evolution.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphate Aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) Metabolism: Implications for Pathogenesis and Chemotherapy Development

**Research Question:** What is the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M) metabolism, and how does its regulation impact the bacterium's ability to establish and maintain infections in vivo and in vitro?

**Methods:** We engineered an Mtb strain with regulated FBA levels using anhyrotacycline and depleted FBA in both acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo. We also cultured M on single carbon sources and mixtures of glycolytic and gluogenic carbon to evaluate the essentiality of FBA in vitro.

**Findings:** Depletion of F resulted in clearance of M in vivo and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, consistent with M's ability to coatabolize multiple sources, this essentiality could be overcome when cultured on mixtures of glycol and gluogenic carbon, enabling generation of f knockout (Δfba). In vitro studies of Δf revealed lack of F could only be compensated by specific balance glucose and butyrate, with growth and metabolism butrate determined by M's ability to coatabize glucose.

**Implications:** These data evaluate F as a potential target in both replicating and persistent M, and expand our understanding of multiplicity in vitro that define the essentiality of M's F in vivo. M's ability to adapt to diverse host environments may be attributed to its metabolic flexibility and capacity to efficiently catabize multiple sources.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of F in M metabolism and its potential as a drug target for chemotherapeutic interventions. M mutants lacking metabolic enzymes are most attenuated in mouse model of tuberculosis. F is central to glycolysis and gluogenesis and has been focus of structural, enzymatic, and drug studies. M's ability to coatabize multiple sources in vitro and macrophages is in contrast to other bacteria such as E. coli.

**Title:** Redefining the Role of 2-Cys Peroxiredoxins in Leishmania: A Novel Molecular Chaperone Function of Mitochondrial 2-Cys Peroxiredoxin (mTXx)

**Research Question:** What is the functional significance of mitochondrial 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (mTXx) in the Leishmania life cycle, and does its peroxidase activity play a crucial role in parasite survival in mice?

**Methods:** A gene replacement strategy was used to generate mpx null (txn−) mutants, which were indistinguishable from wild-type promastigotes, but unable to thrive in a murine model of infection. Unexpectedly, the avir phenotype of txn− was not due to lack of peroxide activity, as txn behaved like controls when exposed to oxidants exogenously or generated by macrophages phagocytosis in vivo.

**Findings:** txn− were avir when inoculated into murine hosts unable to mount effective phagocyte response (B.47ox−/− and B.R2/−/− IF− mice). Peroxidase activity of TXx is not required for parasite survival in mice was shown by rescuing non-infect phenotype of txn with peroxide-inactive version of protein. A novel function is proposed for TXx, a molecular chaperone, which explains impaired infectivity of mutants. This is based on observation that enzyme suppresses thermal aggregation citrate synth in vitro. txn− were more sensitive to temperature shift from 25°C to 37°C, reminiscent of organisms lacking chone genes.

**Implications:** These findings change paradigm regarding all tryosomatid 2-cyste peroxins as peroxide-eliminating devices and demonstrate, for the first time, that 2-cyst peroxins can be determinant for pathogenic independently of peroxide activity.

**Conclusion:** Mitochondrial 2-cyste peroxiredin (TX) plays a crucial role in Leish pathogenicity, but not through its perase activity. Instead, it acts as a molecular chone, suppressing thermal aggregation of citrate synth in vitro. This novel function is essential for parasite survival in mice, as shown by rescuing nonfect phenotype of txn with per-inactive protein. These findings redefine the role of 2-cyst peroxins in Leish and highlight their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.

**Title:** Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Histoplasma Urine Antigen (HAg) for Progressive Disseminated Histoplasis (PDH) in HIV Patients: A Multicenter Prospective Study in Mexico

**Research Question:** This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Histlas Urine Antigen (HAg) for Progressive Disseminated Histlas (PD) in HIV patients in a multicenter, prospective study in Mexico.

**Methods:** We conducted a multicenter, prospective diagnostic study in two secondary and tertiary-care facilities in Mexico, including 288 HIV patients with suspected PD suspicion. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ALPHA-HAg using Histoplas capsulatum growth on blood, bone, marrow, and tissue cultures or histopathologic examination (PD-proven) as the reference standard.

**Findings:** We found that 29.5% (85/288; 95% CI, 24.3-35.1) of patients had PD. The sensitivity of ALPHA-HAg was 67.1% (95% CI, 56.7-76.8) and specificity was 97.5 (95% CI, 94.3-99.1). The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2 (95 CI, 11.6-74.4). In 10.5% of PD-proven patients, co-opportunistic infections were diagnosed, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium complex.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that ALPHA-HAg has high specificity but low sensitivity. The test may be useful for starting antifungals, but a culture-based approach is necessary since co-infections are frequent and a negative-HAg result does not rule out PD.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to the understanding of diagnostic accuracy of ALPHA-HAg for PD in HIV patients. Our results are difficult to compare with previous studies mainly due to study design. Multicenter comparisons of tests against cultures and histology are lacking. For regions outside the US, on-site HAg is preferred for logistics and turn-around time. Therefore, we prospectively evaluated the accuracy of ALPHA-HAg for PD diagnosis among HIV-infected patients.

**Title:** Metagenomic Characterization of Viral Communities in Pediatric Diarrhea: A Novel Insights into the Diversity of Viruses Present in Acute Episodes

**Research Question:** What is the diversity of viral communities present in stool specimens from children with acute diarrhea, and can metagenomic approaches identify novel viruses that may play a causal role in human diarrhea?

**Methods:** We employed a "microassay" sequencing strategy, requiring minimal sample quantity (<100 mg), minimal purification, and limited sequencing (384 reads/sample), to characterize viral communities in 12 pediatric diarrhea specimens. This approach enabled the detection of known enteric viruses and novel sequences with limited similarity to viruses in GenBank.

**Findings:** We detected known enteric viruses and multiple putative novel viruses with limited sequence similarity to viruses in GenBank. The diversity of viral communities varied significantly between specimens, underscoring the importance of sampling multiple patients to obtain an overall perspective on viral diversity.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the potential of metagenomic approaches to define the spectrum of viruses, including novel, in stool during acute episodes of diarrhea. Detection of novel or unexpected viruses enables investigations to assess whether these agents play a causal role in human diarrhea. Our findings lay the foundation for future studies to interrogate the roles of diverse viruses in the gastrointestinal tract.

**Conclusions:** We have shown that microass can define the diversity of viral communities in fecal from patients with diarrhea. Both known and novel viruses were detected by sequencing few colonies from each library. These studies serve as a springboard for further investigations into the roles of these viruses in the gastrointestinal tract. This work expands on previous metagen studies of human stool, which have been limited to analysis of specimens from healthy individuals. Our approach minimizes the number of purification steps, enabling analysis of as little as 30 mg fecal matter, making it suitable for pediatric samples.

**Title:** Investigating the Transmission Dynamics of Dengue and Zika Viruses in the Dominican Republic: A Retrospective Analysis of Outbreaks and Demographics

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the transmission dynamics of deng and Zika viruses in the Dominican Republic, specifically examining the age and sex distribution of cases, and calculating the reproductive number (R) of each outbreak.

**Methods:** Retrospective datasets were used to collect information on populations at risk, and descriptive statistics were used to describe outbreaks on a national scale. Expected plots showed that 75% of deng cases were reported in those <20 years, while Zika infections were dispersed among the population. Dengue rates were marginally higher among males (25.9 per 10,000 population vs. 21.5 per 10,000 for females). Infections appeared highly clustered among females (73.8% (95% CI 72.6, 75.0; p<0.05); age-adjusted Zika rates among females were 7.64 per 10,000 compared to 2.72 per 10,000 among males.

**Findings:** Stratification by sex showed significantly higher rates among females (1.84 (1.82, 1.87; p<0.05) compared to males (1.72 (1.69,1.75; p<0.05). However, GBS rates stratified by sex revealed higher risk in males vs. females (0.62 vs 0.57 per 10,000). Evidence suggests little impact of existing deng immunity on Zika attack rates at the population level. Confounding R and incident calculations by sex-specific reporting can alter reliability of epidemiological metrics, which can be addressed using proxy syndromes or conditions to explore sex-skewed incidence.

**Implications:** The findings indicate community campaigns, influencing short-term health behavior, remain plausible behind increased reporting among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. Media and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on Zika outcomes among deng seropositive individuals.

**Conclusion:** This study provides insights into the transmission dynamics of deng and Zika in the Dominican Republic, highlighting the importance of age and sex in transmission. The findings suggest that community awareness campaigns and short-term health behavior are key factors in increased reporting among women of reproductive age, while biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. Media and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on clinical outcomes among deng seropitive individuals.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases (PARPs) and Poly(ADP-ri)glycohydrolase (PARG) in Arabidopsis thaliana's Response to DNA Damage and Immune Responses

**Research Question:** What are the roles of Poly(AD-ribose) polymerases (PARs) and Poly(AD-ri)glyhydrolase (PARG) in Arabidopsis thalian's response to DNA damage and immune responses, and how do they differ from their animal counterparts?

**Methods:** We investigated the functions of PAR1 and PAR2, the two members of the PAR family, and PARG1 and P2, the enzymes responsible for poly(AD-ri) removal, in Arabidopsis thalian. We generated Arabid TNA lines with mutations in PAR1 and PAR2 and tested their sensitivity to genotoxic agents, bleomycin, mitomycin, and gamma-radiation. We also examined the physical interactions between PARs and PARG using co-immunoprecipitation.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, PAR2, not PAR1, is the major contributor to poly(AD-ri) activity in Arabid thalian in response to DNA damage and immune responses. PAR2 has SAP binding motifs, not zinc fingers, and makes stronger contributions to plant immune responses, including restriction of Pseudomonas syringae growth and reduction of infection-associated DNA-strand breaks. PARG1, not P2, is the primary enzyme counteracting poly(AD-ri) in Arabid. PAR1 and PAR interact with each other and with P1 P2, suggesting direct regulatory interactions among mediators of poly(AD).

**Implications:** Our findings suggest substantial differences in regulation of poly(AD) between plants and animals. PAR2 and PARG are structurally distinct from their animal counterparts, indicating unique mechanisms of poly(AD) in plants.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that PAR2, not PAR1, plays the major role in Arabid response to DNA damage and immune, and P1, not P2, counteracts poly(AD. PAR1 and PAR interact with each other and with P1 P2, suggesting direct regulatory interactions among mediators of polyAD. Our results indicate substantial differences in regulation of polyAD between plants and animals, highlighting the importance of understanding plant-specific mechanisms of polyAD in response to DNA damage and immune.

**Title:** The MIG/JNK Pathway: A Novel Regulator of Glutamatergic Synapse Formation and Short-Term Learning in C. elegans

**Research Question:** How does the M/JNK pathway regulate glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning in C. elegans?

**Methods:** Using suppressor genetics, we identified kinases that are likely part of a new JNK pathway regulating glutateric neuron-neuron synapse in mechanensory neurons of C. elegans. This pathway includes M-15 (MAPK), NS-1 (MAPK), J-1 (MAPK), and J-1 (K). Loss of function in kinases in the M/J pathway suppresses synapse defects in mechanens neurons of rpm- mutants.

**Findings:** The M/J pathway has a specific suppress phenotype: kinases suppress synapse defects, but not axon termination, in mechanens neurons of rpm mutants. Kin in the M pathway function autonomously in mechanens neurons and localize to presynaptic terminals, indicating a role in synapse development. Transgenic overexpression of kin in the M/J pathway impairs synapse in wild-type animals. Loss of M/J signaling also suppresses defects in habituation to repeated stimuli in rpm mutants, a behavioral deficit likely arising from impaired glutater synapse formation.

**Implications:** These findings indicate the M/J pathway restricts glutateric synapse formation and short-term learning. The M/J pathway functions as a parallel to RPM-1, which acts as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit DL-1 and ML-1 MAPK pathways. The M/J pathway is a novel regulator of glutateric synapse and short-term learning in C. elegans.

**Conclusions:** The M/J pathway is a conserved intracellular hub regulating glutater synapse and short-term learning in C. elegans. This pathway is distinct from RPM-1, which regulates axon termination. The M/J pathway functions autonomously in mechanens neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals, indicating a role in synapse development. Transgenic overexpression of kin in the M/J pathway impairs synapse in wild-type animals. Loss of M/J signaling suppresses habituation to repeated stimuli in rpm mutants, a deficit likely arising from impaired glutater syn formation.

**Title:** Elucidating the Bipotential Nature of Sex-Determining Protein TR-1 in Caenorhabditis brigae and Caenorhabditis elegans**

**Research Question:** This study investigates the bipotential nature of sex-determin protein TR-1 (TR-1) in Caenorhabdit brigae and Caenorhabitis elegans, exploring its role in spermatogenesis and the structure of the bipot switch during evolution.

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic, biochemical, and molecular biology techniques, including null mutants, RNA interference, RT-PCR, and epistasis tests to investigate the function of TR-1 in Caenor brigae and Caenor elegans.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that TR-1 is required for spermatogenesis in Caenor brigae, acting as part of the Tip60 Histone Acetylase complex, and promoting the expression of C-fog-3, a gene essential for spermatogenesis. Epist tests demonstrate that TR-1 works through TR-1 to activate Cog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision. Notably, TR- also regulates the development of the male tail, as C-tra C-tr- double mutants resemble C-tra null mutants, indicating that both branches control TR- activity. However, striking differences in the relationship between the two halves of the switch have arisen during evolution.

**Implications:** Our findings confirm the bipot nature of TR-1, which can activate or repress the same target genes in response to changing upstream signals. Moreover, we show that the relationship between the two halves of the bipot switch can shift rapidly during evolution, producing the same phenotype by alternative mechanisms.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the bipot nature of TR- and its role in spermatogenesis, shedding light on the evolution of the sex-determination pathway. Our results demonstrate that TR- is bipot, activating or repressing genes in response to upstream signals, and that the relationship between the two halves of the switch can change during evolution. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms in Caenorhabitis and other species.

**Title:** Measuring Integrated Information in Biological Systems: Overcoming Limitations of ΦDM and Introducing ΦE and ΦAR**

**Research Question:** Can we develop new measures of integrated information, ΦE and ΦAR, that can quantify the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts, applicable to time-series data in biological systems, and explore their implications for consciousness and neurocognitive processes?

**Methods:** We propose two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, to overcome the limitations of ΦDM, which is only defined for Markov systems, rare in biology. We use simulations to demonstrate the in-practice applicability of our measures and explore their properties.

**Findings:** Our results provide new opportunities for examining integration in real and model systems, and carry implications for relations between integrated, consciousness, and neuroognitive processes. However, our findings pose challenges for theories that ascribe meaning to measured quantities.

**Implications:** Our work opens avenues for empirically examining integrated for time-series data from neuroimaging and biological datasets to test intuitions regarding consciousness and neuroognitive processes, investigating how integrated is modulated by input and output of a system in and with surrounding environment, and theoretically determining measures under different assumptions.

**Abstract:**

Integrated information, Φ, quantifies the extent a system generates more than sum its parts, possibly reflecting consciousness generated by neural systems. However, Φ is only defined for Markov, unusual in biology; as a result, Φ rarely measured in practice. We introduce Φ and Φ, easy to apply time-series data, overcoming limitations. Simulations demonstrate in-practice applicability and explore properties. Our results new opportunities examining integration real and model, implications relations integrated, consciousness, and neuroognitive processes. However, pose challenges theories ascribe meaning quantities. Future work empirically examine integrated time-series neuroimaging biological, investigate modulated input output system, and environment, determine measures under assumptions.

**Title:** Investigating the Spread of Rhodesian African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda: A Spatial Analysis of Environmental and Climatic Factors and Livestock Movement

**Research Question:** What are the environmental and climatic factors contributing to the spread of Rhodesian African Trypanosomias (H) in Uganda, and does the movement of infected livestock play a significant role in its distribution?

**Methods:** We extended a previous study using logistic regression to incorporate spatial autocorrelation, uncertainty in data and model parameters, and predictive mapping of high AT risk areas. A generalized linear geostatistical model in a Bayesian framework was used to account for spatial autocorrelation and uncertainty.

**Findings:** Our analysis supports the theory that Rhodesian AT was introduced to the area via movement of untreated, infected livestock from endemic areas. The confounding effect of healthcare accessibility on AT distribution and link between disease and minimum surface temperature was confirmed. Predictive mapping indicates increased risk of high AT prevalence in areas surrounding livestock markets, highlighting the importance of trading for disease spread.

**Implications:** Adherence to government policy to treat livestock at point of sale is essential to prevent spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the application of Bayesian geostatistical to AT distribution in a small area of Uganda. Robust results strengthen the role of livestock in continued spread of Rhodesian AT in Uganda and utility of methodology for prediction of AT based on covariates.

**Title:** Challenging the Consensus: Feasibility of Equilibrium in Ecological Networks

**Research Question:** Does the assumption of a feasible equilibrium with positive abundances in ecologically-inspired networks hold true, particularly in species-rich systems?

**Methods:** We employed analytical and simulation-based approaches to investigate the feasibility of equilibrium in ecologically networks, focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.

**Findings:** Our results show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species-rich systems, leaving the existence of a feasible equilibrium in local stability criteria far from granted. Furthermore, we found that dynamical behavior of ecologically-inspired architectures differs from unstructured systems, suggesting that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and architecture.

**Implications:** Our findings challenge the consensus that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems and highlight the importance of exploring the effects of topological structure on system dynamics. While previous works have shown that particular architectures can stabilize ecological networks, the feasibility of different architectures for interaction regimes has not been explored. Our results indicate that sensible information on dynamics of natural systems will be obtained by concentrating on the interplay between ecological structure, strengths, interaction weights, and how strengths are distributed in architecture.

**Conclusions:** In species-rich communities, interactions should be moderate to ensure stability of equilibrium. We performed simulations to study stability in randomly generated systems mimicking empirically observed food webs. Secondly, species richness and connectance are usually treated as independent, but have been described to decrease in different systems, restricting the parameter space to be explored. Finally, even topology has been suggested to play a minor role in stability, we showed that architecture plays a non-trivial role on equilibrium abundances. Our results are compatible with previous works that the existence of equilibrium is not guaranteed, the probability to observe such a decreases exponentially towards the size of the network. Interestingly, we found that with weak interactions, non-trivial equilibria are only found in ecologically, in a way ecologically sensible.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Feasibility of equilibrium is not guaranteed in species-rich systems
* Dynamical behavior of ecologically architectures differs from unstructured systems
* Interplay between interaction strength and architecture is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics
* Interactions should be moderate to ensure stability in species-rich communities
* Topology plays a non-trivial role on equilibrium abundances

**Title:** Investigating the Epidemiology of Coxiella burnii Infection in Humans and Cattle in Western Kenya: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Research Question:** What is the seroprevalence of Coxi burnii in humans and cattle in Western Kenya, and what socio-economic, demographic, and environmental factors are associated with exposure to the pathogen?

**Methods:** A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 416 households in Western Kenya, collecting serum samples from 204 humans and 955 cattle for Co burnii antibodies. Questionnaires on demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information were administered. Data linked to environmental datasets on geographical locations (e.g., land cover). Correlation and spatial correlation analyses were applied to assess the link between cattle and human seropreval. Multile regression was used to assess relationships between socio-economic, demographic, and environmental factors and seropositivity in humans and animals.

**Findings:** The overall seropreval of Co burnii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5 in cattle. No correlation was found between cattle and human seropval within households or spatial proximity to households. Multile modelling indicated factors associated with exposure: cattle from market (opposed to homestead) and residing areas with lower precipitation had highest seropreval. For humans, the youngest group had highest odds of serositivity, variations observed between ethnic groups, and frequent contact with livestock (grazing and material) was a risk.

**Implications:** Coxi burnii is endemic in Western Kenya, although prevalence is relatively low. Analysis suggests environmental factors play a role in cattle exposure, human patterns likely driven by livestock contact. Livestock markets may be a target for interventions.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the influence of livestock on transmission Co burnii. No correlation found between cattle and human seropval at household or spatial level, indicating significant human exposure due to contact or contamination by livestock from other households.

**Title:** Identification of Vasa-like Genes in Schistosoma mansoni: Implications for Germ Line Transgenesis and Functional Genomics

**Research Question:** This study aimed to identify and characterize Vasa-like genes in Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm responsible for schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease, and explore their potential as markers for germ line transgenesis and functional genomics.

**Methods:** Bioinformatics analysis of the S. mansoni genome revealed 33 putative DEAD-box helicases, three of which exhibited Vasa-like sequences. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed three Vasa-like genes, Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3, as members of the Vasa/10 DEAD-box family. Transcripts encoding Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3 were cloned from cDNAs of mixed adult worms, and quantitative PCR revealed their presence in developmental stages with elevated expression in sporocysts, adult, females, eggs, and miracidia, strikingly high in undeveloped egg. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) analysis showed Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3 transcribed in the ovary where oocytes.

**Findings:** Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3 exhibited high identity to Vasa proteins from other flukes, with Sm1 89% identical and 95% similar to DDXX-dependent helicase of blood fluke. Germ specific expression of schosome Vasa genes provide an informative landmark for line transgenesis schist, etiologic agents of major tropical diseases.

**Implications:** Germ line transgenesis schist might be expedited if schosome cells could be reliably cultured. Vasa, an ATP-dependent DEAD-box helic, is an archetypal metazo germ specific marker. DEAD-box helic have been identified essential for schosome survival, and vasa gene products as targets in schist worthy of consideration. Genome sequences of three major schist species are available, underscoring need for functional approaches to identify schist genes for novel interventions.

**Conclusions:** Vasa-like genes Sm1, Sm2, and Sm3 in S. mansoni may be valuable markers for functional genomics to introduce trans into schist germ line. However, expression pattern may impact use vasa genes as markers cell identification and transformation. WISH corroborated expression Sm genes germ rich tissues organs adult schist. These findings provide a route to germ line schist transduce egg and genetic manipulation developmental stage with ML feasible. Additionally, germ trans might be monitored if schosome cells localized and tracked cultured pathogen.

**Title:** Hippo Signaling and VGL4 Regulate Cardiac Valve Development and Homeostasis: Implications for Congenital Valve Disease Prevention

**Research Question:** What is the role of Hippo signaling and V4 in cardiac valve development and homeostasis, and can modulation of this pathway prevent congenital valve disease?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of V4, a transcriptional cofactor in vertebrates, in cardiac valve development and homeostasis using tissue-specific knockout and semi-knockout models in mice. We found that V4 is mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells at post-EM stage and maintained till adult stage. Loss of V in endothelial lineage led to valve malformation with expanded expression of Y targets, while semi-knock of Y in V-ablated hearts constrained hyperproliferation of valve interstitial cells.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that V is essential for valve development and manipulation of Hipp components would be a potential therapy for preventing progression of congenital valve disease. Loss of V in endothelial resulted in abnormal valves and cardiac hypertrophy in 36-week-old mice, while semi-knock of Y rescued malformation induced by V deletion. Hipp signaling in V is required for post-EM semunar valveogenesis and homeasis. Precise regulation of the pathway is necessary for proliferation of endocard-derived mesenchymal cells and valve elongation.

**Implications:** This study identifies a previously unknown function of V in valve remodeling homeasis and suggests that mutations may underlie human congenital heart dysplasia. Our findings indicate that Hipp signaling is critical for proper valve maturation, and modulation of this pathway could prevent congenital valve disease.

**Conclusions:** This is the first in vivo study showing the role of Hipp regulation in valve and maturation. Lineage tracing data suggest that endothelial, not neural, V regulates valve interstitial proliferation. Mechanistically, semi-knock of Y rescued the phenotype of valves in V-deleted heart, indicating V is required for normal development by antagonizing Y activity. Together, we identified a key role of V in valve development and maintenance.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Prevalence of Soft Sweeps in Natural Populations: A Critical Examination of Methodological Assumptions and Demographic Factors

**Research Question:** Do soft sweeps, a type of positive selection acting on genetic variation, occur in natural populations, or are they a result of methodological artifacts and demographic factors?

**Methods:** We re-examined three recent studies on soft sweeps in humans, Drosophila, and HIV, using population theory and simulation, and found that all are prone to high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying sweeps under hard and neutral models. We demonstrate that demographic histories combined with hard sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation.

**Findings:** Our results challenge the tendency to invoke parameter-heavy models of positive selection, neglecting proper demographic models. The lack of model testing and statistical analysis led to inaccurate views of evolutionary processes and trajectories. Generalization resulted in misleading answers to old questions in population genetics, suggesting a dominant role for selection in shaping genomic variation.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of proper demographic modeling and statistical analysis in identifying sweeps. We argue that soft sweeps are unlikely in these examples, given non-equilibrium histories, rare beneficial mutations, and demographic factors.

**Conclusions:** Our study reconciles opposing views on sweeps in natural populations, highlighting the need for careful consideration of demographic factors and methodological assumptions. We suggest that soft sweeps are not pervasive, but rather a result of methodological artifacts and demographic factors. This has implications for understanding evolutionary processes and genomic variation in natural populations.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Host-Seeking Inhibition in Aedes aegypt Mosquitoes: Identification of Neurope Y-Like Receptor 1 (NLR1) as a Candidate Receptor for Headptide

**Background:** Aedes aegypt mosquitoes are the primary vectors of dengue fever, causing 50-100 million infections per year, transmitted between humans and mosquitoes through blood feeding. Their host-seeking behavior is known to be inhibited for three days following a meal by a hemolymph-borne humoral factor, Headptide. The mechanism by which this peptide alters mosquito behavior and the receptor through which it signals are unknown.

**Research Question:** We aimed to identify receptors that respond to Headptide as a means to clarify the mechanism of host-seeking inhibition following a meal.

**Methods:** We carried out a cell-based imaging assay to link Ae. aegi Neurope Yike receptors (NLR) to a panel of peptide ligands and identified NLR1 as a candidate receptor for shorturope-F peptides (sPF) that showed sensitivity to Headptide.

**Findings:** Four of eight Ae. aegi NLR responded to one or more ligands, but only NLR1 responded to Headptide as well as sPF. Two NLR homologs in the genome of the disease vector Ix scularis were also sensitive to Headptide. Injection of synthetic Headptide and sPF inhibited host-seeking in non-fed females, whereas injections of buffer or inactive Headptide[C10 had no effect.

**Conclusion:** We identified four Ae. aegi NLR and N1 as a candidate sPF receptor sensitive to Headptide. However, N1 alone is not required for host-seeking, suggesting other receptors, peptides, or both, regulate this behavior.

**Implications:** Our findings provide insight into the mechanism of host-seeking inhibition in Ae.egy mosquitoes and highlight the complexity of regulation of this behavior. N1 may function redundantly with other receptors to modulate mosquito behavior. Our results propose two models for the regulation of host-seeking behavior: (1) N1 responds to sPF but not Head, or (2) N1 responds to both sPF and Head. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between N1 and regulation of feeding behavior.

**Title:** Spatial Analysis of Schistosomiasis Transmission in Akure Local Government Area, Ondo State, Nigeria: A Multicriteria Evaluation Approach Using Satellite Imagery and Spatial Analysis

**Research Question:** Can environmental factors such as rivers, elevation, slope, land temperature, land use/cover, and rainfall influence the distribution and transmission of schistosiasis in Akure Local Government Area, Ondo State, Nigeria?

**Methods:** This study employed a multicriteria evaluation (MCE) approach using Sa's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to identify areas with suitable conditions for schosias transmission based on physical and environmental factors derived from satellite imagery analysis. The study focused on temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, and land use/cover as controlling factors of schias incidence in the area. AHP was used to obtain the weight importance of each schias risk factor. Weighted overlay analysis was done after each factor was given appropriate weight through the hierarchical process.

**Findings:** The study revealed varying risk of schias with 82% of the area falling under high and very risk category. One community (Ole) had the lowest risk, while risk increased in four communities (ju, Igoba, Ita, Ogb and Oese). Predictions by model correlated with observations from field study. High zones corresponded to known endemic communities.

**Implications:** Environmental factors can be used in identifying and predicting transmission of schias as well as monitoring disease in newly rural and agricultural communities.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrated the potential of remote sensing and geographical information system spatial analysis for schias modeling, disease distribution, ecology, epidemiology, prevention, surveillance, and prioritization of risk areas and early warning for disease transmission. Field records confirmed spatial epidemiology of schias in the region. Results showed significant difference between communities prevalence of schias. This study confirmed satellite environmental data can determine schias risk using relevant techniques. Spatial model produced schias risk zones from factors (temperature, rainfall, elevation, land use, NDVI, slope, proximity).

**Title:** Cholesterol-Dependent Cytolysin Pneumolysin Plays a Key Role in Neuropathogenic Potential of Streptococcus pneumoniae Meningitis through Glutamate-Dependent Synaptic Damage

**Research Question:** What is the role of cholesterol-dependent cytolytic pneumolysin in the neuropathogenic potential of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, and how does it contribute to synaptic damage in the brain?

**Methods:** We analyzed post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumoccal meningitis and mouse models of pneumoc meningitis expressing pore-form cholesterol-dependent cytolytic pneumolys. We also exposed mouse brain slices to pore-compet pneumolys at disease-relevant concentrations and measured dendritic and synaptic damage.

**Findings:** We observed synaptic loss in the superficial layers of the neocortex in post-mortem samples and mice with pneumoc meningitis when bacteria expressed pore-form pneumolys. Exposure to pore-compet pneumys caused dendritic swelling, spine elimination, and synaptic loss in mouse brain slices. NMD glutamate antagonists MK and DAP reduced this pathology. Pneumolys increased glutamate levels in brain slices. In astrocytes, pneumys initiated glutamate release in a calcium-dependent manner.

**Implications:** We propose that pneumys plays a significant role in pneumoc meningitis by initiating glutamate release from astrocytes, leading to subsequent glutamate-dependent synaptic damage. This is the first demonstration of synaptic pathology in pneumoc meningitis and a bacterial cytolyin dysregulating glutamate control in the brain, inducing excitotoxic damage.

**Conclusion:** Streptoccus pneumoniae meningitis, a common bacterial infection of the brain, is associated with significant neuronal death, particularly in the hippocampus. Pneumolys, a cholesterol-dependent cytolyin, is a critical pneumoc pathogenic factor. Our study demonstrates a pathogenic cascade linking pneumys with glutamate release and subsequent NMD-dependent dendritic and synaptic pathology in pneumoc meningitis. We identify pneumys as a critical factor in synaptic loss in neocortex in pneumoc meningitis and demonstrate its pore-form capacity, glut release, and activation of N receptors.

**Title:** Cell Cycle Progression through Mitosis is Critical for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection: Implications for Cancer Prevention and Control

**Research Question:** What is the role of cell cycle progression through mitosis in the establishment of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection in stratified epithelium?

**Methods:** We used synchronized human keratinocytes and infectious HPV16 particles with intact genome to investigate the role of cell cycle progression in HPV infection. Early gene expression was used as a readout for infection.

**Findings:** Our results show that cells must enter mitosis for HPV infection to take place. Late phase inhibitors had no effect, whereas G1, S, G2, and M phase cycle inhibitors prevented infection. We conclude that cells need to pass through prophase for successful onset of transcription of HPV encapsulated genes.

**Implications:** These findings provide a reason why HPVs establish infections in basal compartment of stratified epithel. Only this compartment contains cells progressing through the cycle, allowing HPVs to establish infection. By defining a condition for susceptibility to HPV infection, these results have implications for control.

**Conclusions:** Cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection in stratified epithelium. Our data indicate that movement through mitosis is one step in establishing infection. Further physiological relevance would be confirmed in primary keratinocytes and in vivo models such as mouse and non-primate.

**Research Question:** Are microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marffei and do they play a role in regulating thermal dimorphism?

**Methods:** High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from mycelial and yeast phases of P. marffei revealed 24 potential miRNA candidates, with 17 in mycelial and 7 in yeast phases. Two genes, d-1 and d-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins and q-2 encoding Argonaute protein, were identified in P. marffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed d-2 of P. marff was closely related to homologs in other dimorphic pathogenic fungi than Penicillium chrysenum and Aspergillus spp, suggesting co-evolution of d-2 among thermal fungi.

**Findings:** d-2 demonstrated higher mRNA levels in mycel than yeast by 7-fold (p<0.001). Northern analysis confirmed expression of two miRNAs, PMil-M1 and PMil-M2 only in mycel phase. Using d-1 KO, d-2 KO, dDK and q-2 deletion mutants, biogenesis of both miRN dependent d- but not d- or q-. mRNA levels of predicted targets PMil-M upregulated in knockdown PMil-MKD, supporting regulatory function miRN.

**Implications:** Our findings provide first evidence for differential expression of miRN in growth phases of dimorphic fungi and shed light on evolution of proteins involved mi biogenesis and possible post-transcriptional control governing thermalism.

**Conclusion:** miRN are important regulatory molecules in multicellular organisms, we hypothesized P marff possesses functional RNA machinery encoding miRN involved regulation thermalism. High-throughput sequencing small RN from mycel and yeast P revealed 24 potential mi candidates, more abundantly expressed mycel than yeast. Two genes, d- and q, encoding Dicer and Argona proteins, identified P marff. Phylogenetic showed d- P mar closely related homologs other dim pathogenic fungi than Penillium chrys and Asgillus, suggesting co-evolution d among thermal fungi. d demonstrated higher mRNA mycel than yeast 7-fold (p<0.001). Northern analysis confirmed expression two miRN, PMil-M and PMil only mycel. Using d- KO, d KO, dDK q deletion, biogenesis both mi dependent d but not d or q. mRNA predicted targets PMil upregulated knockdown PMilKD, regulatory function miRN.

**Title:** Evaluating the Competence of Pacific Mosquito Vectors for Zika Virus Transmission during the 2013-2017 Outbreak

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the ability of two primary mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypt and Aedes polensis, to transmit Zika virus (ZIK) in the Pacific region during the 2013-2017 outbreak.

**Methods:** Field-collected female mosquitoes from three Ae. aegypt and two Ae. polensis populations were orally exposed to ZIK (107 TCID/mL) isolated in 2014. At 6, 9, and 21 days post-infection, mosquito bodies, thorax, and abdomen, and heads were analyzed for infection, dissemination, and transmission rates, and transmission efficiency, respectively.

**Findings:** Our results showed heterogeneous ZIK infection rates between Ae. aegpt populations, but moderate and homogeneous dissemination rates between populations. For Ae. polensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between the two tested populations. Transmission efficiency revealed low vector competence for ZIK of different Ae populations. Our results indicated low ZIK transmission by Ae. aegi and Ae. polensis from the Pacific region.

**Implications:** Unexpected results suggest that other factors, such as vector density, lifespan, or immunologically naive fraction of population, may have contributed to the rapid spread of ZIK in the Pacific during 201-2017 outbreak.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of understanding vector competence for ZIK in Pacific mosquitoes, particularly Ae. aeg and Ae. polensis, during the 201-201 outbreak. Our results indicate low transmission efficiency of ZIK by Ae.eg and Ae. pol from the region, suggesting that other factors may have contributed to the rapid spread of ZIK in the Pacific during 201-201 outbreak.

**Title:** Elucidating the Structure and Function of the Long Non-Coding RNA Xist: A Master Regulator of X Chromosome Inactivation in Mammalian Cells

**Research Question:** How do noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) like Xist regulate X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells, and what are the thermodynamically stable secondary and higher-order structures that enable their function?

**Methods:** We developed Targeted StructureSeq, a novel approach that combines chemical probing of RNA structure with massively parallel sequencing to enrich for signals from the RNA of interest, achieving high coverage with few sequencing reads. We applied this method to the full-length Xist lncRNA and identified new functional elements, including the repeat element in the 5'-end of X.

**Findings:** Targeted StructureSeq revealed novel structural elements in X that are evolutionarily conserved, including a new proximal to the repeats important for X function. Our analysis also demonstrated the utility of this approach for probing RNA conformation in mammalian cells.

**Implications:** Understanding the conformation of RNAs is crucial for understanding their function and evolution. Targeted StructureSeq provides a scalable and targeted approach to analyze RNA conformation, enabling systematic study of ncRNAs like Xist. Our findings provide new insights into the structure and function of Xist, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of Targeted StructureSeq for probing RNA conformation in mammalian cells and highlights its potential for advancing mechanistic understanding of ncRNAs. We expect this approach to be useful for developing conformation models of full-length ncRNAs like Xist.

**Title:** A Novel Statistical Framework for Evaluating the Performance of Genetic Risk Prediction Models in Complex Diseases

**Research Question:** Can we develop a unified statistical framework that connects various predictive indices to evaluate the performance of genetic risk models for complex diseases, complementing the limitations of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve (AUC)?

**Methods:** We propose a novel statistical framework that estimates a range of predictive metrics, including AUC, mean difference between cases and non-cases, net reclassification improvement, proportion of cases by specific population percentile, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile, given overall disease probability and heritability explained by genetic variants.

**Findings:** Our simulations match well with theoretical estimates, demonstrating the feasibility of the framework. We apply the methodology to nine complex diseases, evaluating predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants.

**Implications:** Our framework provides a comprehensive assessment of model performance, complementing AUC with other indices and visualizations such as ROC, risk density, and predictiveness curves. This is crucial for evaluating the clinical utility of risk-based genomic profiles, as commercial companies like deCODE, Navigics, and 23Me offer disease estimates. High statistical significance does not equate to predictive power, emphasizing the need for appropriate measures.

**Conclusions:** Our framework offers a unified approach to evaluating genetic risk models, addressing limitations of AUC. By considering overall disease prevalence and heritability, we can estimate various metrics and visualize model performance. This is essential for determining the clinical value of risk-based genomic tests, where established thresholds exist, a large part of the ROC curve is derived from cutoffs not of interest. Our results demonstrate the potential of complementing A with other indices and visualizations, particularly when meaningful thresholds exist.

**Title:** Evaluation of a New Recombinant Antigen-Based Rapid Diagnostic Test for Human African Trypanosomiasis (H) in the Democratic Republic of Congo

**Research Question:** This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) using recombinant antigens (SDOLINEAT 2.0) in comparison with a DT produced using native antigens (SDOLINEAT) and the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomias (CATT) for diagnosing Human Trypanosoma brucei gambense African trypaniasis (H) in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

**Methods:** A total of 57,632 individuals were screened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, either passively at 10 health centers or actively by 5 mobile teams, and 260 H cases were confirmed by parasitology. The sensitivity and specificity of each test were compared.

**Findings:** The highest sensitivity was achieved with SDOLAT 2.0 (71.2%), followed by CATT (62.5%) and SDOLAT (59%). The most specific was CATT (99.2%), while specificity of SDOL and SDOL 2.0 were 98.9% and 98.1, respectively. Sensitivity of tests were lower than previously reported as they identified cases from overlapping populations. All tests were more sensitive in passive than active screening. Combining two or three tests resulted in increased sensitivity: when SDOL was combined with SDOL 2.0, sensitivity reached 98.4% in passive and 83% in active screening.

**Implications:** The recombinant antigen-based DT was more sensitive and specific than SDOLAT. It was as sensitive but less specific than CATT. While practicality and cost-effectiveness of algorithms including screening need to be investigated, two or more tests appear to enhance diagnostic sensitivity algorithms although decrease specificity observed.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the potential of SDOL 2.0 as a valuable tool for diagnosing H in the Democratic Republic of Congo, particularly when combined with other tests. Further research is needed to standardize and improve manufacturing of recombinant antigens and investigate practicality of algorithms.

**Title:** Persistent Triatoma dimata Infestation in Comapa, Guatemala: Challenges to Chagas Disease Control and Elimination

**Research Question:** What is the effectiveness of multiple rounds of indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS) in controlling Triatoma dimata infestation in the municipality of Comapa, Guatemala, and what are the implications for Chagas disease elimination?

**Methods:** We conducted three cross-sectional entomological and serological surveys in Comapa between 1999 and 2015. Baseline serological (1999) and entomological (2001-2) surveys were followed by three rounds of insecticide applications (2003-2005) and intermittent spraying of infested houses until 2012. Household entom indices and construction materials were assessed in 200, 2007, and 201. Serological surveys were conducted in school-age children (199, 200, and 201, and women of child-bearing age (15-44) in 201.

**Findings:** After multiple rounds of IRS, the infestation index decreased significantly from 39% (200-2) to 27 (201). Household materials alone predicted <10% of infested houses. Chagas seropreval in Com declined in school-aged children by 10-fold from 10 (199) to 1 (201). However, serreval in women of child age remained >10. Despite a decade of vector control in Com, evidence of reduced transmission, continued risk for vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to 202 Chagas elimination.

**Implications:** Systematic vector control and Chagas screening programs for congen and vectororne disease are needed to reach elimination in regions with persistent infestation.

**Conclusion:** Our study highlights the challenges to Chagas control in Comapa, a region with persistent Trioma infestation, despite multiple rounds of IRS. Continued vector-borne and congenital transmission pose a threat to the 202 elimination goal. Integrated vector control and Chagas screening programs are necessary to reach elimination in regions with persistent infestation.

**Title:** Unstable Genome of Citrobacterium rodent: Insights into the Evolution of a Recently Emerged Pathogen

**Research Question:** How does the genome of Citrobacterium rodent, a mouse pathogen causing attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, evolve through large-scale recombination and transposition of mobile genetic elements, and what are the implications for its emergence as a significant pathogen?

**Methods:** We performed PFGE sequencing of isolates, whole-genome transcript analysis, and examination of mobile genetic elements in Citrobacter rodent strain ICC168, and sequenced additional strain EX-33, to investigate the impact of mobile elements on its genome evolution.

**Findings:** Consistent with our hypothesis, the genome of Citrobacter rodent is unstable due to repeat-mediated large-scale recombination and active transposition of mobile elements, such as prophages. We found that strain ICC168 is representative of the species, and most inactivating mutations common to isolates likely occurred early in evolution of this pathogen.

**Implications:** Our findings draw parallels with evolution of other bacterial pathogens, suggesting Citacter rodent is a recently emerged pathogen that co-evolved with development of mice as a model for human disease.

**Conclusions:** The genome of Citrobacter rod features characteristics of a recently passed evolutionary bottleneck, including pseudogenes and IS elements. This study demonstrates the impact of mobile elements on evolution of Citacter rod and its unstable genome.

**Title:** Inferring Molecular Mechanisms of Stochastic Protein Expression from Protein Distributions: A Robust and Assumption-Free Approach

**Research Question:** Despite the abundance of theoretical models explaining stochasticity in protein expression, there is a lack of a robust, assumption-free method for inferring the molecular mechanisms underlying protein distributions.

**Methods:** We propose a method for inferring biochemical rate constants governing chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA degradation from stochastic protein distributions. We derived analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution, found that these moments capture the shape of protein distributions, and developed an efficient algorithm for inferring expression constants from moments.

**Findings:** Using this algorithm, we find that protein distributions are consistent with multiple biochemical constant sets. Despite degeneracy, the solution space of constants always informs underlying mechanisms. For example, we distinguish between transcriptional bursting and constitutive production regimes. Our method agrees with the standard approach in the restrictive regime and identifies constants not obtainable without assumptions. We estimate biochemical constants or ratios in 91% of cases, and all underlying constants in some cases.

**Implications:** This framework will be a powerful tool for deducing molecular contributions to specific patterns of expression. Given four moments capture the shape and can rapidly determine constant sets, this approach shows promise in learning mechanistic information from stochastic expression. We applied our framework to a steady protein distribution.

**Conclusions:** Stochastic transcription and translation produce fluctuations in RNA and protein, manifesting as distributions across cells. These distributions contain information about processes governing transcription and translation, though unclear. Investigators measure expression by reporter fluctuations flow cytometry or microscopy, resulting in a count reflecting cell-cell variation. To simulate cell-to variation in silico, investigators developed a stochastic model by summing possible. Instead of assuming geometric distributions, we modeled translation. The -th moment depends on RNA-protein covariates summing. The result is expansion for -th and - moments between RNA protein distributions. Learning mechanisms from stochastic requires a method, model, and fitting parameters from data. There are consensus for tasks.

**Title:** Development of a Novel Vaccination Strategy against Monkeypox Virus (MPV) using Recombinant Bovirus 4 (BoHV-4) Vectors

**Research Question:** Can recombinant Bovirus 4 (Bo-4) vectors expressing different Monkeypox virus (MPV) glycoproteins provide protection against lethal MPV challenge in STAT knockout mice?

**Methods:** Three recombinant Bo-4 vectors, Bo-4-CMV-A29g106ΔTK, Bo-4-E1-MR106ΔTK, and Bo-4-E1-BR106TK, were constructed and tested for their capacity to express MPV glycoproteins. The vectors were administered intraperitoneally to STAT knockout mice and evaluated for safety and efficacy against lethal MPV challenge.

**Findings:** The recombinant Bo-4 vectors were found to be safe, with no weight loss or adverse events observed. Bo-4-E1-MR106TK alone or in combination with Bo-4-CMV-A106 and Bo-4-E-BR106 provided 100% and 80% protection, respectively, against mortality and morbidity in STAT knockout mice.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the efficacy of Bo-4 vectors as a vaccine platform for MPV and highlights the need for further research on pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and therapeutics due to concerns of MPV as bioterror agent.

**Conclusions:** MPV remains a neglected disease in rural areas, with increasing human-wildlife interaction and human-to-human transmission. Smallp vaccination provides cross-protection, but campaign ended in 1980, leaving a large population unprotected. Current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns, and no FDA-approved therapies exist. This study provides a novel approach to MPV vaccination using Bo-4 vectors, which could be used as a platform for future vaccine development.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of mRNA Decay in Trypanosomes: Identification of ApH Phosphatase AL1 as the Major Decapping Enzyme

**Research Question:** What is the mechanism of mRNA decay in trypanosomes, and what is the role of ApH phosphatase AL1 in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the mRNA decay pathway in trypanosomes using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. We identified ApH phosphat AL1 as the major decapping enzyme in trypanosomes and characterized its localization, function, and substrate specificity.

**Findings:** We found that ApH phosph AL1 is essential for mRNA decay and localizes to the posterior pole of the cell, where it co-localizes with the 5-3 exonuclease X. Depletion of ApH AL1 leads to accumulation of deadenylated mRNAs that have not started 5-3 decay, indicating that ApH acts downstream of deadenylation and upstream of degradation. In vitro experiments showed that recombinant, N-terminally truncated ApH protein sensitizes capped trypan spliced RNA to X1, but only in the presence of 5 polyphosphatase, indicating a different decapping mechanism than Dcp. This is the first reported function of eukotic ApH phosphatase, a bacterial-derived class of enzymes present in all phylogen supergroups of eukotic kingdom.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that trypanosomes use ApH phosphase AL as the major decapping enzyme, which is essential for mRNA decay. The exclusive co-localization with 5-3 exonuclease X suggests both enzymes are part of the same pathway. Deadenated mRNAs can be degraded by 3-5 exonuclease or decapped by Dcp/D2 followed by 5-3 exonolytic decay. We propose that the granule separates decay enzymes AL1 and X from mRNA, regulating the amount of decay needed by the cell. The fraction of X at posterior is variable and depends on cellular state of metabolism.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals the mechanism of mRNA decay in trypan and identifies ApH phosphase AL as the major decapping enzyme. This is the first reported function of eotic Ap phosphatase, a bacterial-derived class enzymes present in all phylogen supergroups of eotic kingdom. The substrate of eotic ApH phosphat is unknown, but related to bacterial Ap diadenine tetraphosphate, reminiscent of eotic cap. Our findings provide strong evidence for ApH being the trypan decapping enzyme, essential for mRNA decay.

**Title:** Inhibition of Arx Gene in α-cells Promotes α-to-β Cell Conversion and Regeneration in the Adult Pancreas

**Research Question:** Can the inhibition of the Arx gene in α-cells induce the conversion of α-cells into β-like cells in the adult pancreas, and is this process sufficient to regenerate functional β-cell mass and reverse diabetes?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches to investigate the role of Arx in α-cells in α-to-β cell conversion in the adult pancreas. We generated Arx knockout (ArKO) and Ar conditional knockout (cKO) mice, and analyzed the effects on α-cell conversion and β-cell regeneration.

**Findings:** Our results show that selective inhibition of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to promote α-to-β conversion at any age, inducing continuous mobilization of ductal precursor cells to an endocrine fate, gluc+ cells being subsequently converted into β-like upon Ar inhibition. Notably, through generation of Arx and Pax4 double mutants, we demonstrate that Pax is dispensable for these processes, indicating Ar as the main trigger of α-cell β-cell neogenesis. Moreover, loss of Ar in α-c is sufficient to regenerate functional β-cell mass and reverse diabetes-induced β-cell depletion.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that strategies targeting Ar expression or its molecular co-activators may provide new avenues for diabetes treatment. Importantly, β-cell regeneration is able to counteract toxin-induced diabetes, maintaining euglycemia.

**Conclusions:** Inhibition of Arx in α-cells initiates a cycle of gluc+ cell neoformation and conversion into β-like cells, leading to regeneration of functional β-cell mass, a concept of importance in diabetes research. Our data provide evidence that sole loss of Ar gene in α-c is sufficient to initiate continuous gluc+ cell neoformation and conversion into β cells, thereby leading to regeneration of functional β-cell mass.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Layer of Control in Eukaryotic Replication Initiation: Identification of Replication Initiation Promoters (RIPs) and Their Role in Preferential Initiation of Origins

**Research Question:** How do eukotic cells regulate the initiation of DNA replication at thousands of origins in their genome to prevent genomic alterations?

**Methods:** We employed a sensitized system to study the regulation of eukotic replication, where multiple inhibitory mechanisms were disabled, allowing for the observation of diverse initiation efficiencies among origins.

**Findings:** We identified novel genetic elements, termed Replication Initiation Promoters (RIPs), necessary for preferential initiation of two origins and sufficient to confer preferential initiation on heterologous origins when control of initiation is partially deregulated. RIPs do not enhance S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins, acting specifically as initiation promoters. We mapped RIPs to ∼60 AT-rich sequences acting in distance- and sequence-dependent manner. During replication, Mc2 associates with origins that preferentially initiate and those that do not, suggesting RIPs can overcome block initiation imposed by Mc2 association.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a local level of control in the block initiation, creating a complex genomic landscape of replication potential revealed when global mechanisms preventing replication are compromised. If replication contributes to genomic alterations, as speculated in cancer, some regions of the genome may be more susceptible to these alterations than others.

**Conclusions:** Eukotic cells use a battery of regulatory mechanisms to reduce the activity of replication proteins to minimize the probability of initiation from many origins. However, our findings suggest an additional layer of control can differentially regulate initiation at distinct origins. RIPs provide a new insight into how diversity can be introduced in the regulation of eukotic replication. Investigation into the role of individual mechanisms in the block initiation must be conducted in sensitized systems where other mechanisms have been disrupted and replication can be detected.

**Title:** Clinical and Epidemiological Features of Invasive Amoebias in HIV-1 Infected Individuals: A Retrospective Analysis of 170 Cases in East Asian Countries

**Research Question:** This study aimed to characterize the clinical and epidemiological features of invasive amebias in HIV-1 infected individuals in East Asian countries and investigate the effectiveness of metronidazole and tinidazole treatment in this population.

**Methods:** A retrospective analysis of medical records of 170 HIV-1 infected patients with invasive amebias was conducted. E. histoly genotype was assayed in 14 cases. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and treatment outcomes were analyzed.

**Findings:** Clinical presentation of invasive amebias in HIV-1 patients was similar to that in non-HIV hosts, with fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP associated with extraintestinal ameb diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis, and three from unrelated causes. Metronidazole or tinidazole treatment was successful in 165 cases. Luminal treatment was provided to 83, but amebias recurred in 6, similar to non-treated patients. Recurrence more frequent in HCV-antib positive and syphilis acquired during follow-up. Various E. histoly genotypes identified, no correlation with clinical features or outcome.

**Implications:** Excellent outcome for HIV-1 individuals with uncomplicated amebias treated metronidazole tinidazole, consistent with previous reports. Luminal treatment after metronidazole tinid does not reduce recurrence in high-risk populations due to re-infection.

**Conclusions:** HIV-1 immunocompromised status had no impact on amebias forms. High fever, leukocyt, and CRP correlated with extraintestinal ameb diseases. Metronidazole tinid treatment effective in HIV-1 individuals uncomplicated amebias. Luminal treatment post-metronid tinid does not prevent recurrence in high-risk groups. Spread of E. hist in MSM beyond Asia a concern.

**Title:** Evaluating the Impact of Targeted Tset Control on the Incidence of Gambian Sleeping Sickness in Mandoul, Chad

**Research Question:** Can the addition of targeted tset control to case detection and treatment further reduce the transmission and incidence of Gambian sleeping sickness (HAT) in Mandoul, Chad, a persistent focus of the disease?

**Methods:** A census of the human population and settlements was conducted, followed by a pre-intervention survey of tset distribution and abundance in November 2013. 260 targets were deployed in riverine habitats of tset in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Impact on tset and incidence of H was assessed through nine tset monitoring and four medical surveys of the population in 201 and 201. Mathematical modeling was used to assess the relative impact of tset control on incidence compared to active and passive screening.

**Findings:** The census indicated a population of 74 inhabitants in the vicinity of Mandoul. In November 201, the vector Glossina fuscipes was the most abundant, with a mean catch of 0.7 tset/trap (range 0-26). After deployment of targets, the catch declined to 0.005set/trap. Modeling attributed 70.4% (95% CI 51-95) of the reduction in cases between 2013 and 201 to vector control, with the rest due to medical intervention. Targets reduced new infections by 62.8% (95 CI 59-66) due to tset control, and 8.5 (95 8-9) to passive detection. Predictions anticipate elimination as a public problem by 201 if vector and screening continue.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of targeted tset control in reducing tset numbers and interrupting transmission. Combination of tset control and medical treatment has played a major role in reducing H incidence in 201 and 201. This approach may be applicable to other areas with persistent foci.

**Conclusions:** Targeted tset control has significantly reduced tset in Mandoul, interrupting transmission and contributing to reduced incidence of H. The combination of tset control and medical treatment has been effective in reducing H incidence. This approach may be applicable to other areas with persistent foci.

**Title:** Epidemiological, Clinical, and Microbiological Characteristics of Imported Strongyloidiasis in Spain: A Retrospective Study of 124 Cases

**Research Question:** What are the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of patients with imported strongyloidias in Spain, and what factors are associated with parasite burden and treatment success?

**Methods:** This was a retrospective observational study that included all patients diagnosed with strongloidias registered in the +IV Collaborative Network from 2009 to 2017. Demographic, epidemiological, and clinical information was collected from the +IV database, and additional information regarding microbiological, treatment, and follow-up was requested from participant centers. Overall, 124 cases were included.

**Findings:** Most patients were immigrants (66.9%) from South America was the most frequent area of origin. Detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients, and serological tests allowed the diagnosis in the rest of cases. Eosinophilia was present in 82.2% of cases. Treatment with ivermect (compared to albendazole) was the most associated factor to achieve cure (OR 2.34). Given the latency of infection and risk of developing severe presentation, screening S. storal infection should be mandatory in patients from or traveling to endemic areas, especially with immunosup conditions.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of screening for S. storal infection in patients from or traveling to endemic areas, especially those with immunosup conditions, due to the long latency of infection and risk of developing severe presentation. The use of iverectin compared to albendazole was strongly associated with treatment success.

**Conclusion:** This study describes the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of patients with imported strongloidis in Spain, and identifies factors associated with parasite burden and treatment. The results differ from previous clinical trials and a recent study in non-endemic area (Buenos Aires, Argentina), highlighting the need for further research in this area.

**Title:** Determining the Optimal Inoculum Dose for Vaccines: A Mathematical Modeling Approach to Balance Immune Stimulation and Morbidity**

**Research Question:** What is the optimal inoculum dose for a vaccine that balances immune stimulation and morbidity, and how can mathematical models inform this determination?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental approaches to investigate the impact of inoculum dose on immune response and morbidity in two pathogens: influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection in rats. We developed a mathematical framework to map inoculum dose to level of immune protection and morbidity, and explored how this framework can be used to determine the optimal inoculum dose.

**Findings:** Our results show that the impact of inoculum dose on immune and morbidity depends on the specific pathogen, and that protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with inoculum dose. We found that higher inoculum doses lead to better immune stimulation, but may cause more severe side effects and limit population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages.

**Implications:** Determining the optimal inoculum dose is a crucial component of rational vaccine design. Our framework combines mathematical models with experimental data to predict the impact of inoculum on outcomes such as protection and morbidity. This approach can help design vaccines with specified levels of protection and acceptable morbidity, and determine the optimal inoculum dose.

**Conclusions:** We developed a quantitative framework to predict the optimal inoculum for a given vaccine setting, using data from live attenuated and inactivated vaccines. This framework can be applied to specific vaccine candidates to efficiently determine the optimal dose. Our study contributes to the development of a conceptual, quantitative framework for rational vaccine design and inoculum determination for any pathogen.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Gene Expression Fluctuations in the Developmental Pattern Formation of Nitrogen-fixing Heterocysts in the Cyanobacterium Anabaena

**Research Question:** How do fluctuations in gene expression of hetR, a transcription factor essential for heteroc differentiation, contribute to the formation of a one-dimensional pattern of nitrogen-fixing heterocysts in the cyanobacter Anena under nitrogen deprivation conditions?

**Methods:** We employed a chromosomally translational hetR-gfp fusion to study the statistics of fluctuations of hetR expression in wild-type and mutant filaments of Anena under steady-state nitrogen-rich conditions and at different times following nitrogen deprivation. Statistical analysis of fluorescence at the individual cell level revealed that fluctuations of het in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic range of circa two to three cells, setting the scale for cellular interactions along filament.

**Findings:** We found that under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal, steady expression of HetR is influenced by cell-cell communication through the septal protein Sep and Het auto-regulation, while under nitrogen-deprivation, fluctuations can build on those under-replete conditions. Comparison of het-g expression under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions highlighted differences between Het inhibitors PatS and Het, as well as sept proteins Sep and Fra/Fra.

**Implications:** Our results show that proteins involved in these processes combine to control fluctuations in gene expression, giving rise to a one-dimensional developmental pattern in this organism. Key factors known to act during differentiation following nitrogen deprivation also play a role before differentiation has been triggered, setting an underlying pattern of correlations gene expression along filaments.

**Conclusions:** In contrast to unicellular organisms, fluctuations in gene expression between cells are independent, we found correlations between fluctuations het-g expression in Anena filaments. Response to nitrogen deprivation, nitrogen-fixing photosynthetic filaments such as Anena and Nost undergo development into a pattern of single heterocysts separated by photosynthetic cells, forming a one-dimensional multicellular organism with clear division of labor. Our study addresses issues and characterizes noise of het gene expression and correlations between cells in Anena filaments under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-p conditions.

**Title:** Shift in Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) Genotype from Genotype III to Genotype I in China: A Seroepidemiological and Experimental Evidence

**Research Question:** What is the reason behind the shift in Japanese Encephitis virus (JEV) genotype from Genotype III to Genotype in China, and how does it affect the transmission dynamics of the virus in the mosquito-bird cycle?

**Methods:** We conducted a serological survey in JE-vaccinated pigs to confirm the genotype shift at the seroepidemiological level and compared the replication of seven recently-isolated JE isolates, including three Genotype I and four Genotype strains in C/36 cells, chicken fibroblast (DF-1) and porine artery endothelial (PIE) cells. We also inoculated young ducklings with Genotype and Genotype strains to examine the replication in vivo.

**Findings:** The ratio of Genotype/Genotype infection was 1.87, indicating co-circulation of both genotypes with Genotype being more prevalent in pigs. Genotype strains replicated more efficiently than Genotype in DF-1 and PIE cells, particularly in DF-1 with titers 22.9-225.3 fold higher than Genotype. In vivo, Gen-inoculated ducklings developed higher vire titers and displayed longer vire duration than Gen-inoculated ducklings. There are 36 amino acid differences between Genotype and Genotype, some of which may be responsible for enhanced replication of Genotype in birds.

**Implications:** Enhanced replication of Genotype in birds may result in higher exposure and infection in mosquitoes, leading to increased transmission efficiency in the mosquito-bird cycle, contributing to JE genotype shift.

**Conclusion:** Our study confirms the shift in JE genotype from Genotype to Genotype in China and provides evidence for enhanced replication of Genotype in avian cells and in vivo. These findings suggest that Genotype may outcompete Genotype in the mosquitoird transmission cycle, leading to the observed shift in genotype.

**Title:** Elucidating the Regulatory Network of Transcription Factors Controlling Candida albicans Biofilm Formation: A Systematic Analysis of Double Heterozygous Mutants Reveals a Highly Interdependent "Small-World" Network**

**Research Question:** How do the transcription factors B1, Brg, E1, N80, Rob1, Tec, and 1 interact to regulate Candida albicans biofilm formation, and what are the implications of their interactions on the network topology and function?

**Methods:** We employed a systematic genetic approach to generate all possible double heterozygous mutants of the transcription factor network and quantitatively analyze the genetic interactions between them to understand how they function together regulate biofilm formation.

**Findings:** The network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with six heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation (haploinsufficiency), and many double heterozygous mutants as severely affected as homozygous deletions, indicating a highly interdependent "small-world" network that is efficient but not robust. TEC1 represents a network component whose expression is highly sensitive to perturbations in function of other TFs. RO1 expression is dependent on auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other TFs, and heterozygous N80 mutant is hyperfilous under bio and hypha-inducing conditions in T1-dependent manner.

**Implications:** Genetic analysis of this network has provided insights into individual TF functions as well as the role of overall topology in its function. The biofilm TF network is comprised of six genes whose homozygous mutants significantly decreased biofilm formation. Double heterozygous deletions approach limited understanding inter-genetic interactions TF due to second homozyg mutation effect difficult to quantify. We propose interactions and bio TF topographical features contribute mechanism C. albicans biofilm under specific conditions.

**Conclusions:** The transcription factor network regulating Candida albicans biofilm is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with double heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation and many as severely affected as homozygous deletions. The network is a highly interdependent "small-world" that is efficient but not robust. TEC1 is a component whose expression is sensitive to perturbations in other TFs, and RO1 is dependent on auto-regulation and cooperative with other TFs. Heterozygous N80 mutant is hyperfilous under bio and hy-inducing in T1 manner. This study provides insights into individual TF functions and overall network topology function.

**Title:** Reevaluating Asparagine Synthase (AS) as a Drug Target for Leishmania infantum: A Novel Insights into Nitrogen Metabolism and Essentiality**

**Research Question:** Is Asparagine synthase (AS), a key enzyme responsible for converting aspartate to aspar in an ATP-dependent manner using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source, essential for Leishmania infant survival and infectivity?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of AS in Leishmania infant, a causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, by generating AS null mutants through targeted gene replacement and assessing their growth and infectivity in vitro and in vivo.

**Findings:** Contrary to previous reports, our results show that Leish infant AS uses both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen sources, similar to Trypanosoma spp. and L. donani. Moreover, AS null mutants displayed no significant growth or infectivity defects under normal conditions, but exhibited severe impairment in vitro when cultured under aspar limiting conditions.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that AS is not essential for Leish survival or infectivity in normal conditions, excluding it as a suitable drug target against L. infant parasites.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into nitrogen metabolism in Leish and highlights the importance of considering species-specific differences in AS function and regulation. Our results contradict previous claims of AS essentiality in L. donani, emphasizing the need for reevaluation of AS as a drug target. Furthermore, this study underscores the complexity of nitrogen homeostasis in trypanids, warranting further investigation into transport and regulation mechanisms.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Leish AS uses both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen sources
* AS null mutants display no growth or infectivity defects under normal conditions
* Severe impairment observed under aspar limiting conditions
* AS not essential for Leish survival or infectivity
* Contradicts previous claims of AS essentiality in L. donani
* Highlights species-specific differences in AS function and regulation
* Emphasizes need for reevaluation of AS as drug target
* Underscores complexity of nitrogen homeostasis in trypanids

**Title:** Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Association between Toxocariasis and Epilepsy: A Global Evidence Update

**Research Question:** Is there an association between Toocari seropositivity and epilepsy, and if so, what is the magnitude of this association?

**Methods:** A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted without language restriction on electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Ingenta Connect, ScienceDirect, Elsevier, Ref, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Institute of Neuroepidemiology and Neurology of the Limog University (IENL). Two investigators independently searched up to November 2017. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was estimated using a random effects meta-regression to investigate heterogeneity.

**Findings:** Eleven case-control studies were included, conducted in 13 countries, involving 474 subjects (215 with epilepsy and 259 without). The pooled OR was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01) for the association between Toocari serositivity and epilepsy. Meta-regression showed no significant association between covariates and outcome.

**Implications:** The updated meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Tooc seritivity and epilepsy, mainly supported by population-based studies. Strategies to reduce Tooc spp are strongly advised. Further research is needed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of Tooc-associated epileptogenesis.

**Conclusion:** This systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence of a positive association between Tooc seritivity and epilepsy, mainly supported by population-based studies. The association is significant, with a pooled OR of 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01). Meta-regression showed no association between covariates and outcome. Further research is needed to understand the physopathological mechanisms of To-associated epileptogenesis.

**Title:** ATM-Mediated DNA Damage Response Pathway Involves MicroRNA: A Novel Insights into Homologous Recombination Repair of Double-Strand Breaks

**Research Question:** What is the role of the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway involving microRNA (mi) in the selection of homologous recombination (HR) repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs)?

**Methods:** We investigated the ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway involving microRNA (mi) in the selection of homologous recombination (HR) repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) using HeLa cells and patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines. We analyzed the expression of miR335, a microRNA that targets CtIP, an important for DNA end resection in HR, and its regulation by CREB, a transcription factor phosphorylated by ATM in response to DNA damage.

**Findings:** We found that irradiation (IR)-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) activate ATM, leading to downregulation of mi335, a microRNA that targets CtIP, an important for DNA resection in HR. CRE is responsible for a large portion of mi335 expression by binding to the promoter of mi335. CRE binding is reduced after IR, corroborating previous studies that IR-activated ATM phosphorylates CRE to reduce its activity. Overexpression of mi335 in HeLa cells resulted in reduced Ct levels and post-IR survival and BRCA foci formation. In patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines with decreased post-IR survival "radiosensitive" phenotype, we observed elevated mi335, reduced Ct levels, and BRCA foci formation. Colony, BRCA foci, and Ct levels were partially rescued by miRNA antisense AM335 treatment.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest an ATM-dependent CRE-mi335-Ct axis influences the selection of HR for repair of certain DS lesions, impacting BRCA foci formation, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and survival.

**Conclusions:** We identified a novel ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway involving CRE-mi335-Ct axis, impacting BRCA foci formation, BRCA retention at DS, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and survival. Our model proposes that downregulation of mi335 by ATM-CRE in lymphoblast cells results in increased Ct protein after IR-induced damage, enhancing the DNA damage response. CRE is likely the mechanism for ATM-dependent downregulation of mi335, as demonstrated by siRNA knockdown of CRE protein abolishing IR-induced mi335 downregulation in HeLa cells.

**Title:** The Role of Sophisticated Mentalizing in Social Interactions: A Study on Recursive Beliefs and Learning in Repeated Games

**Research Question:** Can sophisticated mentalizing, or the ability to attribute mental states and beliefs to others, enhance learning in social interactions, particularly in the context of repeated games?

**Methods:** We designed an experiment where participants played repeated games against artificial Bayesian mentalizing agents with varying levels of sophistication, under two framing conditions: social and non-social. In the social framing, participants believed they were playing against other humans, while in the non-social, they thought they were gambling in a casino.

**Findings:** We found that participants performed better against the sophisticated mentalizing agents in the social framing, but lost to them in the non-social. Moreover, their choices were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian models only in the social framing.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the added value of mentalizing in social interactions, showing that deciphering behavior requires attributing mental states to others. Our results support the "social brain" hypothesis, where the brain assumes others are also Bayesian, and mentalizing involves recursive belief updates from observing others' behavior.

**Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the importance of sophisticated mentalizing in social interactions, particularly in repeated games. The social framing induced mentalizing and recursive inference, while non-social relied on domain-general heuristics vulnerable to artificial agents' sophistication.

**Title:** Efficient Estimation of Gaussian Graphical Models for High-Dimensional Biological Data: A Novel Algorithm and Applications

**Research Question:** Can we develop a computationally efficient and statistically sound algorithm for estimating Gaussian graphical models (GM) in high-dimensional biological data, enabling the analysis of complex networks beyond traditional single-variable approaches?

**Methods:** We propose an efficient algorithm, FastGM, to estimate GM and obtain p-value and confidence intervals for each edge in the graph, based on a recent proposal by Ren et al. (2015). Through simulations, we demonstrate that FastGM is faster by several orders of magnitude than the current algorithm by Ren et al without losing accuracy. We apply FastGM to two real datasets: transcriptomic from a childhood asthma study and proteomic from Alzheimer's disease, estimating global gene/protein networks for disease and healthy samples.

**Findings:** The resulting networks reveal interesting interactions and differential networks between cases and controls, showing functional relevance to diseases. FastGM provides a computationally fast and statistically sound procedure for constructing GM and inference with high-dimensional data, implemented in R package "FastGM".

**Implications:** FastGM enables researchers to study large-scale networks, such as gene/protein, using GM in practice. It is an exact implementation of asymptotically normal efficient estimation by Ren et al (1), hence statistically sound. Using simulated and real data, we demonstrate FastGM speeds existing implementation several orders without losing efficiency. FastGM makes feasible infer biological networks under GM whole-genome scale.

**Conclusion:** FastGM is a powerful tool for network analysis under conditional dependence, especially high-dimensional data. It has been implemented in R package, available at http://www.pitt.edu/~ec/FastGM.html.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Striatal Medium Spiny Neurons in Learning and Execution of Movement Sequences: A Dynamical Systems Perspective

**Research Question:** How do striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) population dynamics interact with temporally varying cortical activity, and what are the implications for learning and execution of movement sequences?

**Methods:** We employed a minimal model of a local MSN network with realistic connectivity and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPs) to investigate how MSN population activity responds to temporally varying cortical driving, mimicking behavioral tasks.

**Findings:** Our results show that at unrealistically high connectivity, a "winner-takes-all" regime emerges, where activity separates into fixed, stimulus-dependent firing and quiescent components, with only a few population rate components interacting with cortical variations. Conversely, at lower connectivity, a more dynamic regime occurs, where cells constantly switch between activity and quiescence, with population components wandering randomly and independently of cortical driving. Notably, in the transition regime, weak changes in cortical driving interact with many components, enabling sequential assemblies to be reproducibly activated for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset, with peri-stimulus histograms displaying strong temporal specificity.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the MSN network is optimized to generate stimulus-dependent patterns for extended periods after cortical excitation, neither too stable to respond dynamically to variations nor too unstable to respond consistently. This is maximized at striatally realistic connectivities and IP sizes.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of MSN population dynamics in learning and execution of movement sequences, highlighting the role of striatum in transforming cortical input in a complex way. Our results can be explained within dynamical systems theory, with implications for understanding neural responses to sensory and behavioral events throughout the brain.

**Title:** Polarized Growth Maintained by Polarized Exocytosis and Endocytosis: A Novel Role for Sec4 in Actin Polymerization and Endocyt

**Research Question:** How do polarized exocytosis and endocyt pathways interact to maintain polarized growth in yeast cells, and what is the role of the Sec4 GTPase in this process?

**Methods:** We used live cell imaging, in vivo and in vitro binding assays, and in vitro actin polymerization assays to investigate the relationship between polar exocyt and endyt in yeast cells.

**Findings:** Our results show that the Sec4 GTPase couples polarized exyt with actin polymerization, which induces endyt. After polar exocyt to the plasma membrane, Sec4 binds Las17/Bee1 (WASP) in a complex with S1 and S2 during actin patch assembly. Mutations in Sec4 or its GEF Sec2 inhibit actin formation, while activating Sec4L accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays of Arp/3-dependent actin polymerization, GTP-Sec4 overrides S1 inhibition of Lasp actin nucleation.

**Implications:** Our findings support a model where Sec4 relocates along the plasma membrane from polar exocytic sites to nascent endytic sites, promoting actin polymerization and triggering endyt, which controls surface expansion and refines cell polarization.

**Conclusions:** In addition to its established role in exyt, Sec4 also regulates endyt by transiently localizing to endytic sites, disrupting actin assembly, interacting with Lasp, and inducing Arp/3-dependent actin polymerization. This suggests that Sec and Sec2 have a specific role in actin assembly. The temporal and spatial relationship between Sec4 and actin subunits Lasp suggests a direct interaction, hinting at Sec's involvement in endyt apart from exyt. In yeast, polar exytic sites overlap with nascent endytic, dependent on both exyt and endyt.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Acetaminophen-Induced Liver Injury in Mice: A Novel Insights into Hepatotoxicity and Necrosis

**Research Question:** Can acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice be used as a model for drug-induced liver injury in humans, and what are the underlying mechanisms that lead to hepatotoxicity and necrosis?

**Methods:** We employed a computational model of acetamin-induced liver injury in mice to challenge the NQI zonation hypothesis, which posits that zonation of NQI formation is necessary and sufficient to explain early periven necrosis. To validate this hypothesis, we engineered a virtual hepatocyte model that mimics anatomical and biological features of the liver, including zonation of NQI formation. Our results showed that zonation of NQI alone is insufficient to explain periven necrosis.

**Findings:** We discovered that two additional features are necessary to explain the phenomenon: 1) glutathione depletion in the direction of the central vein (CV) and 2) diminished ability to repair mitochondrial damage in the direction. Inclusion of both features enabled achieving the phenomenon, providing a multile, multiscale explanation of key features of acetamin hepatotoxicity in mice. Variants of the merged mechanism provide plausible explanations for variation in 24-hour necrosis among genetically diverse mouse strains.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that acetamin-induced liver injury in mice is a valid model for drug-induced liver injury in humans, and that NQ zonation alone is not sufficient to explain hepatotoxicity. The merged mechanism provides a framework for predicting injury and developing treatment strategies.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that acetamin-induced liver injury in mice can be used to challenge the NQ zonation hypothesis, and that two additional features are necessary to explain the phenomenon. The merged mechanism provides a multile, multiscale explanation of key features of acetamin hepatotoxicity in mice, and variants provide plausible explanations for variation in necrosis among genetically diverse strains. Our findings have implications for predicting and treating drug-induced liver injury in humans.

**Title:** Quantification of Parasitemia in Congenitally Infected Children with Trypanosoma cruzi: Implications for Early Diagnosis and Treatment**

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the parasitemia levels in congenitally infected children with Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) at different stages of diagnosis, from birth to one year of age, to understand why not all neonates born to T. cruz-infected mothers can be diagnosed by microscopy immediately after birth.

**Methods:** A total of 51 congenally infected children were grouped into three categories: A) neonates diagnosed by microscopy at birth (n=19), B) infants requiring second parasitological diagnosis at 6 months (n=10), and C) undetectable parasitem by microscopy but diagnosed by serology at 1 year (n=22). Parasitem levels were quantified by PCR, and T. cruz parasites isolated by hemoculture and genotyped.

**Findings:**

* Neonates diagnosed by microscopy at birth (n=19) had a median parasitemia of 1,700/mL.
* Infants requiring second parasological diagnosis at 6 months (n=10) showed a median parasitem of 20/mL and 500/mL at 6 and 12 months, respectively.
* Babies undetectable parasitem by microscopy but diagnosed by serology at 1 year (n=22) exhibited parasitem of 5/mL,800/mL and 20/mL at 6 and 12 months, respectively.
* T. cruz parasites were isolated from 19 congenally infected children, 18 genotyped as DTU Tc (former TcI) and one as Tc.

**Implications:** Our results show that parasite burden in 22 out of 51 children is below the detection limit of IN micromethod. Current tryocidal treatment is effective, but sensitive parasological methods should be developed for early T. cruz congenital diagnosis.

**Conclusion:** This is the first study to quantify parasitem in more than 50 congenally infected with T. cruz at different diagnostic controls. Our findings suggest that parasitem levels in some children are below the detection of IN microm, highlighting the need for more sensitive methods to ensure early diagnosis and prompt treatment.

**Title:** A Biophysical Model of Escherichia coli Predicts Growth Rate and Cellular Composition from Coarse-Grained Genome Representation

**Research Question:** Can a biophysical model of Escherichia coli predict growth rate and cellular composition from a coarse-grained representation of its genome, assuming the bacterium is in a state of balanced steady-state growth in a temporally and spatially constant environment rich resources?

**Methods:** We applied a biophysical model to a series of past measurements where growth and rRNA-protein ratio have been measured for seven Escheria coli strains with rRNA operon number ranging from one to seven (wild-type number). The model assumes Escheria is in a state of balanced steady-state growth in tempor and spatially constant environment rich resources.

**Findings:** The model reproduces measurements that growth markedly decreases for strains with fewer than six copies. The model suggests that the fraction of macromolecules inside Escheria is not fixed when rRNA operon number varied. Moreover, the model predicts that increasing number beyond seven results in cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming overcrowded conditions weaken affinities, the model predicts growth will not increase beyond wild-type rate, consistent with experiments.

**Implications:** Our model suggests that changing r operon number of wild Escher cells in constant environment does not substantially increase growth. Observations with altered oper number, such as nucle compaction and oper feedback, qualitatively consistent with model.

**Conclusions:** We propose a biophysical model of Escheria that predicts growth and cellular composition from coarse-grained representation its genome. The model assumes Esia in balanced-state growth tempor and spatial constant environment rich resources. The model reproduces measurements that growth decreases for strains with fewer copies. The model suggests fraction macromolecules inside Esia not fixed when oper number varied. The model predicts increasing beyond seven results cytoplasm packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming overcrow conditions weaken affinities, model predicts growth not increase beyond wild-type rate, consistent experiments. Our model suggests changing oper number wild Es in constant does not increase growth.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of RADIAL-LIKE SANTY 1 (R1) in Abiotic Stress Responses in Arabidopsis thaliana

**Research Question:** How does RADIALIKE SANTY 1 (R1) (R1), a member of the MYB-related subfamily, regulate abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms of its action?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of transcriptome analysis, genetic, and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of R1 in seed germination, seedling development, and responses to abiotic stresses, including abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl, and mannitol.

**Findings:** Downregulation or upregulation of R1 expression altered sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to ABA, NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. Expression of R1 was dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Transcription factors ELONG HYCOTYL 5 (5) and HYHOMOLOG HY regulated R1 via binding to the R promoter. Genetic analyses revealed R mediates multiple functions of HY in responses seed germination postgermination to A and abiotic stresses, and seedling to salinity. Pull-down and BiFC assays showed R1 interacts with HYHY in vitro and in vivo. R1 and HYHY function as a regulatory module in responses A and abiotic stresses.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that R1 and HYHY converge on ABI promoter and independently or dependently regulate ABI expression and ABI-down ABA and abiotic-responsive genes, thereby improving adaptation of plants to environment.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms of R in abiotic responses Arabidopsis, highlighting its interaction with HY and ABI signaling components ABI, ABI, ABI, and ABI. Our results provide insights into the complex regulation of ABA and abiotic stress responses in plants, shedding light on the role of R and its homologs in plant adaptation to environment.

**Title:** Unveiling the Proton Pumping Mechanism of Mitochondrial Complex I: Evidence for Two Functionally Distinct Modules in the Membrane Arm

**Background:** Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complicated proton pump of the respiratory chain, links electron transfer from NAD to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Defects in complex I are involved in a wide range of degenerative disorders. Recent progress in X-ray structural analysis of proary and eukotic complex confirmed that redox reactions are confined to the hydrophil peripheral arm of L-shaped molecule and take place at remarkable distance from membrane.

**Research Question:** What is the mechanism of proton pumping in the membrane arm of complex I, and what are the identity and localization of the pumpites?

**Methods:** We report the deletion of gene for small subunit of complex I, a stable sub (nbmΔ), which lacks dist part of membrane domain revealed by single particle analysis. Analysis of sub composition of holo and sub by complementary proteomics approaches revealed two subunits (ND and ND) with homology to bacterial-type Na+/H antiporters as prime candidates for harbouring proton pumps in nbΔ. Despite this, nbΔ still pumps protons at stoichiometry of complete enzyme.

**Findings:** Our results provide evidence that membrane of complex harbours two functionally distinct modules connected by long helical element identified X-ray analysis.

**Implications:** This study sheds light on the pumping mechanism of complex I, which is crucial for cellular energy metabolism and implicated in degenerative diseases. The discovery of two functionally distinct modules in membrane arm complex has significant implications for understanding of bioenergetic disorders and aging.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that membrane arm of complex I harbours two functionally distinct modules that are connected by long helical element, providing new insights into the pumping mechanism of this crucial enzyme. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of these modules in degenerative diseases and aging.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Fever in Modulating Antibody-Antigen Affinity: A Novel Insights from Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and ELISA Studies

**Research Question:** How does fever influence the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens in infectious diseases?

**Methods:** We employed Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to investigate the binding of malar and deng antigens to specific monoclonal antibodies at physiological (37°C), febrile (40°C), and pathophysiological (42°C) temperatures. Proteins were thermally equilibrated in vitro for 1 hour prior to measurements to simulate in vivo conditions.

**Findings:** Our results show a marked increase in affinity of antibody-antigen complexes at 40°C compared to 37°C or 42°C. Thermal equilibration of proteins prior to measurements further enhanced binding, suggesting a positive role for fever in vivo. We observed a 1.15-1.3 increase in affinity from 37 to 40°C in absence of thermal priming, and significant improvements in KD by a factor of 9.5 at 37 and 8 at 40 for deng immune complex.

**Implications:** These findings highlight the potential for reversible physiological temperatures to increase antibody affinity for tertiary and quatern epitopes, suggesting a thermal activation step for antibodies binding antigens. Thermal equil of protein partners prior to ELISA or other in vitro assays may improve affinities and inform optimal testing conditions, especially in cases with limited samples.

**Conclusion:** This study provides novel insights into the role of fever in modulating antibody-ant affinity, shedding light on a previously unexplored aspect of immune response to infection. Our results suggest that thermal priming can enhance protein-protein affinity, with implications for vaccine development and therapeutic strategies.

**Title:** Actomyosin Cortical Flow: A Fundamental Engine for Cellular Morphogenesis

**Research Question:** How do actomy cortical flows, generated by cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors, produce and dissipate contractile stress, and how does local remodeling tune stress production and dissipation shape long-range flow?

**Methods:** We developed a computational model of a cross-linked network with active motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress, incorporating asymmetric compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links, and filament turnover. We analyzed how production and dissipation of stress depend individually on cross dynamics and filament turnover, and how these combine to determine rates of cortical flow.

**Findings:** Our analysis predicts that filament turnover is required to maintain stress against external resistance and steady flow in response to external stress. Steady stress increases with lifetime up to a characteristic time τ, then decreases with lifetime above τ. Effective viscosity increases with lifetime up to characteristic τ, then becomes independent of lifetime and sharply dependent on cross dynamics. These dependencies of stress and viscosity define multiple regimes of steady flow.

**Implications:** Our results provide a framework for understanding how cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling. Specifically, when lifetimes are shorter than both τ and τ, dependencies of viscosity and steady stress on turnover cancel, such that flow is insensitive to turnover and shows simple dependence on activity and dynamics.

**Conclusions:** Cortical flows arise from a dynamic interplay of force production and dissipation within cross-linked actomy networks. Our model captures distinct contributions of cross unbinding and turnover within a self-consistent framework. Simulations confirm that heterogeneity of activity and asymmetric compliance support macroscopic contraction of unconstrained networks. We predict biphas dependencies of steady stress and viscosity on lifetime define regimes of flow, characterized by dependencies on turnover and other parameters.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel Sugar-Sensing Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) in Arabidopsis thalian and Insights into Sugar Signaling Pathways

**Research Question:** How do high glucose and fructose levels inhibit seedling establishment in Arabidopsis thalian, and what are the genetic loci responsible for this inhibition?

**Methods:** A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed on a Col/C24 F2 population of Arabidopsis thalian to identify the genetic basis of seedling sensitivity to high sugar levels of glucose and fructose. Selective genotyping and near-isogenic lines were used to map the glucose-sensing QTL, GS11, which was confirmed to be associated with the ANAC gene. Allelism and transgenic complementation tests showed that GS11 lies within the AN060 gene. Genomic and mRNA analyses revealed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in AN060 that affects splicing, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the transmembrane domain (TMD).

**Findings:** The AN060 allele confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C allele. The truncated AN060 protein is found in ~12% of natural Arabidopsis accessions. Glucose induces GS11/AN060 expression in a process requiring abisic acid (ABA) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and transient analysis showed ABI directly binds the GS11AN060 promoter to activate transcription. AN060 reduces ABA sensitivity and Gl-induced ABA accumulation, and ABI expression was reduced in AN060 lines.

**Implications:** The sugar-ABA cascade induces AN060 expression, but the truncated AN060 protein attenuates ABA induction and signaling, resulting in sugar insensitivity. This negative feedback from AN060 on A signaling is a novel mechanism of sugar sensing in Arabidopsis.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies a novel sugarensing QTL, GS11, which encodes the Arabidopsis NAC transcription factor AN060. Seedling growth and greening is inhibited by high sugar concentrations, and this phenomenon has been used to identify mutants in sugarensing processes. The sugar-ABA cascade induces GS/DOG expression, and the C allele enhances sugar-ABA signaling, increasing sensitivity. Natural analysis provides a tool for analyzing biological processes, and this study reveals a novel mechanism of sugar sensing in Arabidopsis.

**Title:** Deciphering the Specificity of c-di-GMP Signaling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: A Novel Insights into the Hpt Pathway Regulation

**Research Question:** How does c-di-GMP signaling achieve specificity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and what is the role of the Hpt pathway in regulating biofilm formation and motility?

**Methods:** We investigated the molecular basis of c-G signaling in P. aeruginosa, focusing on the Hpt pathway, which controls biofilm formation, motility, twitching, swarming, and chemotaxis. We identified the c-G synthase gene, hD, in proximity to the hpt and flagellar cluster, and demonstrated its interaction with the anti-sigma factor, HA.

**Findings:** Rewiring of c-G signaling into the Hpt cascade relies on the interaction between hD and HA, controlling hD localization at cell poles. We show that hD and Sad contribute to H-dependent biofilm formation, but have distinct impacts on H-mediated motility, suggesting they act at different positions in the c-G network. We propose local action of hD at cell poles and intersection of two Ds, hD and Sad, within the global G/R cascade, which regulates biofilm.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a novel scenario of c-G signaling evolution in P. aerugin, where a single D faithfully transmits c-G and triggers a subset c-regulated behaviors, avoiding cross-talk. The H pathway controls biofilm, twitch, swimming, swarming, and chemotaxis, with hD and Sad acting at distinct positions in the c-G network. We propose local action of hD at cell poles and intersection of two Ds, h and Sad, within the G/R cascade, which regulates biofilm.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide insights into the specificity of c-G signaling in P. aerugin, highlighting the role of the H pathway in regulating biofilm and motility. The rewiring of c-G into the H cascade relies on interaction between h and HA, controlling h localization at poles. We propose a model where h and Sad intersect within the G cascade, regulating biofilm. This study sheds light on the evolution of c-G signaling in P. aerugin, where a single D faithfully transmits c-G and triggers a subset-regulated behaviors, avoiding cross-talk. The H pathway controls biofilm, twitch, swimming, swarming, and chemaxis, with h and Sad acting distinct in the c network.

**Title:** Learning and Generalization of Visuomotor Mappings: An Investigation of Associative Learning and Bayesian Model

**Research Question:** Can humans learn and store multiple visuomotor mappings when feedback is provided alternately, and can learned cues associated with each mapping be used to switch between stored mappings? How does associative learning between cue and visomotor mapping generalize to novel but similar conditions?

**Methods:** Participants performed a rapid pointing task while manipulating the offset between visual feedback and end-points. Visual feedback was presented with horizontal offsets of different amounts dependent on targets. Shapes were morphed between spiky and circular. After training, participants' performance was tested without feedback on different shapes not previously learned.

**Findings:** Results show that learning associations require explicit awareness of cues' role, but participants apply mapping to trained shape most similar to current, consistent with Bayesian model. Bayesian model predicts learning slows with increased training pairs, confirmed by results. A correspondence between Bayesian model and results indicates it poses a mechanism for learning multiple visomotor mappings.

**Implications:** This study investigates associative learning between previously irrelevant shape cues and behaviorally visomotor mappings. Novelty is that cue and visom mappings varied continuously, training focused on functional relationship between shape and mapping, a linear. Participants pointed to right for spiky shapes and left for round. Trained on subset shape/visomapping pairs, tested generalization to other shapes along scale. Relationship between shape and visom underlying training was linear.

**Conclusions:** We found a correspondence between Bayesian model and results, indicating it poses a mechanism for learning multiple visom mappings.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Inferior Olivary Nucleus in Climbing Fiber Activation: A Computational Modeling Study

**Research Question:** How does the inferior oliv nucleus (IO) influence climbing fiber activation in the cerebellum, and what factors determine the size of the climbing fiber burst?

**Methods:** We employed a three-compartmental model of the IO cell to investigate the relationship between the phase of subthreshold membrane oscillation (STO) and the size of the climbing fiber burst. We simulated experiments where a sinusoidal subthreshold oscillation of the membrane potential was imposed on the cell by injecting a corresponding sinusoidal current and compared to control experiments where the cell received no such injection.

**Findings:** Our results suggest that the phase dependency of the burst size is present but limited, and charge flow between soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the fiber burst. We found a correlation between ST phase and spike count in line with previous findings by Mathy et al. [26]. Our model predicts that there may be a phase dependency of fiber size only in a range of ST amplitudes and coupled cell ensembles sufficient.

**Implications:** This study provides new insights into the electrophysiological properties of IO and its ability to transfer information to the cerebellum. Our findings suggest that phenomena such as cell synchrony can have a significant effect on fiber size through dendritic gap-junction coupling between IO cells. This has implications for understanding cerebellar learning and motor control, where IO is thought to play a key role in timing motor commands and learning.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of investigating IO's electrophys properties to better understand its role in the cerebell system. Our results suggest that IO's low firing rate may limit its ability to transfer information, making machine learning approaches less accurate. Our model provides a framework for understanding IO's contribution to cerebellar learning and motor control, and highlights the need for further investigation into its electrophys properties.

**Title:** A Quantitative Mechanistic Model of Human Iron Metabolism: Elucidating the Role of the Liver in Iron Regulation and Implications for Disease

**Research Question:** How does the liver regulate iron metabolism and what are the implications of its dysregulation for disease?

**Methods:** A mechanistic computational model of human iron metabolism was constructed based on known regulatory mechanisms and kinetic properties from several publications. The model was quantitatively validated by comparing results with previously published physiological data and was able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. A time course simulation following oral iron dose was compared to clinical study and simulation recreated the dynamics and scale of response to iron challenge. A disease simulation of hereditary hemochromatosis was created by altering a reaction mimicking human hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation.

**Findings:** The model provides a quantitative understanding of liver overload in this disease and supports the role of the liver as an sensor. The model is the most detailed mechanistic of iron metabolism to date, allowing comprehensive description of regulation. It can elucidate link from genotype to phenotype, demonstrated with hereditary hemromatosis.

**Implications:** The model allows "what-if" experiments leading to hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. It provides a framework for further modelling, simulations to identify targets and design experiments to improve knowledge of this system. The model identified predictions about liver regulation should be investigated. Due to limited clinical data, other sources, particularly in vitro and animal, were integrated for parameterization. This modelling constitutes a clinical approach, enabling multiple sources to improve understanding iron metabolism.

**Conclusions:** The liver plays a central role in regulation through secretion of hormone hepcid. The involved iron, absorption, transport, and regulation form a complex network. The model analyzed the hepatic network in sensing and regulation through mathematical and simulation. The model is a tool for understanding iron metabolism and disease, including hereditary hemochromosis. It can be used to identify targets and design experiments to improve knowledge of this system.

**Title:** Coarse-Grained Modeling of Nuclear Pore Complex Reveals Mechanisms of Selective Nucleocytoplasmic Transport

**Research Question:** How does the nuclear pore complex (NPC) regulate selective transport across the nuclear envelope (NE) at the nanoscale, and what is the role of hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins (kaps) and P-G (FG) repeat domains in this process?

**Methods:** We developed a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure, taking into account the polymeric nature of FG-repeats and kap-FG hydrophobic affinity, to mimic nucleocytoplasm transport. Brownian dynamics simulations were performed to predict the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex and its interaction with the FG-layer.

**Findings:** Our model predicts a first-passage time of 2.6 ± 0.13 ms with an inverse Gaussian distribution, indicating efficient transport through the NPC. The cargo-com is primarily attached to the wall, interacting with the FG-layer as it passes through the channel. Kap-F hydrophobic interaction is dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation. Almost all hydrophobic spots on kap-β are occupied during transport. In contrast, cytoplasm fil-deficient NPCs show high permeability to inertos, highlighting the role of cytoplasm filaments in selectivity.

**Implications:** This study provides a foundation for understanding nucleocytoplasm transport, resolving uncertainties about transient interactions between FG-re and cargo on the order of nanoseconds. Our model can probe the NPC to examine sequential events leading to the N cycle.

**Conclusions:** Our coarse-grained model of NPC reveals the mechanism of selective nucleocytoplasm transport, highlighting the key role of kap-FG hydroph interaction and FG-re in the process. The dynamic nature of kap-F interaction ensures efficient transport, while cytoplasm filaments define the selectivity barrier. This work provides a basis for future studies on nucleocytoplasm transport and its regulation.

**Title:** Optimized Protocol for Determining the Infectious Dose 50 (ID50) in Non-Human Primate (NHP) Models: Minimizing Animal Use and Resources while Ensuring Accurate Results

**Research Question:** How to determine the optimal dose of a pathogen that infects 50% of animals (ID50) in nonhuman primate (NHP) models, minimizing animal use and resources while ensuring accurate results.

**Methods:** A novel protocol was developed to determine the ID50 of a pathogen in NHP models by iteratively challenging cohorts of animals to a dilution of the stock, adjusting the dose between rounds to achieve 50% infection. This approach minimizes the number of animals and resources required, providing an estimate of ID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value.

**Findings:** On average, the protocol enrolled 15-25 animals, required 3-5 rounds, and resulted in an estimate of ID50 within 40% of the true value. This method is generalizable to any pathogen and animal model, but critical for NHP where ethical considerations mandate minimization of use.

**Implications:** Determining the ID for a challenge pathogen stock is typically done by iterative exposures of one or more animals to a dilution of stock, adjusting the dose between rounds to achieve 50 infection. Adjusting the dose between rounds requires understanding the relationship between probability of infection (P) and challenge (D). The proposed protocol minimizes the number of animals and resources needed to define the ID in NHP.

**Conclusions:** The optimized protocol for determining ID50 in NHP models minimizes animal use and resources while ensuring accurate results. By iteratively challenging animals to a dilution of stock, adjusting the dose between rounds to achieve 50 infection, investigators can estimate the ID within 1.5 of the true value. This approach is critical for NHP models where ethical considerations mandate minimization of use.

**Title:** Adaptation of First-Order Auditory Interneuron (AN2) in Crickets to Amplitude-Modulated Sound Stimuli: Implications for Signal Representation and Coding

**Research Question:** How does adaptation of the first-order auditory interneuron (AN) in crickets respond to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli, and what are the implications for signal representation and coding?

**Methods:** We investigated the response of AN2 neuron to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli and found that adaptation shifts the stimulus-response curve towards higher intensities with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery. Spike responses were reduced for low-intensity sounds. We tested whether adaptation improves signal representation by comparing results with predictions of two competing hypotheses: infax, which maximizes information about the entire signal range, and selective coding, which enhances foreground signals while suppressing background.

**Findings:** Adaptation changes the input-response curve when presenting signals with two or three peaks in amplitude distributions, conflicting with predictions of infax and selective coding. Bayesian analysis quantified shifts in response curves and found slight reductions in slopes, smaller and absolute thresholds higher than predicted by infax. Notably, adaptation reduces the amount of encoded information considering the range of signals. Response changes are not consistent with selective coding, as information about the loudest part of the signal does not increase but remains constant, and less is transmitted about lower intensity signals.

**Implications:** The input-response curve altered by adaptation depends on relevant information in context. We explored properties of single AN2 in cricket auditory pathway and tested two principles proposed to underlie adaptation: infax and selective coding. Adaptation with time constants observed in crickets range from short (100 ms) to long (10 s). Our study reports firing adaptation with 1-second constant, previously unreported in AN of T. ocean and T. The primary auditory task is to maintain and condense relevant information for localization and recognition. Adaptation at first synapse similar to vertebrate and other modalities. Motivated by competing hypotheses, we examined adaptation to ensembles of stimuli demanding changes in stimulus curve. Multimodal noise stimuli mimicked scenes with multiple signals. Principles predict conflicting changes of input curve presenting more than one signal. Optimal coding shifts response to peak highest intensity, while infax maximizes information conveyed.

**Conclusions:** Adaptation of AN2 in crickets to amplitude-modulated sound shifts stimulus-response curve towards higher intensities, reducing responses to low-intensity sounds. Adaptation does not improve signal representation as predicted by infax or selective coding. Bayesian analysis shows slight reductions in slopes and higher thresholds than inf. Notably, adaptation reduces encoded information considering signal range. Response changes not consistent with selective coding, as information about loudest part remains constant and less transmitted lower signals.

**Title:** The Role of Polybasic Domains in Prion Propagation: A Novel Mechanism of Prion Interaction and Infectivity

**Research Question:** Do polybasic domains of the cellular prion protein (PC) serve as docking sites for disease-associated prion (PrSc) propagation, and are they essential for prion infectivity?

**Methods:** We generated prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and used them as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) reactions. After ∼5 rounds of PMCA, PrSc molecules lacking the central polydomain (Δ) were formed. Surprisingly, in contrast to wild-type prions, Δ-PrSc prions could bind and induce conversion of the polydomain mutant substrates into PrSc molecules.

**Findings:** Δ-PrSc prions interact with PC through a novel mechanism, yielding an expanded substrate range and efficient PrSc propagation. Polydomain deficient PrSc molecules provide the first dissociation between brain homogen PMCA ability and pr infectivity. Our results suggest that propagation PrSc may not depend on a single mechanism, but Pr/Pr interaction through polydomains may be required to generate infectivity.

**Implications:** These findings have significant implications for our understanding of prion biology and prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Prions are infectious proteins that cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases, and understanding their propagation mechanism is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that polydomains of PC are required for efficient PrSc binding and propagation. Δ-Sc prions, lacking polydomains, display diminished or absent infectivity, despite normal brain homogen PMCA seeding ability. This dissociation between PMCA ability and infectivity highlights the complexity of prion propagation and suggests that Pr/Pr interaction through polydomains may be essential for generating infectivity. These findings provide new insights into prion biology and pr diseases, and highlight the need for further investigation into the role of polydomains in pr propagation.

**Title:** Deciphering Animal Decision-Making Strategies through Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Unveiling the Thermotactic Behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How do animals control their behavior to reach a desired state in an environment, and what strategies do they employ to make decisions?

**Methods:** We developed an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework to identify animal behavioral strategies from time-series data and applied it to Caenorhabdis elegans thermactic behavior. We cultivated worms at constant temperature with or without food, then placed them on a thermal gradient. Our IR approach revealed that fed worms used both absolute and temporal temperature, employing two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal (IM). DM efficiently reached specific temperatures, explaining thermactic behavior when fed. IM moved along constant temperature, reflecting isothermal tracking observed in previous studies. In contrast, starved worms escaped using only absolute, not temporal temperature.

**Findings:**

* Fed worms utilized both absolute and temporal temperature for thermactic behavior, involving DM and IM strategies.
* DM efficiently reached specific temperatures, explaining thermactic behavior when fed.
* IM moved along constant temperature, reflecting isothermal tracking observed in previous studies.
* Starved worms used only absolute, not temporal for escaping temperature.
* Neural basis of strategies investigated by applying IRL to thermosensory-deficient worms.

**Implications:** Our IRL approach is useful for identifying animal strategies from behavioral data and can be applied to various studies, including decision-making in other organisms.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the power of IRL in deciphering animal decision-making strategies from time-series data. By applying it to Caenorhabdis elegans thermactic behavior, we uncovered the underlying strategies employed by fed and starved worms. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both absolute and temporal temperature in thermactic behavior. This work has implications for understanding decision-making in other organisms and can be applied to various behavioral studies.

**Title:** Draft Genome Sequence of Chrychromina tobin (Prymiales): Insights into the Evolutionary History, Ecology, and Economic Importance of Haptophytes

**Research Question:** What is the draft genome sequence of Chrychromina to (Pmiales) and how does it contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of hophytes?

**Methods:** We sequenced the nuclear genome of Chrychromina to (Pm) and collected transcriptome data at seven points over a 24-hour light/dark cycle.

**Findings:** The genome of C. to is small (59 Mb), compact (∼40% of genome is protein-coding) and encodes approximately 16,777 genes. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression when monitored the circadian photoperiod. The C. to genome harbors the first polyketide synth/nonribosomal synthase complex reported for algal species and encodes anti-microbial and proteins involved multidrug and toxic extrusion. A new hophyte xorhodopsin was identified, with two "red RuBisases shared across algal lineages.

**Implications:** The Chrychromina to genome provides new information on the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic of hophy. Genomic studies of E. hleyi panome show significant variability among strains [19]. Hophy characterized in this study Chrychromina (Prynesophidae: B clade) dominate marine and freshwater ecosystems.

**Title:** Concomitant Inactivation of Tumor Suppressor Pathways in Mammary Epithelium Leads to Highly Penetrant Adenocarcinomas with Bas-like Features

**Research Question:** What is the impact of conitant inactivation of tumor suppressor pathways in mammary epithel on the development of highly penetrant adenocarcinomas with Bas-like features?

**Methods:** We used mouse genetic studies to investigate the effects of conitant inactivation of Rb p53 and Brca pathways on mammary cell death and tumorigenesis.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that conitant inactivation of R and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress physiological cell death of mammary involution. Furthermore, conitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithel has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant metastatic adenocarcinomas. Tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features common among human Brca-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous metaplas and necrosis. Gene expression analyses show that tumors share attributes both Bas-like and Claud-low signatures, two subtypes encompassed by broader triple-negative class defined clinical markers.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that conitant inactivation of tumor suppressor pathways in mammaryel leads to highly penetrant adenarcinomas with Bas-like features. This is consistent with previous studies showing that p53 is mutated in 20-30% human cancers and defective intermediates increase breast risk, and nearly all Bas-like cancers with BRCA mutation have conitant p mutation. Our results also show that conitant inactivation all three suppressor pathways in mamel has additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly malignant carcinomas.

**Conclusions:** Conitant inactivation of tumor suppressor pathways in mamel leads to highly penetrant adenarcin with Bas-like features, characterized by rapid progression, poor differentiation, distant metastasis, necrosis, metlas, and genomic instability. Mouse models that mimic TNBC complexity will be invaluable for defining cellular behavior and triaging new candidates. Bas-like cancers often inactivate three suppressors infamous for familial cancers: RB, TP53, and BRCA. Loss BR activity may alter phenotype through deregulation EMT inducer SL. CG analysis revealed CN consistent with human genomic surveys. This study shows mam tumors caused by inactivation p family proteins (p, p, p, p) together with BRCA and p53 mimic aggressive forms breast cancer, including rapid progression, poor differentiation, distant metastasis, necrosis, metlas, and genomic instability.

**Title:** Assessing the Impact of Larval Site Density on Aedes aegyipopulation and Productivity: Implications for Vector Control Strategies

**Research Question:** How does larval site density influence the distribution and abundance of Aedes aegi, the primary vector of deng virus, and what are the implications for vector control strategies?

**Methods:** Pupal surveys were conducted from 2004 to 2007 in rural Kampha Phet, Thailand, collecting 84,840 samples of water-holding containers. Regression modeling was used to assess the effect of larval site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity. A varying-coeff model was employed to account for differences in productivity between container types.

**Findings:** The number of larval sites and their density in the environment were primary determinants of the distribution and abundance of Aegi pupae. Productivity of containers increased significantly with habitat density. An ecological approach accounting for site density is appropriate for predicting Aeg population and developing vector programs.

**Implications:** Accurate predictions of vector populations are required for control and effective population strategies. Aeg develops in artificial water containers. Release studies indicate most Aegi do not disperse long distances. Containers in high-density areas are likely to be ovip sites and used more frequently than isolated containers. Accounting for individual characteristics, frequently used sites produce mosquitoes at higher rates. Most studies ignore spatial larval site density.

**Conclusion:** Understanding Aeg ecology is key to predicting abundance through space and time. Determinant of adult population concerns container types and number in environment. Incorporating density into efforts with research will lead to effective interventions. Container, water, temperature, source, and location vary seasonally affect production. Aeg abundance is not homogeneous among households, clustered in key premises. Our model estimates productivity at individual and sample level, but not small super-producing containers.

**Key Findings:**

* Larval site density is a primary determinant of Aeg distribution and abundance
* Productivity increases with habitat density
* Ecological approach accounting for site is appropriate for predicting A population and control
* Incorporating density into efforts will lead to effective interventions
* Container, water, temperature, source, and location vary seasonally affect production
*eg abundance is not homogeneous among households, clustered in premises

**Recommendations:**

* Accurate predictions of vector populations are required for control and population strategies
* Incorporating density into efforts with research will lead to effective interventions
* Container, water, temperature, source, and location vary seasonally affect production
*eg is not homogeneous among households, clustered premises

**Title:** The Role of Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 (TOR2) in Integrating External and Internal Cues to Regulate Behavioral and Developmental Decisions in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How does the Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TOR2) coordinate larval and adult behaviors in response to environmental cues and feeding state in the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of TOR2 in regulating the expression of daf-7 TGF-β and d-28 insulin-like peptides in sensory neurons, which promote a binary decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage during development. We also examined the effect of TOR2 on food-regulated foraging behaviors via PDF-2/PDF-1 neuropeptide signaling pathway in adults.

**Findings:** We found that TOR2 acts in the intestine to regulate expression of d-7 and d-28, which reflect bacterial-dependent feeding status, providing a mechanism for integration of food signals with external cues in regulation of neuroendocrine expression. In adults, TOR2 acts in intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging via PDF-2/PDF-1 neurope signaling pathway. Genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes and identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with these traits.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that TOR2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding information from gut to brain, contributing to modulation of neuronal function by state.

**Conclusions:** TOR2 plays a crucial role in integrating external and internal cues to regulate behavioral and developmental decisions in C. elegans. By regulating TGF-β and insulin pathways, feeding signals may strengthen or weaken the salience of pherom and temperature signals, biasing larval developmental decisions. Intestinal TOR2 signaling is also implicated in regulation of food-dependent adult foraging decisions. Analyses of dauer and adult foraging in C. elegans isolates show these traits are genetically separable and identify QTL contributing to variation between strains.

**Title:** Unveiling the Transcriptional Regulatory Networks of Pluripotent Cells: A Novel Insights into the Regulation of Embryonic Stem and Somatic Cells

**Research Question:** Understanding the transcriptional regulation of pluripotent cells is crucial for directing the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells and reprogramming somatic cells. We investigated the transcription profiles of mouse ES and primordial germ cells to identify genes upregulated in pluripotent cells, both in vitro and in vivo.

**Methods:** We analyzed gene expression profiles of ES and PGC cells and identified clusters of genes upregulated in pluripotent cells, including those involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. Developed a novel algorithm, Compoby, combining sequence alignment and non-alignment with probabilistic segmentation to predict short motifs regulating gene expression. Compoby identified conserved motifs in upregulated plurip cells.

**Findings:** Motifs are preferentially active in undifferentiated ES and embryonic cells in sequence-specific, acting as enhancers in endogenous promoters. Activity conserved in human ES cells. Transcription factor-Y binds one motif, differentially expressed during ES differentiation, required for ES proliferation.

**Implications:** This study provides novel insights into transcriptional networks of pluripotent cells, suggesting systematic approach applicable to mammalian species. Identified clusters upregulated genes in pluripotent, including known pluripotency markers. Developed algorithm Compoby for motif discovery, validated in mouse and human pluripotent cells, and transcription factor-Y as regulator of ES proliferation.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals transcriptional regulatory networks of plurip cells, providing basis for understanding early mammalian embryogenesis and ES self-renew plurotency. Compoby combines comparative genomics and sequence segmentation to identify motifs in upstream coregulated genes, demonstrating novel regulatory elements in mouse and human pluripotent cells. Biochemical approaches will identify transcription factors binding motifs.

**Title:** Structural Characterization of the Nucleoprotein-Nucleocapsid Complex of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus: Implications for RNA Replication and Encapsidation

**Research Question:** How does the nucleoprotein (N) interact with the phosphoprotein (P) to facilitate replication and encapsidation of non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses?

**Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy to characterize a soluble heterodimer complex between a variant of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lacking its N-terminal residues (Δ) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P) encompassing the molecular recognition element (Mo) of P that binds to RNA-free N.

**Findings:** The crystallized decameric form of the NΔ-P complex at 3.0 Å resolution reveals how Mo folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy confirm the binding of Mo and indicate that flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure suggests a mechanism for initiation of viral RNA synthesis.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that the reconstituted N-P complex is a suitable model for viral N-P in agreement with previous studies. The crystal and NMR experiments show Mo adopts a stable conformation upon binding to N, including residues 6-35, corresponding to the fragment previously identified essential for maintaining N in soluble (aa 11-30). The heterodimer N-P crystallized into a decamer, similar to previously crystallized decam N-RNA. The structure reveals mechanisms N-binding Mo attaches to N.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides insights into the molecular basis of N-P interaction, essential for replication and encapsidation of nonsegment negative-strand RNA viruses. The structure of the N-P complex suggests a mechanism for initiation of RNA synthesis and encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA by viral polymerase. These findings have implications for understanding viral replication and encapsidation processes in negative-strand RNA viruses.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Axonal Gap Junctions in Efficient Sensory Processing in the Fly's Visual System

**Research Question:** How do axonal gap junctions contribute to the efficient encoding of sensory information in the fly's visual system, particularly in the vertical (VS) network?

**Methods:** We employed a realistic network model of the VS to investigate the role of axonal gap junctions in encoding the axis of rotation (θ) of the fly's motion. We analyzed the network's performance in the presence and absence of axonal gap junctions, measuring efficiency in bits, and robustness to signal-to-noise ratios.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed that within 10 ms of visual input onset, the presence of axonal junctions enables the VS to encode θ efficiently, achieving near-optimal performance with respect to the physical limits determined by the visual input's statistical structure. Furthermore, we found that a subpopulation of VS cells connected via axonal junctions encodes θ more efficiently than the whole network, reaching at least 90% of the physical limit, regardless of signal-to-noise ratios.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that axonal junctions play a crucial role in efficient sensory processing in the fly's visual system, particularly in the VS network. The subpopulation of cells connected via axonal junctions is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Our study highlights the importance of exploring gap junctions as a mechanism for improving information transmission in neuronal systems.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into how specific connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli. The presence of gap junctions among axons of VS cells impacts the system's readout while maintaining dendritic input intact, indicating that neural circuit principles may be richer than previously appreciated based on point models. Our results encourage exploration of gap junctions as a common mechanism for improving transmission in various systems, including periphery and neocortical networks.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Basis of P-selectin Glycoprotein Ligand-1 (PSGL-1) Interaction with Enterovirus 71 (EV71): A Critical Role of Tyrosine Sulfation in Virus Binding and Replication

**Research Question:** What are the post-translational modifications of P-select glycoprotein ligand-1 (PS-1) that facilitate its interaction with Enterovirus 71 (EV), a causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, and fatal neurological disorders?

**Methods:** A series of PS-1 mutants were generated and expressed in 293T cells, and their abilities to bind EV71 were assayed by flow cytometry. Site-directed mutagenesis at tyrosine sulfation sites in the N-terminal region of PS-1 significantly impaired PS1 binding to EV71. Inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, blocked PS1-EV interaction and inhibited PS1-mediated replication of EV in Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner.

**Findings:** Tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal of PS1 is critical for EV71 binding and replication. Unlike P-selectin-F, EV71 bound a PS1 mutant with alanine substitution at the O-glycosylation site T57 in a calcium-independent manner. O-glycosylation on T57 is not necessary for PS1 binding to EV71. Site-directed mutagenesis at one or more tyrosine sulfation sites in the N region of PS1 significantly impaired PS binding to EV71.

**Implications:** These findings reveal the molecular basis of PS1-EV interaction and provide insights into the pathogenesis of EV71, a major causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease and fatal encephalitis in the Asia region. PS1, a sialucin expressed on leukocytes, serves as a high-affinity counterceptor for selectins and mediates leukocyte rolling on endothelium. PS-EV interaction requires sulfation of at least three tyines and adjacent O-gcan sial Lewis in N-terminal of PS.

**Conclusions:** Tyros sulfation, not Olycosylation, in the N-terminal of PS1 facilitates virus entry and replication of EV in leukocytes. This study elucidates the molecular basis PS-EV interaction and highlights the significance of PS1 as a cellular receptor for EV. Further studies are needed to identify determinants in EV capsid proteins required for PS binding using EVB and nonB strains.

**Title:** Therapeutic Efficacy of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitors in Controlling Leishmanias

**Research Question:** Can mammalian target of rapycin (mTOR) inhibitors be used as a novel therapeutic approach to control Leishmanias, a serious global health problem affecting millions worldwide?

**Methods:** We investigated the efficacy of three mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin, G-645, and K-379, in a mouse model of cutaneous Leishiasis. BAL/c mice received an intrafoot injection of the parasite and were treated with clinically relevant doses of rapycin, G-645, or K-379. Foot swelling and parasite burden were assessed, and cytokine production by splenocytes and phenotypic changes in draining lymph nodes were evaluated.

**Findings:** Treatment with clinically relevant doses of rapycin or G-645, but not K-379, dramatically lowered foot swelling and parasite load in draining node. Importantly, rapycin did not kill promastigotes in vitro. IL-4 production of splenocytes from rapycin-treated mice was reduced, and IFN-γ:IL-4 ratio was elevated, indicating a Th1-skewed cytokine profile. Expression of CD, an activation marker, on splenic and node CD+ CD+ T cells was enhanced in rapycin mice.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that select mTOR inhibitors may be used in therapeutic settings for Leishias management. We propose that beneficial effects stem from immunomodulatory properties. Adjuvant of m inhibitors may be considered in vaccination strategies against Leish species.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates, for the first time, that inhibition of m by rapycin or G645 decreases parasite burden and morbidity in experimental Leishias. We provide evidence linking benefits to immunomodulatory of m inhibitors. Biological and clinical relevance of findings will be discussed. Future studies will address how rapycin-primed CD+ and CD+ T cells participate in anti-Leish immunity.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Natural Transformation in Neisseria Species: Unveiling the Role of ComP and DUS Interdependence

**Research Question:** What is the role of Com and DUS in the natural transformation process of Neisser species, and how do they interact to facilitate horizontal gene transfer?

**Methods:** We employed a series of experiments to investigate the interdependence of Com and DUS in Neisser transformation. Firstly, we modulated Com levels in Neisser meningidis to assess its impact on transformation in the presence and absence of DUS. Secondly, we analyzed the importance of DUS and its bases for recognition by Com and transformation. Thirdly, we examined the ability of naturally occurring D variants in Neisser commals to transform N meningidis. Finally, we tested the ability of a Com homolog from N commals to mediate D-enhanced transformation in a com mutant Nidis.

**Findings:** Our results show that Com is essential for transformation in the presence and absence of DUS, and that inner bases of D (7-10) are critical for recognition by Com and transformation. Notably, naturally occurring D variants in Neisser commals differing from D by one or two bases were impaired for transformation Nidis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a Com from N comm specifically binds its cognate D variant and mediates D-enhanced transformation in a com mutant Nidis.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the molecular events of the earliest step in natural transformation and reveal an elegant mechanism for modulating gene transfer between species sharing the same niche. Our results suggest that Com and D interdependence is conserved across Neisser species, enabling them to promote their own or closely related DNA.

**Conclusions:** The identification of Com as the D receptor Neisser species paves the way for detailed analysis of D-Com interdependence during natural transformation. Our study highlights the importance of inner bases D for recognition by Com and transformation, and demonstrates that naturally occurring D variants in Neisser commals are impaired for transformation Nidis. The ability of a Com hom from comm to mediate D-enhanced transformation in a mutant Nidis confirms a conserved mechanism across Neisser species. Together, these findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms of natural transformation and provide a framework for understanding gene transfer between species sharing the same niche.

**Title:** Coordinated Regulation of Fungal Cytokinesis: Cooperation between PAX1, BGS, and Cdc15 in Septum Synthesis and Contractile Actomyosin Ring Stability

**Research Question:** How do PAX, B, and C15 proteins interact to regulate septum synthesis and contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) stability during fungal cytokinesis?

**Methods:** We employed a genetic approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the role of PAX, B, and C15 in septum synthesis and CAR stability during cytokinesis.

**Findings:** Our results show that PAX and B cooperate to maintain CAR integrity and septum formation during cytokinesis. PAX is required for CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane before septation onset, while B is essential for linear (1,3) glucan synthesis and septum formation. Depletion of P in combination with B causes ring contraction failure and lateral wall overgrowth without septum formation. We also found that P concentration at the CAR increases during cytokinesis, dependent on the SH domain of C15. Depletion of B in cells carrying c15SH allele causes ring disassembly and septation block, similar to cells lacking P. Conversely, absence of P is lethal when C15 function is affected, leading to CAR sliding and septum material deposition along the cortex.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that anchorage of CAR to plasma through C15 and P, and concomitant B activity are necessary for CAR and septum formation in yeast. B and P cooperate to maintain CAR position and integrity during cytokinesis, and are essential for septum synthesis. Temporary inactivation of R1 GTPase is required for septum ingression, and deletion of P increases R1 activity, impeding septum ing upon B repression in P cells. These results suggest C15, through SH, and P cooperate with B to confer stability to CAR and form septum during cytokinesis.

**Conclusions:** Cooperation between P, B, and is essential for CAR and septum formation. Cells lacking B display CAR disassembly and cannot form sept when P is absent or P levels are reduced, as in cells carrying cSH allele. We propose that P acts as mechanosensor transforming CAR contraction into activation for biosynthetic enzymes forming septum. Our study highlights the complex interplay between P, B, and C in regulating septum and CAR stability during fungal cytokinesis.

**Title:** Investigating the Outbreak of Glanders Caused by Burkholderia malle in Bahrain: A High-Resolution Genotyping and Whole Genome Analysis Reveals Complex Epidemiological Dynamics

**Background:** Glanders, a zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia malle, has been eradicated in many Western countries but recently emerged in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. Due to its rarity, little is known about its outbreak dynamics and epidemiology.

**Research Question:** We investigated a recent outbreak of glanders in Bahrain using high-resolution genotyping (multiple locus variable number of tandem repeats, MLVA) and whole genome sequencing of B. malle isolated from infected horses and camels, comparing them to samples from an outbreak in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 and placing them in a broader phylogeographic context based on published B. malle data.

**Methods:** We analyzed nine B. malle isolates from different horses and one camel from the Bahrain outbreak (2010 and 201) and 15 isolates from the 2004 outbreak in UAE using the high-resolution 23-marker VNTR assay. MLVA data from 50 horses and one camel tested positive B. malle was isolated from eight horses and single camel. Using B. malle-specific real-time PCR and high ML typing, we showed the camel strain was genetically related to B. malle strain Dubai 7 isolated from a horse during the outbreak in quarantine in UAE 2004.

**Findings:** Our results provide evidence that the outbreak in Bahrain was caused by two B. malle strains, suggesting independent introductions. Animal import records suggest Syria and Kuwait as possible sources, supported by one necropsied horse in quarantine came directly from Kuwait. The outbreak dynamics and genetic variability of B. m are not understood due to its rarity. This provided an opportunity to understand dynamics in a region previously free B.

**Implications:** The emergence of glanders in combination with horse trading poses a new risk for human infections. High-resolution genotyping and comparative genome analysis revealed phylogenetic patterns among samples. The close relationship of Dubai/UAE B. m populations may indicate a similar origin yet to be identified infecting strains.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the complex epidemiological background of B. m in Bahrain, involving multiple strains. The recent emergence of glanders in combination with horse trading poses a new risk for human infections.

**Title:** Investigating the Clinical and Parasitological Features of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Patients Unresponsive to Pentavalent Antimonial Treatment: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Research Question:** What are the clinical and parasitological characteristics of patients with cutaneous leishmanias that do not respond to pentavalent antimonial treatment, specifically Glucime, and what are the factors associated with treatment failure?

**Methods:** A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in a cohort of 43 patients recruited from three Colombian National Army reference centers for complicated cutaneous leishiasis. Clinical, paraclinical, epidemiological, and geographic information were recorded for each patient. Parasitological, histopathological, and PCR confirmation were performed. Glucime IC50 and in vitro infectivity for isolated parasites were estimated.

**Findings:** The predominant infecting Leish species was L. braziliensis (95.4%), and 35% of parasites showed a significant decrease in vitro Glucime susceptibility associated with previous medication. Lesion size and in vitro infectivity of parasite were negatively correlated with Glime susceptibility (Spearman r = -0.548 and r = -0.726, respectively). A negative correlation between lesion size and resistance was documented. L. brazili was the main species associated with treatment failure or relapse.

**Implications:** The findings suggest that L. brazili is the main species associated with treatment failure or relapse of cutaneous leishias with pentaval ant derivatives, indicating a second round of treatment may be necessary.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of understanding the clinical and parasitological characteristics of patients with cutaneous leishias that do not respond to pentaval ant treatment, specifically Glime, and the factors associated with treatment failure. The results indicate that L. brazili is the main species associated with treatment failure or relapse, suggesting a second round of treatment may be necessary.

**Title:** Interplay between Biosynthetic Pathways of Siderophores and Genotoxin in Escheria coli

**Research Question:** How do the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores and genotoxins interact in Escheria coli, and what is the role of 4-phosphopantin transferase (PT) enzymes in this interaction?

**Methods:** We investigated the interplay between biosynthetic pathways of siderores and genotoxin in Escheria coli by analyzing the functional interchangeability of PTases Ent and ClA. We used a mouse sepsis model to evaluate the virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (Ex) strains with either functional Ent or ClA.

**Findings:** We found that ClA, encoded by the pks island, is a promuous PTase that contributes to the synthesis of both genoto and siderores. Inactivation of both Ent and ClA abolished the virulence of Ex in the mouse seps model, while the presence of either functional Ent or ClA was required for survival of Ex in vivo. This is the first report of a connection between multiple PT pathways leading to biosynthesis of functionally distinct metabolites in a microorganism.

**Implications:** The association of pks with highogenic island (H) in highly virulent E. coli may be due to ClA's ability to contribute to synthesis of both genoto and siderores. This highlights the complex interaction between virulence features and functions, and identifies key points for understanding Ex virulence and developing anti-vir therapy strategies.

**Conclusion:** Our study demonstrates the interplay between biosynthetic pathways of genoto and multiple siderores in Escheria, and identifies ClA as a promuous PTase contributing to synthesis of both genoto and siderores. The association of pks with H may have been selected in highly virulent E coli due to ClA's ability to contribute to synthesis of both genoto and siderores. This work highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory networks of virulence features and functions, and identifies potential targets for anti-vir therapy.

**Title:** A Probabilistic Model of Multiple Alignment Accounting for Insertions and Deletions in Phylogenetic Inference

**Research Question:** How can we develop a probabilistic model of multiple alignment that accounts for insertions and deletions in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree, to improve the accuracy of phylogenetic inference?

**Methods:** We construct a non-reversible (birth-death) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions starting from a continuous Markov process, assuming that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. We extend the Felsen peeling algorithm to calculate the probability of a multiple alignment with insertions and deletions given a phylogen tree. We apply this model to phylogen tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phip.

**Findings:** We show that the extended dnε program improves accuracy relative to the usual approach ignoring gaps while retaining the efficiency of the Felsen peeling algorithm. Using benchmarking on simulated and real ribosomal RNA data, we demonstrate that the extended program outperforms the usual approach.

**Implications:** Our model integrates evolutionary modeling into probabilistic widely used for sequence problems such as Hs and SCs for homology and genefinding. While Hs SCs and other models account for insertions deletions, widely phylogen models only account for substitutions. Our model describes the evolution of residues in one column of multiple alignment given phylogen tree. The probability of alignment is an independent product of each column probability.

**Conclusions:** We present a probabil model of multiple alignment that accounts for insertions deletions in addition to substitutions given phylogen tree. Our model improves the accuracy of phylogen inference while retaining the efficiency of the Felsen pe algorithm. We demonstrate on simulated and real RNA data that our model outperforms the usual approach ignoring gaps. Our model integrates evolutionary into probabilistic widely used for sequence problems such as Hs and SCs hom and genefinding.

**Title:** Mechanism of Immunity to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Initiation: A Novel Insights into the Role of Langerhans Cells and Dermal Dendritic Cells

**Research Question:** How do Langerh cells (LCs) and dermal dendritic cells (DCs) interact to initiate immunity against Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection in the skin?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between LCs and dermal DCs in HSV-1 infected human foreskin explants, biopsies from initial genital herpes lesions, and isolated skin cells in vitro.

**Findings:** LCs were initially infected by HSV-1, underwent apoptosis, and were taken up by BD3+ dermal DC and DC-S+ cells, which upregulated damaged cell receptor CLEC9. No other epidermal cells interacted with dermal DCs. In vitro, isolated LCs infected with HSV-1 underwent apoptosis and were taken by BD3+ dermal DC and DC+ cells.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest a viral relay mechanism where infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken by dermal DC for antigen presentation, providing a rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal immunization.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the mechanism of HSV immunity initiation in the skin, highlighting the role of LC and dermal DC interaction in antigen presentation. The innerkin model is useful for studying epithelial viruses in human skin.

**Title:** Multidimensional Imaging Reveals Leishmania Species-Specific Differences in Parasitophorous Vacuole Biogenesis and Remodeling in Macrophages

**Research Question:** How do Leishmania major and Leish amazonensis amastigotes differ in their biogenesis and remodeling of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages?

**Methods:** We used multidimensional imaging of live cells to compare and characterize PV biogenesis and remodeling in macrophages hosting amastigotes of Leish major or Le amazon and loaded with Lysotracker, a lysosotropic fluorescent probe.

**Findings:** Three dynamic features of Leish amastote-hosting PVs were documented: (i) entry of Lysacker into tight-fitting, fission-prone Le major PVs; (ii) decrease in number of macroph acidic vesicles during Le major PV fission and amazon PV enlargement; and (iii) amazon PV remodeling through homotypic fusion. High-resolution images revealed Leish species-specific differences in PV biogenesis and remodeling.

**Implications:** This study updates our understanding of Leish species-specific differences in PV biogenesis and remodeling, which could be useful for studying other intracellular microorganisms.

**Conclusions:**

1. Leish major amastotes form tight-fitting PVs housing one or two amastigotes, while Le amazon amastotes form giant PVs housing many amastotes.
2. Le major PVs undergo fission through a two-step process: replication of amast in a single PV followed by separation into two PV with transient lysosotropic accumulation.
3. Le amazon PV remodeling occurs through homotypic fusion.
4. Macrophage acidic vesicles contribute to Le PV biogenesis, with approximately 30% of acidic vesicles consumed during intracellular infection.
5. Secondary lysosomes are the main source of Le PV membrane, but other acidic vesicles also contribute.
6 Multidimensional imaging allowed quantification of host acidic vesicles and Le PV in the same channel.

This study overcomes limitations of previous research on fixed cells and provides high-resolution characterization of Leish PV features in live macrophages.

**Title:** Chromatin Structure Regulates Homologous Recombination in Immunoglobulin Gene Diversification in Chicken DT40 Cells

**Research Question:** How does chromatin structure contribute to the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair in immunoglobulin gene diversification in chicken DT40 cells?

**Methods:** We employed a regulatable system in which heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) from Drosoph melanogaster was expressed as a fusion to Escheria coli lactose repressor (LacI-1) and tethered to polymerase operators within the immunoglobulin λ (λ) pseudogene array in DT40 cells. Histone acetylation within the pseudoλ array was diminished, and the outcome of Vλ diversification was altered, favoring non-templated mutations over templated mutations.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that chromatin structure regulates homolog-directed repair, suggesting that histone modifications contribute to genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.

**Implications:** These findings have practical ramifications for developing strategies to harness cell's capacity for homology repair to promote gene therapy by providing an intact donor gene to replace a deficient gene. Our results suggest that permissive structure at the donor will be an important parameter in designing genes for therapeutic applications.

**Conclusions:** We found that the immunoglob λ pseudogene is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin, directly demonstrating the importance of chrom structure for gene conversion. Tethering HP1 to the pseudoλ array diminished histone acetylation and altered the outcome of V diversification, favoring non-templated mutations over templated. These results suggest that chromatin structure regulates homolog recombination, and histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.

**Title:** Revisiting the Role of Climbing Fibers in Cerebell-Based Motor Learning: A Novel Insights from Random Saccadic Paradigm

**Research Question:** Does the cerebellum-based motor learning rely solely on the difference between desired and actual behavior, i.e., error information, or does it also benefit from future error-induced changes in synaptic plasticity?

**Methods:** We employed a random saccadic paradigm to investigate the role of climbing fibers in cerebell-based motor learning in monkeys. This paradigm avoids the buildup of behavioral changes and diminution of error, allowing for a clear electrophysiological fingerprint of error.

**Findings:** We observed a clear spike signature of error at the time of occurrence and reverberation of this signature later, before the manifestation of new behavior to improve it. Contrary to the prevailing assumption, climbing fibers are not confined to communicating instant errors, but also convey information on past errors for synaptic modification.

**Implications:** Our findings challenge the concept that climbing fibers' role is limited to instant error communication, suggesting a more complex function in cerebellar motor learning. This contrasts with previous studies, including our own work on short-term sacc adaptation (STSA), which showed patterns at odds with MA theory.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate a shift between populations indicating alteration of sacc amplitude by occurrence of CS in primary interval. Firing of simple spikes (SS) and CS in motor learning are well established, but our effects might be secondary to error-related changes in simple discharge. Climbing fibers convey information on past errors, not just instant, for synaptic modification. This expands our understanding of cerebellar motor learning, highlighting a more nuanced role for climbing fibers beyond instant error communication.

**Title:** Modulation of TDP-43 Toxicity by the Hsp70 Chaperone Sis in a Yeast and Mammalian Models of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

**Background:** Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of motor neurons and cytoplasmic inclusions containing the RNA-binding protein T-43 (TDP-43). Recent studies have implicated T-43 in the pathogenesis of ALS, with overexpression of T-43 leading to cytoplasmic aggregation and toxicity in yeast and mammalian neurons.

**Research Question:** Can the Hsp chaper S1 modulate T-43 toxicity in yeast and mammalian models of ALS?

**Methods:** We employed a yeast model of ALS exhibiting T-43-dependent toxicity to investigate the effects of S1 overexpression on T-43 aggregation and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Additionally, we overexpressed the mammalian S1 homologue, DNA1, in primary rodent cortical neurons to assess its impact on T-43-mediated toxicity.

**Findings:** Overexpression of S1 dramatically reduced T-43 aggregation and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of a reporter construct. Furthermore, overexpression of DNA1 relieved T-43-mediated toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons, suggesting S1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that S1 and its homologues can modulate T-43 toxicity, potentially mitigating cytoplasm aggregation and proteolytic dysfunction associated with ALS. The protective effects of S1 were influenced by the presence of the endogenous yeast prion, PIN+, and overexpression of S altered T-43 aggregation pattern without detectable physical association between S1 and T-43, indicating indirect effects on T- aggregation.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the utility of yeast as a model for understanding ALS and identifies S1 as a potential modifier of T-43 toxicity. Overexpression of S1 and its mammalian homologue, DNA1, may provide a means of extending neuronal survival in ALS and related conditions characterized by cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of RNA-binding proteins like T-43. Further investigation is warranted to determine the efficacy of S1 and DNA1 in extending neuronal survival in ALS.

**Title:** Molecular Characterization of Trypanosoma cruzi Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) and Parasite Load in Chronic Chagas Disease Patients in Brazil

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the association between Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs) and clinical manifestations of Chagas disease in a cohort of 65 chronic patients from different geographic regions of Brazil.

**Methods:** A multilocus conventional and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) approaches were used to perform molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens of 65 chronic Chagas patients. Patients were recruited at the same health center, but their places of birth were widely distributed in different geographic regions of Brazil.

**Findings:** Of the 65 patients, 35 (53.8%) presented amplification by real-time qPCR, being 20 (30.7%) with the indeterminate form and 15 (23.1) with the cardiac form of disease. The parasite median for all positive patients was 2.54 [1.43-11.14] parasite equivalents (Eq/mL), ranging from 0.12 to 153.66 Eq/mL. Notably, the load was higher in patients over 70 years (median 20.05 [18.29-86] Eq/mL). Using guanidine-ED blood spiked with T. cruzi strains, belonging to six DTUs, it was possible to genotype to 0.5 Eq/mL with high specificity. Of patients with qPCR, it was possible to identify T. cruz DT in 28 (80%) For remaining (20%), least partial result was obtained. Analysis showed prevalence of Tc, TII, and mixed Tc equal 40%, 17.1%, and 14.3, respectively. In addition, two were infected by T and one coinfected by TIII, last three in stage of chasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) and born in Bahia (northeast region Brazil).

**Implications:** Our results contribute to update epidemiological knowledge of T. cruz DT in Brazil and highlight age and infection by TII as features leading to higher parasitemia levels.

**Conclusions:** The real-time PCR showed satisfactory sensitivity and accuracy for detection and quantification of T. cruz from peripheral blood of infected patients, even in chronic phase [25, 26, 27]. Quantitative is used to monitor parasite during etiological treatment and valuable as indicator of failure Ch disease [23, 24]. Parasite estimation by PCR was used to determine T genotyping and pooled analyzed characteristics of patients. Sixty Chagas chronic, aged 26 to 76 with median 54 (45), 34 females and 31, recruited. Intraspecific T. cruz genotyping and pre-established q protocol used, recommended by international specialists [15, 17, 25, 27, 28], enabling molecular characterization and load directly from samples, high.

**Title:** Detection of Rabies Virus in Bats in Guatemala: A Low Prevalence and Phylogenetic Analysis

**Research Question:** What is the prevalence of rabies virus (RV) in bats in Guatemala, and what is the phylogenetic relationship of RV isolates from vampire bats in this region?

**Methods:** Between 2009 and 2011, a total of 672 bats from 31 species were sampled and tested for RV in Guatemala as part of a larger pathogen detection program. Viral antigens and infectious virus were isolated from the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotus). RV was also isolated from oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats, whereas viral RNA was detected in all tissues examined by hemi-nested RT-PCR except the liver of one.

**Findings:** The prevalence of RV among collected bats was low (0.3%). Sequencing the nucleoprotein gene showed both viruses were 100% identical, whereas sequencing glycoprotein revealed non-synonymous substitution (302T). The vampire RV isolates in this study were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of sera from 398 bats demonstrated RV neutralizing antibodies. The proportion of seropositive bats varied across troph guilds, suggesting complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RV perpetuation.

**Implications:** Given the ecological importance of bats, especially in tropical regions, novel strategies are necessary for prevention and control of bat-associated zoonoses. This is the first report of RV isolation from bats in Guatemala. The prevalence of RV among all bats was low (0.3%), even among vampire bats (1.3%). The vampire RV isolates were related phylogen to viruses associated with bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador, which is expected given their proximity. Rab epizootics and phylogen clusters of RV in vampire populations are relatively constrained in space.

**Conclusions:** The low prevalence of RV in bats in this study is consistent with other surveillance in Peru (10.3%), Grenada (7.6%), and Trinidad (12%). The detection of RNA in bats demonstrated RV exposure among multiple species in Guatemala. Viral RNA was detected in all examined tissues except the liver of one. The results of RV isolation and nucleic detection from rabid bats are presented in Table 4. Two RV sequences and RV were generated from brain of infected bats and deposited into GenBank (accession: F696-99).

**Title:** The Role of Nuclear Lamins in Regulating Heterochromatin and Gene Activation during Herpes Simplex Virus Infection**

**Research Question:** What is the role of nuclear lamins in regulating heterochromatin and gene activation during Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection?

**Methods:** We examined HSV infection in wild-type (WT) and lamin-deficient (Lna/−) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) using chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies.

**Findings:** HSV replication compartments were reduced in size and failed to target the nuclear periphery in Lna/− MEFs compared to WT cells. Chromatinoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies showed HSV was associated with increased heterochatin in Lna− MEFs.

**Implications:** These results suggest a functional role for lamin A in viral expression, replication, and growth, with greatest effect on viral replication at low multiplicity of infection. Lamin/C is required for targeting the viral genome and reduction of heterochatin on viral promoters during lytic infection.

**Conclusions:** The nuclear lamina serves as a molecular scaffold for DNA and protein complexes that regulate euchatin and heterochatin modifications. This study provides evidence for lamin-dependent targeting of HSV to the periphery associated with reduction of heterochatin on lytic genes. The data suggest a role for lamin in maintenance of heterochatin and gene silencing. Viruses have been used as probes for studying cellular mechanisms, and chromatin plays a role in regulation of HSV expression. HSV DNA is not associated with histones. By regulating chromatin on the viral, HSV determines productive or latent infection in cell types. Further studies should determine the mechanism lamin exploited by HSV to keep genome transcriptionally active during productive infection.

**Title:** Elucidating the Structure and Function of the Tripletore TOM Complex in Hydrogenosomes of Trichomonas vaginalis: Implications for the Evolution of Mitochondrial Protein Import Pathways

**Research Question:** The origin of mitochondria from proteobacterial endosymbionts and their transition to organelles is tightly linked to the establishment of protein import pathways, with the initial import of proteins mediated by the transloc of the outer membrane (TOM). However, the diversity of TOM subunits between eukotic lineages has been predicted, but experimental knowledge is limited to few organisms, and it remains unsettled whether the tripletore or twinore is the generic form of TOM.

**Methods:** We analyzed the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically anaobic form of mitochondria found in the excav Trichomonas vaginal. We demonstrate the highly divergent β-bar T vaginal TOM (Tv)40 forms translocation to hydrogenosomal import. Tv40 is present in high weight complexes, and analysis revealed the presence of four-anchored (TA) proteins. Two, Tom36 and Tom46, with heat protein (H) and tetratopeptide (PR) domains, bind hydrogenosomal proteins and likely function as receptors. A third unit, Tom-like, has short domain and conserved transmembrane but lacks domain. The fourth, hydrogenosomal outer protein (p) has no homology.

**Findings:** Our data indicate that TvOM is associated with sorting assembly (SAM) that in β-bar assembly. Visualization of TvOM by electron microscopy revealed it forms three pores with an unconventional skull-like shape. Although TvOM lacks Tom, phylogenetic predicted Tom in freeivingates.

**Implications:** Collectively, our results suggest that the tripletore complex, composed of conserved units, was present in the common eukotic ancestor (LECA), while receptors for substrate evolved in eukotic lineages. Our study extends knowledge of TOM diversity in eukotes and provides insights into the evolution of mitochondrial import pathways.

**Conclusions:** Mitochondrial protein import is essential for the function and evolution of eukotic cell, but experimental knowledge of TOM is limited to few organisms. Our study of hydrogenosomes, anaobic form of mitochondria in Trichas vaginal, reveals a highly divergent TOM complex that mediates protein import. Despite divergence in primary structure and evolutionary, electron microscopy shows structural similarity between TvOM and threeore complex. The presence of extra density gives TvOM a unique skull-like shape. Our results suggest that tripletore complex was present in LE, while receptors for substrate evolved in eotic line.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of CD4 and CD8 T Cell Regulation in Autoimmune Diseases: Insights from eQTL Mapping and Gene Expression Analysis

**Research Question:** How do genetic polymorphisms in CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to the initiation and progression of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

**Methods:** We employed eQTL mapping in purified CD4 and CD8 T cells to investigate the regulation of genes associated with autoimmune diseases, focusing on the chr12q13.2 locus containing the RPS gene and the IL27 gene.

**Findings:** We identified a common missense variant in IL27 associated with type 1 diabetes, resulting in decreased protein activity and reduced expression of IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4 T cells. Notably, the rs206[G] variant of IL27 conferred protection against type 1 diabetes by inhibiting IR1 and STAT1 expression in CD4 T cells. Conversely, IL27 may promote autoimmunity towards pancreatic islets via upregulation of the STAT pathway.

**Implications:** Our results provide novel insights into the regulation of gene expression in T cells and the pathways involved in disease susceptibility in the adaptive immune system, highlighting the importance of cell-specific regulation in autoimmune diseases.

**Conclusions:** eQ mapping in purified T cells reveals functional insights into polymorphisms and pathways associated with autoimmune diseases, underscoring the significance of cell-specific regulation in the immune system. Our findings suggest that CD4 T cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and that IL27 may contribute to autoimmunity via the STAT pathway.

**Title:** Socio-Cultural and Economic Barriers to the Uptake of Screening and Treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): A Qualitative Study

**Research Question:** What are the socio-cultural and economic factors that hinder the uptake of screening and treatment of Human Trypanosomiasis (H) in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and how can they be addressed to enhance the effectiveness of H control efforts?

**Methods:** A qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions was conducted in Bandu and Kasa Oriental provinces, two provinces lagging behind in H elimination efforts. Participants included current and former H patients, as well as healthcare providers and program managers of the national H control program. Interviews and discussions were recorded and analyzed using ATLAS.ti software.

**Findings:** Health workers and community members reported prohibitions to be respected for six months after H treatment: no work, no intercourse, no food, not walking in the sun. Violating these restrictions is believed to cause serious, sometimes deadly complications. These prohibitions are well-known by community and lead people to avoid H screening for fear of observing tabo in case of diagnosis. Restrictions aimed to mitigate severe effects of melarsol regimen, but are not evidence-based and obsolete with new drugs. Correct information regarding H treatment is essential. Providers should address community perspective in dialogue to keep abreast of unintended transformations.

**Implications:** Understanding these prohibitions, their origin, and rationale is required to improve H control in DRC coordinated by Programme National contre la Trypanomiase Humaine Africaine (PNLA). Medical advice on H management has transformed into series of enforced tabo entertained by providers and community in these regions. They are determinant of suboptimal uptake of H screening. Tabo might be abandoned if safer options made available, as observed with advent NECT.

**Conclusion:** Nature of restrictions and duration negatively affected participation in H screening and treatment. Unclear where tabo originated, whether self or provider-imposed, and basis. Given impact on efforts, we document perceptions and attitudes in depth. Conducted in provinces with H prevalence, where tabo previously identified. Not explored provinces with lower prevalence. Failure and event rates melars vary, e.g. 19.5% in Equateur, 0.45 in Bandu, 29.6 in Kasai. Systematic follow-up no longer recommended by WHO. Non-participation compromises national program objectives.

**Title:** Estimating the Incidence and Mortality of Visceral Leishmanias in Tabarak, Eastern Sudan: A Door-to-Door Survey in 45 Villages of Alure Locality

**Research Question:** What is the incidence and mortality rate of visceral leishmanias (VL) in 45 villages of Alure locality, Eastern Sudan, and what is the burden of the disease in the region?

**Methods:** A door-to-door survey was conducted in 45 villages of Alure locality between May 5-17, 2011, interviewing 17,702 households with a population of 94,369 inhabitants. Individuals with fever for at least two weeks, VL diagnosed in the previous year, and clinical suspicion of post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) were referred to medical teams for case ascertainment. New cases of VL were suspected with positive rk39 rapid test or direct agglutination test (DAT).

**Findings:** The crude mortality rate over the recall period of 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people per day, VL was possible or probable cause for 19% of all deaths. VL-specific rate was estimated at 0.9/100 per year. Medical teams examined 551 individuals for history of fever at least two weeks, of which 16 were diagnosed with primary VL. Incidence of VL over past year was 7.0/100 persons per year, or 7.9/100 per year when deaths or probably due to VL included. Overall, 12.5% (11,943/95,609) of population reported past VL episode.

**Implications:** VL represents significant health burden in Gedare State. Active case detection had low yield in this setting with access to care and may not be priority intervention to control in similar contexts.

**Conclusion:** VL is a major public health concern in Eastern Sudan, with high incidence and mortality rates. The study highlights the importance of door-to-door survey in estimating disease burden in endemic areas. The low yield of active case detection in this setting with access to care suggests that other interventions such as vector control may be more effective in controlling the disease.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Negative Supercoiling in Bacterial Chromosomes: Unveiling the Role of Gyrase and Transcription

**Research Question:** How does the catalytic efficiency of gyrase and transcription elongation rate influence the supercoiling density of bacterial chromosomes?

**Methods:** We analyzed strains of Salmonella using a 9 kb "supercoil" sensor inserted at ten positions around the genome to monitor supercoiling and transcription rates in wild-type (WT) and mutant strains. The sensor contains a Lac operon flanked by resolvase binding sites and can detect both supercoiling and transcription elongation.

**Findings:** Unexpectedly, Escherichia coli has a 15% higher level of supercoiling compared to Salmonella. Strains with gyrase mutations at permissive temperature exhibited significant supercoil losses from 30% of WT levels to total loss of σ at chromosome. Supercoiling was influenced by transcription, as rifampicin (Rif) caused superco to rebound throughout chromosome. Gyrase mutants caused super losses also reduced transcription elongation throughout genome. The link between RNA polymerase elongation and gyrase turnover suggests bacteria with fast growth rates generate higher supercoiling than slow species.

**Implications:** Our results show that supercoiling of Salmonella is determined by a mechanism linking gyrase catalytic efficiency to transcription elongation rate. TS alleles of Gyr caused broad depletion of superco throughout genome, which was reversed by blocking transcription with Rif. Most strikingly, gyr182 mutation caused fall to 1% while recombination was 11 in upstream domain. Superco levels rose and fell at ends of highly transcribed operon in growing permissive temperature. We measured superco levels and elongation using sensors at multiple positions covering 6 domains of E. coli.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that slow or uncoordinated gyrase variants in WT may cause sporadic supercoil disruptions, promoting RNAP block to replisome. A second model proposes a long supercoil gradient within chromosome, with origin having highest σ and terminus lowest. Negative supercoiling is generated by gyrase, composed of Gyr and Gyr proteins as A2 tetramers. Super density of large chromosomes and plasmid is influenced by gyrase and topoisomer mutations. Top I breaks and rejoins DNA with one-strand mechanism.

**Title:** Regulation of Leishmania amazonensis Parasitophorous Vacuoles (PV) Expansion by Host Cell-Intrinsic Mechanisms: Implications for Intracellular Survival and Growth

**Research Question:** How does the expansion of parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) impact the intracellular survival and growth of Leishmania amazonensis, a causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of LYSTBe, a gene previously implicated in lysosome regulation, in the expansion of PV and intracellular survival of L. amazonensis in macrophages and fibroblasts.

**Findings:** Our results show that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate LYSTBe expression, leading to PV expansion and enhanced parasite replication. Conversely, LYSTBe overexpression resulted in small PV that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of LBe-expressing cells with vacolin reversed this phenotype, expanding PV and promoting growth. In contrast, E64 reduced PV size in LBe mutant cells and inhibited Lensis replication. Enlarged PV appear to protect parasites from oxidative damage, as inhibition of nitric oxide synthase had no effect on Lensis viability within PV, but enhanced growth within LBe-induced small PV.

**Implications:** Upregulation of LBe in infected cells functions as a host response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV and inhibiting intracellular survival. Our findings provide direct evidence for the idea that increased LBe expression restricts Leish growth by counteracting PV expansion.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that transcription of LBe, a gene implicated in lysosome regulation, is upregulated in macroages and fibrobl infected by L. amazon. Examining the impact of PV on parasite fate, we found that size is a determinant of intracellular survival. Our results suggest a search for drugs capable of blocking L amazon PV expansion may lead to therapeutic strategies against human infections caused by this pathogen.

**Title:** Elucidating the Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Allan-Her-Dandy Syndrome: A Novel Insights from MCT8 Mutant Zebraf Model

**Research Question:** What is the role of monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT) in the pathophysiology of Allaner-Handy syndrome (AH), an X-linked psychotor retardation characterized by delayed development, intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, and spastic paraplegia, and disturbed thyroid hormone (TH) parameters?

**Methods:** We generated an M8 mutant zebraf using zinc-finger nuclease (Z)-mediated gene editing, eliminating M8 expression, which decreased TH levels, but not other TH-related genes. M8/ larvae exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to light-dark transitions, and increased sleep time. High-throughput behavioral assays revealed altered myelin-related gene expression and neuron-specific circuit formation. Time-lapse imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses in m8 larvae showed reduced filodia dynamics, axon branching, and synaptic density in sensory and motor neurons.

**Findings:** Our results suggest that M8 regulates neural circuit assembly, mediating sensory and motor control behavioral performance. Administration of TH analogs restored myelin and axon outgrowth in m8 larvae, indicating a potential therapeutic strategy for AH patients.

**Implications:** Our study provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of AH, highlighting the critical role of M in TH transport and neural development. We propose that early administration of TH analogs during embryonic development can reduce neurological damage in AH patients.

**Conclusions:** Our M8 mutant zraf model recapitulates AH symptoms, providing a valuable tool for understanding the disorder's mechanisms. Our findings suggest that M regulates neural circuit assembly, mediating sensory and motor performance, and that TH analogs can restore myelin and axon outgrowth deficiencies, offering a potential therapeutic avenue for AH treatment.

**Title:** Characterization of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Glycoprotein Complexes: Implications for Viral Entry and Fusion

**Research Question:** How do human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) glycoproteins, specifically gB and g/gL, interact to facilitate viral entry and fusion?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between CMV glycoproteins gB and gL using biochemical and biophysical approaches, including coimmunoprecipitation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and electron microscopy.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that CMV gB and gL form a stable complex in the absence of other viral proteins, with gL interacting with B mutants unable to mediate cell fusion. The B-gL complex constitutes 16-50% of total gL in CM virus particles, whereas small amounts of gL and gL-131 complexes were associated with B. This contrasts with herpesvirus models suggesting gL interacts B to mediate membrane fusion.

**Implications:** Our findings have major implications for herpesvirus entry models, demonstrating that CMV gB and gL form stable B-gL complexes are incorporated into virions without receptor binding or membrane fusion. Our data support the proposal that gL interacts B.

**Conclusion:** CMV entry differs from glycoprotein-mediated cell fusion, which requires only B and gL without O or UL-131, defining B and gL as the minimal machinery. Our results provide evidence for the interaction between gL and B, a crucial step in herpesvirus entry.

**Title:** Regulation of Mitochondrial DNA Segregation in Hematopoietic Tissues by Gimap, an Outer Mitochondrial GTPase

**Research Question:** The mechanisms underlying the segregation of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants in hematopoietic tissues remain poorly understood, and their pattern is a major determinant of disease onset and severity.

**Methods:** Using a heteroplasmic mouse model, we investigated the role of Gimap, an outer mitochondrial GTPase, in regulating mtDNA segregation in hematopoiet tissues.

**Findings:** We identified Gimap as the first nuclear-encoded gene influencing mtDNA segregation in mammals. Gimap regulates the rate of mtDNA segregation in hematopoiet tissues and is critical for leukocyte development and survival, suggesting leukocyte survival as a key factor in regulating mtDNA variants and modulating mitochondrial diseases.

**Implications:** Our study reveals Gimap as a novel regulator of mtDNA segregation in hematiet tissues, independent of mt copy number. Altered splicing of the CASTi allele changes the G3 protein sequence, affecting its soluble domain but not transmembrane domain, which anchors it to the outer membrane. mt segregation in hematiet tissues is age-dependent, but Gimap's role in younger mice unclear.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate Gimap's critical role in regulating mtDNA segregation in hematiet tissues. An outer membrane protein regulating mtDNA segregation in hematiet is puzzling. mt haplotype selection occurs at two levels: DNA sequence or encoded proteins. Gimap sequence analysis does not support direct interaction with mtDNA, as it does not span membranes to facilitate interaction. Retroviral overexpression of CASTimap in heteroplasmic fibroblasts had no effect on heterlas, implying cell-specific pathway required for mt segregation. Mitochondrial copy regulation has been proposed influencing mt haplotype and human mutations.

**Key Findings:**

* Gimap, an outer mitochondrial GTP, regulates mtDNA segregation in hematiet tissues.
* Gimap is critical for leukocyte development and survival.
* mt segregation in hematiet is age-dependent, but Gimap's role in younger mice unclear.
* Altered splicing of CASTi changes G3 sequence, affecting soluble domain but not transmembrane.
* Retroiral overexpression of CASTimap in heteroplasmic fibroblasts had no effect on heterlas.
* Cell-specific pathway required for mt segregation.

**Implications for future research:**

* Investigate Gimap's role in younger mice to understand age-dependent segregation.
* Explore cell-specific pathway for mt segregation.
* Examine mt copy regulation's influence on haplotype and human mutations.

**Title:** Estimating the Incubation Period of Buruli Ulcer in Victoria, Australia: A Retrospective Study of 443 Cases

**Research Question:** What is the incubation period of Buruli ulcer (BU) in Victoria, Australia, and does it vary by geographic location, age, sex, duration of exposure, or location of lesion?

**Methods:** A retrospective review of 443 cases of BU notified in Victoria between 2013-2016 was conducted. Telephone interviews were performed to identify cases with a visit to an endemic region or multiple visits within a month. The incubation period was defined as time between exposure to endemic region and symptom onset. Data were combined with earlier study cases 2002-2012.

**Findings:** Among 20 short-term visitors, the mean incubation was 143 days (4.8 months), similar to previous estimate 135 (4.5) months. No association was found between incubation and age, sex, location of exposure, duration or location of lesion.

**Implications:** Our study confirms mean incubation of BU in Victoria to be 4-5 months. This knowledge guides clinicians and suggests mode of transmission is similar in different regions.

**Conclusions:** The incubation period of Buruli in Victoria is estimated to be between 4-5 months, regardless of geographic location, age, sex, duration of exposure, or location of lesion. This suggests that the mode of transmission is similar in different endemic regions of Victoria.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Toxoplas Niemann-Pickel Type 1-Related Protein (TN1) in Lipid Homeostasis in Toxoplas

**Research Question:** What is the function of the Toxoplas Niemann-Pick type 1-related protein (TN) in lipid homeostasis in the intracellular parasite Tooplas?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of TN, a protein containing a canonical sterol-sensing domain (SSD), in lipid regulatory mechanisms in Tooplas. The protein sequence predicts an uncharacterized Niemann-P, type 1-related (NPC) protein with significant identity to human NPC1 and contains residues implicated in human disease. We named NPC-related, TN. Mammalian NPC localizes to endo-lysosomes and promotes movement of sterols and sphingolids across membranes of these organel. Miscoding mutations in NPC cause overloading of lipids in endo-lys. TN, however, lacks endosomal signals and localizes to flattened vesicles beneath plasma membrane Tooplas.

**Findings:** When expressed in mammalian NPC mutant cells and addressed to endo-lys, TN restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from organel. Quantitative lipid analyses on ΔN strain reveal normal cholesterol but overaccumulation several species cheryl esters sphingomyins and ceram. ΔN parasites characterized by storage bodies and membranous tubules from parasitoph vacoles. Interestingly, mutants generate multiple daughters single cell high frequencies allowing replication in vitro and slightly virulent mice parental strain.

**Implications:** These data suggest Δ strain lost ability control intracellular levels lipids, resulting stimulation lipid biosynthesis and division. Based observations ascribe role TN lipid homeost Tooplas.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate TN functions similar human NPC promote LDL-chole and GM release endytic organel, indicating conserved activity proteins. Data mammalian cells, parasite human NPC interchangeable respect LDLcho transport endytic compartments. To identify proteins involved homeasis Toop, searched homology ster-sensing (SSD) Tooplas genome ToDB. Gene coding transmembrane polype containing ster-sensing domain annotated transmembrane protein retrieved TG49 location chromosome.

**Title:** Identification of SMOC1 as the Causative Gene for Ophthalmoacromelic Syndrome (AS) through Homozygosity Mapping and Targeted Mutation Analysis

**Research Question:** What is the genetic cause of Othalmoacromelic syndrome (AS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bilateral anophthalmia and postaxial oligodactyly?

**Methods:** Homozygosity mapping and targeted mutation analysis of the locus 14q24.2 identified homozy mutations in SMOC (SMARC-related calcium binding 1) in eight unrelated families with AS. Four mutations were nonsense, frameshift, and missense, with missense mutations in the Thyrogulin-1 (T1) domain of the protein.

**Findings:** The ortholog gene Sm1 in mouse shows site- and stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofac, and somite development. Targeted gene-trap mutation of Sm1 (Sm1tm1) reduced mRNA to ∼10% of wild-type levels, resulting in highly penetrant hindlim postax oligodactly in homozyg mutant (Sm1tm1/t1) animals. Eye malformations, most coloma and cleft, occurred in a proportion of Sm1tm1/t1 embryos.

**Implications:** Partial loss of Sm-1 results in a convincing phenocopy of human AS. SM-1 is one of two mammalian paral of Drosophila Pentone, an inhibitor of decaplegic. Ortholog in Xenopus lavis, Sm-1 functions as Boneogenic (BMP) antagonist in earlyogenesis. Loss of BMP antagon during mammalian development provides plausible explanation for limb and eye phenotypes in humans and mice.

**Conclusions:** Taken together, these papers support loss SM-1 as major cause of AS, with conserved function during ocular and limb development. In six families with typical AS, no SM1 mutations were identified, including original described by Waarden in 1939. In two families, individuals showed homozyg over region 14q24. A proportion of Sm1/tm1 homozy mice had cleft, feature common in AS, consistent with high expression Sm1 in developing pharynge arch. Eye malations in mouse were less severe than human AS, predominantly iris and retinal coloma.

**Title:** TRIM22: A Key Mediator of Type 1 Interferon-Induced Restriction of HIV Replication

**Research Question:** How does Type 1 interferon treatment restrict HIV replication, and what is the role of the tripartite motif protein TR22 in this process?

**Methods:** We used transcriptional profiling to identify genes induced by interferon treatment and found TR22 as one of the most upregulated genes. We confirmed previous studies that TR22 overexpression inhibited HIV replication. To assess the role of TR22 under natural conditions, we compared the effects of interferon in cells depleted TR22 using RNAi and found that HIV release was significantly increased in knockdown, indicating TR22 acts as an antiviral effector. Further studies showed TR22 inhibited budding of virus-like particles containing Gag, indicating G was the target of TR22. TR22 did not block ML or EIA G particles. Inhibition was associated with diffuse cytoplasmic staining of G rather than accumulation at plasma, suggesting TR disrupts trafficking.

**Findings:** TR22 is an interferon-inducible effector responsible for part of the IFβ block to HIV-1 replication. Overexpression of TR22 in cells obstructed replication. Knockdown of TR22 in cells in the context of IF response abated the block to replication, implicating TR as an antiral effector. TR22 blocked release of HIV-1 G-only particles, and release was dependent on the R domain of TR22.

**Implications:** Our data disclose a pathway by which Type 1 interferons obstruct HIV replication. TR22 is a key mediator of this process, acting at least in part by inhibiting late stages of the viral cycle.

**Conclusions:** TR22 is a key mediator of Type 1 interferon-induced restriction of HIV replication, acting at least in part by inhibiting late stages of the viral cycle. TR22 is an antiral effector that blocks release of HIV-1 G-only particles and is dependent on the R domain of TR22.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Mutualism Maintenance in Fig-Pollinator Mutualism: A Novel Insights into the Role of Parasitic Wasps

**Research Question:** How do parasitic wasps contribute to the stability of the fig-poll mutualism, a classic example of obligate mutualism between fig trees (Ficus) and their host-specific wasps (Agonidae)?

**Methods:** We investigated the oviposition behavior of parasitic wasps in Ficus rubosa, a monoecious fig species, and found that offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit outside the sycon. We observed a gradient of parasitism risk towards the center of the sycon, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring.

**Findings:** Our results suggest that the resulting gradient in offspring viability likely contributes to selection on pollinators to avoid outerules, forcing wasps to focus on a subset of ovules, reducing galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors invoking plant defenses against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints on pollin that prevent oviposition in all ovules.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of mutualism maintenance in fig-poll mutualism, where parasitic wasps play a key role in stabilizing the relationship by favoring inner ovules oviposition. This challenges previous hypotheses that failed to explain stability in monoious Ficus species, suggesting that pollinators favor innerules for ovip due to variance in floral morphology and likelihood of externally ovipiting parasitic wasps.

**Conclusions:** Our findings indicate that parasitic was may contribute to mutualism stability by exerting selection pressure on foundresses to favor innerules. This study is the first to show pollin was gain fitness by selecting innerules for ovip due to reduced vulnerability to parasism. The provision of ovules with variance in profitability demonstrates the larger, sessile partner (tree) controls resources for the smaller, mobile partner (wasp).

**Title:** Dissecting the Genetic and Environmental Components of Plant Height in Setaria ital x viridis Recombinant Inbred Population

**Research Question:** How do genetic and environmental factors influence plant height in a Setaria ital x viridis recombinant inbred population, and what are the implications for plant architecture and biomass?

**Methods:** We conducted six controlled growth trials on a Setaria ital x viridis recombinant inbred line (RIL) population to investigate how plant height is influenced by developmental queues, water availability, and density. Non-destructive plant measurements enabled monitoring height throughout the life cycle in both field and controlled environments.

**Findings:** Plant height was reduced under water limitation and high planting density and affected by growth environment (field vs. chamber). Results support a model where height is a heritable, polygenic trait with major loci influencing height independent of environment. The contribution of loci influencing height dynamically changes throughout development and reduction observed in water environments is a consequence of delayed progression through genetic program establishing plant height in Setaria. In this population, alleles from weedy S. viridis parent increase height, while a number of small effect alleles from domesticated S. italica collectively increase height in later development.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest plant height is a functionally continuous process under strong genetic control but influenced by water and density. Combining field and environmental analysis, we dissected genetic and environmental components of height in Setaria. Genetic components determining height exhibit strong canalization, influenced by temporal and environmental factors. A chronological model of height may explain differences observed in parental lines grown in controlled versus field settings. Experiments in controlled environments may limit effects of alleles at positions 2 and 9 due to growth constraints.

**Conclusions:** We identified 37 QTL associated with height development in Setaria R population across 12 experiments varying water and density. Analysis suggests known Poaceae genes account for a fraction of loci. Organism growth is complex influenced by genetic and environmental in time-dependent manner. Understanding these interactions is crucial for understanding trait determination. Height is a critical component of plant architecture due to ease of measurement, heritability, and agronomic importance, making it an attractive topic for scientific inquiry over a century.

**Title:** Detection of West Nile-like Virus in Mosquitoes in the Brazilian Pantanal Wetlands: Implications for Zoonotic Arbovirus Circulation

**Research Question:** Does West Nile-like virus (WNV) circulate in the Brazilian Pantanal wetlands, and what are the implications for zoonotic arvirus circulation?

**Methods:** We collected 3,234 adult mosquitoes from 16 species in the Ncolând sub-region of the Pantanal between 2009-2010. Mosquito homogenates were assayed for infectious virus on C6/36 and Vero cell monolayers and tested for flaviral RNA by group-specific real-time RT-PCR.

**Findings:** One pool of 50 engorged female Aedes aegypti tested positive for NV by culture and NV RNA by real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5/1,000. Full genomic sequence exhibited 95% identity to the full genome available NV.

**Implications:** Our data confirm the circulation of NV in the Brazilian Pantanal, supporting previous serological evidence of flaviviruses in horses. The Pantanal's diverse wildlife and hematophagous arthropods favor zoon arvirus circulation, despite scarce data on arv vectors in the area.

**Conclusion:** The isolation of NV in mosquitoes attempting to feed on humans warrants further investigation by the Brazilian arv surveillance program and local physicians. The high prevalence of NV in Ae. aegypt, an efficient vector, and anthropophilic behavior, and susceptibility (infection rate 2.5/1,000) implicate this species in NV transmission.

**Title:** Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Single-Dose Ivermectin (MO) Compared to Two-Dose Ivermectin (IVM) in a Porcine Scabies Model

**Research Question:** Can single-doseverectin (MO) be an effective and safe alternative to two-dosevermectin (IVM) in treating scabies, a neglected infectious disease with emerging drug resistance?

**Methods:** Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive either MO (0.3 mg/kg once) or IV (0.2 mg twice) or no treatment in a porine scabies model. Efficacy was evaluated by mite count, clinical lesions, pritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S scieiG antibodies. Plasma pharmacokinetic profiles were determined.

**Findings:** At day 14 post-treatment, all MO-treated but two IV-treated were mite-free. MO efficacy was 100% and unchanged until study-end (47), compared to 62% (26-100) for IV, with one IV-treated remaining infected until 47. Clinical scabies, pritus, and anti-Siei antibodies disappeared in all MO-treated but 75% IV-treated. MO persisted 9 times longer than IV in plasma and skin, covering mite life cycle.

**Implications:** Single-dose MO was more effective than two-dose IV, supporting MO as a therapeutic approach for scabies.

**Conclusions:** This preclinical study demonstrates the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of single-dose MO compared to two-dose IV in a porine scabies model. Singleose MO was more effective in killing mites, reducing immune response, and inflammation than two-dose IV. MO persisted longer in plasma and skin, enabling long-lasting efficacy. These findings support the development of MO as an alternative for scabies treatment.

**Title:** Elucidating the Minimal Peptidoglycan Synthesis Machinery of Staphylococcus aureus: Implications for Antibiotic Resistance and Pathogenicity**

**Research Question:** What is the minimal composition of the peptoglycan (PG) synthesis machine in Staphlococcus aureus, a Gram-positive pathogen notorious for its antibiotic resistance and virulence?

**Methods:** We generated a mutant strain of S. aureus (MIN) by deleting seven of the nine genes encoding proteins with PG activity, resulting in a strain capable of PG synthesis catalyzed solely by the transpeptase PBP1 and bi-functional PBP2. We employed bioinformatics tools, including Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs), to scan the S. aureus genome for close and distantly related homologs of transpeidase and transglyase enzymes.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that S. aureus can synthesize PG using only two enzymes, PBP1 and P2, which perform transpeidation and transglyylation reactions. The mutant strain MIN, encoding only P1 and P2 as PG enzymes, was viable in rich and minimal medium. However, in vitro assays are insufficient to study the fitness of a pathogen like S. aureus. In clinically relevant environments, bacteria with minimal PG machinery became highly susceptible to cell-target antibiotics and displayed impaired virulence in Drosophila infection dependent on peptoglycan receptor PGRP-SA.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that most PG enzymes are redundant in vitro, but essential for pathogenic and antibiotic resistance in S. aureus. The minimal PG machine is important in environments other than in vitro, as expend enzymes play a role in resistance and virulence. This study identifies targets for the development of antibiotics inhibiting final stages of PG synthesis.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the plasticity of PG synthesis in S. aure, which can be catalyzed by just two enzymes, P1 and P2. Interactions between PG enzymes in Gram-positive organisms have been suggested, but not confirmed biochemically. Our results show that S. aure can grow and divide with only two active synthesizing enzymes, identifying the minimal PG machinery of S. aure.

**Title:** Elucidating the Iron Acquisition Pathways of Burkholderia pseudomallei: A Novel Ferritin-Dependent Pathway Contributes to Virulence in Melioidosis

**Research Question:** How does Burkholderia pseudalle acquire and utilize iron in its host environment, and what is the contribution of iron acquisition systems to its virulence in meloidosis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of iron acquisition systems in Burkholder pseudalle virulence using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We deleted the major siderophore malleactin (m) and pyochelin (p) gene clusters in strain 171b, revealing residual siderophore activity unrelated to known Burkholder siderophores. Deletion of the hem uptake loci hmu and hem showed that Hmu is required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin, and that Hem cannot complement H deficiency. Prolong incubation of h hem mutant in hemoglobin minimal medium yielded variants able to utilize hemoglobin and hemin, suggesting alternate pathways for utilization of these iron sources. Lacterrin utilization was dependent on mallein, not pyelin synthesis/uptake.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that Burkholder pseudalle employs a novel ferritin-iron pathway to sustain in vivo growth. The absence of mallein did not lead to upregulation of other siderores or iron-acquisition mechanisms, but rather, a shift to alternate pathways. Deletion of the hem loci h and hem showed that H is required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin, and that Hem cannot complement H deficiency. Prolong incubation of h mutant in hemoglobin minimal medium yielded variants able to utilize hemoglobin and hem, suggesting alternate pathways for utilization. Lacterr utilization was dependent on malle, not pyelin synthesis/ake. A pchmu h hem quadruple mutant used ferritin as an iron source and was lethal in acute murine meloid model.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that Burkholder pseudalle may employ a ferritin-iron pathway as a means to sustain in vivo. Given its ability to adapt to adverse host conditions, strain 708 may acquire iron in absence of mallein by upregulating production of other siderores or iron-acquisition mechanisms. Our study highlights the importance of investigating annotated but uncharacterized iron systems in Burk pseudalle biology and virulence.

**Conclusions:** Burkholder pseudalle, a saprophytic bacterium, can infect humans causing difficult-to-manage meloidosis with high mortality rates. Little is known about its iron acquisition and virulence. Our study reveals a novel ferritin-dependent pathway contributes to virulence in meloid, and suggests that absence of malle leads to shift to alternate pathways. These findings have implications for understanding Burk pseudalle biology and virulence, and highlight the need to investigate uncharacterized iron systems in this emerging pathogen.

**Title:** Consensus Metabolic Model Generation (COMM): A Semi-Automated Tool for Reconciling Inconsistencies in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models

**Research Question:** How can we improve the usability of genome-scale constraint metabolic models (GSMs) by reconciling inconsistencies between concurrent models and increasing their predictive power?

**Methods:** We present COMM, a tool for Consensus Metabolic Model Generation, which automatically identifies and resolves inconsistencies between two or more GSMs of the same organism, thereby consolidating knowledge of metabolic function.

**Findings:** Tests of COMM for four organisms showed that automatically generated consensus models were predictive and substantially increased coherence of representation. Our results demonstrated that automatically generated consensus models had higher predictive power than manually curated GSMs and were comparable to manually constructed models for yeast.

**Implications:** COMM is particularly useful for complex scenarios where manual curation does not scale, such as eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions.

**Conclusion:** Genome-scale constraint metabolic models are integrated knowledge repositories and predictive models. A consensus model should be more comprehensive than individual GSMs due to shared, unique, and accurate due to reconciliation of inconsistencies. COMM bridges the gap between automation and high-quality manual curation for consensus model generation.

**Abstract:**

Genome-scale constraint metabolic (GSM) models are integrated knowledge and predictive models. However, their usability is often hampered by inconsistencies, particularly for concurrent models. We present COMM, a tool for Consensus Metabolic Generation that reconciles two or more GSM of the same organism beyond common namespace. COMM automatically identifies similarities, dissimilarities, and complements of metabolic networks based on classification of problems arising during integration and novel algorithms to resolve. The identification of similar reactions in different compartments is challenging, but an extension could progress this by combining metabolite information prior to matching. COMM forms a bridge between automation and high-quality curation for consensus model generation.

Our results demonstrate that automatically generated consensus models have higher predictive power than manually curated GSM and comparable to manually constructed models for yeast. COMM increases coherence with biological system while maintaining predictive power. This balance is crucial for usability and reliability of GSM to elucidate cell interactions.

**Title:** Cartilage Proteoglycans Regulate Chondrocy Maturation and Perichond Development in Zebraf

**Research Question:** Do cartilage proteoglycans (PGs) regulate the interaction between chondrocytes and perichond, and if so, the timing of perichral bone development?

**Methods:** We used zebraf mutants to investigate the role of PGs in chondcy maturation and perichral development. A mutagenesis screen identified two genes, famb and xylosyltransferase1 (xt), which encode enzymes involved in PG synthesis. Mutants lacked wild-type levels of chroit sulfate PG, a key component of cartilage matrix, and formed perichral bone earlier than wild-type siblings.

**Findings:** Mutants exhibited decreased cartilage matrix and increased perichral bone. Ultrastructural analyses revealed aberrant matrix organization and cellular features of chrocy hypertrophy in mutants. Molecular and genetic studies showed that chcy Ih expression induced perichral bone prematurely in mutants. However, famb mutants formed perichral despite loss of HSP production in chcytes. Our data suggest that defective cartilage synthesis altered expression of transcription factors controlling chcy maturation, changing perichral timing.

**Implications:** These findings indicate that cartilage PGs regulate chcy maturation and perich development. Mutations in PG synthesis genes, such as fam and xt, lead to precocious chcy maturation and early perichral formation. Our results are consistent with the notion that these genes act directly in chcy to produce the cartilage phenotype, but indirectly cause elevated perichral.

**Conclusions:** Cartilage defects in fam and xt mutants accelerated chcy maturation and Ih expression, triggering early perichral bone formation. Our study highlights the critical role of PGs in regulating chcy maturation and perich development, with implications for understanding human diseases associated with these genes.

**Title:** Resolution of Heterochromatic Entanglements during Meiosis I in Drosophila melanogaster: A Role of Topoisomerase II

**Research Question:** How are heterochromatic entanglements resolved during meiosis I in Drosila melanogaster, and what is the role of Topoisomerase II in this process?

**Methods:** We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Topoisomerase II (Top) in Drosila female meiosis and analyzed the effects on heteroch region separation and chromosome segregation.

**Findings:** TopiRNA-express oocytes exhibited defects in heteroch region separation during prometaph I and metaphase, with heteroch regions stretching into long projections and centromeres localizing near tips. Bipolar spindles formed, but achmate chromosomes failed to move towards poles. Euchromatic regions, which separate earlier in prophase, were unaffected. Embryos from TopRNA-express females failed to initiate mitotic divisions.

**Implications:** Topois II is involved in resolving heteroch DNA entang during meiosis, and these entang must be resolved to complete meiosis. If heteroch regions remain locked, chromosomes cannot segregate to poles anaph I, and oocytes fail meiosis.

**Conclusions:** Our results support the idea that Top plays a crucial role in releasing bonds holding heteroch regions together during prophase. Even if heteroch regions separate anaph I, orientation homolog chromosomes towards same pole leads high chias and achmate missegregation. Our data indicate that Top is involved in resolving homous entang in Dila oocytes.

**Title:** Evaluation of Deltamethrin-impregnated Collars as a Public Health Measure to Prevent Canine Leishmaniasis (VL) in a Highly Endemic Area of Brazil

**Research Question:** Can the use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars in dogs be an effective as a public health measure to control and prevent visceral leishmanias (VL) in a highly endemic area of Brazil?

**Methods:** An interventional study was conducted in two areas in the district of Monteordo, Bahia, Brazil: an intervention area where seropositive dogs were collared, and a control area where conventional VL control measures were applied. Dogs were evaluated every 7-8 months for two years. At each point, in the intervention area, seronegative dogs received new collars and newly serop dogs were included. Local zoonosis control authorities were notified serop dogs in both areas, which were euthanized as mandated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

**Findings:** At baseline, seroprevalence was similar in both areas. At second evaluation, significant reductions in serrevalence were seen in both areas, with 6.0% in the intervention and 11.0 in the control. The relative risk (RR = 0.55) indicated protection against VL in the intervention. Although CV incidence did not differ, a tendency was observed in the control.

**Implications:** Although the effectiveness of deltam-impregnated collars as a community control measure was inconclusive, it likely provides protection over time. This strategy represents an operational challenge for zoon control authorities in endemic areas, indicating need for adjustments, including collar design.

**Conclusion:** This study evaluated the effectiveness of del-impregnated collars as a public health measure to prevent VL in a highly endemic area of Brazil, differing from previous reports due to inclusion of a control area and focus on canine population. The use of these collars in association with euthanas of seropitive dogs resulted in significant reduction of CV in an endemic municipality. However, the study was limited by diagnostic technique and lack of comparison with controls.

**Title:** Transcriptional Traffic on the X Chromosome: A Limiting Gene Expression and Shaping Gene Content

**Research Question:** What is the role of transcriptional traffic on the X chromosome in shaping gene expression and evolution?

**Methods:** We analyzed data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANT5) projects to investigate the relationship between transcriptional traffic and gene expression on the X chromosome.

**Findings:** Our results show that maximal expression of X-linked genes is lower than autosomal genes, with an average maximal expression three times lower on the X than autosomes. Autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than X-to-autosome retrogenes on autos. X-linked genes have lesser increase in expression than autosomal ones compared to the human-Chimpanzee ancestor, highly expressed but not lowly expressed. The traffic model explains the lower breadth of expression for genes on X and Z, with broad expression genes having high expression. Highly tissue-specific genes are rare on X, and broadly expressed genes on X tend to be lowly expressed, indicating that the trend is shaped by maximal expression not breadth.

**Implications:** The notion that it is hard for genes on the X to be highly expressed due to transcription traffic provides a simple yet robust rationale for many features of X's gene content, expression, and evolution.

**Conclusions:** The centrality of the limit on expression on X calls into question evidence for other models, such as the X-inactivation model. The X is not optimal for genes with high levels of expression due to transcription jams. The limitation is not great if transcription rate is not limiting. The X is a non-optimal environment for genes with high maximal levels of expression. The traffic model is a driving force for the evolution of gene content on X, stemming from the fact that X is haploid-expressed, limiting maximal expression.

**Title:** Investigating the Prevalence and Population Structure of Helicobacter pylori in Baka Pygmies, a Hunter-Gather Population in Cameroon

**Research Question:** What is the prevalence and population structure of Helicobacter pylori in Baka Pyies, a hunter-gather population in Cameroon, and how did they acquire this bacterium?

**Methods:** Gastric biopsies were obtained from 77 Baka Pyies from two geographically separated populations and 101 non-B individuals from neighboring agricultural populations and cultured for H. pyl. Multilocus haplotypes were generated for each H. pyl isolate by DNA sequencing.

**Findings:** Unexpectedly, Baka Pyies showed a significantly lower H. pyl infection rate (20.8%) than non-B (80.2%). Most isolates in the sample were assigned to hpAfrica or hp1. The hpAfrica, a marker for the expansion of the Nilo-Saharan family, was divided into East and West African subpopulations. A hp1, identified among Cameroonians, supports the eastern and western expansions of Bantu languages. Age-structured model shows the low H pyl prevalence among Baka is achievable within a few hundred years, suggesting demographic factors such as small size and low life expectancy can lead to eradication of pyl from human populations. Baka were either pyl-free or lost lineages during past fluctuations. Coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference show B almost certainly acquired extant pyl through contact with agricultural neighbors.

**Implications:** The findings suggest that Baka Pyies were either pyl-free or lost ancient lineages during demographic fluctuations, and acquired extant pyl through contact with agricultural neighbors. This has implications for understanding the evolution and transmission of pyl in human populations.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into the prevalence and population structure of pyl in B Pyies, a hunterather population in Cameroon, and how they acquired this bacterium. The findings suggest that demographic factors such as small population size and low life expectancy can lead to eradication of pyl from human populations, and that B Py acquired pyl through contact with agricultural neighbors. This has implications for understanding the evolution and transmission of pyl in human populations.

**Title:** Structural and Functional Analysis of the C-terminal Region of Dengue Virus NS5 Reveals Evolutionarily Conserved Motif for Nuclear Localization and Replication**

**Research Question:** What is the role of the C-terminal region of Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 5 (NS5) in determining its subcellular localization and replication, and how does it interact with host proteins to modulate immune responses?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of functional and structural analyses to examine the C-terminal region of NS5 from DENV1 and D2, which exhibit prominent differences in nuclear localization. Extensive gene swapping identified the C-terminal 18 (C18) residues as sufficient to direct the protein to cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively. We purified and visualized the complex between NS C18 and nuclear receptor importin-alpha (Imp) at 2.2 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography. Structure-guided mutational analysis of GFP-NS clones D1 and D2 and a D2 infectious clone revealed important residues for NS subcell localization.

**Findings:** The C-terminal of DENV NS forms a low-mic affinity complex with Imp, which is conserved in all flaviviruses. Mutating Pro884 to Thr, present in D1 NS, results in mislocalization of NS to cytoplasm without compromising virus fitness. In contrast, mutating R to alanine at position 888, conserved in all flaviruses, results in non-viable virus, while R888 mutation leads to severely attenuated phenotype. Our data suggest an evolutionarily conserved function for C18, possibly in RNA interactions critical for replication, independent of its role in subcell localization.

**Implications:** The cytoplasmic location of D2 NS makes it valuable to explore non-replication functions of NS in modulation of innate response and host interactions contributing to deng pathogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that directing subcell localization of DENV NS occurs within residues 883-900. Although NS from four serotypes D are similar, varying degrees of nuclear transport using host machinery import-alpha and beta-1. Phenotyp differences can be ascribed to adaptive changes during evolution, essential role in pathogenesis contentious.

**Conclusions:** We identified a motif within C of NS from D1 and possibly other flaviruses as determinant for differential subcell localization and distribution. Importantly, a single amino acid change in D2 clone results in altered phenotype. Our data suggest C of D and 3 interact with import to target to nucleus, while C of D1 may bind other factors and mostly in cytoplasm. The C region, located in thumb domain, may initiate de novo synthesis.

**Title:** Developing an Integrated Mapping Protocol for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs): The Integrated Threshold Mapping (IT) Methodology for Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), Trachoma, Schistosomiasis, and Soil-Transmitted Helminths (STH)

**Research Question:** Can an integrated mapping protocol for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) be developed to determine the threshold for public health interventions, balancing epidemiologic rigor and practicality?

**Methods:** We developed and field-tested the Integrated Mapping (IT) Methodology for LF, trach, schosiasis, and STH. The protocol is designed to be resource-efficient, using World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators in disease-specific age groups. For each disease, the sampling frame was district, but for schosias, the sub-district rather than ecological zone was used. We tested the protocol by comparing it to current WHO methodologies for each disease in one district in Mali and Senegal.

**Findings:** The IT methodology reached the same conclusions as WHO regarding initiation of public interventions for trach, LF, and STH, but resulted in more targeted recommendations for schias. IT was practical, feasible, and demonstrated overall cost savings compared to standard, non-integrated WHO methodologies.

**Implications:** This integrated tool can facilitate implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries.

**Conclusion:** This study presents a novel integrated protocol to determine thresholds for public health interventions. The approach is logistically practical, cost-efficient, and flexible. For schias, our approach results in more targeted MDAs with district implementation currently by integrated NTD programs. The protocol uses age-specific indicators as recommended by WHO. This paper describes a methodology for integrated mapping LF, trach, schias, and STH. Our methodology does not provide prevalence, its purpose is to determine if disease has reached threshold for public intervention by balancing epidemiologic rigor and practicality.

**Title:** Conserved Phosphatase Cdc14 Release from Nucleolar Chromatin Requires Ubiquitination of Histone H2 and Histone Modifications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

**Research Question:** How do histone modifications regulate the release of conserved phosphatase C14 from nucleolar chromatin during mitotic exit in Saccharomy cerevisiae?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of histone modifications in the release of C14 from nucleolar chrom during anaphase in the absence of the mitotic exit network (MEN) using genetic and biochemical approaches. We analyzed the interactions between histone ubiquitination, histone methylation, and histone deacetylation in this process.

**Findings:** We found that ubiquitination of histone H2 by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase is required for the release of C14 from nucleolar chrom when MEN is inactivated. This function is mediated by activation of histone H methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (H3K4 and H3K79), but not by histone deetylase (HD) Sir2, which associates with C14 on nucle chrom as part of the RENT complex. Additionally, we observed defects in C14 release in cells lacking H3 lysine methylation (H3K36) and cells lacking HD recruited by this modification. These histone modifications represent unappreciated factors for accessibility and/or action of FEAR components on nucleolar chrom.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a novel role for histone ubiquination in the early phase of mitotic exit, contrasting the notion of a highly combinatorial code of histone marks controlling biological processes. The conserved role of histone modifications in yeast and mammals suggests a conserved function in controlling localization of C14.

**Conclusions:** Histone modifications play a crucial role in regulating the release of conserved phosphatase C14 from nucleolar chrom during mitotic exit in Sacomy cerevisiae. Ubiquination of histone H2 by Bre1 and histone methylation of H3 on lysines 4 and 79 are required for C14 release, while hist deacetylation by Sir2 is not involved. H3 lysine methylation also plays a role in this process. These findings highlight the importance of histone modifications in regulating mitotic exit and suggest a conserved function in yeast and mammals.

**Title:** GeneProgram: A Novel Unsupervised Framework for Identifying Co-expressed Gene Programs in Human Expression Compendia

**Research Question:** The identification of co-expressed gene sets orchestrating normal or pathological processes is a crucial in computational biology, yet challenging due to cellular heterogeneity within samples, genetic variation across samples, uncertainty in number of programs and populations, and temporal behavior.

**Methods:** We developed GeneProgram, a novel unsupervised framework based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, addressing these challenges. Gene uses expression data to organize tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent behavior, producing maps of programs sorted by generality scores that exploit automatically learned groupings.

**Findings:** Using synthetic and real expression data, Gene outperformed popular analysis methods. We applied Gene to a compend of 62 time-series expression datasets, exploring human responses to infectious and immune-modulating molecules. Gene produced a map of 104 programs, many significantly enriched for genes in key pathways and bound by NF-κ transcription factors. Gene discovered programs implicating surprising signaling pathways, including Wnt and neurotransmitter receptors.

**Implications:** The map of programs in response to infection will guide future experiments; genes with low generality may serve as targets for minimal cross-talk, while high gener programs maintain common responses in disease states. Our method is multipurpose, applicable to novel compia biological data.

**Conclusion:** Gene is a general for analyzing expression compend, and maps discovered programs will be useful for guiding biological experiments.

**Title:** Epigenetic Imprinting of the IFNG Locus as a Hallmark of Adaptive Features in Human NK Cells

**Research Question:** What molecular mechanisms underlie the adaptive properties of NK cells in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the epigenetic regulation of the IFNG locus in NKGChi NK cells expanded in human CMV seropositive individuals.

**Findings:** We found that NKGChi NK cells underwent epigen remodeling of the IF conserved non-coding sequence (CNS) 1, similar to memory CD8+ T cells and TH1 cells. The accessibility of CNS was required for IF-γ transcriptional activity in response to NKG2 and 4 engagement, leading to consistent IF- production in NKGChi NK cells.

**Implications:** Epigenetic imprinting of the IF locus is a hallmark and crucial mechanism driving stable IF- expression in CMV-specific NK expansions, providing a molecular basis for regulation of adaptive features in innate cells.

**Conclusion:** Our study demonstrates that epigen remodeling of the CNS region in IF locus is a hallmark of NChi NK cells in CM+ individuals as well as cytok-primed NK cells, previously described as memory-like cells, sharing an open configuration with TH cells. Epigen regulation of IF locus contributes to high competence and stability in NK cells displaying memory-like properties. Our findings strengthen the idea that epigen features are functional hallmarks of memory NK and T cells.

**Title:** Temporal Regulation of Bacterial Effectors by Metaeffectors: A Novel Mechanism of Co-evolution between Eukaryotic Cells and Legionella pneumophila

**Research Question:** How do bacterial effectors regulate the function of other effectors within host cells during infection, and what is the role of metaeffectors in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of Legionella pneumila effector LubX, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that hijacks the host proteasome to target bacterial effector SidH for degradation. We analyzed the temporal regulation of Sid by Lub and its impact on host cell processes during infection.

**Findings:** Delayed delivery of Lub to the cytoplasm leads to shutdown of Sid within host cells at later stages of infection. This demonstrates a sophisticated level of coevolution between eukotic cells and L pneumila involving an effector that regulates cognate effector function temporally. We propose the designation "metaeffector" for this class of bacterial effectors.

**Implications:** Temporal regulation of Sid by Lub and the host proteasome illustrates a novel mechanism by which effectors are regulated. The determinants of susceptibility are encoded in effectors themselves. Lub acts as a negative regulator of Sid within host cells, the first example of effector that targets cognate eff within host. The targets of bacterial E ligases are largely unknown, and previous studies aimed to identify host proteins. Sid is the first target of bacterial E ligase effector.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of coevolution between eukotic cells and L pneumila involving effector that regulates cognate eff function temporally. We propose the designation "metaeffector" for this class of effect. The role of Lub at late stages of infection suggests multiple targets within host, including Sid and host kinase Cl1. Accumulating evidence suggests effect proteins functioning as E ubiquitin ligase are prevalent among plant and bacterial pathogens. Future studies will reveal some effectors implicated in manipulation of ubiquitin system possess functions as metaeff that coordinate effector expression spatiempor.

**Title:** Investigating the Pattern of Diversification of HIV-1 in Newly Infected Individuals: Insights into Host-Pathogen Interactions and Immune Responses

**Research Question:** How does the HIV-1 virus diversify in newly infected individuals, and what role do host immune responses play in shaping its evolution?

**Methods:** We analyzed 81 early HIV-1 env sequences from individuals with single (n=78) or closely related (n=3) viruses, allowing accurate estimation of the infecting virus sequence and direction of substitutions and insertions/deletions. We integrated data from multiple acutely infected hosts to identify adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env and rapidly diversifying codons.

**Findings:** We found evidence of adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env and identified 24 rapidly diversifying codons, 14 of which were embedded in CTL epitopes or APOB-mediated G-to-A substitutions, suggesting CTL and APOEC facilitate early escape. Ten diversifying sites could not be explained by CTL or APOEC mutation, including the most mutated site in gp41 fusion peptide. Insertions and deletions in hyperviable regions of envelope glycoprotein were due to selection, not mutational hotspots.

**Implications:** Our study provides a detailed view of HIV-1 diversification following transmission, highlighting the role of CTL and APOEC in shaping evolution during new infections.

**Conclusions:**

1. HIV-1 diversifies rapidly in newly infected individuals, with evidence of adaptive evolution in env.
2. Rapidly diversifying codons are often embedded in CTL epitopes or APO-mediated substitutions, suggesting CTL and APO facilitate early escape.
3. CTL and APO play a significant role in shaping HIV evolution during new infections.
4. Insertions deletions in hyperviable regions are due to selection, not mutational hotspots.
5. Our study provides insights into host-pathogen interactions and immune responses in early HIV-1 infection.

**Title:** Modeling Epigenetic Silencing in Budding Yeast: Unveiling the Role of Chromatin Marks and Protein Interactions

**Research Question:** How do chromatin marks and protein interactions contribute to the bistability of epigenetic states in budding yeast?

**Methods:** We developed a minimal model of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast based on known biomolecular interactions, incorporating two key chromatin marks: H4 acetylation and H3 methylation. We explored whether the presence of multiple marks leads to qualitatively different behavior.

**Findings:** Our model reveals that both modifications are essential for the robustness of epigen silencing. Besides silenced and transcriptionally active chromatin, it leads to a novel bivalent state (both active and silencing marks) under perturbations (knock mutations, inhibition of enzymatic activity). The bivalent state appears under perturbations is shown to result in patch silencing. We also show titration effect, due to limited supply of silencing proteins can result in counterintuitive responses.

**Implications:** The design of the silencing system is systematically investigated and experimental observations are assessed within a theoretical framework. Specifically, we discuss behavior of protein recruitment, spreading of silenced regions in commonly-stud mutants (e.g., s2,1) illuminating the controversial role of Dot in the biology of silencing.

**Conclusions:** Our model captures distinct mechanisms of cooperativity at molecular level in budding silencing: (a) cooperativity in histone states, (b) interactions of proteins in chrom-bound complex. Both mechanisms have been proposed by groups, sometimes mutually-exclusive. Active sites budding chrom are not only acetylated particular histone sites but also hypermethyl certain residues. We show stable bivalent states emerge naturally modeling interactions. The model can be extended to other silencing and active marks, informing which are essential resolving epigen fate and reinforcing one over another.

**Key findings:**

* Both H4 acetylation and H methylation are essential for robust epigen silencing
* Bivalent chromatin states emerge under perturbations, resulting in patch silencing
* Titration effect due limited silencing proteins leads counterintuitive responses
* Model captures cooperativity histone states and protein interactions in budding silencing

**Future directions:** The model can be extended to other silencing and active marks, informing which are essential resolving epigen fate and reinforcing one another.

**Title:** Gut Microbiota Composition in Severe Acute Malnutrition: A Comparative Analysis of Oedemat and Non-oemat Forms in Ugandan Children

**Research Question:** Does the gut microbiota composition differ between Ugandan children suffering from oedemat and non-oemat severe acute malnutrition?

**Methods:** This observational study recruited 87 children aged 6-24 months hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Uganda. Fecal samples were collected at admission, and total genomic DNA extracted. Denaturing Gradient Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA-targeted high-throughput amplicon sequencing were performed to determine alpha and beta diversity. ANOVA and relative abundance tests were used to compare groups.

**Findings:** Oemat children (62%) had lower alpha diversity than non-oemat children (p=0.036), but beta diversity did not differ between groups (ANOSA, weighted UniFrac R=-0.008, p=0.584; unweighted UniF R=0.071, p=0.011).

**Implications:** Non-oemat SAM children have lower gut microbiota diversity than oemat SAM, but compositional differences were not identified.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to the understanding of gut microbiota's role in severe malnutrition, highlighting the need for further research on therapeutic strategies.

**Title:** Investigating Telomere Length Variation in Saccharomy sensu stricto: A Complex Trait Controlled by Multiple Loci**

**Research Question:** What is the extent of telomere length variation among wild-type Saccharomy sensu stricto isolates, and what are the genetic factors controlling this variation?

**Methods:** We screened 112 wild-type Sacchar sensu stricto isolates and found extensive telomere length variation in S paradox isolates, which correlated with their geographic origin. European strains had short telomeres (<150 bp), while American isolates had telom approximately three times longer (>400 bp). Insertion of URA gene near telomeres allowed analysis of individual telom lengths and telomere effect (TPE). Crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telere lengths consistent with multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) involvement.

**Findings:** Variation in TPE is quantitative but weakly correlated with telere length. Genotyping F1 segregants indicated several QTLs associated with telere length and silencing variation, including candidate genes and regions without known telom properties. Transgressive segregation was detected for both phenotypes, validated by reciprocal hemizosity that YU80 and TLC are telere QTL in two S paradox subpopulations. Sequence divergence within Kuod generates negative epistasis in allelic combinations (American-YU and EuropeanYU) resulting in short telomeres.

**Implications:** Telom length is a complex trait controlled by multiple loci, consistent with previous reports in S cerevisiae. Our study reveals extensive variation in S paradox, with three-fold difference between European and American subpopulations. Insertion of URA near telom allowed analysis of individual telom lengths and telere effect, indicating multiple QTL involvement. Genotyping F segregants showed several QTL associated with telere length and silencing, including candidate genes and regions without known telom properties. Transgressive segregation and reciprocal hemizosity validated YU and TLC as telere QTL in two paradox subpop.

**Conclusions:** Telom length is a complex trait controlled by multiple loci, consistent with previous reports in S cerevis. Our study reveals extensive variation in paradox, with three-fold difference between European and American subpop. Insertion of U near telom allowed analysis of individual tel lengths telere, indicating multiple Q involvement. Genotyping segregants showed several Q associated with telere and silencing, including candidate and regions without tel properties.

**Title:** Unveiling the Hidden Dynamics of Human Decision-Making: A Sequential Sampling Models Revisited

**Research Question:** Can sequential sampling models (SSMs) accurately predict not only when, but also how people make decisions, particularly when they are allowed to sample information sequentially?

**Methods:** We employed electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to investigate decision-making in a paradigm where participants rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues and were free to respond at any time. We developed several SS models predicting response times (RTs) and compared their performance to standard SS implementations.

**Findings:** Standard SS failed to adequately describe RT distributions, but adding a mechanism for postponing decisions to the model obtained an accurate fit to data. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-band (14-30 Hz), indicating responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited, supporting the existence of a decision to not decide. The extended model accounted for results of an adapted paradigm where participants pressed a button for more information.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate computational modeling of decisions and RTs supports a deeper understanding of hidden dynamics in cognition. The assumption of a time-consuming process implies decisions are delayed until a threshold is reached, but explicit not deciding is not typically considered by SS. Our findings suggest that people actively terminate the process to wait for more information in this task.

**Conclusions:** We propose that factors like number of cues and its variability, and presentation time cues and its influence how long people postpone the process. This study contributes to the understanding of sequential decision-making, particularly in the field of neuroscience, where methods like fMRI and EEG require well-controlled presentations. Accurate modeling of mechanisms in choice is highly desirable.

**Title:** Identification of the Causative Variant for Hereditary Nasalakerosis (HN) in Labrador Retrievers: A Genome-Wide Association Study and Histopathological Analysis

**Research Question:** What is the genetic basis of hereditary nasalakerosis (HN) in Labrador Retrievers, a monogenic autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 13 HN cases and 23 controls, identifying a strong association signal on chromosome 2 (p=4.4×10-14). Haplotype analysis defined a critical interval of 1.6 Mb with 25 genes. Resequenced the genome of one case at 38 coverage, detecting 3 nonsynonymous variants in the interval. Genotyped these variants in larger cohorts, only one was associated with HN phenotype in over 500 dogs.

**Findings:** The candidate causative variant is a missense in SUVH2, encoding histone lysine 9 (HK) methyltransfer, mediating chromatin silencing. The c.972G>T variant predicts a conserved asparagine to lysine in catalytically active domain (p.NK). Histopathological analysis in vivo suggests HN is not caused by hyperproliferation, but delayed differentiation of kerocytes.

**Implications:** Our data provide evidence SUVH involved in epigenetic regulation of kerocyte differentiation, ensuring stratification and sealing of mammalian epidermis.

**Conclusion:** Hereditary nasalakerosis (HN) in Labrador Retrievers is caused by a missense variant in SUVH, a histone lysine 9 (HK) methyltransfer, mediating chromatin silencing. This defect leads to delayed differentiation of kerocytes, not hyperproliferation, resulting in crusts and fissures on the nasalum. Our study highlights the importance of SUVH in epigenetic regulation of kerocyte differentiation and stratification in mammalian epidermis.

**Title:** Genetic Reassortment of Influenza Viruses in Swine: A Potential "Mixing Vessel" for Pandemic Strains

**Research Question:** How do genetic reassortments between avian and mammalian influenza viruses occur in swine, and what factors contribute to the emergence of transmissible reassortants?

**Methods:** We conducted a genomic analysis of 571 isolates from nasal wash and respiratory tissues of co-housed pigs infected with avian H1N1 and swine H3 IAV, identifying 30 distinct genotypes of reassortant viruses. Viruses from lower respiratory tissues showed largest diversity, while those from turbinate and nasal fluids had least. Reassants from lower tracts had largest growth kinetics in respiratory epithelial cells, and temperature in sw nasal cells selected type reassant shed.

**Findings:** Reassort in nasal samples consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower tracts, and was efficiently transmitted between pigs. Tissue tropism played a key role in selecting transmissible reassant.

**Implications:** Swine may serve as intermediate host generating and transmitting reassant viruses containing avian and sw genes to domestic and humans. Our study illustrates transmissible reassants arise between av and sw IAV in pigs, occurring in lower tracts, and tissue tropism selecting reassant shed.

**Conclusions:** By housing I-sergative pigs with H3 I–infected and av H I–inf, we demonstrated 1) many reassants generated in lower tracts, but few shed; 2) tissue, especially replication in sw nasal cells at 33°C, selecting reassant shed. Gene compatibility is subtype and strain-dependent, but transmissible derived from av and mammalian I. Our study found 30 of 254 reassant genotypes between av H and sw, most in middle and lower tracts, only 2 genotypes reassants in vivo and in vitro suggested timing, dose, and inoculation contribute to reassment efficiency. We mimicked natural scenario by housing I-serative with sw H I–inf and av Iinf pigs to test hypothesis tropism bottleneck for reassment and selecting viruses shed. Viral analyses of av, sw, and representative reassant in sw nasal epithelium, tracheal, and alveolar epithelial cells at 33, 37, and 39°C showed tropism influenced reassant growth.

**Title:** Effects of Praziquantel Treatment of Schistosoma mansoni during Pregnancy on Schistosomiasis Infection and Immune Responsiveness among Offspring at Five Years: A Randomized Controlled Trial

**Research Question:** Does piquantel treatment of Schistoma mansoni during pregnancy influence the prevalence and immune responsiveness to Schistoma infection among offspring at five years?

**Methods:** In a randomized controlled trial (ISRCT32847), 134 children of mothers treated with piquel or placebo during pregnancy were examined for Schoma infection and cytokine and antibody responses to SWA and SEA, as well as T cell expression of FoxP at five years.

**Findings:** Prevalence of Schoma infection did not differ between children of treated or untreated mothers. Cytokine (IFγ, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13) and antibody (Ig, Ig and IgE) responses to SW and SEA, and FoxP expression were higher among infected than uninfected children. Piquel treatment of Schoma during pregnancy had no effect on immune responses, except IL-10 to SW, which was higher in offspring of women who received piquel during pregnancy than those who did.

**Implications:** We found no evidence that maternal Schoma infection and treatment during pregnancy influence prevalence and intensity Sch infection or immune response among offspring at five, but observed effects on IL-10 to SW suggest maternal Schoma and treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoreg responsiveness in childhood schosiasis. This has implications for pathogenesis the disease.

**Conclusion:** This study examined the effects of Schoma infection and piquel treatment during pregnancy on Sch infection and immune among offspring at five, an age by which children are expected to have first exposure to Sch through water. We found no conclusive evidence of effect maternal schiasis, or its treatment pregnancy on susceptibility. However, observed effects on IL-10 to SW suggest maternal Schoma and treatment during pregnancy may influence immunoreg in childhood schias. Further study is needed to elucidate magnitude and implications in childhood schias.

**Title:** Reprogramming of Macrophage Endocytic Machinery from Phagocytosis to Macinocytosis: A Novel Mechanism for Efficient Clearance of Infectious Pathogens

**Research Question:** How is macrophage activation coupled to increased clearance of infectious pathogens, and what are the underlying mechanisms involved in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the reprogramming of macrophage endocytic machinery from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macinocytosis, enabling rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner.

**Findings:** Inflammatory stimuli reprogrammed the macrophage endytic pathway from phagocyt to macinocyt, allowing macrophages to internalize large amounts of cargo for direct transfer to lysosomes. We identified serine phosphorylation of macroph protein coronin 1 as the molecular switch that reprograms macroph from phagytic mode to macinocytic uptake. Expression of phosphomim coronin 1 induced PI-3-kinase activity and macinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli.

**Implications:** Our results reveal a hitherto unknown mechanism regulating internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation. Phosphorylation of coronin 1 is sufficient to redirect phagoc cargo via macinocytosis to lysosomes, even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli.

**Conclusions:** Macroph activation is coupled to increased clearance of infectious pathogens through reprogramming of endytic machinery from phoc to macinocyt. Phosphorylation of coronin 1 is the key switch from phag to macin uptake upon macroage activation. This mechanism provides a novel strategy for host defense against pathogens, enabling efficient clearance of large amounts of extracellular material and avoiding inflammatory responses.

**Research Question:** What are the perceptions and acceptance of tset baits among communities in the West Nile region of Uganda, particularly in areas where tset control has not been previously conducted?

**Methods:** We conducted 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in 8 villages across Arua District, West Nile, Uganda. Discussions were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis to compare views and identify salient themes.

**Findings:** Despite being less than 10 km apart, communities perceived tset ba differently. Villagers who had never seen traps before expressed fear and anxiety, associating them with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river" linked to physical illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers in areas where traps had been used had positive attitudes and were aware of their purpose and benefits. The latter reported similar negative perceptions when tset control started a decade ago. Our results suggest acceptance varies between villages and is related to duration with tset programs.

**Implications:** The success of community-based interventions against tset will depend on early engagement with communities and sensitization campaigns, especially in areas new to interventions.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of community acceptance in tset control efforts. In contrast, negative attitudes in DRC led to damage, theft, and vandalism, and operational failure [25-27]. Community participation is crucial for success [19-24]. Three years before this study, 70 traps were deployed per parish, but not monitored, resulting in unsustainable tset control. Deployment enabled communities to familiarize themselves with traps.

**Background:** Sleeping sickness (African trypanosomias or HAT) is a disease restricted to Africa, caused by Trypanosoma brucei transmitted tse. b. gambense causes chronic form in West and Central Africa, including study area. Tse vectors other species Trypanosoma path to livestock, estimated losses $4. In H− villages, no tset control, exposure introduced as part study. 8 villages included, 4 H+ and 4 H−.

**Title:** High-Resolution Characterization of Recombination in Drosophila melanogaster Reveals Extensive Variation in Recombination Rates and Landscapes

**Research Question:** How does recombination impact the effectiveness of natural selection in populations, and what are the implications of recombination variation across genomes within species?

**Methods:** We investigated recombination in D. melanogaster by genotyping 139 million SNPs and mapping 106,964 recombination events at 2-kb resolution, generating whole-genome CO and GC maps, and describing variation in recombination among individuals.

**Findings:**

* Recombination rates exhibit extreme and punctuated variation along chromosomes, with hotspots and coldspots.
* GC rates are uniformly distributed across the genome, detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO.
* Recombination events are associated with sequence motifs, occurring within transcript regions, suggesting chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks.
* Intra-specific variation in recombination landscapes is associated with hotspots at low frequency in sample.

**Implications:**

* Our study underscores the potential for selection to act on recombination modifiers and alter recombination landscapes across genomes.
* Variance in recombination among crosses is mostly associated with hotspots low in sample.
* Detailed characterization of re variation is necessary for accurate estimates of recombination rates and population models of selection and linkage.

**Conclusions:**

Our study provides the first high-resolution picture of recombination in D. melanaster, distinguishing CO and GC, two meiotic repair outcomes. We describe recombination variation across the genome at 100-kb, and whole-genome maps at 250b. Our results have implications for understanding recombination's role in shaping genetic variation, adaptation, and evolution.

**Title:** Elucidating the Function of ID2 in the RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) Machinery in Arabidopsis thaliana

**Research Question:** How does ID2, a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (Rd) machinery in Arabidopsis thalian, function in Rd?

**Methods:** We employed affinity purification of ID2 and co-purified two ID2 paralogs, ID1 and ID2 (ID2 PAROG1 and 2). The coiled domain between XS and X domains of ID2 is essential for ID homodimerization, whereas ID2-terminal X domain, not coiled domain, is required for ID interaction with ID1 and ID2. We introduced wild-type ID2 and mutated derivatives into the id2 mutant for complementation testing, demonstrating the previously uncharacterized ID2 X domain is required for ID-ID1/ID2 formation and function.

**Findings:** ID1 is required for de novo methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional silencing, whereas ID2 has partially overlapping roles with ID. Unlike ID2, ID1 and ID2 are incapable of binding double-stranded RNA, suggesting roles of ID1 and ID2 differ from ID2 in ID-ID/ID complex, and ID1 ID2 are essential for functioning Rd.

**Implications:** Our study reveals ID2 associates with ID paralogs ID1 and ID2 in ID protein family, named ID PAR1 and ID2. ID1 is required for siRNA accumulation, de novo methylation, and transcriptional silencing, whereas ID2 has partially overlapping roles with ID. ID2 coiled domain is essential for homodimer ID2 itself but not required ID association ID1 ID2.

**Conclusions:** ID2 is a member of protein family containing eight ID-like proteins in Arabid. ID2 similar to SUPPRESSOR GENE SILENC3 (SGS), important in post-transcription silencing pathways. ID2 and SG contain zinc, XS, coiled domains. XS required ID2 and SG bind 5 overhanging double-stranded RNA. ID coiled domain may help ID form homimer itself or heterimer other ID family Arabid. X domain highly conserved ID family not SG, indicating X may be required functional specificity ID protein. Our study characterized ID-ID/ID complex required Rd pathway. ID and ID belong subfamily ID2 homologs ATG50 AT80. ID interacts via coiled domain, interacts ID1 ID via X domain. Unlike ID, ID ID incapable double-stranded RNA. Mutations caused mutated ID transgenes fail complement DNA methylation id canonical Rd target AtSN.

**Title:** Investigating the Interaction between Neutrophils and Leishmania braziliensis: Activation, Apoptosis, and Inflammatory Response

**Research Question:** How do neutrophils respond to Leishmania braziliensis infection, and what are the implications for parasite elimination?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between neutrophils and L. braziliensis using in vitro and in vivo models, focusing on activation, apoptosis, and inflammatory response.

**Findings:**

* Neutrophils are recruited to the site of L. braziliensis inoculation in vivo, peaking at 24 hours post-inoculation.
* In vitro, exposure of inflammatory bone marrow neutils to L. braziliensis modulated the expression of surface molecules CD18 and CD62, induced oxidative burst, and release of TNF-α and neutilase.
* Neutils infected with L. brazili displayed markers of early apoptosis.
* Co-culture of infected macrophages and neutils did not modulate parasite load, suggesting species-specific effects on neutil apoptosis.
* Neutroph activation was confirmed by release of inflammatory mediators, which may impact parasite elimination, particularly at early stages of infection.

**Implications:**

* L. brazili induces neutroph recruitment in vivo, and neutils exposed to the parasite in vitro respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators.
* This outcome may impact parasite elimination, particularly at early stages of infection.
* Differences in Leish species may induce distinct outcomes regarding neutil apoptosis and downstream effects.

**Conclusion:**

This study elucidates the interaction between neutils and L. brazili, highlighting activation, apoptosis, and inflammatory response. Neutils are recruited to the site of L. brazili inoculation and respond to the parasite through activation and release of inflammatory mediators, which may impact parasite elimination, particularly at early stages of infection.

**Title:** Exploring the Feasibility of Vaccination for Bovine Tuberculosis (TB) Control in Cattle using Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmet-Gérin (BCG) and Differentiated Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIV) Tests

**Research Question:** Can the use of Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmet-Gin (BCG) vaccination in combination with Differentiated Infected from Vaccinated (DIV) tests improve the control of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, and is it economically viable within the current EU regulations?

**Methods:** We used within-herd transmission models from historical data from Great Britain (GB) to explore the feasibility of supplemental use of BCG vaccination. We estimated the economic impact of bovine tuberculosis on farmers, dominated by costs associated with testing and restrictions on animal movements.

**Findings:** The specificity of the DIV test, rather than sensitivity, is the greatest barrier to herd benefit of vaccination under intensive testing in GB. The potential negative effects of vaccination could be mitigated through relaxation of testing, but may increase hidden burden of infection in officially TB-free herds. We estimated that a DIV specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity >40% is required to see a protective benefit of vaccination with no increase in risk of infection. Data from experimentally infected animals suggest this target could be achieved using a cocktail of DIV antigens while maintaining sensitivity of 73.3% (95% CI: 61.9, 82.9) relative to post-mortem detection.

**Implications:** The use of BCG vaccination in combination with DIV testing offers potential to introduce vaccination within existing eradication programs. The benefits of vaccination must outweigh the increase in testing associated with efficiency of DIV testing for it to be economically viable within EU regulations.

**Conclusions:** Our models explore the range of DIV characteristics necessary to see a protective level of vaccination. We estimate that a DIV specificity of at least 99.85 and sensitivity >40 is required to see a benefit of vaccination with no increase in risk of infection. Data from experimentally infected animals suggest this target could be achieved using a cocktail of DIV antigens while maintaining sensitivity of 73.3 (95% CI 61.9, 82.9) relative post-mortem detection.

**Title:** Identification of Dihydrobenoxazepones as a Novel Anthelmintic Class against Trichis Parasites: A Promising Leads for Neglected Disease Treatment

**Research Question:** Can we identify novel small molecule compounds with anthelmint activity against Trichis, a parasitic worm infecting over 500 million people worldwide, and develop a new treatment for this neglected disease?

**Methods:** We screened a library of 480 drug-like small molecules for paralysis of ex vivo adult Tris using Tris mur, an established model for T. trichi, and identified a class of dihydroben[e][1,4]oxepin-2(3)one compounds with anthint activity. We further screened structurally related compounds and resynthesized the most potent molecules, leading to the identification of 20 dihydrobenoxazepones, a class not previously implicated in nematode control.

**Findings:** Dihydrobenazepones immobilized adult Tris with EC50 values around 25-50μM, comparable to existing anthelmint levamis, and showed low cytotoxicity against murine epithelial cells, demonstrating selectivity for the parasite. Notably, dihydroazepone O029 reduced the ability of embryated Tris eggs to establish infection in mouse in vivo, complementing the development of dihydroazepines as an anthint.

**Implications:** Dhydroazepines are a new class of anthint active against both egg and adult stages of Tris, demonstrating selectivity and considerable scope for optimisation to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties for clinical development.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies dihydroepines as a novel anthint class specifically active against Tris, a significant step towards developing a new treatment for neglected disease. The dihydroepines show potential as an alternative therapeutic strategy acting in the environment, via spray, interrupting the parasite lifecycle. Further optimisation is needed to improve potency and pharmacetic properties for clinical development.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Date-Party Dichotomy in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks: A Critical Examination of the Relationship between Hub Function and Co-expression

**Research Question:** Does the distinction between date and party hubs in protein-protein interaction networks hold up to scrutiny, and is there a correlation between hub function and co-expression?

**Methods:** We re-examined the date-party dichotomy in protein-protein interaction networks using various data sets and methods to investigate the relationship between hub function and co-expression.

**Findings:** Our analysis reveals that the importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of extremely central hubs, which do not display low co-expression, undermining the idea of a link between quantity and function. The bimodal distribution of hub co-expression is not robust to methodological changes, and topological properties do not correlate with co. However, we find significant correlations between centrality and functional similarity of interacting proteins.

**Implications:** The date-party dichotomy in protein-protein interaction may not be meaningful, and it may be more useful to conceive roles protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that prior arguments in favor of date-party dichotomy are susceptible to changes in data and methods. Observed differences in network vulnerability to attacks arise from only a few important hubs. Properties attributed to date and party do not correspond well with actual topological roles, which are more diverse than explained by simple dichotomy. We suggest that date and party play different roles respect modular structure protein data.

**Key Findings:**

* The bimality in hubP distributions not robust across interaction and expression sets
* Tests deletion of two types not considered outlier effects
* Definitions date and party based on correlations with interactors in protein network
* avCC computed each hub and distribution observed Han et al [1] bimodal cases
* date/p threshold avCC for given data defined optimally separate types [1]

**Summary:** We revisited possibility date-party dichotomy and found concerns. Claims bimality hub distributions not robust available data, tests differences two types not important effects.

**Title:** Assessing the Limitations of Whole Genome Sequencing Data in Infectious Disease Outbreak Reconstruction: The Role of Transmission Divergence

**Research Question:** What is the impact of genetic diversity on the utility of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data in reconstructing transmission trees of infectious disease outbreaks?

**Methods:** We introduce the concept of "transmission divergence", defined as the number of mutations separating pathogen genomes sampled from transmission pairs. Using literature values, we simulated outbreak scenarios with two sequence evolution models to describe divergence of major outbreak-causing pathogens.

**Findings:** Mean transmission values vary between pathogens, but divergence is generally low, with many outbreaks characterized by genetically identical transmission pairs. We evaluated the impact of divergence on outbreak reconstruction using tools R and phybreak, demonstrating that rapidly evolving pathogens like RNA viruses provide valuable transmission information, while pathogens with lower divergence (e.g., Streptoccus pneumoniae, Shigella soni, Clostrid difficile) provide little to no information.

**Implications:** Our results highlight the limitations of GS data in certain outbreak scenarios, emphasizing the need to expand reconstruction tools to integrate other epidemiological data.

**Conclusions:** Genetic diversity accumulating transmission depends on genomic and epidemiological factors. We propose transmission as a measure of informativeness of GS for reconstructing transmission chains. Estimated transmission can be empirically from transmission by determining mutations separating pathogen samples. This limitation may be more problematic for methods relying on phylogenetic trees inferring events. The impact of limited diversity on reconstruction remains to be investigated, varying across methods. The informativeness of data respect underlying transmission can be evaluated. This study introduces transmission as a measure of informativeness of GS for reconstructing transmission during infectious outbreaks, estimating for major causing pathogens with simulated approach using distinct evolution models for comparison.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of X Chromosome Inactivation and Gene Escape in Mammals: A Comprehensive Analysis of Allele-Specific Expression and Chromatin Structure in Mouse Tissues and Cells

**Research Question:** How do genes escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals, and what are the molecular mechanisms regulating this process?

**Methods:** We analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed XCI based on single nucleotide polymorphisms, using a binomial model to assess allelic expression, and verified RNA-seq with RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing.

**Findings:** A continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X (Xi) was demonstrated, with few genes (3-7%) escaping CI in mouse tissues, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro embryonic kidney-derived Pki cell line showed a higher density of escape genes (21%), representing both kidney-specific and cell-line escape. Alle-specific RNA polymerase II and DNase hypersensitivity at the promoter genes on Xi correlated with levels of escape, consistent with open chromatin structure at escape. Alle-specific CTCF binding on Xi was denser in brain compared to Pki cell, possibly contributing to compartmentalized structure of Xi and fewer genes in brain compared to cell.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that XCI and escape are tightly controlled in vivo, with only a minority of genes escaping in a tissue and cell-specific manner. The probability of bi-allelic versus monoallelic expression was calculated using a new algorithm applicable to any gene in the genome. Surveys in human/mouse cells and cell lines showed 8-15% human genes consistently escape CI, 10-13 display variable, and 10-20 vary between lines/individuals. Escape from CI results in sexual dimorphisms and bi-alle expression at some genes is important for normal phenotype in females.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides insights into the mechanisms of XCI and escape in mammals, highlighting stringent silencing and escape controls, tissue-specific genes, and the role of chromatin structure and CTCF in regulating escape. The 3-7% escape genes in mouse may be exceptional compared to other mammals, while the larger number in Pki cells may reflect epigenetic changes or cell property. Tissue-specific genes will help understanding functional mechanisms to sex differences.

**Title:** Characterization of a Novel Cysteine Protease from Plasium viv: Implications for Malaria Parasite Metabolism and Egress from the Erythrocyte

**Research Question:** What are the biochemical properties and biological functions of a novel cystine protease from Plasium viv, and how does it contribute to the parasite's metabolism and egress from the erythrocyte?

**Methods:** We identified and characterized a novel cystine protease (VXV-4) from Plas viv using bioinformatics and biochemical approaches. Recombinant VX-4 was expressed and purified, and its substrate specificity and activity were analyzed at different pH conditions.

**Findings:** VX-4 exhibited dual substrate specificity, with highest activity against benzyloxycarbonyl-Le-Arg-methyl-amide (Zu-Arg-CA) at acidic pH 5.5 and against Z-Arg-Arg-CA at neutral pH 6.5-7.5. It preferred positively charged amino acids at the P1 position, with less specificity at P3 and P4, which depended on pH. Three amino acids in the S pocket were substituted in VX-4 compared to VX-2 and VX-3. Replacement of Glu180 abolished activity against Z-Arg-Arg-CA at neutral pH, indicating its importance in pH-dependent substrate preference. VX- was localized in the vacuoles and cytoplasm of erythrocytic stage Pl viv.

**Implications:** VX-4 demonstrates pH-dependent substrate switching, which might offer an efficient mechanism for cleavage of different substrates in intracellular environments. It might function as hemase in acidic food vacu, matur of viv plasmin 4 at neutral/acidic pH, and cytos-degrading protease in erythrocytosol.

**Conclusions:** Characterization of VX-4 provides insights into Pl viv cystine proteases, essential for parasite survival and egress from erythrocy. Understanding its biochemical properties and biological functions will aid in developing antimal drugs targeting cystine proteases. Further studies on Pl viv cystine proteases are hindered by inability to culture viv. This study contributes to understanding Pl viv cystine proteases and their roles in malaria pathogenesis.

**Title:** Reconstruction of a Genome-Scale Model of Metabolism and Macromolecular Synthesis (ME) for Clostridium ljungahli: Elucidating the Biology of Acetogens for Biotechnological Production

**Research Question:** Despite the unique ability of acetogens to ferment a broad range of substrates, their potential for biotechnological production is hindered by incomplete knowledge of their physiology and inability to accurately predict phenotypes. This study aimed to reconstruct a genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME) to gain insights into the biology of Clostridium ljungahli, a model acetogen.

**Methods:** A novel ME model, iLjL-M, was constructed, capturing major metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, cofactor, and vitamin pathways, as well as RNA and protein synthesis necessary for catalysis. The model includes WLP with updated cofactors and mechanisms for energy conservation.

**Findings:** The iL-M accurately predicted secretion of acetate, ethanol, and glycer during changing carbon and metal availability, revealing protein and media influence on metabolic pathways and energy in acetogens. Turnover rates of metabolic enzymes were approximated by ke, set to 25-1, the average rate of acetogens in literature. Coupling constraints linked macrom synthesis with reactions using COBme formulation.

**Implications:** This ME broadens the scope and predictability of microbial biology, enabling new strategies for biotechn production, such as glycerol formation, a novel product for C. ljungahli. Prediction and validation of secretion rates based on metal availability opens fermentation optimization and knowledge of proteome and carbon flux in acetogens.

**Conclusions:** This study reconstructs the first genome-scale ME of a Gram-positive bacterium, providing insights into acetogen biology and biotechn potential. Accurate prediction of protein and media influence on metabolic pathways and energy in acetogens enables new design strategies for biotechn production. The iL-M opens window into acetogen physiology, enabling optimization and biotechn applications.

**Title:** Elucidating Tissue-Specific Genetic Regulation of Transcript Isoforms in Human Osteoblasts and Lymphoblast Cell Lines using Genome-Wide Association Studies

**Research Question:** How do genetic variants influence the expression of transcript isoforms in human osteoblast (HO) and lymphoblast (L) cell lines, and what are the implications for our understanding of disease-relevant genetic signals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)?

**Methods:** We conducted a transcriptomic survey of HO and L cell lines to identify cell-type specific genes and functionally relevant pathways. We performed cis-association analysis with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify genetic variations in transcript isoforms and found that differential expression of isoforms in HO is partly controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants. Isoforms are regulated by variants in tissue-specific and tissue-independent manners, confirmed by RT-PCR validation.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that multiple isoforms are present in both tissues and genetic control the relative expression of one iso to another, rather than an all-or effect. Examination of top SNPs from GWAS of bone density shows overlap with associations in this study, with the top hit corresponding to FAM gene tested in additional clinical studies revealing a novel iso variant. Our approach examining transcript variation in multiple types is useful for detecting genetic variation common to cell types and identifying cell-specific iso variants functionally relevant.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of examining transcript variation in multiple tissues for understanding disease-relevant genetic signals in GWAS. Osteoblast-specific isoforms are present and expression of alternatively spliced variants in tissue are controlled by regulatory SNPs and vary between individuals/populations, potentially important functions. Data comparing L and HO, RT-PCR replication of L iso variants in HO, suggests a proportion of variation genes expressed common between cell types. Allele-specific expression iso in HO but not L, identify unique iso with biological functions in osteob. This study assesses whether genes/pathways preferentially under genetic control.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the utility of examining transcript variation in multiple tissues for detecting genetic variation common cell types and identifying cell-specific variants functionally relevant. This approach is an important follow-up step for GWAS.

**Title:** Evolution of Maltotose Utilization in Saccharomyces eayan CBS 123T through Neofunctionalization of a Maltose Transporter

**Research Question:** Can laboratory evolution of maltose utilization in Saccharces eayan CBS 123T be achieved through neofunctionalization of a maltose transporter?

**Methods:** Maltose-assimulating mutants of Saccesayan CBS 123T were subjected to laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltose-enriched wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel SeMALT gene resulting from repeated introgression by non-reciprocal translocation of at least SeALT genes.

**Findings:** The evolved strain showed improved maltose and maltose fermentation in 7 ferment experiments on industrial wort. Overexpression of SeALT sufficed to enable growth on maltose, indicating neofunctionalization had occurred. The structure of SeALT resembles the structure of Sorian maltose-transporter SpY, which has high identity to S cerevis MAL1, Sus MAL1, and SeALT.

**Implications:** The evolution of maltose landscape in hybridorian lagering strains likely involved mechanisms similar to those observed in this study. S cerevis contains ScT, a transporter with 57 nucleotide identity to MAL genes. Sc encodes a broad-substrate sugar symporter enabling maltose uptake. However, eayan type CBS 57 utilizes maltose but not maltose, suggesting it expresses functional maltase and maltose transporter but not maltose.

**Conclusions:** Neofunctionization of maltose transporter in Sacomy yeasts can lead to emergence of maltose transporter. Laboratory evolution may be sufficient to obtain maltose utilization in eayan CBS 57. The mosaic structure ofALT resembles the structure oforian maltose-transporter SpY, which has high identity to S cere MAL, Sus, and SeALT. Evolution of maltose landscape inorian lager strains likely involved mechanisms observed in this study.

**Title:** Predicting Influenza Mortality: A Novel Host-Virus Model Reveals Correlation between Antigenic Distance and Excess Mortality

**Background:** Influenza viruses continue to pose a significant threat to global health, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Accurate assessment of their impact on human mortality is crucial for effective planning, but current approaches rely heavily on intensive surveillance. This study proposes a novel host-virus model to establish a correlation between excess mortality caused by viral strains and their antigenic distance to previous strains for each sub-type of seasonal viruses.

**Methods:** A simplified hostirus model was developed to explore the relationship between antigenic variation and excess mortality. Strains with significant human infection were denoted as "antigen strains" (Table S1). The model predicted antigen distance (Epred) was evaluated against observed excess mortality for A(H1N) virus.

**Findings:** A positive correlation was found between antigenic variation and excess mortality. Epred showed high accuracy in predicting antigen distance, suggesting utility in rapid estimation of mortality. Further, Epred for A(HN) correlated with observed excess mortality.

**Implications:** Rapid prediction of mortality will aid timely preparedness, balancing public health and economic costs. This method may be useful for future A(HN variants and applicable to A(H2 and B with modification.

**Conclusions:** A novel hostirus model revealed a direct correlation between antigenic variation and excess mortality. Epred accurately predicted antigen distance, suggesting utility in rapid estimation of mortality. This study contributes to timely assessment of influenza burden, informing cost-effective control and prevention strategies.

**Title:** Elucidating the Virulence Mechanisms of the Asian Soybean Fungus Phakora pachhizi: Characterization of a Small Secreted Cysteine-Rich Protein Effector (PEC23) and its Interaction with Soybean Transcription Factor GPL12

**Research Question:** How does the Asianbean fungus Phora pachizi interact with its soybean host, and what is the role of small secreted cysteine-rich proteins (SCRPs) in this interaction?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and plant pathology techniques to investigate the interaction between Phora pachizi and soybean. We sequenced the haustorium transcriptome of P. pachizi and predicted secreted effector candidates (PEC), identifying several SCRPs, including PEC23, which showed unique ability to suppress soybean immunity.

**Findings:** PEC23, a small cysteine-rich protein, interacts with soy transcription factor GPL12, a negative regulator of soybean defenses. Silencing GPL12 resulted in constitutive immunity, indicating its role as a negative regulator of soybean responses. Our data suggest PEC23 functions as a virulence factor, suppressing soybean immune responses and interacting with GPL12.

**Implications:** This study provides first evidence for a virulence function of a SCP and identifies GPL12 as a negative regulator of soybean defenses. PEC23 may represent a conserved protein-protein platform used by fungi to manipulate host immune responses.

**Conclusions:** Our findings shed light on the molecular mechanisms of Phora pach interaction with soybean, highlighting the role of SCRPs in virulence and GPL12 as a negative regulator of soybean defenses. Further research on PEC and GPL interactions may reveal novel targets for disease management strategies.

**Title:** Identification of EphA as a Host Cell Surface Receptor for Chlamydia trachomatis Invasion and Intracellular Signaling

**Research Question:** How does Chlamdia trachatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, invade host cells and replicate inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion, and what host proteins are recruited and modulated to support its development?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of EphA, a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, in Chydia adherence and invasion, and intracellular signaling.

**Findings:** We identified EphA as a chlamial adherence and invasion receptor that induces PI3 kinase (PIK) activation, promoting chlamial replication. Interfering with C trachitis serar2 (C) binding to EphA, downregulation of EphA, or inhibition of Eph activity significantly reduced C infection. C interacts and activates Eph on the surface, resulting in receptor internalization. During chyd replication, Eph remains active around the inclusion and interacts with the p85 subunit of PIK to activate the PIK/Akt pathway required for chyd development. Overexpression of full-length Eph, but not mutant lacking the intracellular domain, enhanced PI activation and C infection.

**Implications:** Our findings provide evidence for a host surface receptor exploited for invasion as well as receptor-mediated intracellular signaling to facilitate chyd replication. Engagement of a surface receptor at the membrane is a new mechanism by which Chy subverts the host and induces apoptosis resistance.

**Conclusions:** EphA plays a crucial role in chlamia entry and intracellular signaling. Activation of the EphA-PIK pathway is important for chyd development, particularly in the early phase of infection. During this phase, Eph levels remain unchanged, indicating post-translational modification by phosphorylation is the mechanism of activation. In the middle and late phase, the PIK pathway is less important, as C can develop irrespective of PIK activity. The effect of C on Eph is line with ligand-independent signaling, causing Eph activation, PI/A activation, and preventing Eph degradation. Activation of PI is not dependent on Eph during chyd infection, indicating a possible role of other PI-inducing pathways.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Dendritic Excitability in Neural Computation: A Novel Insights into the Dynamic Range Enhancement of Dendritic Trees

**Research Question:** What is the functional significance of dendritic excitability in neural computation, and how do active dendritic conductances contribute to the dynamic range of dendritic trees?

**Methods:** We developed a computational model of an active dendritic tree, incorporating voltage-gated ion channels, to investigate the role of excitability in dendritic computation. We analyzed the output of the model as a function of afferent rate and compared it to experimental data from retinal ganglion cells.

**Findings:** Our results show that the output of the dendritic tree is a highly non-linear function of afferent rate, exhibiting extremely large dynamic ranges (up to 50 dB). Moreover, the model yields double-sigmoid response functions, consistent with experimentally observed in retinal ganglion cells. We propose that the enhancement of dynamic range is the primary role of active dendritic conductances.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that neurons with larger dendritic trees have larger dynamic range, and blocking active conductances lead to a decrease in dynamic. This implies that dendritic excitability is crucial for amplifying weak signals and saturating stronger activity, addressing the "dynamic range problem" in signal processing.

**Conclusions:** Dendritic excitability is not just a consequence of excitable dynamics, but an essential feature for dendritic computation. Our results propose that dendritic trees without plasticity can benefit from active conductances for enlargement of operational range. The double-sigmoid behavior of the neuron function, observed in retinal ganglion cells, is a result of dendritic spikes under synaptic bombardment. This study highlights the importance of dendritic excitability in neural processing, shedding light on the functional significance of extensive dendritic trees.

**Title:** Correcting for Assumptions in Time-Series Transcriptomics Data Analysis: A Systematic Investigation of Regulatory Interactions and Quantitative Models in the Fli-FlM Module of E. coli Motility

**Research Question:** Do commonly made assumptions in time-series transcriptomics analysis, such as equating mRNA abundance to protein concentrations and neglecting global physiological effects, bias the inference of regulatory interactions and quantitative models?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of experiments and models to investigate the importance of these assumptions in the Fli-FlM module of E. coli motility. We measured real-time in vivo activity of genes, estimated protein concentrations, and global effects using kinetic models of gene expression.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that correcting for these assumptions improves the quality of inferred models from data. Moreover, we show that this improvement is expected to be stronger in systems with longer protein half-lives and varying gene machinery activity, as in the Fli-FlM module.

**Implications:** The proposed approach is broadly applicable to time-series data to learn structure and dynamics of regulatory networks. Our results demonstrate the importance of global effects and regulation of Fli and FlM halfives for Fli-dependent promoters.

**Conclusions:** We propose new controls for transcript experiments, constitutively-expressed genes, and mathematical procedures for reconstructing protein concentrations and integrating physiological effects into the inference process. A second step, global effects measured by reporter driven constitutive promoter results expected regulatory structure. However, fit to data is only marginally improved. Therefore, we estimated Fli and FlM from promoter activities and physiologically halfives, yielding a rich data for testing distinction between mRNA and protein influences. We inferred regulatory and quantitative function of Fli-dependent gene, not regulated by other transcription factors. Estimation of time-vary protein from promoter by kinetic and physologically halfives improves inference interactions and regulation. A model reconstructed Fli and FlM as regulators, in addition to gene machinery, is structurally compatible data.

**Title:** Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Oligzoryzomys fulcens (O. fulcens) Populations in Central America: Implications for Zoonotic Pathogen Transmission

**Research Question:** What are the spatio-temporal dynamics of Oligoryzomys fulcens (O. fulens) populations in Central America, and how do these dynamics influence the transmission of zoonotic pathogens?

**Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal study of rodent populations in the community of Agua Buena, Toní, Panama, between April 2006 and December 2009, using non-spatial analyses (box plots) and spatial statistical tests (corregrams, SAD, and LISA). A 90-node grid was built in raster format to design a base map, with an area of 0.09 km^2 and total area of 6.43 km^2 (2.39 x 2.69 km). The temporal dataset was divided into four periods: dry season, rainy season, and two-month transitions between seasons (April and December).

**Findings:** We found heterogeneous patterns in population densities and dispersion of O. fulcens across seasons and years. The species was typically absent during late transitional months and re-established locally in subsequent years. Populations reoccurred in the same area during first three years but re-established further south in final year of study. Spatial autocorrelation indicated populations encompassed approximately 300-600 m. Borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats were sharply demarcated over short distances. Oligzoryomys fulens showed a well-defined spatial pattern over time, leading to a pattern of changing aggregation. Hotspots of abundance showed a shifting pattern explaining intermittent transmission by this species. Variation was associated with seasonality and anthropogenic pressures from agricultural activities.

**Implications:** Our results provide a detailed spatio-temporal characterization of hotspots of rodent habitation and persistence, highlighting the challenges in monitoring zoon disease outbreaks at population level. Populations are subject to fluctuations within and among years, and geographically restricted within range. Suitable habitat change is poorly understood on landscape level. Rod-borne zoon are sensitive to population size, demographic, persistence, and population factors in conjunction with temporal changes host distribution, determinants pathogen establishment and transmission intensity within populations. This plays a role in spillo pathogen cycle into other species.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates multiannual dynamics of O. fulens populations, seasonal and yearly heterogeneity in abundance and distribution. This variation in zoon reservoir makes hotspot identification challenging. Results provide an important characterization of challenges in predicting zoon disease at population level. Populations are subject to fluctuations within and among, and geographically restricted within range. Suitable habitat change is poorly understood on landscape level.

**Title:** Inferring Antigenic Trees: A Computational Method for Determining the Antigenic Impact of Amino Acid Changes in Influenza Virus Evolution

**Research Question:** How can we develop a computational method to infer the antigenic impact of amino acid changes in the evolution of influenza viruses, enabling the identification of key mutations that determine an organism's phenotype from "near-neutral hitchhikers"?

**Methods:** We developed a technique for inferring antigen trees, assigning antigen weights to branches, allowing the resolution of antigenic impact associated with amino acid changes. Our method, based on least-squares optimization (LSO) procedure, fits pairwise antigen distances onto a tree topology, providing a fine-grained resolution of antigen impact without time- and cost-intensive experiments.

**Findings:** We applied our technique to infer antigen trees representing the antigen evolution of the major surface protein of human influenza A (H3) over 35 years. Branch lengths represent antigen distances inferred from HI assay data and maximum likelihood of HA domain hemagglutinin. Our method accurately predicted antigen distances comparable to antigen cartography. We identified known and novel amino acid changes with antigen impact in the evolution of influenza A (3) from 196 to 2003.

**Implications:** This technique can be applied to infer phenotype and genotype-phenotype relationships in other types of pairwise distances. It can be used to identify isolates associated with large antigen impact, necessary for vaccine updates prior antigen type transitions. Our method is not restricted to influenza or antigen information, but can be applied to any system with homologous sequences and pairwise distances.

**Conclusions:** We present a computational method for inferring antigen impact of amino acid changes in the evolution of influenza viruses. Our technique provides a fine-grained resolution of antigen impact without time and cost-intensive experiments. We demonstrate its application to the antigen evolution of influenza (3) from 196 to 200, identifying known and novel amino acid changes with antigen impact. This method can be applied to other systems with homolog sequences and pairwise distances, enabling the study of phenotype-genotype relationships.

**Title:** Identification of Host Cell Factors Required for Human Papillomavirus Type 16 (HPV16) Infection Reveals a Novel Mechanism for Nuclear Import of Viral DNA during Mitosis

**Research Question:** What are the host cell factors required for human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV) infection, and how does the viral DNA (vDNA) enter the nucleus during mitosis?

**Methods:** A two-step high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screen was used to identify host factors required for HPV16 infection. Validated hits implicated a cluster of mitotic genes, which revealed a previously unknown mechanism for viral DNA import into the nucleus.

**Findings:** In interphase cells, viruses were endocytosed, routed to perinuclear, and uncoated, but vDNA failed to be imported into the nucleus. Upon nuclear envelope perforation in interphase, HPV16 infection occurred. During mitosis, vDNA associated with host chromatin on metaphase plate. We propose that HPV requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for access of vDNA to nucleoplasm.

**Implications:** This study highlights the value of RNA screens for investigation of viral infections. The list of cell functions required for HPV16 infection provides a resource for future virus-host interaction studies.

**Conclusions:** Mitosis is crucial for nuclear import of HPV vDNA, facilitated by changes in nuclear envelope (NE) permeability due to nuclear breakdown (NE). Association of subviral complex with host chromatin on metaphase plate is essential for viral entry.

**Key Findings:**

* Nuclear envelope breakdown (NE) during mitosis allows association of subiral complex with host chromatin on metaphase
* vDNA of HPV16 enters nucleoplasm through nuclear envelope breakdown (NE) during mitosis
* Association of v with host chromatin on metaphase is crucial for viral entry
* HPV causes increase in fraction of cells displaying prolonged mitosis, dependent on amount of L associating with host chromatin
* Entry of HPV requires progression of cells through cell cycle into mitosis
* Nuclear import of subiral complex not known, but requires cell cycle progression into mitosis

This study demonstrates the power of RNAi screens in analyzing pathogen-host interactions and provides a resource for future studies on virus-host interactions.

**Research Question:** The study aimed to investigate the genetic structure and function of the Dothideomyc fungus Pseudospora fiji, the causative agent of Black Sigat or black streak disease, a major threat to global banana production, to inform fungicide treatment and breeding programs.

**Methods:** Two strains of P. fiji, CIR86 and C139, were sequenced and assembled with the aid of a genetic map. Genome analysis revealed a massive expansion of LTR transposons, making P. fiji's genome the largest in Dothomycetes. Electrophoretic karyotyping and molecular markers showed chromosome polymorphisms and high genetic diversity. Genetic differentiation was detected using neutral markers, suggesting strong selection and limited gene flow at the geographic scale.

**Findings:** Frequencies of fungicide resistance in treated plantations were higher than in wild-type P. fiji populations. A homologue of Cladospor fulum Avr effector, PfAv4, was identified in P. fiji genome. Infiltration of purified PfAV4 into leaves of resistant banana variety Calcut 4 resulted in hypersensitive response, suggesting Cal 4 carries unknown resistance gene recognizing Pf4.

**Implications:** The P. fiji genome will aid in developing fungicide schedules to combat this pathogen and improve banana breeding programs. The high adaptability of P. fiji due to rapid fungicide resistance and variability and sexual reproduction makes it a threat to global production. Diversifying host resistance in banana may slow devastation caused by this fungus.

**Conclusions:** The study provides new insights into Dothomyc genome structure and P. fiji function. The availability of P. fiji genome sequence will facilitate resistant cultivar development in breeding programs and fungicide treatment to combat this pathogen.

**Title:** Uncovering Lineage-Specific Regulatory Elements through a Birth-Death Model: A Novel Insights into the Evolution of Species-Specific Traits

**Research Question:** How do lineage-specific changes in cis-regulatory elements contribute to the evolution of species-specific traits, and how can we identify these elements without relying on cross-species alignments?

**Methods:** We developed a novel framework using a birth-death model to trace the evolution of lineage-specific binding sites without requiring detailed base-by-base cross-species alignments. We applied this method to ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors (GATA, SOX, CTC, MY, MAX, E1, and TS) along the human-mouse lineage.

**Findings:** We estimated that 58-79% of binding sites for each factor originated since the human-mouse divergence, and 15% are unique to hominids. These elements are enriched near genes associated pathways and harbor more SNPs than older sites in the human genome.

**Implications:** Our method identifies lineage-specific regulatory elements and sheds light on their roles in shaping gene regulation variation across species. Unlike conservation-based approaches, our method generates predictions using lineage-specific sites or their creation rate along a lineage. For five factors (GATA, SO, MAX, CTC, and TS), our method produced the most significant motif prediction.

**Conclusions:** Our results support the ability of this method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements, a step towards understanding regulatory evolution's role in species variation. This contrasts with phylogen footprinting approaches, which rely on fixed-species alignments, often of low quality in non-coding regions. Our method can determine lineage differences in evolutionary rates along a branch in the phylogeny.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Light-Dependent Regulation of the Zebraf Period2 Gene: A Novel Insights into the Vertebrate Circadian Clock Entrainment**

**Research Question:** How does light regulate the expression of the zebraf period2 (per) gene, a key component of the vertebrate circadian clock, and what are the underlying transcriptional mechanisms?

**Methods:** We employed transgenic and stably transfected cell-based assays to investigate the zraf per promoter and identified a Light-Responsive Module (LRM) proximal to the transcription start site, necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian regulation. The LRM is conserved in vertebrate per genes, even in species lacking light-sensitive peripheral clocks.

**Findings:** The LRM contains E- and D-box elements critical for its function, with the E-box mediating circadian regulation by BMAL/CLOCK activity and the D-box driving light expression. The zraf homolog of thyrotrophic factor binds to the L D-box and transactivates expression. We demonstrate that t mRNA levels are light-inducible, and knockdown of t attenuates light-driven transcription from the per promoter in vivo.

**Implications:** Our results support a model where light-dependent crosstalk between E and D-box factors is central to per expression, extending our understanding of light entrainment and regulation of the vertebrate circadian clock.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel mechanism combining light-induced and circadian transcriptional control, shedding light on the phenomenon of gated entrainment of the circadian clock and general photic cellular responses. The LRM and D-box elements may play a general role in light-dependent changes in zraf cell physiology. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of transcriptional mechanisms in the vertebrate circadian clock.

**Title:** Actin-Binding Protein Coronin Regulates Motility in Plasmodium berghei Sporozoites: Implications for Malaria Transmission**

**Research Question:** How does the actin-binding protein coronin regulate the motility of Plasium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite transmitted by mosquitoes, and what are the implications for malaria transmission?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of coronin in sporite motility using a combination of mutational analysis, imaging, and biochemical approaches. We generated a series of parasite lines that lack coron, contain mutations in the ß-propeller, or express coron fused to mCherry, and analyzed their motility, adhesion, and transmission efficiency.

**Findings:** Our results show that coronin localizes to the periphery of sporites in a calcium-dependent, actin-independent manner and contributes to sporite motility through actin-binding. Parasites lacking coron frequently detach from substrate and struggle to reattach, suggesting a function in adhesion. Importantly, coron is essential for efficient transmission from mosquitoes to mice, as coron- parasites exhibit defects in saliv gland invasion.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of coronin in malaria transmission and suggest a crucial interplay between TR-family adhesins, actin filaments, and regulating adhesion for sporite migration. Actin filaments are likely linked to transmembrane proteins containing adhesive domains, including integrin-like domains, driving motility upon attachment. However, the mechanism of transmembrane force transmission remains unclear.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that coronin regulates sporite motility through actin-binding and is essential for efficient malaria transmission. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of malaria transmission and highlight the importance of coronin as a potential target for antimalarial therapy.

**Title:** Characterization of Novel Amphotin B-Resistant Leishmania mexicana Lines Reveals Altered Sterol Biosynthesis and Loss of Sterol C-Methyltransferase Expression

**Research Question:** What are the genetic mechanisms underlying Amphotin B resistance in Leishmania mexicana, and how do they impact sterol biosynthesis and virulence?

**Methods:** We generated four independent Amphot B-resistant Leish mexicana lines and characterized their sterol biosynthesis, gene expression, and virulence in macrophages.

**Findings:** All four lines exhibited altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a mutation in the sterol bios gene sterol5-desaturase in one line, while RNA-seq showed loss of sterol C-methyltransferase (SMT) expression in three lines, associated with altered sterol biosynthesis. Loss of milteine transporter was also observed in one line. MT is encoded by two genes with different expression levels, with reduced expression associated with loss of the 3 untranslated region of the dominant copy due to structural variations at the locus. Regions of homology between copies and presence of SIDER retrotransposons promoted these variations.

**Implications:** Loss of MT expression was not associated with loss of virulence in macrophages in at least one case. Repeat-mediated instability in Leish genomes is known, but associated with major antileishial drug resistance without fitness costs is a significant concern.

**Conclusions:** We identified novel mechanisms of Amphot B resistance in Leish, including altered sterol biosynthesis and loss of SMT, a key enzyme in sterol biosynthesis. SMT is encoded by two genes with different expression levels, with reduced expression associated with loss of the 3 untranslated region of the dominant copy due to structural variations at the locus. Regions of homology between copies and presence of SIDER retrotransons promote these variations. Loss of SMT was not associated with loss virulence in macrophages in at least case. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring SMT expression in emergent Am resistance, as low-level resistance predisposes higher-level resistance through additional mutations.

**Title:** Investigating the Interaction between Attention and Prediction in the Brain: A Neural Encoding of Mismatch Information in Response to Surprising Stimuli

**Research Question:** How do attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain, particularly in the encoding of mismatch information in response to surprising stimuli?

**Methods:** We employed electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity from human observers performing a simple visual task, where they attended to or ignored a stream of gratings with orientations that could be predictable, surprising, or unpredictable.

**Findings:** We found that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed features, and attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain. Specifically, attention increased the selectivity for mismatch information in the response to surprising stimuli, consistent with a recent predictive coding theory that attention optimizes expected precision by modulating the gain of prediction errors.

**Implications:** These findings advance our understanding of how attention and prediction interact to modulate processing in the brain, supporting the theory that attention optimizes expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that attention boosts mismatch information evoked by surprising (putative errors) is consistent with a version of predictive theory that proposes attention optimizes expected precision by increasing the gain of errors. We propose the "mismatch model" account, where attention increases selectivity for mismatch information in neural response to surprising relative to unsurprising stimuli. This is in contrast to alternative predictive models that propose predictions, not prediction errors, are propagated through the hierarchy and modulated by attention. Our results show a significant effect of attention on mismatch profiles response to surprising but unpredictable stimuli around 150 ms after onset, reaching significance at 350 ms, demonstrating attention boosts prediction errors evoked by surprising stimuli consistent with predictive theory.

**Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Human Resistance to Trypanosome Lytic Factors in Trypanosoma brucei Subspecies

**Research Question:** What are the underlying mechanisms of human resistance to trypan lytic factors (TLF) in Trypanosoma brucei subspecies, particularly in group 1 and 2 T. b. gambense, and how do they differ from each other?

**Methods:** We generated isogenic and sensitive lines of group 2 T. b. gambense and compared them to T. brucei and T. rhodesense. We analyzed the expression of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HbHR) gene and internalization of fluorescent labeled TLF-1 and recombinant AP1.

**Findings:** Both resistant and sensitive group 2 T. gambense express HHR at similar levels and internalize TLF-1 in a similar fashion to T. brucei. However, only sensitive group 2 T. gambense are lysed by AP1, indicating that despite avoiding TLF-1, group 1 T. gambense is resistant to the main lytic component AP1. Group 2 T. gambense is also innately resistant to AP1, which may be based on the same mechanism. However, group 2 T gambense variably displays this phenotype and does not correlate with change in HHR expression or expression.

**Implications:** Our results reveal distinct mechanisms of human resistance in T. gambense groups 1 and 2. Group 1 T. gambense avoids TLF-1, but is resistant to AP1, while group 2 T. gambense is resistant to AP1, suggesting different strategies have evolved in human infective trypan strains.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the complexity of human resistance to trypan lytic factors in T. brucei subspecies, particularly in group 2 T. gambense. Our findings indicate that HHR expression and internalization of TLF-1 are not responsible for resistance in group 2 T. gambense, suggesting alternative mechanisms are at play. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing effective treatments against human trypanosomiasis.

**Title:** Epigenetic Control of HIV-1 Latency: CpG Methylation of the HIV-1 5' Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) as a Mechanism of Resistance to Reactivation

**Research Question:** What is the role of CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) in the establishment and maintenance of HIV-1 latency, and its potential as a mechanism of resistance to reactivation?

**Methods:** We investigated the epigenetic control of HIV-1 latency in an in vitro model of reactivable latency and in latent reservoirs of HIV-1-infected patients using bisulfite treatment, PCR, and histone deacetylase inhibitors, protein C agonists, TN-α, and combinations with 5-aza-2oxycytidine.

**Findings:** CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5 LTR is an additional epigenetic mechanism that controls resistance of latent HIV-1 to reactivation and determines the stability of HIV-1 latency. Cp methylation acts as a late event during establishment of HIV-1 latency and is not required for initial provirus silencing. Latent reservoirs of avire patients contained high proportions of non-methyl 5 L. Latency controlled by transcriptional interference and chromatin mechanisms is leaky and easily reactivable. In latent HIV-1-infected individuals without detectable viremia, HIV promoters and enhancers were hypermethyl and resistant to reactivation, opposed to hypomethyl 5 L in vire patients. Dense methylation of HIV-1 5 L did not confer complete resistance to reactivation with histone deetyl inhibitors, protein C agonists, TN-α, and combinations 5-aza-2oxycyt, but was efficiently reactivated in absence T cell activation suboylanide hydroamic.

**Implications:** Cp methylation of HIV-1 5 L is an epigen mechanism that maintains HIV-1 latency by preventing reactivation. Our results explain ambiguous conclusions from meth studies in cell lines latently infected HIV-1 and correlate in vitro data from HIV-infected patients. Cp meth in HIV-infected has not been studied. Our work shows possibility studying and acting ep control HIV latency in individuals. meth of HIV-1 5 is additional mechanism controlling resistance latent against reactivation and determines stability HIV-1 latency.

**Conclusions:** Cp meth of HIV-1 5 L is epigen mechanism maintaining HIV-1 by preventing reactivation. Our propose two-step model ep control HIV-1 (Figure 7). Our work demonstrates Cp meth HIV-1 5 could be important mechanism maintaining HIV-1 by preventing reactivation.

**Title:** Comprehensive Genomic Variation in Drosophila melanogaster: Unveiling the Relationship between Genetic and Phenotypic Variation

**Research Question:** Understanding the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation is a long-standing challenge in biology. To address this, comprehensive genomic maps of human and model organism populations are required.

**Methods:** We present a nucleotide catalog of single-nucleotide, multiucle, and structural variants in 39 Dophila melanogaster Genetic Panel inbred lines using integrative, local assembly-based approach for variant discovery. We identified more than 3.6 million variants, including 800,000 insertions, deletions (indels), and complex variants (1-6,000 bp).

**Findings:** While SNP density is higher near variants, we find that variants are not mutagenic nor regions with high variant density particularly mutation-prone. Our data suggest elevated SNP density around variants mainly due to population-level processes. We provide insights into regulatory gene expression variation in adult flies by mapping cis-expression trait loci (cisQTL) for 2,000 genes. Indels comprise 10% all-cisQTL show larger effects SNP-cisQTL. Identified two-fold gene associations males compared females, most-cisQ sex-specific revealing partial decoupling genomic between sexes importance genetic factors mediating sex-based expression.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Amplitude Cancellation on the Rectified EMG Signal as an Estimator of Neural Drive to Muscle

**Research Question:** Does amplitude cancellation of motor unit potentials distort the rectified EMG signal, affecting its correlation with neural drive to muscle?

**Methods:** We employed analytical derivations and computational models of motor activity, force, and EMG to investigate the effect of amplitude cancellation on rectified EM as estimator of neural drive. We simulated neural drive to muscle with common input in 1-30 Hz band and analyzed correlations between drive and EM signals.

**Findings:** Rectified EM without cancellation (EMnc) was superior to actual rectified EM as estimator of neural drive. Simulations showed average correlation (r2) between drive and EMnc (0.59±0.08) matched rect EM and drive only at low cancellation (<40%) and contraction (<5% MVC). However, correlation decreased linearly with cancellation (r=-0.83) to r<0.2 at >60% cancellation (>15 MVC). Simulations revealed stronger neural drive implied stronger correlation rect EM and drive, with cancellation distorting mainly low-frequency (<5 Hz) components.

**Implications:** Amplitude cancellation distorts rectified EM spectrum, implying valid use of rect EM as estimator requires low levels and/or strong synaptic input to motor neurons.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that amplitude cancellation disrupts rectified EM's ability to accurately reflect neural drive, except in conditions with low contraction and/or variable synaptic input. Analytical and simulation results show rectified EM is not optimal estimator of neural due to cancellation. Simulations indicate cancellation impairs rect EM's ability to reflect neural drive, especially in low-frequency components.

**Key Findings:**

* Rectified EM without cancellation (EM) is superior to actual rectified EM as estimator of neural drive
* Simulations show correlation between drive and EM (r=0.59±0.08) at low cancellation (<40%) and contraction (<5 MVC)
* Correlation decreases linearly with cancellation (r=-0.83) to r<0.2 at >60% cancellation (>15 MVC)
* Simulations reveal stronger neural drive implies stronger correlation rect EM and drive, with cancellation distorting mainly low-frequency (<5) components

**Conclusion:** Amplitude cancellation distorts rectified EM signal, implying valid use of rect EM as estimator requires low levels and/or strong synaptic input to motor neurons.

**Title:** Regulation of Auxin Biosynthesis by YUC Genes in Arabidopsis thaliana Roots under Aluminum Stress

**Research Question:** How do YUC genes regulate auxin biosynthesis in the root apex transition zone (TZ) of Arabidopsis thaliana in response to aluminum (Al) stress?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of YUC genes (Y3, 5, 7, 8, and 9) in regulating auxin biosynthesis in the root apex TZ of Arabidopsis thalian under Al stress conditions. We analyzed the expression of YUC genes in the root TZ using YpGFP-GUS transgenes and examined the effect of Al on auxin signaling using the DR5:GFP reporter. We also examined the effect of ethylene signaling on YUC expression and auxin biosynthesis in the root TZ.

**Findings:** Our results show that Al upregulates Y3/5/7/9 in the root TZ, leading to accumulation of auxin and root growth inhibition. Al-dependent regulation of Ys in the root TZ and Y-regulated growth is dependent on ethylene signaling. Disruption of eth signaling either enhanced or reduced upregulation of Ys in the root TZ in response to Al. Moreover, eth enhanced root inhibition under Al was alleviated in yuc mutants or co-treatment withucas, an inhibitor of Y activity, suggesting a downstream role of Ys in this process. We also found that eth-insensitive 3 (E3) is involved in the regulation of Y9 transcription in this process. Furthermore, PHYTOCHROMEACTING FACTOR 4 (P4) functions as a transcriptional activator for Y5/8, promoting Al-inhibited root growth by regulating local expression of Ys and auxin in the root TZ. Al-induced expression of P4 in TZ acts downstream eth signaling.

**Implications:** Our results highlight a regulatory cascade for Y-regulated aux biosynthesis in the root TZ mediating growth in response to Al. We demonstrate that Y activity is involved in eth positive modulation of aux signaling in the root TZ. The attenuated response of stresseduc mutants after treatment suggests that Y-mediated aux synthesis in the root TZ and growth acts downstream eth signaling.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the role of Y genes in Al-induced root growth inhibition through regulation of auxin biosynthesis in the root TZ. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of Al-induced root growth inhibition and highlight the importance of Y-regulated auxin biosynthesis in response to stress.

**Title:** Modulation of Natural Killer (NK) Cell Responses by Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) Peptides through Interactions with Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I Ligands

**Research Question:** How do simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) peptides modulate natural killer (NK) cell responses through interactions with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands?

**Methods:** We investigated the functional implications of SIV peptides bound to Mamu-A*002, a common MHC class I molecule in rhes mac, on the cytolytic activity of Mamu-K3+ NK cells. Twenty-eight of 75 SIV peptides bound Mam-A002 suppressed the cytolytic activity of Mamu-K+ NK cells, including immunodominant CD+ T cell epitopes previously shown to stabilize Mam-A002 tetramer to Mam-K. Substitutions at C-terminal changed inhibitory into disinhib peptides and vice versa without binding Mam002.

**Findings:** The effects of these peptide variants on NK responses corresponded to their effects Mam002 tetramer to Mam-K. In assays with mixtures inhibitory and disinhib peptides, low inhib peptides dominated suppress NK responses. Consistent with inhibition Mam-K NK by epitopes presented Mam002, S replication was higher in Mam002+ CD+ lymphocytes co-cultured Mam-K NK than Mam-K cells.

**Implications:** These results demonstrate that viral peptides can differentially affect NK responses by modulating M class I interactions inhibitory, providing a mechanism by which immunodef viruses evade NK responses.

**Conclusions:** Our findings support the possibility that HIV-1 and S may acquire changes inopes that increase binding M class I ligands inhibitory to impair NK killing virus-infected cells.

**Title:** Adaptation to Nutrient Limitation Enhances Colonization and Persistence of Haemophilus influenza in Otitis Media

**Research Question:** How does adaptation to nutrient limitation influence the ability of Haemophilus influenza to colonize and persist in the middle ear during otitis media (OM)?

**Methods:** We investigated the evolution of Haophilus influenza in response to nutrient limitation using a preclinical model of OM. We isolated and sequenced paired strains from middle ear effusion (EE) and nasophary (NP) of children with active OM and identified genetic variations in the ic gene. We generated a mutant with a single nucleotide polymorphism that abolishes 3',5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiester activity and tested its behavior in the preclinical model.

**Findings:** The ic mutant exhibited decreased 3',5-cyclic adenosine monosphate phosphodiester activity and formed significantly more intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) than the parental strain during early stages of OM. However, the number of IBCs formed by the parental strain increased at later stages, coinciding with the absence of recoverable effusion, suggesting a mucosal reservoir following resolution of disease. In contrast, the ic mutant showed a significant decrease in recovery of effusion from infected ears.

**Implications:** Adaptation to nutrient limitation enhances colonization and persistence of Haophil influenza in OM. Our data provide the first insight into the evolution of Haophil during nutrient limitation and demonstrate IBC in a preclinical model of OM.

**Conclusions:** Adaptation to nutrient limitation is key for colonization and persistence of Haophil influenza in OM. The ic mutant, with decreased 3',5-cyclic adenosine monosphate phosphodiester activity, formed more IBCs than the parental strain early in OM, but showed a decrease in recovery of effusion. This suggests that adaptation to nutrient limitation enhances evasion of host immune responses and persistence. The presence of IBC in the mucosa following resolution of disease indicates a reservoir of infection. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of OM and highlight the importance of adaptation to nutrient limitation in colonization and persistence of Haophil.

**Title:** Modulation of Host Iron Homeostasis by Burkholderia pseudomallei Facilitates Intracellular Proliferation and Immune Evasion

**Research Question:** How does Burkholder pseudalle, the causative agent of meloidosis, modulate host iron homeostasis to facilitate intracellular proliferation and immune evasion?

**Methods:** Primary macrophages were infected with B. pseudalle, and expression of ferroport was downregulated, resulting in higher iron availability within macrophages. Exogenous modification of iron export by hepcin or supplementation with ferric ammonium citrate increased intracellular iron, stimulating B. pseudalle growth, whereas iron chelation with deferoxamine reduced bacterial survival. Infection of mice with B. pseud caused diminished ferport expression, higher iron retention in the liver, and lower serum iron levels (hypofermia). In vivo administration of ferric ammonium citrate promoted bacterial growth and inflammatory response, whereas limitation of iron availability ameliorated bacterial clearance, attenuated cytokine levels, and improved survival.

**Findings:** Our data indicate that modulation of cellular iron balance is a strategy of B. pseudalle to acquire iron and restrict antibacterial effector mechanisms, promoting intracellular growth. We provide evidence that changes in host homeostasis influence susceptibility to meloidosis, suggesting iron chel drugs as a therapeutic option. Balle growth was not affected by hein in media at 24 hours, indicating hein intracellular retention beneficial for B.alle establishment in macroph. FAC or Fe4 treatment increased intracellular iron, facilitating B.alle growth. Iron supplementation impacted macro immune functions, such as reactive oxygen species, inflammatory mediators, antimicrobial expression, and cell induction.

**Implications:** The facultative intracellular bacterium B pseudalle evades immune defense by modulating ironostasis in murine macrophages. This study provides insights into the role of cytosolic iron and ferritin in intracellular infection, opening future investigations into pathogen iron sequest in ferritin and modulation of homeasis or iron chel. In a murine model, FAC iron supplementation stimulated systemic and hepatic iron, leading to higher bacterial numbers and cytokine release, whereas DFO limitation improved Balle-infected mice with reduced burden and response.

**Conclusions:** Burkholder pseudalle modulates host iron homeasis to facilitate intracellular proliferation and immune evasion, suggesting iron chel as a therapeutic option for meloid.

**Title:** Elucidating Functionally Relevant Collective Motions in Proteins: A Novel "Functional Mode" Analysis Approach

**Research Question:** How can we systematically identify collective motions in proteins that are directly related to their specific functions, given the complexity of molecular dynamics?

**Methods:** We propose a novel technique, "Functional Mode Analysis" (MA), which detects the collective motion maximally correlated to an arbitrary functional quantity, such as geometric, electrostatic, or chemical variables, relevant to the protein's function. This approach leverages an ensemble of structures to quantify the protein's functional state and estimates the motion most likely to induce a substantial change in the functional quantity. Two correlation measures are applied: Pearson's coefficient for linear correlation and mutual information for any interdependence.

**Findings:** Using MA, we identified functionally relevant motions in several biomolecules, including polyalanine-helix, T lysozyme, Tr-c, and leucine-binding protein. Unlike established methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Normal Mode Analysis (NMA), which elucidate large and low-frequency modes, respectively, but not necessarily collective motions related to function, MA directly detects the maximally correlated motion.

**Implications:** Detecting maximally correlated motions allows deriving a model for the functional state in terms of a single coordinate. This novel approach complements molecular dynamics simulations, PCA, and NMA, and elastic models, which focus on variance, frequency, and intrinsic motions, respectively. MA bridges the gap between protein dynamics and function.

**Conclusions:** Functionally relevant collective motions are crucial for protein function, yet identifying them from dynamics is non-trivial. MA addresses this challenge by systematically extracting motions maximally correlated to an arbitrary functional quantity. Its application to various biomolecules demonstrates its efficacy. This technique opens new avenues for understanding protein function, dynamics, and structure-function relationships.

**Title:** Unconventional Introns in Euglenids and Diplonids: A Novel Insights into Non-canonical Splicing Mechanisms

**Research Question:** This study investigates the order of intron removal from Euglena gracilis transcripts of the tubA and gap genes, which contain two types of introns: nonconventional and spliceosomal, and compares the relative order of excision for pairs of introns belonging to different types.

**Methods:** Intermediate products of splicing were analyzed using PacBio Next Generation Sequencing system.

**Findings:** Nonconventional introns are removed in a rapid way later than spliceosomal introns. The observed accumulation of transcripts with conventional introns removed and noncon present suggests the existence of a gap between the two types splicing.

**Implications:** The results suggest that the process of noncon intron removal is rapid and precedes the removal of outr, and the addition of splice-leader takes place before conventional splicing.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into non-canonical splicing mechanisms in eugids and diplids, which harbor atypical nonventional introns not observed in other eukaryotes. Nonventional introns do not have conserved characteristic spliceosomal borders or sequence to U snRNA at 5' end, but form stable secondary structure bringing exon/intron junctions. This conformation does not resemble self-splicing or tRNA introns. Nonventional introns insert at new positions, whereas conventional introns are conserved or lost. This study highlights the need for complete survey of nonventional intr on whole-genome.

**Title:** Long-term Consequences of Subclinical Coxsackievirus B3 Infection on Cardiac Progenitor Cells and Vascular Remodeling in Mice

**Background:** Coxsackievirus B (CV) is an enterovirus that commonly causes self-limited febrile illness in infants, but severe cases can manifest as acute myocarditis. The chronic consequences of mild CV infection are unknown, with an epidemiological association between subclinical infections and late-onset heart failure, suggesting potential for subtle damage leading to late-onset dysfunction or ongoing injury due to inflammatory reactions during latent infection.

**Research Question:** We investigated the long-term effects of subclinical Coxsievirus B3 (CV3) infection on cardiac progenitor cells and vascular remodeling in mice.

**Methods:** We established a mouse model of juvenile CV3 infection with a sublethal dose, which did not cause myocarditis or immune cell infiltration in the heart, but triggered apoptosis or premature differentiation of cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), resulting in a significant reduction in PC numbers within the adult heart. We infected three-day-old pups with a suble dose of eFP-CVB and examined hearts over time, observing a decrease in PC numbers in infected early life. After subjecting mice to cardiac stress via exercise or pharmacological induction, adult mice with sustained CV3 infection developed left ventricular hypertrophy and chamber dilation.

**Findings:** Viral protein (eFP) colocalized with c-kit and S-1, indicating infection of PCs in the heart, but not in surrounding myocardium, suggesting preferential targeting of PCs. Infection caused a sustained reduction in PC pool into adulthood. These results provide evidence that selfimited juvenile CV3 infection may have lasting effects on adult ability to undergo compensatory vascular remodeling under cardiac stress.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that subclinical CV3 infection may impair the heart's ability to increase capillary density in response to increased load, potentially contributing to late-onset heart failure. The preferential infection of PCs in the heart may be a key mechanism underlying the association between subclinical infections and late heart failure.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the long-term consequences of subclinical CV infection on cardiac progenitor cells and vascular remodeling in mice, highlighting the need for further investigation into the role of CV in heart disease.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of NLRC and NLRP in Caspase-1 Activation and Pyroptosis during Burkholderia pseudallei Infection

**Research Question:** How does Burkholder pseudalle, the causative agent of meloidosis, regulate IL-1 and IL-18 production through NL-like receptor NLRP and pyptosis via NLRC downstream pathways, and what are the mechanisms of cell death induced during B pseudalle infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of NLRC and NLR in caspase-1 activation and pyptosis in macrophages infected with Burkholder pseudalle using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and in vivo approaches. We analyzed caspase-1 processing and pypt in wild-type and caspase-1 deficient macrophages, as well as cells transfected with wild-type and mutated TSS3 effector proteins.

**Findings:** Our results show that caspase-1 processing and pypt is exclusively dependent on NLRC, not NLRP, in the early phase of macroph infection, whereas later casase-1 activation and death is NLRC-independent. We identified a pathway involving casases-9, -7, and PAR downstream of NLRC and casase-1. Analysis of casase-1-deficient macrophages revealed strong induction of apoptosis, dependent on activation of apoptotic initiator and effector casases. Early casase-1 activation in macroph was reduced or abolished after infection with B. pseudalle flagellin F or TSS mutant. Studies using transfected cells with wild-type and mutated TSS effector proteins indicated a role of this protein in casase-1 processing. TSS inner protein mutant failed to activate casase-1, revealed higher intracellular counts, reduced death and IL-β secretion during early but not late macroph infection.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate a major role for functional TSS in NLRC-mediated casase-1 activation pypt and contribution of casase-dependent and -independent cell mechanisms in pathogenesis B pseudalle infection.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of NLRC and NLR in casase-1 activation and pypt during B pseudalle infection, highlighting the importance of TSS in early NLRC-mediated casase-1 activation and pypt and contribution of casase-dependent and -in cell mechanisms in pathogenesis. Future studies will elucidate differences in casase activation signalling among pseudalle strains or Burkia spp. linked to virulence.

**Title:** KINγ Regulates Pollen-Stigma Interactions by Mediating Mitochondrial and Peroxis Biogenesis in Arabidopsis

**Research Question:** How does Kγ, a plant-specific subunit of the SNF-related kinase 1 complex, regulate pollen-stigma interactions during pollination?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Kγ in pollen-stigma interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant species. We analyzed the subcellular localization of Kγ in vegetative cells of pollen grains and examined the germination of γ mutant pollen on the stigma in vitro and in vivo.

**Findings:** Kγ is a cytoplasm and nucleus-localized protein in vegetative cells of pollen. γ mutant pollen failed to germinate on the stigma, but germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed compromised hydration of γ pollen on the stigma, which was rescued by adding water. γ mutant pollen exhibited reduced mitochond and peroxisome structure and numbers, and lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Overexpressing Arabidopsis CATAL 3, which reduces ROS, compromised pollen hydration on stigma.

**Implications:** Our results indicate Kγ is critical for regulating ROS levels by mediating biogenesis of mitochond and peroxomes in pollen, essential for pollen-stigma interactions during pollination.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanism underlying pollen-stigma interactions, highlighting the importance of Kγ in regulating biogenesis of mitochond and perox in pollen. Our findings suggest that compromised biogenesis of these organelles in γ mutant pollen leads to defective germination on the stigma, underscoring the significance of Kγ in pollen-stigma interactions.

**Title:** Essential Role of RNase III in Bacillus subtilis: Protection from Toxin Expression by Prophages via Antisense RNA Cleavage

**Research Question:** What is the role of RNase III in Bacillus subtilis, and how does it contribute to the organism's defense against toxin expression by prophages?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of RNase in Bacillus subtil by analyzing the degradation of toxin-encoding mRNAs, txA and yT, from Skin and SP prophages, both in vivo and in vitro.

**Findings:** Our results show that RNase is essential for Bacillus subtil to protect from expression of toxin genes borne by Skin and SP prophages via antisense RNA cleavage. We identified txA and yT as two toxin-encoding mRNAs sensitive to RNase cleavage, and explored the mechanism of RNase-mediated decay of txA mRNA paired with antisense RNA Rat in vivo and in vitro.

**Implications:** This study highlights the unique role of RNase in Bacillus subtil as a defense mechanism against viral infection, contrasting with other organisms that use RNase or its homologs as part of viral defense. Our findings indicate that RNase is not involved in rRNA metabolism or ribosomal maturation, but rather essential for degradation of toxin-encoding mRN from prophages.

**Conclusions:** Bacillus subtil requires RNase for survival, unlike other organisms where RNase is non-essential. We propose that RNase plays a critical role in protecting Bacillus from toxin expression by prophages via antisense RNA cleavage. This study contributes to our understanding of RNase function and its role in bacterial defense mechanisms against viral infection.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Parasite-Host Interaction through Parasite-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Brugia mal

**Research Question:** How do filarial nematodes, specifically Brugia malayi, modulate host biology through the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing bioactive proteins and RNA species, and what are the mechanisms of effector molecule trafficking and internalization?

**Methods:** We investigated the release of EVs across all intra-mammalian life stages (microfilar, L3, L4, adult, and female worms) of B. malayi using nanoparticle tracking analysis, revealing discrete vesicle populations and a conserved secretory process. Brug EVs were internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for life stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector trafficking. Proteomic profiling of adult and female EVs using nano-scale LC/MS/MS described quantitative and qualitative differences in adult proteome, defining biogenesis of Brug EVs and revealing sexual dimorphic immunomodulatory cargo. Ivermect was found to inhibit EV release by all Brug life stages, also observed in related filarial nemode Dirofilar imitis, but not in iverect-unresponsive isolate.

**Findings:**

1. Brug EVs are secreted by all intra-mamm life stages (microilar, L, L4, adult, and female) with consistent morphology and size consistent with exosomes.
2. Brug EVs are internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for life stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector trafficking.
3. Proteomic profiling of adult and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in adult proteome, defining biogenesis of Brug EV and sexual dimorphic immunomulatory cargo.
4. Iverect inhibits EV release by all Brug life stages, also observed in related filarial nemode Dirofilaritis, but not iver-unresponsive isolate.

**Implications:**

1. The release of EV by B. mal and other parasitic nematodes is a conserved mechanism for effector molecule trafficking.
2. Brug EVs are internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for life stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector trafficking.
3. Iverect inhibits EV release by all Brug life, suggesting a potential mechanism of action and new platforms for anti-filar drug development.

**Conclusions:**

This study elucidates the mechanisms of parasite-host interaction through parasite-derived extracellular vesicles in Brug mal, revealing a conserved secretory process across intraamm life stages. Brug EVs internalized by murine macrophages with no preference life, suggesting a uniform mechanism effector trafficking. Proteomic profiling of adult and female EVs described quantitative and qualitative differences in adult proteome, defining biogenesis Brug EV and sexual dimorphic immunomulatory. Iverect inhibits EV release by Brug life, suggesting a potential mechanism of action and new platforms for anti-filar drug development.

**Title:** High Prevalence of Scabies and Impetigo in Rural Communities of the Western Province of Solomon Islands: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Research Question:** What is the prevalence of scabies and impigo in rural communities of the Western Province of Solomon Islands, and what are the clinical and epidemiological associations of these conditions in this setting?

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 villages of the Western Province Solomon Islands. All residents were eligible to participate, and 190 people were enrolled. Participants were interviewed and examined by a pediatric registrar, who recorded demographic information, clinical diagnosis of scabies and/or impigo, and severity and distribution.

**Findings:** The unweighted prevalence of scabies was 19.2% (95% CI 17.5-21.0) and age and gender weighted 19.2 (95 CI 16.7-21.9). Adult prevalence of scabies was 10.4 (95 CI 8.2-13.2), highest in infants <1 year (34.1, OR 3.6, CI 2.2-6) and children 1-4 (25.7, OR 2.6 CI 1.7-3.9). Scabies affected two or more body regions 80.9 of participants, 4.4 cases classified as severe. Unweighted prevalence impigo 32.7 (CI 30.6-34.8), age and gender 26.7 (CI 24.2-29.5). Highest in children 1-4 (42.6, OR 4.1 CI 2.9-5.8). Sc infestation associated with impigo (OR 2.0 CI 1.6-2.6); 41.1 imp cases also had scabies.

**Implications:** Scabies and impigo are common in rural Western Province of Solomon. Sc infestation associated with impigo. Community strategies for sc control may reduce burden of both conditions and complications.

**Conclusion:** This study reports high prevalence scabies and impigo in rural Western Province Solomon. Age and gender adjusted prevalence lower than 1997 study from Malait Province. Our estimates consistent with comparable studies, suggesting standardized criteria for diagnosis in field settings would facilitate data collection and comparisons. Sc and imp place great burden on communities, consuming health resources.

**Title:** Genetic Regulation of Adult Neurogenesis in the Subgranular Zone of the Dentate Gyrus of the Hippocampus: A Novel Role for CD4+ T Lymphocytes

**Research Question:** This study investigates the relationship between cellular proliferation in the hippocampus and the proportions of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte subsets in outbred stock mice.

**Methods:** We analyzed cellular proliferation in the hippocampus of 719 heterogeneous mice and found a significant correlation with the proportions of CD4 and CD8 T cells. This correlation was driven by genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2a locus, which had a dominant influence on T subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. Knockout and repopulation of Tα-deficient mice subsets confirmed the influence of T cells on adult neurogenesis, indicating CD+ cells or subpopulations mediate the effect.

**Findings:** Our results reveal a broader impact of genetic variation on T cell development and homeostasis than previously suspected. Naturally occurring genetic variation is more physiologically relevant than abnormalities in knockout mice. The correlation between T cells and neurogenesis in the hippocampus is not an artefact of transgenic or knockout mice, but arises from subtle genetic loci that contribute to variation in cell proliferation.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest a novel role for CD+ T cells in adult neurogenesis, extending previous observations that T cells contribute to variation in adult neurogenesis. The relationship between T cells and proliferation in the hippocampus is significant, accounting for 6% of phenotypic variance. Higher hippocampal proliferation is associated with higher CD+ cells and lower CD+ cells and CD+/+ ratio.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a significant correlation between cellular proliferation in the hippocampus and proportions of CD and CD T cells in outbred mice. The correlation is driven by genetic loci that contribute to variation in cell proliferation also contribute to variation in CD and CD cells. Our results indicate a broader role for T function on adult neurogenesis than previously suspected.

**Title:** Efficacy of a Multi-Component DNA/Protein-Boost Vaccine (TVac2) Against Chagas Disease in a Murine Model

**Background:** Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major health problem in Latin America and emerging in the US. We previously screened the T. cruzi sequence database using computational/bioinformatics and identified antigens with vaccine potential.

**Research Question:** We investigated the efficacy of a multi-component DNA/protein-boost vaccine (TVac2) constituted of selected antigens and cytokines (IL-12 and GMF) expression plasmids in a murine C57/6 mice model.

**Methods:** Mice were immunized with antigen-encoding plasmids plus cytokine adjuv, followed by recombinant proteins and two weeks later challenged with T. cruz trypastigotes. ELISA and flow cytometry measured humoral (antibodyotypes) and cellular (ymphocyte, CD+ and CD+ T phenotype and cytokine responses. Myocardial pathology was evaluated by H&E and Masson's trich staining.

**Findings:** TVac induced strong antigen-specific antibody (Ig2>Ig1) and moderate lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon challenge, TVac-vaccinated mice expanded Ig2/Ig1 and elicited substantial CD+ T response with type 1 cytokines (IF-γ and TNα) resulting in control of parasite burden. During chronic phase, response persisted, splenic activation CD+ cells and IFγ/TNFα subsided, and IL/10 cytokines became dominant in vaccinated. Tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in heart and skeletal of TVac-vacc mice were undetectable histologically. In contrast, mice with vector or cytok only responded T. cruz by elicitation of mixed type 1/type 2 antibody, cell and cytok response and persistent burden in myocardium.

**Implications:** TVac activation of type 1 antibody and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute T. cruz infection and prevented evolution of immunopath associated parasite in chasic hearts.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates TVac efficacy in reducing parasite burden below detection limits in chasic animals. Immunized with TVac elicited strong parasite-specific response rapidly after T. cruz infection. The antigen candidates in TVac were conserved among clinically relevant T. cruz strains and expressed surface proteins in infective trypastig and intracellular amigote stages. TVac is a promising heterolog prime-boost vaccine approach.

**Title:** Improving Disease Risk Assessment for Complex Diseases using Machine Learning Approaches with Ensemble Markers

**Background:** Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified susceptibility loci for common diseases, but the question remains whether individual disease risk can be quantified based on genotype data for personalized prevention and treatment. Previous studies have failed to achieve satisfactory performance due to limited confirmed loci use.

**Research Question:** Can machine learning approaches with ensemble markers improve disease risk assessment?

**Methods:** We applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on a GW dataset for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and optimized a risk model with hundreds of markers. We tested this model on an independent Illumina-genotyped dataset (1,008 cases, 1,000 controls) and a separate Affymrix-genotyped dataset (1,529, 1,458 controls), achieving Area Under Curve (AUC) ∼0.84 in both. In contrast, poor performance was achieved with limited susceptibility loci in SVM or logistic regression.

**Findings:** Our study suggests disease assessment can be improved by algorithms accounting for interactions between ensemble markers. We are optimistic genotype-based risk may be feasible for diseases with notable risk captured by SNP arrays.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning approaches for disease risk assessment using large datasets. SVM achieved satisfactory performance with hundreds of SNPs, outperforming logistic regression and limited loci models. The model can account for additional variables, reducing false positives and leveraging established associated markers.

**Conclusion:** Recent GW studies have generated vast data for disease understanding, including risk using genetic profiles. Our results show computational robustness with non-contributing markers and established associated markers. This approach may facilitate personalized prevention and treatment for complex diseases.

**Title:** Circulating CD8+ T cells rapidly infiltrate non-lymphoid tissues to provide antigen-specific immunity and differentiate into cytolytic tissue-residents

**Research Question:** What is the fate of CD8+ T cells after entering non-lymphoid tissues, such as the skin, during a secondary infection, and how do they provide protective immunity against viral infections?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of circulating CD8 T cells in providing immunity against Vaccinia virus (Vac) infection in the skin and their differentiation into cytoly tissue-residents.

**Findings:** Contrary to naïve CD8 T cells, memory CD8 T cells traffic into the skin independent of CD62-mediated lymph node reactivation and provide robust immunity against Vac infection. Central memory (TCM) CD8 T cells, but not effector (TEM) CD8 cells, differentiated into functional CD69+/CD- tissue residents following viral clearance, dependent on local antigen recognition in the skin environment. Memory CD8 cells expressed granzyme B after trafficking the skin and utilized cytolysis to provide immunity against Vac infection.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that TCM CD8 cells become cytoly following rapid infiltration of the skin to protect against viral infection and differentiate into functional tissue-residents.

**Conclusions:**

1. Circulating memory CD8 T cells rapidly infiltrate nonlymphoid tissues, such as the skin, independent of CD62-mediated lymph node homing, to provide protective immunity against viral infections.
2. Central memory CD8 T cells differentiate into cytoly tissue-residents following viral clearance, dependent on local antigen recognition in the skin environment.
3. Memory CD8 cells express granzyme and utilize cytolysis to provide immunity against Vac infection.
4. The capacity of memory CD8 cells to home and survey peripheral lymph nodes does not play a major role in secondary response against local infection.
5. The primary feature of TCM that allows memory to provide immunity is their capacity to rapidly traffic into inflamed nonlymph tissues.

This study provides new insights into the protective mechanisms used by circulating CD8 cells during secondary infection in peripheral tissues and reveals information about prime-boost vaccination strategies generating memory cells in nonlymphoid tissues.

**Title:** Polarized Trafficking of Vesicle-Bound Membrane Proteins Gives Rise to Distinct Molecular and Functional Properties of Axons and Dendrites: A Role of Myosin VI in Axonal Enrichment

**Research Question:** How do myosin motors contribute to the polarized distribution of axonal and dendritic proteins in neurons?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Myos VI, a minus-directed motor, in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons in dissociated cortical neurons. We engineered non-neuronal proteins to interact with Myos VI and found them to be highly concentrated at the axonal surface. Disruption of Myos VI function or expression led to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins.

**Findings:** Myos VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface by stimulating dendrite endocytosis, a mechanism underlying localization of many axonal proteins. A version of Channelrhodin 2 engineered to bind to Myos VI was concentrated at the axonal surface of cortical neurons in vivo, suggesting a potential tool for probing circuit and function.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that myins shape the polar distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins, necessary for proper electrical signaling. The presence of vesicle in one compartment may explain why axonal and dendritic proteins are trafficked by distinct mechanisms in mammalian neurons.

**Conclusions:** Myos contribute to the enrichment of both axonal and dendritic proteins at the plasma membranes of appropriate compartments, playing a role in specifying polarized structure of neurons. This study highlights the importance of myos in polar trafficking of proteins in neurons.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Environmental Sex Determination in Daphnia magna: Identification of Dsx Genes and Implications for Sex Determination Pathways

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying environmental sex determination (ESD) in Daphnia magna, a freshwater branchiop crustacean that parthenogenetically produces males in response to environmental cues, and how do these mechanisms compare to genetic sex determination (GSD) in other organisms?

**Methods:** We identified two Dsx genes, DmaD1 and Dma2, in D. magna and analyzed their expression patterns, function, and effects on sex determination.

**Findings:** DmaD1, designated DmaD1, is responsible for male development during environmental sex determination, with a domain organization similar to Dsx in insects, thought to be the sister group of branchiop crustans. Intriguingly, DmaD1 exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in transcript abundance, not sex-specific pre-mRNA splicing, as in insects. During embryogenesis, Dma1 expression increased in males, and transcripts detected in male-specific structures. Knockdown Dma1 in males resulted in female traits, while ectopic expression in females resulted in male-like phenotypes. Dma2 expression patterns similar to Dma1, but silencing/overexpression did not induce clear phenotypic changes, establishing Dma1 as a key regulator of male phenotype.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal how ES is implemented by selective expression of a conserved genetic component, functionally in SD. We infer an ancient, previously unidentified link between genetic and environmental sex determination.

**Conclusions:** Dsx expression in sexually dimorphic tissues is key to induce differentiation in crustacean Dnia and insects. Our results establish Dma1 as a fundamental component of ES, conserved in SD, and suggest a previously unknown link between genetic and environmental sex determination.

**Title:** Evaluation of a Trivalent HSV-2 Subunit Vaccine in Rhes Macaques and Guinea Pigs for Prevention of Genital Herpes and HIV Transmission

**Research Question:** Can a trivalent HSV-2 subunit vaccine administered with CpG and alum induce protective immunity against genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection and reduce the risk of HIV transmission in rhes macques and guinea pigs?

**Methods:** We evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a trivalent HSV-2 subunit vaccine containing glycoproteins C, D, and E (g2, D, g2, E) in rhes macques and guinea pigs. Rhes macques were immunized with Cp and alum (mock) or the trivalent vaccine, while guinea pigs were immunized with mock, g2, trivalent, or trivalent followed by a booster of g2 (tr + D). Intravaginal challenge was performed in naïve and immunized rhes macques.

**Findings:** Inhes macques immunized with the trivalent vaccine produced robust IgG responses to each antigen, which waned over six months. The trivalent also protected against vaginal infection, although results were inconclusive due to small sample size. Immunized rhes macques developed mucosal IgG and IgA responses to all three antigens, with most robust to g2. CD4+ T responses were detected in one animal. Guinea pigs immunized with trivalent or tr + D showed 97% and 99% efficacy, respectively, in preventing genital lesions, outperforming g2 alone. Shedding of HSV-2 DNA was reduced in all groups compared to mock, with fewer days of replication competent virus in tr than g2, and none in tr + D.

**Implications:** The trivalent vaccine has potential for prevention of genital herpes in humans.

**Conclusions:** The trivalent HSV-2 subunit vaccine met immunogenic goals inhes macques and was highly efficacious in preventing lesions in guinea. Administering a booster of D minimally enhanced efficacy.

**Title:** Enhancing Genome-Wide Profiling of Protein-DNA Interactions in Highly Repetitive Regions using Perm-se: A Novel Read Allocation Method for ChIP-se Experiments

**Research Question:** How can we improve the accuracy of genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of the genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (Ch-se)?

**Methods:** We developed Perm-se, a prior-enhanced read method for Ch-se experiments that allocates multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of genomes with high accuracy. We evaluated Perm-se using 64 ENCODE Ch-se datasets from GM78 and K562 cells and identified novel protein-D interactions in segmental regions.

**Findings:** Our results show that Perm-se significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over standard approaches that do not utilize additional data. We found that protein-DNA sites in repetitive regions are evolutionarily conserved and share sequence characteristics with protein-D interactions in non-repet regions.

**Implications:** Perm-se enhances the capability of Ch-se for profiling repetitive regions, enabling the discovery of novel protein-D interactions in segment duplications. Our analysis reveals that protein-D interactions in repetitive regions share chromatin signatures with non-repet regions.

**Conclusions:** Perm-se is a novel approach that utilizes DNase-se and histone Ch-se data to allocate reads in repetitive regions with high accuracy. The Perm framework is versatile and enables incorporation of multiple data sources such as histone Ch-se for allocation. Our results demonstrate the utility of Perm-se in identifying novel protein-D interactions in segment duplications and highlight the importance of considering repetitive regions in protein-D interactions.

**Title:** Schistosoma Infection and HIV-1 Acquisition: A Nested Case-Control Study in Tanzania

**Research Question:** Does pre-existing Schistoma infection increase the odds of HIV-1 acquisition and affect HIV-1 viral load at the time of seroconversion, and do these effects differ between men and women?

**Methods:** We conducted a nested case-control study within a large population-based survey of HIV-1 transmission in Tanzania. Adults from seven villages were tested for HIV in 2007, 2010, and 2013, and dried blood spots were archived for future studies with participants' consent. Approximately 40% of the population had Schistoma mans infection and 2% had S. haematium. We tested schist antigens in pre- and post-HIV-1-serconversion blood of HIV-1 seroconverters and controls who did not acquire HIV-1. We calculated the odds of a person with schosoma becoming HIV-1-infected compared to matched controls, stratified by gender.

**Findings:** Women with schist infections had higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than those without (adjusted OR 2.8 [1.2-6.6], p=0.019). Schist-infected men did not have increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition (adjusted OR 0.7 [0.3-1.8], p=0.42). We compared HIV-1 RNA in post-serconversion blood of HIV-1 serconverts with schoma versus those without: median 4.4 [3.9-4.6] log copies/mL versus 3.7 [2-4.3], p=0.017.

**Implications:** Pre-existing schoma infection increases HIV-1 susceptibility in women and raises HIV-1 load at seroconversion. This is the first study to demonstrate schoma effect on HIV-1 susceptibility and viral control, differentiating effects by gender.

**Conclusion:** Our study confirms in an area with S. mansoni that pre-schoma infection increases HIV-1 odds in women and HIV-1 viral load at seroconversion. Approximately 218 million schoma-infected live in African countries with HIV-epidemics and ~6 million are HIV-co.

**Title:** Investigating Ribosomal DNA Copy Number and Sequence Variability in Human and Mouse Genomes: Implications for Cancer Development and Treatment**

**Research Question:** What is the relationship between ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number and sequence variability in human and mouse genomes, particularly in the context of cancer development and treatment?

**Methods:** We employed computational and droplet digital PCR approaches to measure rDNA copy number in normal and cancerous states in human and mouse genomes. We utilized a Pten-/- mouse model for leukemia in the C57Bl background to assess rDNA in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, human cancer genomes exhibit a loss of rDNA copies accompanied by global copy number co-variation. The sequence is also more variable in cancer genomes. Genomes with lower rDNA have mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity. PTEN phosphatase, a tumor suppressor, is critical for genome stability and negative regulator of the mTOR pathway. Surprisingly, hematopoietic cancer cells from P-/- mice have lower rDNA number than normal, despite increased rRNA production and protein synthesis. Loss occurs early and is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage.

**Implications:** rDNA copy loss is a recurrent feature in cancers with mTOR activation. Ribosomal DNA number may be a simple indicator of cancer sensitivity to DNA treatments.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that rDNA copy and sequence can change in cancer, with mTOR activity associated with contractions and DNA damage. With this recognition comes the possibility to target these loci. Cancer cells with low copy may be sensitive to DNA agents. The loss of copies is not immediate upon PTEN loss, consistent with results in HSC that short-term mTOR inhibitor treatment does not alter copy. In hematietic stem cells, robust growth and ribosome biogenesis occur with ~–40 fewer rDNA. In yeast, loss rDNA is associated with sensitivity to damage.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Bacterial Growth, Death, and Spread within Mammalian Hosts: A Spatiotemporal Population Dynamics of Salmonella enterica Infections

**Research Question:** The mechanisms governing bacterial growth, death, and spread within mammalian hosts remain poorly understood, particularly when studying a single bacterial population. We aimed to investigate the spatiemporal dynamics of Salmonella enterica infections using a multidisciplinary approach.

**Methods:** We employed wild-type and isogenic tagged (WTS) strains of Salmonella enterica, phenotypically identical but distinguishable by quantitative PCR, in wild-type mice. This enabled probabilistic modeling to estimate bacterial death rates based on strain disappearance over time.

**Findings:** Our analyses revealed that shortly after infection, concomitant death and rapid replication led to establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in organs, controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased mortality led to exponential increase in bacteria locally, with subsequent mixing between organs via bacteremia and stochastic selection.

**Implications:** This study provides an unprecedented insight into the pathogenesis of S. enterica infections, illustrating complex and stochastic effects driving disease. The novel method presented can be applied to diverse host-pathogen combinations, facilitating comprehensive understanding of spatiemporal within-host dynamics.

**Conclusions:** Our integrated approach unraveled variations in demographic processes driving spatiemp events, leveraging concepts from population ecology to derive quantitative information from experimental data. The use of tagged strains transformed our understanding of host-pathogen interactions, providing information for mechanistic models, hypotheses, and predictions.

**Title:** Revisiting the Inverse Problem of Binocular 3D Motion Perception: A New Insights from Velocity and Disparity Constraints

**Research Question:** Can existing schemes of 3D motion perception, such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding motion and disparity, solve the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion?

**Methods:** We evaluated existing models of 3D perception and binocular 3 motion, demonstrating that they are insufficient to solve the inverse problem of binocular 3 motion. Using binocular geometry, we derived constraints on velocity and showed that additional information is necessary to disambiguate local constraints and derive velocity.

**Findings:** Late integration of motion and disparity with other cues solves the inverse problem of local 3 motion, allowing the system to remain flexible when segmenting local inputs from different stages into a global 3D percept. Geometrically, intersection of two planes in binocular geometry defines a line in 3 velocity space. We suggest that tracking features in depth with binocular velocity provides a flexible strategy to disiguate 3D direction and solve the inverse of 3 perception.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that velocity and disparity from tracking are necessary to solve the inverse of 3 motion. It is plausible that motion and disparity are processed in parallel and integrated in the visual hierarchy.

**Conclusions:** The inverse problem of binocular 3 motion remains unresolved due to the underdetermined nature of local constraints. Late integration of motion and disparity with other cues provides a convincing solution to the problem of local 3 motion, adding a functional aspect to the notion of parallel streams of disparity and motion processing. We propose two plausible strategies: (1) normal slow motion in 3D and (2) cyclopean based on slow in 2. Predicting motion for ambiguous provides an opportunity to distinguish between strategies of 3D processing.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of AlgJ in Alginate Acetylation: A Structural and Functional Insights into the O-Acetylation of Polysaccharides in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

**Research Question:** What is the role of AlgJ in the O-acetylation of alginate, a key component of the biofilm matrix formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients?

**Methods:** We determined the structure of AlgJ to 1.83 resolution and functionally characterized the protein. We compared the abilities of Alg and AlgX to bind and O-acetylate alginate using electrospray ion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) assays.

**Findings:** AlgJ is a SGN hydase-like protein with a conserved catalytic triad of D190, H192, and S288, and exhibits acetylease activity in vitro. Residues in the Alg signature motifs form an extensive network critical for Oetylation of alginate in vivo. Alg exhibits weak or no detectable binding to polymannonic acid, while Alg binds specifically in a length-dependent manner. Additionally, Alg utilizes surrogate acetyl donor 4-nitrophenyl acetate to catalyze Oety of polymannonic.

**Implications:** Our results, combined with previously published in vivo data, suggest Alg and Alg have distinct roles in Oetylation. Our refined model for alg acetylation places Alg as the terminal transferase, providing a rationale for variability in proteins required for polyschar Oety.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the role of Alg in alginate Oety, a key step in biofilm formation by Pseudas aeruginosa. Our structural and functional characterization of Alg provides insights into the mechanisms of polyschar Oety, a common modification used by pathogenic organisms to protect against external forces. The distinct roles of Alg and Alg in alginate Oety highlight the complexity of this process, underscoring the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of biofilm formation.

**Title:** Unmasking Candida albicans: The Role of Phosphatidser Synthase and MAP Kinase Pathways in β(1,3)-glucan Exposure and Immune Detection

**Research Question:** How do phosphatidser synthase and MAP kinase pathways regulate β(1,3)-glan exposure and immune detection in Candida albicans?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of phosphid synth and MAP kinase pathways in β(1,3)-an exposure in Candida albicans using a homozygous mutant, choΔ, which exhibits increased β(1)-an exposure. We analyzed the activity of MAP kinases C1 and M1 and their upstream GTPases C42 and R1 in choΔ and wild-type cells. We also examined the effect of disrupting MK1 and hyperactivating R1 in wild cells.

**Findings:** Our results show that C1 and M1 are constitutively activated in choΔ and act downstream of C42 and R1, respectively. Hyperactivating R1 in wild cells increases β1 exposure and activates C1 and M. Moreover, hyperactivating the kinase Ste11 in wild cells leads to C1 activation and β1 exposure. We conclude that upregulation of the C1 MAP pathway causes β1 exposure and may be responsible for unmasking in choΔ.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that phosphid synth and MAP pathways play a crucial role in β1 exposure and immune detection in Candida alb. Enhancing β detection by immune cells could improve antifungal strategies. The C1 MAP pathway may be a target for future antifungal therapies.

**Conclusions:** Candida alb diminishes detection by immune cells through β1 masking with an outer layer of glycosylated mannrote. However, mutations or drugs disrupt the cell wall can lead to β exposure and detection by immune cells like Dect-1. Our study shows that phosphid synth and MAP pathways regulate β exposure. The C1 MAP pathway may be responsible for unmask in choΔ. Enhancing β detection could improve antif strategies.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: Unveiling New Insights into Molecular Pathogenesis

**Research Question:** What are the genetic loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, and how do they relate to specific neuropathologic features?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study of known risk loci for AD using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropath data defined clinico-pathologic AD or controls, coreath features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibr tangles, NFT), and coorbid neuropath changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CA), Lewy disease (LD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and brain injury (BI).

**Findings:** Genome-wide significance was observed for clin-path AD, NPs, NFT, CA, and LD with variants in apolipoprotein E (APO), GAL7, ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), and intergenic on chromosome 9. Twelve of 21 non-APO genetic loci for clin-defined AD were confirmed in clin-path sample: CR1, BIN, CL, MS4A, PICAL, ABC, CD, TK, SOR, MEF, ZW, and C with 9 of 12 showing odds ratio in clin-path. Correlation effect sizes for AD with NFT or NPs showed positive, while for V showed negative. Co-mor neuropath features showed nominal association with known loc.

**Implications:** Our study reveals new genetic associations with neuropath features and aligns known risk AD with specificath changes in the largest autopsy of AD and dementias. The APO locus was strongly associated with clin-path AD, as expected. The International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) has identified 21 genetic loci with AD using clinically ascertained datasets, confirming APO. We aimed to determine alignment AD loc and neuropath features to clarify molecular mechanisms underlying characteristic lesions. Our study enhances and diminishes known risk loc, highlights subset as potential drivers neuropath AD, and discovers new loc with specificath features.

**Conclusions:** This genome-wide study of brain autops enhances and diminishes known risk loc AD, highlights subset as potential drivers neuropath AD, and discovers new loc with specificath features. Our findings suggest genetic stratification of risk for common causes cognitive impairment in older individuals. The APO locus was strongly associated clin-path AD, as expected. The IGAP has identified 21 loci AD using clinically ascertained datasets, confirming APO. Our study aims to determine AD loc and neuropath to clarify mechanisms underlying lesions.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Urea in Protein Unfolding: A Molecular Dynamics Simulations Reveal Robust Rules for Urea Unfolding at the Proteome Level

**Research Question:** Despite decades of using urea as a denaturant, the kinetic role of this molecule in the unfolding process remains undefined: does urea actively induce protein unfolding or passively stabilize the unfolded state?

**Methods:** We employed extensive molecular dynamics simulations using a range of force fields to analyze a set of 30 proteins representative of all native folds to derive robust rules for ure unfolding valid at the proteome level.

**Findings:** Irrespective of protein fold, presence or absence of disulfide bridges, and secondary structure, urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of quasi-native proteins with a density lower than the fully unfolded state. The presence of ure does not alter spontaneous protein vibrations; instead, it reduces their magnitude, leading to a counterintuitive slowdown of atomic motions opposing unfolding. Urea's stickiness and diffusion, however, are crucial for unfolding. Long urea molecules placed around hydrophobic cores stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Our simulations indicate ure does not favor formation of partially open states; it is not a mere spectator of unfolding simply displacing the folded→unfolded equilibrium. On the contrary, ure actively unfolds: selects and stabilizes partially microstates, driving the conformation ensemble far from native and conformations sampled during thermal unfolding.

**Implications:** Our results provide a robust and complete picture of ure's role in destabilizing folded states and mechanisms contributing to protein unfolding.

**Conclusions:** Urea, a protein denaturant used for decades, has unclear denaturing properties. The dominant "direct" mechanism claims ure interacts with exposed residues more strongly than water. Our simulations (8M ure at 368K) show unfolding signals in microseconds, but progress smaller than reduced proteins. Unfolding at 368 after 1sec is not dependent on fold, nor structure, and similar with/without disulf bridges. This study presents difficulties; ure's effect on early unfolding might depend on native structure. To obtain valid conclusions, representative folds should be addressed. Results can be force-dependent; robust conclusions require variety of force-fields.

**Title:** Epidemiology of Dengue Disease in Colombia: A Systematic Review (2000-2012)

**Research Question:** This systematic review aimed to describe the epidemiology of deng disease in Colombia between 2000 and 2012, focusing on national and regional trends, incidence by age and sex, seroprevalence, and serotype distribution, and other relevant epidemiological data.

**Methods:** A comprehensive literature search of published epidemiological studies on deng disease was conducted using the terms "deng", "epemiology", and "Colomb" in English and Spanish databases between January 2000 and February 2012. 225 citations were identified, of which 30 fulfilled the inclusion criteria.

**Findings:** The epidemiology of deng disease in Colombia was characterized by a stable baseline annual number of deng fever cases, punctuated by major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. Geographical spread of deng cases showed a steady increase, with most of the country affected by 2010. The majority of deng cases recorded during the period were among <15 years old.

**Implications:** Gaps in epidemiological knowledge regarding deng disease in Colombia provide avenues for future research, including studies on asymptomatic deng virus infection, primary infections, and underreporting of disease. Improved understanding of factors determining disease expression enables improvement in disease control and management.

**Conclusion:** This systematic review provides an overview of deng disease epidemiology in Colombia between 200 and 201 in the context of national and regional trends. Incidence by age and sex, serrevalence and serotype, and other epidemi data are described. The review highlights the number of non-severe deng disease for 201 in Colombia. A lack of information regarding asymptomatic d virus, primary infections, and factors for severity and underreporting d in Colombia may be addressed by improved surveillance.

**Title:** Coinfections with Leishmanias: A Review of Frequency, Interactions, and Implications for Clinical Practice

**Research Question:** What is the frequency of coinfections with Leishiasis in human populations, interactions between Leish and other pathogens in animal and human models, and implications of coinfections for clinical practice?

**Methods:** A comprehensive review of 73 records from MEDLINE and other databases, including 21 studies in animal models and 52 in human subjects (mainly cross-sectional and case studies).

**Findings:** Coinfections are frequent, with Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection reported in 41% of patients in Argentina and helminthias in 15-88% of patients in Brazil. Mechanisms of interaction between microorganisms unclear, may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting quality and quantity of immune responses. Diagnostic problems occur when concurrent infections cause similar lesions (e.g., TL and leprosy), pathogens present in same lesions (e.g., Leish and Sporothrix schenii), or phylogenetically close pathogens affect accuracy of tests (e.g., serology leishias and Chagas). Coinfections reduce effectiveness of antileman treatment and drug combinations cause cumulative effects.

**Implications:** Coinfections frequent in TL patients lead to diagnostic errors, delays and influence effectiveness and safety of treatment. More research needed to unravel how coinfections interfere with pathogenesis TL.

**Conclusion:** This is the first review of literature on TL coinfections other than HIV. Coinfections add complexity of TL outcome of single Leish infection in humans difficult to predict, impact of coin on TL course puzzling. Nevertheless, coinfections clinically relevant, frequent, lead to errors, delays, and influence treatment effectiveness and side effects.

**Title:** Genetic Variation in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Affects CD4:8 Lineage Commitment and MHC Expression: Identification of Underlying Genes in the MHC Region

**Research Question:** The genetic variation in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) affects CD4:8 lineage commitment and MHC expression, but the contribution of specific genes in this gene region has not been resolved, nor has it been established whether the same genes regulate MHC expression and T cell selection.

**Methods:** We assessed the impact of genetic variation on MHC expression and CD4:8 lineage commitment using two genetic models in rats. First, we mapped Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with variation MHC I and II protein and CD:8 cell ratio in outbred heterogeneous rats. We identified 10 QTL across the genome and found that QTL for individual colocalized within a region spanning MHC. To identify genes underlying QTL, we generated a panel of M-recombinant congenic strains and refined QTL to adjacent intervals ∼0.25 Mb in M-I and II regions.

**Findings:** An interaction between these intervals affected M class expression as well as selection lineage of CD8-positive (SP) thymocytes. We mapped effect to transporter with antigen 2 (Tap) in M-II and classical M class gene (RT-A) in M-I. This was revealed by recombination between RT-A and Tap, which occurred 0.2% of rats. Variants Tap have been shown to influence antigenicity M class molecules by altering M class ligand. Our results show a restricted repertoire M class molecules leads to negative selection CD8 cells.

**Implications:** This is the first study showing a recombination between natural alleles in M influences commitment T cells. We also found that majority QTL for traits did not co-local, suggesting variation M not a determinant CD8 cell ratio. We isolated intervals associated phenotypic variation M since mapping HS did not distinguish single gene pleotropic or M genes controlled expression and CD8 cell ratio.

**Conclusions:** Two haplotypes in M-I and II control expression and selection rats. Recombination these broke evolutionary linkage RT-A and Tap affected selection lineage CD8. This was associated TapB allele dependent co-expression RT-A. Our results suggest that levels M and polymorphisms other than classical genes, such as antigen processing, contribute variation.

**Title:** Chagas Disease in Spain: A Retrospective Study of Hospitalizations from 1997 to 2011

**Research Question:** This study aimed to describe the epidemiology of Chagas disease hospitalizations in Spain between 1997 and 201, using the National Health System's Hospital Discharge Database (CMB).

**Methods:** A retrospective study was conducted using CMB information on hospitalizations with Chagas disease diagnosis, divided into two periods: 199-2004 and 200-201. Hospital rates and clinical characteristics were calculated, and multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) for association between conditions and hospitalization with organation.

**Findings:** A total of 172 hospitalizations were identified, with rates of 18.2/100,000 and 24.8/100,000 for the two periods, respectively. Median age was 35 (0-87), 74, with 69.8% in the 16-45 age group. 23.4% hospitalizations included Chagas with complications. Being male, aged 45-64, and hospitalization above 3,065 euros were associated with organation.

**Implications:** Since 2005, detected infections increased in Spain. Asymptomatic patients, fertile women, and conditions with organation underline need for early detection of T. cruzi.

**Conclusion:** This study describes Chagas hospitalizations in Spain for the first time, highlighting the need for increased efforts towards early detection of T. cruzi.

**Title:** Elucidating the "Missing Heritability" of Complex Diseases: A Novel Systems-Level Approach to Identifying Combinatorial Genetic Associations using Blocuster

**Research Question:** Despite the identification of hundreds of genetic markers associated with complex diseases, the "missing heritability" remains elusive. Combinatorial interactions are thought to account for a substantial portion of this missing heritability, but their discovery has been hindered by computational complexity and genetic heterogeneity.

**Methods:** We present Blocuster, a novel systems-level approach that constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks to segregate homogenous combinations of genetic factors, tests associations with given phenotypes, and rigorously validates results using unbiased methods. Blocuster employs a customized correlation measure for single nucleotide polymorphisms and captures genetic heterogeneity.

**Findings:** We applied Blocuster to psoriasis, discovering a combinatorial pattern with an odds ratio 3.64 and Bonferr-corrected p-value 5.01×10−16. This was replicated in independent data, reflecting the robustness of the method.

**Implications:** In addition to improving disease prediction and broadening understanding of pathogenesis, these results demonstrate Blocuster's potential for discovering combinatorial associations within genome-wide data, transcending limitations of "small" effects by individual markers examined in isolation.

**Results:** We applied Blocuster to genome-wide data for psoriatic cases and controls, identifying a bloc of alleles significantly associated with psoriasis, improving previous results by supplying allelic pattern within major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Our network-based result is advantageous over conventional GWAS, as shown in Table 2, the highest ratio for single SNP is 2.41 (rs12177). In contrast, entire bloc unit exhibited ratios 3.45 (Table 1). Employing unbiased, allele network approach, Blocuster identified bloc, consisting of 17 alleles highly-correlated, exhibiting psatic association with ratio 3.64 (2.75-4.80) and Bonerr-corrected p 5.01×10−16 in discovery. This bloc had ratio 3.86 (2.98-5.01) and p-value in independent data.

**Conclusion:** Using Blocuster, we identified novel combinator genetic associated with psoriasis, improving previous results by providing genetic fingerprint 17 alleles supplying information along 211 kb in M region. This was computationally validated in independent data.

**Title:** Large-Scale Chromosomal Copy Number Variation in Congenital Brain Malformations: A Systematic Analysis of ACC, Cerebral Hypoplasia, and Polymicrogyria

**Research Question:** We investigated the prevalence of large chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) in patients with corpus callosum (ACC), cerebral hypoplasia (CBL), and polymicrogyria (PM) compared to controls.

**Methods:** We conducted a large-scale CNV discovery effort in 255 ACC, 220 CBL, and 147 PM patients and 2,349 controls. We analyzed CNVs that impacted at least 1% of the population and compared to controls.

**Findings:** Significantly more ACC, but not CBL or PM patients had rare CNVs over 1 megabase (p=1.48×10-3; odds ratio [OR]=3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.89-5.39). Rare CNVs impacted at least 1% of combined patients and controls. Significantly more ACC, but not CBL or PM patients had CNVs over 20 genes (p=0.01; OR=2.95; 95 CI=1.69-5.18). Independent PCR confirmation showed 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which preferentially overlapped with previously observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders (p=3.06×10-4; OR=7.55 95 CI=2-23.72).

**Implications:** This study is the first systematic analysis of CN in congenital brain malformations, showing higher prevalence of large gene-rich CNVs in ACC than CBL and PM. Our hypothesis that genomic burden of rare CN will be higher in patients than controls was supported for ACC, but not CBL and PM. Hypothesis of enrichment of de novo CN in cohort was supported for ACC, but not CBL or PM.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the complexity of genetics in ACC, CBL, and PM, and the need for further investigation in all three groups. Our findings will facilitate interpretation of CN results in developmental disorders and discovery of underlying genes and pathways.

**Title:** The Hippo Signaling Effector Yorkie Integrates Multiple Aspects of Injury Response in Planarian Regeneration

**Research Question:** How does the Hipp signaling effector Yorkie regulate the integration of proliferation, differentiation, and patterning during planarian regeneration in response to injury?

**Methods:** We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown of Yorkie in the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterrane to investigate its role in regeneration. We analyzed wound-induced gene expression, cell proliferation, and patterning in Yorki (RNA) animals compared to controls.

**Findings:** Yorki RNA animals exhibited hyperactivated and prolonged proliferative and transcriptional wound responses, with increased epidermal and muscle cell populations. We identified novel wound-induced genes repressed in Yorki RNA animals compared to controls. Furthermore, Yorki animals failed to sense the size of an injury, resulting in inappropriate brain, gut, and midline remodeling.

**Implications:** Our results suggest York functions as a key molecule integrating multiple aspects of injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury transcription, and patterning.

**Conclusions:** York plays a crucial role in regulating the stereotyped proliferative and transcriptional responses to injury in planarian regeneration. York RNAi animals display hyperactivated and prolonged proliferative and transcriptional wound responses, with increased epider and muscle cell populations. We identified novel wound-induced genes repressed in York RNA animals compared to controls. York animals fail to sense the size of an injury, resulting in inappropriate brain, gut, and midline remodeling. Our findings suggest York integrates multiple aspects of injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury transcription, and patter.

**Title:** Exosomes Mediate EV71 Infection by Packaging Viral RNA and miR-146: A Novel Mechanism of Viral Transmission and Immune Evasion

**Research Question:** How do exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells facilitate viral transmission and immune evasion through packaging of viral RNA and miR-146?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of exosomes in EV71 infection by analyzing exosome secretion, packaging, and transfer of viral RNA and miR-146 in recipient cells.

**Findings:** EV71 infection upregulated exosome secretion and differential packaging of viral RNA and miR-146. Exosomes contained replication-competent EV71 RNA complexed with miR-146, Ago2, and GW182, mediating EV71 transmission independent of virus-specific receptors. Exosomal RNA was transferred and replicated in new cells, while exosomal mi-146 suppressed type I interferon response, facilitating viral replication. IF-stimulated factors (ISGs), BST-tether, regulated EV-induced exosome secretion. In vivo, exosomal RNA exhibited differential accumulation compared to free particles.

**Implications:** Our findings provide evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package high miR-146, facilitating EV71 replication in recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response.

**Conclusions:** Exosomes play a crucial role in EV71 transmission and immune evasion by packaging viral RNA and mi-146. Exosomal mi-146 suppresses type I interferon expression in recipient cells, facilitating viral replication, while exosomal RNA is transferred and replicated in new cells. IF-stimulated factors regulate EV-induced exosome secretion. In vivo, exosomal RNA accumulates differentially compared to free particles.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanism of Interaction between PINK and Parkin: A Novel Insights into Mitochondrial Homeostasis Regulation

**Research Question:** How do PINK and Parkin regulate mitochondrial activity, and what is the molecular mechanism underlying their interaction?

**Methods:** We employed biochemical purification of PINK-binding proteins from human cells and screened genes encoding these proteins using Drosophila PINK (dINK) models to isolate molecules involved in PINK pathology.

**Findings:** We identified a PINK-binding protein, PG5 (PG), which modulates the PINK pathway. Loss of Drosila PG5 (dPG) suppresses muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan resulting from dINK inactivation, attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. Conversely, dPG inactivation fails to modulate phenotypes park mutant flies. Ectopic expression dPG exacerbates dINK and Dophila park (Park) phenotypes.

**Implications:** PG5 regulates PINK-related maintenance of mitochondria, acting between PINK and Park, or independently of Park downstream PINK.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that mitochondrial-localized PG5 modulates the PINK pathway in Dophila. Further research is required to elucidate PG5 regulation of PINK at the molecular level and determine if PG5 manipulation might provide therapeutic advantage in P1-associated PD.

**Key Findings:**

* PINK is a serine/threon kinase with predicted mitochondrial sequence and probable transmembrane at N-termin
* Park is RING finger protein with ubiquitin ligase 3 activity
* PINK and Park regulate mitochondrial activity largely unknown
* Biochemical purification of P-binding proteins from human cells screened genes encoding using Dophila PINK (dINK) models isolate molecules involved PINK pathology

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Interferon-γ in Host Defense Against Mycobacterium ulcerans Infection: Implications for Buruli Ulcer Pathogenesis and Vaccine Development

**Research Question:** What is the role of interferon-γ (IFNγ) in host defense against Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcer) infection, and how does it impact the progression of Buruli ulcer (BU) disease?

**Methods:** We employed an experimental Buruli ulcer mouse model to investigate the role of IFγ in early immune defense against M. ulcer infection. Wild-type (WT) and IFγ knockout (KO) mice were infected with a highly virulent M. ulcer strain, and disease progression was monitored over five weeks.

**Findings:** IF knockout mice displayed accelerated disease progression, reflected in faster tissue necrosis and oedema formation, and higher bacterial burden compared to WT mice, indicating reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during early intra-macroph growth phase.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate a key role of IFγ in early defense against M. ulcer infection, supporting the view that concepts for tuberculosis vaccine development may be valid for BU.

**Conclusions:** IFγ activation of macrophage bactericidal activity helps contain infection during intracellular stages of M. ulcer. Early intra-mroph growth plays a crucial role before extracellular clusters of mycolone bacteria form, and IFγ production is impaired by mycolone build-up. Our study highlights the importance of IF in host defense against M. ulcer and supports the potential for vaccine development against BU.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Anoxia-Induced ROS Production in Mitochondria: A Novel Insights from Mathematical Modeling and Experimental Validation

**Research Question:** How does anoxia induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, and what are the underlying mechanisms that govern this process?

**Methods:** We developed a novel methodology to mathematically model the electron transport in mitochondria, accounting for all possible redox states in the process of electron transport through respiratory complex III. A set of hundreds of differential equations was constructed to facilitate this task, allowing for the identification of two steady modes of operation (bistability) of complex III under the same environmental conditions.

**Findings:** Our modeling revealed that complex III can operate in either a low or high ROS-producing mode at the same parameters, explaining the difference in ROS generation before and after anox episodes. Experiments qualitatively validated the existence of two ROS steady states in isolated mitochondria at the same conditions and possibility to switch between them by temporal presence of AD and/or anox. Significantly higher ROS levels were released upon resumption of oxygen after anox.

**Implications:** Recognition of bistability of complex operation may enable novel therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. Our method can be widely used in systems studies.

**Conclusions:** Ania-induced ROS production in mitochond is a complex process governed by bistability of complex III, which can switch from low to high ROS mode upon anox and persist after return to normal oxygen. This mechanism explains anox-induced cell damage. Our mathematical modeling and experimental approach opens new avenues for detailed analysis of bioenergetic systems, including other parts of electron chain and central metabolism.

**Title:** Investigating the Regulatory Role of the Terminal Gene Hb (h) in the Gap Gene Network of Drosophila melanogaster: An Integrative Systems Approach

**Research Question:** How does the terminal gene H (h) regulate the expression of gap genes in the Drosila melanogaster embryo, and what are the implications for our understanding of the gap network dynamics?

**Methods:** We employed an integrative systems approach to investigate the regulatory effect of the terminal gene H (h) on gap gene expression in the Drosila melanaster embryo. Quantitative data for H protein expression were obtained, enabling the inclusion of H in gap circuit models. Gap circuits, mathematical models of gene networks, were used to extract regulatory information from spatial data by fitting models to expression patterns and obtaining estimates for parameters predicting network topology.

**Findings:** Our results show that H is involved in the regulation of the posterior hunch (hb) domain, but has no other essential function. Specifically, H is required for the anterior shift of the posterior border of this domain, which is reproduced in our models. Gap circuits presented are able to reproduce mutants of terminal genes, while previous models were unable to reproduce null mutants correctly. Our models capture the expression of posterior genes and variational properties of the system.

**Implications:** This study contributes to a better understanding of developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap network. Gap genes constitute the first zygotic tier in a regulatory cascade leading to determination of body segments along the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis during the blastoderm stage. They are involved in regulation of pair and segment-polarity genes, establishing segmental pre-expression by gastrulation. The addition of terminal gene H to the model is significant, as it is regulated by gap genes and an external factor. Regulatory and external inputs are summarised in Figure 1 (right). Modelling does not predetermine specific interactions within the network.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the power of integrative systems approach in understanding gene regulation. Quantitative data for H expression were used as input to new gap models, obtaining estimates for parameters and topology. Least Squares (LS) and Weighted Least Squares (WLS) functions were used, with the latter producing consistent and well-determined estimates. An integrated time-series of H expression was combined with equivalent data for other gap from FlyBase for modelling and fitting. Gene circuits were used to simulate dynamics of expression. Our results confirm previous studies using gap circuits, with significant improvement in reproducing the shift of posterior domain.

**Title:** Successful Immunotherapy of Brucellos in Cattle using Phage Lysates of Brucella Abortus Strains 19 and 51

**Research Question:** Can phage lysates of Brucella abortus strains 19 and 51 be used as effective immunotherapeutic agents to treat Bruclos in cattle, and can Bruc specific RNA be used as a biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy in a minimally invasive manner?

**Methods:** This study investigated the immunotherapeutic potential of phage lysates of Bruc abortus strains 19 and 51 in naturally Bruclos affected adult cattle. Bruclos positive cows were divided into four groups: Group I (n=6) immunized with Bruc abortus 19 lysate, Group II (n=5) immunized with Bruc 51 lysate, Group III (n=5) immunized with cocktail of 19 and 51 lysates. Bruc specific RNA in plasma was used as biomarker to monitor the effect of therapy in a non-destructive and minimally invasive manner.

**Findings:** Phage lysates of Bruc abortus 19 and 51 induced strong antibody and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses. In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from immunized cattle induced interferon production. A single subcutaneous dose of 2ml of cocktail lysate (19 and 51) eliminated virulent Bruc from Brlos affected cattle, with Bruc specific RNA undetectable by RT-PCR and negative for Bruc culture in 3 post-immunization.

**Implications:** This is the first report on minimally invasive monitoring the efficacy of antibacterial therapy employing Bruc specific RNA as biomarker and the use of 51 phage lysate for immunotherapy Bruclos in cattle. Bruc lysates were considered safe in mice. Bruc abort 19 and 51 phage lysates were used to prepare immunotherapeutic agents, which were injected once in Brlos affected cattle at dose 2 subcutaneously. Trials were carried out on 21 Brlos affected adult cows.

**Conclusions:** Phage lysates of Bruc abortus 19 and 51 are effective immunotherapeutic agents for Bruc in cattle. Bruc specific RNA can be used as biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy in a minimally invasive manner. Bruc abort 19 and 51 phage lysates induced strong antibody and CMI responses. In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from immunized cattle induced interferon production. Single subcutaneous dose of 2 of cocktail (19 and 51) eliminated virulent Bruc from Br affected cattle, with Bruc RNA undetectable by RT-PCR and negative for Br culture 3 post-immun.

**Title:** Uncovering the Specific Role of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (Cdk2) in DNA Damage Response and Repair in Human Cells

**Research Question:** How do cyclin-dependent kinases (CDs) regulate cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage, and what is the specific role of Cdk2 in this process?

**Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the function of Cdk in human cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). We replaced wild-type Cdk with a mutant version sensitized to inhibition by adenosine analogs and selectively inhibited C2 activity with small molecules. We analyzed the effects on cell survival, DNA repair, and checkpoint signaling.

**Findings:** Transient inhibition of C2 after IR enhanced cell killing, whereas C2+ cells were not affected. Selective inhibition of C2 delayed NBS1-Ser432 phosphorylation, a critical for DNA repair and checkpoint signaling. Mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased IR-sensitivity. In vivo, inhibition of C2 diminished N1-S432 phosphorylation during S phase.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a non-redundant requirement for C2 activity in response to DNA damage and identifies a specific target of C2 within the repair machinery. C2 phosphorylates N1-S432, a component of the MRN complex, required for DNA repair and checkpoint signaling.

**Conclusions:** C2 plays a crucial role in orchestrating an effective DNA response to damage, distinct from other CDKs. Its activity is necessary for phosphorylation of N1-S432, a key event in DNA repair and checkpoint. Our findings uncover a C2-dependent pathway in human DNA damage response and provide tools to identify additional targets within this pathway.

**Title:** Elucidating the Functional Mechanisms of Genetic Variants Associated with Hematological and Cardiovascular Traits through Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE) in Megakaryocytic and Erythroblast Cells

**Research Question:** The challenge of translating genetic discoveries from genome-wide association studies (GWA) into biological mechanisms is a significant in human genetics. Many GWA signals map outside exons, suggesting that associated variants may lie within regulatory regions. We aimed to apply the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) method in megakarycytic and erythroblast cell lines to map active elements at loci associated with hematological traits, coronary disease, and myocardial infarction.

**Methods:** We profiled chromatin at 62 non-redund genetic loci representing known associations with cardiovascular traits (Table 1) in megarycytic (MK) and eryblast cell (EB) lines using FAIRE, applying different formaldehyde cross-linking times and hybridization to a custom 385,000-oligonucleotide array (Materials and Methods).

**Findings:** We observed distinct patterns of chromatin in the two cell types, with cell-specific chrom guiding the finding of functional variants. Identified an open chrom region at chromosome 7.22.3 in megaryocytes but not eryblasts, harboring the non-coding variant rs342 known associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing this region in 643 individuals provided strong evidence that rs342 is the putative variant. Demonstrated C- and G differentially bind transcription factor EV1 affecting PI3CG expression in platelets macrophages. Protein-protein interaction network in PikCG knockout mice indicated PI3 is associated with pathways in plate membrane biogenesis and thrombus formation.

**Implications:** rs342 is the functional variant at this locus, the first elucidated among platelet quantitative loci (QTL). Our data suggest a molecular mechanism by which non-coding GWA SNP modulates plate phenotype. Loci associated with plate counts, SHB-ATN and P, have been reported with coronary disease and myocardial infarction, suggesting a role as intermediate. Our maps of chrom generated FA in megarycy and eryblast cell at G loci associated hematological traits and CAD MI.

**Conclusions:** The intersection of chrom with variants through G studies facilitates search for underlying variants. We applied FA to generate a catalog in megary and eryblast cell at selected loci associated hemat and cardiovascular traits. Report differences chrom among the cell and assess phenotypic causality variants in Ns to either type. Demonstrate with locus 7.22, associated plate function, identify site in megary but erybl and elucidate molecular contributing phenotype.

**Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Pharmacological Blockade of Persistent Sodium Currents in Respiratory Rhythmogenesis

**Research Question:** How do distinct pharmacological mechanisms of voltage-gated ion channel blockers affect the blockade of persistent sodium current (INa) in respiratory rhythmogenesis, and what are the implications for interpreting experimental data?

**Methods:** We employed computer simulations to investigate the blockade of INa in the preötzinger complex (preöt) respiratory neurons via two pharmacological mechanisms: (1) pore obstruction by tetrodotoxin (TX) and (2) altered inactivation by ruzole (R).

**Findings:** Our simulations matched a wide array of experimental data from isolated preöt neurons to intact respiratory networks and generated experimentally testable predictions. Specifically, we (1) provided a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory results in vitro studies of INa block, (2) showed effects of INa block in vitro are not equivalent to intact preparations, (3) explained ruz failure to block INa in intact network, and (4) predicted effective block of INa by low tetrootoxin will stop respiratory rhythm in intact network.

**Implications:** Our results support a critical role for INa in respiratoryogenesis in vivo and highlight the importance considering mechanism when interpreting pharmacological blockade data. We demonstrate that assumption of equivalent effects of blockade may not always be correct, and distinct mechanisms of blockers can lead to diverse outcomes.

**Conclusions:** This study provides mechanistic insights into pharmacological blockade of INa and its role in respiratory rhythmogenesis. Our simulations predict that (1) ruz may fail to block INa in intact due to specific pharmacological mechanism and network interactions, (2) pre bursting in network is dependent on both inhibitory interactions and INa, and (3) tetroxin application will terminate respiratory rhythmicity. These findings have implications for understanding respiratory rhythm generation and interpreting pharmacological data.

**Title:** MicroRNA-218 Regulates Gastric Cancer Metastasis through a Negative Feedback Loop with Robo1 and Slit

**Research Question:** How does microRNA-218 (mi-218) regulate gastric cancer metastasis in gastric cancer (GC) and what is the underlying molecular mechanism?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of mi-218 and its host gene Slit in GC tissues and cell lines. We generated a Rob1 construct with a fragment of the mi-218 binding site and a Rob1 mutant lacking the 3-UTR. We also made Rob1 siRNA. Immunohistochemistry and clinicopathological studies were performed on 40 cases of GC and matched normal tissues and metastases.

**Findings:** mi-218 expression was decreased in GC, especially in metastatic GC. Rob1 was upregulated in GC, especially metastatic GC, with low mi-218 expression. Rob1 was a downstream target of mi-218. Induction of Rob1 by the Rob1 construct without the mi-218 site reversed mi-218 suppression of tumor invasion. Knockdown of Rob1 by RNAi reduced invasion similar to restoration of mi-218. Rob1 was not the only target of mi-218 relevant to metastasis.

**Implications:** The Slit-mi-218-Robo regulatory circuit is disrupted in GC metastasis. Targeting mi-218 may block metastasis.

**Conclusions:** Our results provide new insights into metastasis mechanisms in GC and a novel regulatory mechanism of receptor signaling. Rob1 is overexpressed in cancer and promotes angiogenesis and metastasis via interaction with Sl. The Slit-Robo pathway is activated by Rob1 and Sl2 interaction, facilitating invasion and metastasis. Restoration of mi-218 suppresses Rob1 and inhibits invasion and metastasis in vitro and vivo.

**Title:** Identification of Cholesterol-Responsive Atherosclerosis Genes and Their Role in Preventing Advanced Plaque Formation

**Research Question:** Despite the well-documented benefits of plasma lipid-lowering in halting atherosclerosis development and reducing morbidity and mortality of coronary artery disease and stroke, the transcriptional response mediating these effects in atherosclerotic lesions has not been carefully investigated.

**Methods:** We performed transcription profiling at 10-week intervals in atherosclerosis-prone mice with human-like hypercholesterolemia and genetic switch to lower lipoproteins (Lr−/−po/100Mflox/floxM1re). Atheroscler lesions progressed slowly, then rapidly, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of lesion profiles indicated accumulation of lipid-p macrophages led to rapid expansion with foam formation and inflammation, supported by histology. Genetic lowering plasma (e.g., liproteins) at this point prevented formation advanced plaques and transcription profiling atheroscl arterial wall identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating effect.

**Findings:** We identified a network of atherosclerosis genes responding to plasma-lowering preventing formation advanced plaques. This network is of interest for development atherosclerosis therapies. We used Lr/−/Apo/100Mflox/floxMre mouse model with lipop profile similar familialchole (Lr/−/ob/100) and genetic block hepatic synthesis liprote lower liprote (Mflox/fre) to investigate effects cholesterolowering atheros development and identify cholesterol-responsive atheros genes.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a network cholesterol-responsive atheros target and foam formation regulators. To investigate mechanisms atheros arterial wall by lowering cholesterol preventing formation, we performed gene profiling mRNA from mice sacrificed after plasma lowering Cre-recombination M in liver (S). mRNA thirty atheros genes strongly responded lowering (Table). Cholesterolowering mediated by atheros genes. Validation macrophage part genes by profiling mRNA-targeted TH1macroph incubated AcLD regulatory network foam formation. This network and nodes (PV2 and H2) considered therapies prevent formation plaques.

**Conclusions:** We first genome-wide profiling identified point atheros developed slowly low-level inflammation present. Lesions expanded rapidly, inflammation markedly increased. Inflammation persisted late leading formation plaques, but size transient 10-week period. Our study highlights cholesterol-responsive atheros genes and their role preventing advanced plaque formation, providing insights novel atheros therapies.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Gram-Negative Bacterial Envelope Assembly: A High-Throughput Screening Reveals Novel Factors and Vulnerabilities for Therapeutic Targeting

**Research Question:** What are the key factors involved in the assembly of the Gram-negative bacterial envelope, and how can they be targeted for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies?

**Methods:** We developed a quantitative, high-throughput assay to screen for mutants with envelope biogenesis defects and applied it to an ordered single-gene library of Escherichia coli. The screen was robust and identified numerous known and unknown factors involved in envelope assembly.

**Findings:** The screen implicated 102 genes of unknown function encoding factors that likely impact biogenesis, one of which, Ely (YC), was characterized and shown to play a critical role in metabolism of the essential lipid carrier for biogenesis of wall and surface polysaccharides. Further analysis of Ely and other hits is likely to uncover new information on biogenesis of Gram-negative envelope and vulnerabilities for drug targeting.

**Implications:** This study provides a mechanistic understanding of Gram-negative envelope assembly, essential for the development of novel antimicrobial therapies. The screening approach is adaptable to other organisms to study biogenesis of different architectures.

**Conclusions:**

The Gram-negative bacterial envelope is a formidable barrier to antimicrobial drugs, with limited treatment options and rising resistance. A detailed understanding of envelope assembly is crucial for new therapies. Recent progress has been made in identifying essential biogenesis systems, but many aspects remain uncharacterized. We developed a high-throughput assay for mutants with biogenesis defects and screened an ordered-gene library of Escheria coli, identifying known and unknown factors. One factor, Ely, was characterized and shown to play a critical role in lipid metabolism for biogenesis. Further analysis of E and other hits is likely to reveal new information on biogenesis Gram-negative and vulnerabilities for drug targeting. The screening approach is transferable to other organisms to study biogenesis different architectures.

**Title:** Multivariate Dynamics in Biology: Fusing Heterogeneous Datasets through Semi-supervised Learning

**Research Question:** How can we integrate heterogeneous datasets from various imaging modalities to reveal multivariate dynamics in biological systems, such as developmental patterning in Drosophila?

**Methods:** We propose a semi-supervised learning framework that exploits the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets to fuse heterogeneous data from different imaging modalities, including gene expression, subcellular localization, protein phosphorylation, and morphogenesis.

**Findings:** Our approach successfully reconstructs a continuous trajectory of joint dynamics for gene expression, subcellular localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis in a dataset of ∼1000 images of Drosophila embryos. We demonstrate that our method can be adapted to other imaging modalities and serves as a starting point for further data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.

**Implications:** This work addresses the challenge of synthesizing multivariate dynamics from heterogeneous datasets collected from imaging of live and fixed tissues, a non-trivial task due to limitations. Our semi-supervised approach provides a closed-form expression for estimated values of variables using harmonic extension, enabling advanced mechanistic studies of multivariate processes responsible for reproducible developmental pattern formation.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that semi-supervised learning can be applied to multivariate dynamics in biological systems, such as developmental patterning in Dophila, by fusing heterogeneous datasets from imaging modalities. Our method can be adapted to other imaging modalities and serves as a starting point for further data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.

**Title:** Comparative Analysis of Snake Venom Hemorrhagic Metalloproteinases (SVMPs) of PI, PII, and PIII Classes: Tissue Localization, Hydrolysis of Basement Membrane Components, and Proteomic Analysis of Exudates

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the tissue localization and hydrolysis of basement membrane (BM) components by snake venom hemorrhagic metalloproteinases (SVMPs) of PI, PII, and PIII classes, as well as proteomic analysis of exudates collected from tissue injected with these enzymes.

**Methods:** Immunohistochemical localization of SVMPs with type IV collagen revealed that PII and PIII enzymes co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillaries to a higher extent than PI, which showed a more widespread distribution in tissue. Patterns of hydrolysis by these SVs of lamin, type collagen, and nidogen in vivo differed, whereas the three showed similar degradation of type IV, supporting destabilization of microessel structure leading to hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of exudate revealed similarities and differences between the action of three SVs.

**Findings:** Higher proteolysis was observed for PI regarding extracellular matrix and fibrin, whereas exudates from injected with PII P SVs had higher amounts of intracellular proteins.

**Implications:** Our results provide novel clues for understanding mechanisms by which SVs induce microvascul damage and hemorrhage.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of microessel damage and hemorrhage induced by SVs. Proteomic analysis constitutes a window through which details of toxin-induced tissue alterations unobserved by traditional histological analyses can be detected. Findings reveal distinct tissue localization of SVs, with P and P enzymes showing association with microvas, contrast to which had more distribution in tissue.

**Title:** Regulation of Hox Genes in Drosophila melanogaster: Posterior Dominance and Transcriptional Interference**

**Research Question:** How do the Hox genes in Drosila melanogaster regulate the expression of anterior and posterior segments, and what are the mechanisms underlying this regulation?

**Methods:** We investigated the regulation of Hox genes in Drosilaogaster, specifically focusing on the interaction between abdominal-A (ab-A) and abdominal-B (Abd-B) genes. We analyzed the expression of ab-A in embryos lacking Ab-B and found ectopic expression of ab in the epidermis of the 8th abdominal segment, but not in the central nervous system. We identified a 92 non-coding RNA, iab-8, which produces a microRNA that represses ab-A and a second, redundant mechanism acting in cis.

**Findings:** Our results show that iab-8 represses ab-A through two mechanisms: production of iab miRNA acting in trans and a repressive function acting in cis. Transcriptional interference with the ab promoter is the most likely mechanism. We found that i-8 interferes with an ab enhancer, which must lie downstream of the i-6 breakpoint, as ab-A is derepressed in PS13 CNS embryos homozygous for this break. The ab promoter is the likely target of interference, as the major (A) site of i-8 lies 1.1 kb upstream of initiation of ab-A and i-8 transcript continues past poly(A) site. We also found that i-8 represses ab on the chromosome from which it is transcribed, as shown by strong ab-A misexpression in PS13 CNS of embryos. Control for potential effect of haploinsufficiency of i-8, we tested mi-i8 deletion over Df9, which removes entire bithor complex, and found no misexpression ab-A in PS.

**Implications:** Our study reveals two mechanisms of regulation of Hox genes in Dilaogaster: posterior dominance and transcriptional interference. Posterior dominance is qualified by Ab-B, which represses ab-A in the 8th segment, but not in CNS. Transcriptional interference is a likely mechanism, as i-8 interferes with ab enhancer, which must lie downstream i-6 breakpoint. This study highlights the complex regulation of H genes in Dilaogaster and the importance of transcriptional interference in gene regulation.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the regulation of H genes in Dilaaster, specifically the interaction between ab-A and Ab. Our findings demonstrate two mechanisms of regulation: posterior dominance and transcriptional interference, and highlight the importance of transcriptional interference in gene regulation. This research contributes to our understanding of developmental biology and gene regulation.

**Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Focal Seizure Onset: A Computational Modeling and Clinical Insights

**Research Question:** Do low-amplitude fast (LAF) and high-amplitude (HAS) oscillations, two distinct patterns of focal seizure activity, arise from fundamentally different mechanisms?

**Methods:** We employed a previously established computational model of neocortical tissue, validated using clinical recordings of focal seizures, to reproduce and investigate the onset of both patterns. We analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of each pattern, focusing on the role of surrounding tissue excitability.

**Findings:** Our simulations revealed that LAF is initiated by localized patches of activity invading the surrounding tissue, whereas HAS is a global transition to a seizure state triggered by a local event. We found that this transition is enabled by increased excitability of healthy surrounding tissue, which does not generate seizures but supports seizure activity when initiated. The difference in tissue excitability also explains clinical differences in surgical outcomes.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that surrounding tissue excitability plays a crucial role in seizure onset and surgical outcome. We propose that changes in tissue excitability can be elucidated using stimulation.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first spatio-temporal interpretation of distinct mechanisms underlying LAF and HAS. Our model reproduces not only onset but also evolution of seizures, highlighting the importance of surrounding tissue excitability in seizure dynamics. The findings have implications for understanding and treating focal seizures, particularly in relation to surgical outcomes.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of Pollen Tube Arrest and Sperm Release in Flowering Plants: The Role of ZES-4 in Maize

**Research Question:** How do flowering plants regulate pollen tube growth and sperm release during fertilization, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms involved?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of ZES-4, a cysteine-rich protein secreted by the female gametophyte, in pollen tube arrest and sperm release in maize. Using RNAi knockdown and synthetic ZES proteins, we found that ZES induces pollen tube burst in a species-prefer manner. We also identified the potassium channel K1 (KM) as a direct target of ZES, which opens upon ZES application and closes after wash-out.

**Findings:** ZES-GFP proteins accumulate in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature syner cells and are released during fertilization. Upon pollen arrival, ves contents are released and disappear within 24 hours. RNAi knockdown of ZES results in pollen tubes failing to release contents and occasional overgrowth inside the egg. Chemically synthesized ZES induces pollen rupture in vitro in species-prefer manner. ZES converts KM from voltage-dependent rectifier to non-rectifying channel.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that ZES-containing vesicles are released from syner cells upon male-female gamophyte signaling, interacting with KM, leading to channel opening and K influx. K influx leads to water uptake and osmotic tube burst. The species-prefer activity of Z indicates this mechanism represents a prezygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals the molecular mechanisms of pollen tube arrest and sperm release in flowering plants, highlighting the role of Z-4 in maize. Further research will investigate how pathways are connected and evolved, such as FER or LRE signaling leading to ZES secretion, and interaction with homologs Arabidopsis ACA2+ pumps.

**Title:** Systemic Delivery of HER-2-Targeted Oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Reduces Disseminated Tumors in Mouse Models of Ovarian and Breast Cancer

**Research Question:** We investigated the efficacy of systemically delivered HER-2-targeted oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) in reducing disseminated tumors in mouse models of ovarian and breast cancer.

**Methods:** HER-2-targeted oncolytic HSV (RM) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to immunodeficient Rag−/−;2− mice bearing SK-OV-3 ovarian carcinoma cells, which recapitulated the peritoneal carcinomatosis seen in advanced human ovarian cancer patients. We also assessed the effect of RM on ovarian and breast metastases of HER-2+ DA-MB-453 cells.

**Findings:** i.p administration of RM strongly inhibited peritoneal carcinosis, with 60% of mice free from peritone diffusion and 95% reduction in total neoplastic nodules. Intraperitone metastases are common in breast cancer; i.p administration of RM inhibited growth of ovarian metastases. Brain metastases were also reduced. RM effectively reduced growth of ovarian and breast disseminated to peritone cavity.

**Implications:** HER-2-targeted oncol HSV is effective against HER-2+ trastumab-resistant cells, an important for clinical application of RM. Previously, we showed RM exerts anti-tumor activity against subcut-injected human ovarian cancer. Here, we evaluated therapeutic activity of RM against intraper (i.p) cancer, most frequently to lungs, peritone organs, bones, brain, and peritone cavity.

**Conclusions:** Systemically administered HER-2-redirected oncolytic HSV effectively inhibits peritone dissemination of HER+ ovarian and mam carcinomas. This model can be employed to evaluate oncol therapy of HER+ ovarian carcinoma. RM is retargeted to human HER2, unlikely to infect cells with endogenous murine HER2, if present. RM infects cells with high HER2 surface expression, suggesting viral replication in ovarian and brain HER+ metastases. RM exerted strong antimast effect against peritone metastases, with some effect on extraper metastases.

**Title:** Centrosome Duplication Once per Cell Cycle is Essential for Bipolar Spindle Formation and Genome Maintenance: Control by Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (Cdk)

**Research Question:** How is centrosome duplication regulated to ensure bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance during mitosis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) in controlling centrosome duplication, focusing on S1, a conserved component of centrosomes, as a potential Cdk substrate.

**Findings:** We found that reducing Cdk phosphorylation of S1 by changing phosphorylation sites to non-phosphorylatable residues leads to defects in separation of duplicated spindle bodies (SPBs, centrosomes) and inappropriate SP reduplication during mitosis. Cells display defects in bipolar assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that phosphorylation of S1 by Cdk has a dual function: promoting SP separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SP reduplication. Additionally, we provide evidence that protein phosphatase C14 has a converse role in activating, likely dephosphorylation of S1.

**Conclusions:** Our results support the model that Cdk phosphorylation of S1 is required for SP separation and block SP reduplication (Fig. 4). Specifically, we propose that after SP duplication is complete, C phosphorylates at least S1-terminal residues, allowing SP separation and bipolar formation during mitosis. Centros serve as poles of the mitotic spindle in eukaryotic cells, and centome duplication once per cycle is critical for bipolar organization and chromosome segregation. Aberrant centome numbers are linked to chromosomal instability and observed in cancers; thus, mechanisms restricting to single are essential.

**Key Findings:**

* C-terminal residues remain phosphorylated during mitosis, restricting SP duplication until downregulation of mitotic cycl/Cdk at end.
* Dephosphorylation S1 by C14 at end mit licenses SP for next cycle G1 SP duplication.
* Previous research shows SP separation requires mit cycl/Cdk [2, 36, 37] and Cdk phosphorylation S1 terminus [14, 38].
* Budding yeast deletion all mit cyclins leads redup of pole bodies (SP, centomes), indicating cycl/Cdk blocks redup.
* Decrease C1 activity eliminates block redup, allowing SP to become licensed or competent for duplication [2].
* Nonosphory S1 mutations lead premature SP redup during mitosis, pointing S1 as first Cdk target blocking redup.

**Implications:** Our study identifies S1 as the first Cdk substrate controlling centome duplication to once per cycle, essential for bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance.

**Title:** The Role of Viral Protein Vpr in HIV-1 Infection and AIDS Development: A Novel Insights from a Humanized Mouse Model

**Research Question:** The precise role of viral protein V (Vpr) in HIV-1 infection and its contribution to AIDS development remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that V can cause G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HIV-1-infected cells in vitro, and is conserved in transmitted/founder HIV-1 and primate lentiviruses. However, direct evidence in vivo has not been demonstrated.

**Methods:** Using a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model, we investigated the role of V in HIV-1 infection.

**Findings:** We demonstrated that V causes G2 cell arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CCR+ CD+ T cells, mainly consisting of regulatory T (Tregs), resulting in T depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. V-dependent replication and T depletion were observed in C5-tropic but not CX4ropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting these effects are dependent on coreceptor usage by HIV-1. Immune activation was observed in C5-tropic wild-type but V-deficient HIV-1-infected humanized mice.

**Implications:** These results suggest V takes advantage of proliferating C5 CD+ cells enhancing viremia C5ropic HIV-1. Tregs exist in higher state than other cell subsets, making them vulnerable to exploitation by V during acute HIV-1 infection.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to directly demonstrate V positively affects HIV replication by exploiting Tregs vivo. Our findings indicate V plays a crucial role in accelerating Cropic HIV-1 propagation during acute infection by utilizing C5 proliferating CD T cells, including Tregs. These results have significant implications for understanding HIV-1 pathogenesis and development of AIDS.

**Title:** Temporal Dynamics of Plasmodium vivax Population Structure in South Korea: A 14-Year Longitudinal Study using Microsatellite DNA Markers

**Research Question:** To investigate the population structure and temporal dynamics of Plasium vivax in South Korea and evaluate the effectiveness of malaria control measures by analyzing microsatellite DNA markers.

**Methods:** We analyzed 14 microsatellite loci of P. viv genome from 163 isolates collected in South Korea from 1994 to 2008. Allelic data were used to assess linkage disequilibrium (LD), genetic differentiation, and population structure to estimate temporal changes in the parasite population.

**Findings:** Our results showed a gradual decrease in LD levels and genetic differentiation between successive years, indicating a drastic change in the Korean population in 2002-2003. Although relapse and asymptomatic parasite carriage may influence population structure, our results suggest continual introduction of P. viv from other sources, particularly North Korea in 2002-2003.

**Implications:** Molecular epidemiology using microsatellite of P. viv population is effective for assessing population and transmission dynamics, assisting elimination of vivax malaria in endemic areas.

**Conclusion:** This 15-year longitudinal study on P. viv population in Korea using highly polymorphic markers assessed population and temporal dynamics in a more detailed manner than previous study. We increased microsatellite loci from 10 to 14 and sample size from 87 to 163 isolates, performing genetic analysis on differences between populations successive years. Our results suggest introduction of P. viv from North Korea in 2002-200, influencing population structure. Molecular epidemiology using polymorphic DNA markers is effective for assessing population and transmission dynamics, assisting elimination of vivax in endemic areas.

**Title:** Enhancement of Transcription by Splicing-Competent Intron is Evolutionarily Conserved among Eukaryotes: Mechanism of Promoter Directionality Regulation**

**Research Question:** How does a splicing-competent intron regulate promoter directionality in transcription in eukaryotes?

**Methods:** Employing strand-specific transcription run-on (TRO) analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we investigated the role of splicing-competent intr in regulating promoter directionality of transcription in yeast.

**Findings:** Our results show that the presence of a splicingcompetent intr favors transcription of mRNA over antisense transcripts initiating from the promoter. Mutation of either the 5' or 3' splice site reverses promoter direction, indicating that the entire splicing-compet intr, not just the 5' splice site, regulates directionality. ChIP analysis reveals recruitment of termination factors near the promoter in the presence of intr, but not in its absence. Removal of intr or mutation of splice sites affects termination factor localization.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that splicing-compet intr-dependent gene looping is crucial for recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-proximal region of intr-containing genes. In a looping-defective mutant, despite normal splicing, promoter occupancy of termination factors for poly(A)-dependent transcription is compromised, accompanied by loss of directionality.

**Conclusions:** We propose that splicing-dependent looping places terminator-bound factors near the promoter for termination of promoter-initiated antisense transcription, conferring directionality. This mechanism is distinct from non-intr genes, which rely on specific activators for looping. Our study highlights the importance of splicing-compet intr in regulating promoter directionality transcription in eukotes.

**Key findings:**

* Splicing-compet intr favors mRNA transcription over antisense initiating from promoter
* Mutation of 5 or 3 splice site reverses direction
* ChIP reveals termination factors near promoter in presence intr, not absence
* Removal intr or mutation affects termination factor localization
* Looping is crucial for termination factor recruitment in intr-containing genes
* Looping-defective mutant normal splicing, but compromised termination occupancy
* Splicing-dependent looping places termination factors near promoter for direction

**Title:** Identification of ZBED as a Repressor of IGF2 in Placental Mammals: Implications for Muscle Growth and Development

**Research Question:** What is the role of ZBED in regulating IGF2 expression in placental mammals, and how does its disruption affect muscle growth and development?

**Methods:** We identified ZBED, a previously unknown repressor of IGF2 in placental mammals, derived from an exapt DNA transposon. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing in C2C12 myoblasts revealed 2,500 ZBED binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif matching the IGF2 binding site. We silenced ZBED in C2C12 mylast and observed effects on IGF expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation.

**Findings:** Silencing ZBED led to increased IGF expression, cell proliferation, myotube formation, and wound healing. Genes associated with ZBED sites showed significant enrichment in Gene Ontology classifications, including development and transcriptional regulation. Phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED-silenced C12 mylast suggest Z's importance in placental development, proliferation, and growth.

**Implications:** Disruption of ZBED's interaction with IGF leads to 3-fold upregulation of IGF in skeletal muscle and altered body composition. This is consistent with increased IGF expression in skeletal muscle of pigs carrying the mutation at ZBED site in IGF intron 3. Silencing ZBED also increased cell proliferation, myotube formation, and wound healing. Z's ability to interact with chromatin and regulate transcription is likely derived from ancestral transase. Nucleolar localization suggests it mediates transcription silencing by moving IGF locus and targets to nucleus.

**Conclusions:** ZBED is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, proliferation, and growth. Its interaction with IGF represses I2 in skeletal muscle and C12 cells. Disruption of this interaction leads to increased IGF expression and altered body composition. Silencing Z in C12 mylast affects IGF expression, proliferation, myube formation, and wound healing, suggesting its role in placental development and growth.

**Title:** Elucidating the RNA Editome of Macaque: A Comparative Analysis of RNA Editing in Rhesus Macaque Reveals Insights into Mechanism, Evolution, and Function

**Research Question:** What is the extent and nature of RNA editing in rhes macaque, a close relative of human, and how does it relate to its evolution and function?

**Methods:** We combined genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same rhes mac to identify 31,250 editing sites, with 99.8% being A-to-G transitions. We verified 96.6% of sites in coding regions and 97.5% in non-coding regions using multiple means, demonstrating the feasibility of our paradigm.

**Findings:** Evidence supports adenosine deamination associated withhes mac editome A-G sites flanked by ADAR substrates, and sequence and expression of ADs influence editing variance across sites and tissue types. Substitution divergence was detected around editing sites, suggesting evolutionary constraint maintaining these substrates with double-stranded structure.

**Implications:** Thehes editome highlights RNA as a widespread regulation in primate evolution, providing a framework for understanding editing in human.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a representative account ofhes RNA-editing sites acrosshes genome for interrogation of edit attributes. Large-scale sequencing allowed comparative analysis, revealing intra-population conservation and parallels across primate species. We tested whether cross-species similarities were maintained by purifying selection or lower sequence divergences. Local context of editing was important, implicated in AD substrate formation. RNA-Seq estimation may be less accurate for sites with lower coverage; mass-based platform verified intra-population conservation. Thehes edit provides evolutionary context for RNA regulation in human, emphasizing editing as a form shaped by purifying selection.

**Title:** Perceptual Bias in Two-Alternative Spatial Frequency Discrimination: A Novel Insights from Spectrally Filtered Noise

**Research Question:** How does spectrally filtered noise affect the perception of spatial frequency in two-altern discrimination tasks, and what are the implications for our understanding of neural decoding and perceptual processes?

**Methods:** In this study, we investigated the effect of spectrally filtered noise on the perception of spatial frequency in a two-altern discrimination task. We presented gratings at high contrasts, corresponding to 84% correct detection thresholds in broadband noise, and measured grating detectability and discriminability in the presence of filtered noise. We used low-pass and high-pass filtered noise to induce asymmetry in the likelihood function of spatial frequency.

**Findings:** Our results show that spectr filtered noise significantly alters the perception of spatial frequency, shifting it to lower and higher frequencies in low-pass and high filtered conditions, respectively. Notably, observers consider likelihood of spatial frequencies a-priori unlikely to occur, leading to bias in perceived frequency. Log functions are asymmetrical around vertical grating frequency in the presence of low and high filtered noise. High performance and steep psychometric functions indicate that observers base decisions on vertical grating spatial frequency.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel percept bias in two-altern spatial discrimination, highlighting the impact of spectr filtered noise on perception. Unlike traditional psychophysical models, our results suggest that noise affects not only variability but also the average response. Our findings have implications for understanding neural decoding and perceptual processes, particularly in the context of signal uncertainty. We propose that observers evaluate likelihood of a broad range of frequencies, discarding prior knowledge of alternatives, when performing two-altern discrimination.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into perceptual bias in two-altern spatial discrimination, demonstrating the effect of spectr filtered noise on perceived frequency. Our results challenge traditional psychophysical models of visual encoding gratings in noise, suggesting that noise alters not only variability but also the average response. This has implications for understanding neural decoding and perceptual processes, particularly in the presence of uncertainty.

**Title:** Autonomous Transcriptional Regulation of piRNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans: A Novel Insights into piRNA Expression and Germline-Specificity

**Research Question:** How are piRNAs (pi-interacting RNAs) transcribed and regulated in Caenorhabdis elegans, and what determines their germl-specific expression?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of computational and in vivo transgenic approaches to investigate the transcriptional regulation of piRNAs in C. elegans. We developed a novel transgenic system to study the expression of germl-enrich, Pi-dependent piRNAs and identified a conserved upstream motif necessary for their expression. We also analyzed the germl enrichment of C. eleg piRNAs and their target genes to determine if they have evolved independently.

**Findings:** Our results show that C. elegans piRN are autonomously transcribed, with a minimal 21-nt piRNA sequence and ∼50-nt upstream motif required for expression. The conserved motif specifies which sequences are expressed as piRN, how abundantly they are expressed, and in which germl. We found that over 70% of C. eleg piRN are selectively expressed in male or female germl, with germl enrichment enforced by a single nucleotide within the motif. We demonstrated autonomous expression of synthetic 21RNAs from minimal transgenic cassettes containing only the core motif, ∼nt intervening spacer, 21 RNA, and ∼-100 flanking context.

**Implications:** Our study reveals the number of transcriptional units encoding piRN in C. elegans rivals the number of mRNA genes in the genome. The conserved motif encodes information for germl-specific expression of 21 RN, suggesting a novel mechanism for piRNA regulation. We also show that clustered organization of endogenous pi loci is dispensable for robust pi expression, indicating each 21 locus encodes necessary information for independent transcription.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide novel insights into piRNA transcription and germl-specificity in C. elegans, shedding light on how specific sequences are designated as piRN. The conserved motif acts as a promoter to specify which sequences are expressed, how abundantly they are, and in which germl. This study has implications for understanding piRNA function and regulation in other organisms, where piRN play a critical role in defending against foreign genetic elements.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Brucella Species Replication within Host Cells: A Novel Insights into the Role of the Unfolded Protein Response and ER-Derived Vacu Formation

**Research Question:** How do Brucella species replicate within host cells in the form of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles, and what are the mechanisms by which they acquire a continuous membrane supply for replication?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and ER-derived vacu formation in Bruc replication using a combination of biochemical, microscopic, and genetic approaches.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that during Bruc infection, the IRE pathway, but not PER and ATF6, of the UPR was activated in a time-dependent manner, and COI vesicle components Sar, Sec23, and Sec24 were upregulated. We observed a marked accumulation of ER-derived vacuoles around replicating bacteria using fluorescent and electron microscopy. Identified a novel host factor, YipA, for activation of the IRE pathway in response to tunicamycin treatment and infection with Bruc. Found that YipA is responsible for phosphorylation of IRE through high-order assembly of Ire molecules at ER exit (E) under UPR conditions. YipA-knockdown, Bruc failed to generate ER-derived vacoles and remained in endosomal/lysosomal compartments.

**Implications:** Activation of the IRE pathway and formation of ER-derived vacoles are critical for Bruc to establish a safe replication niche, and YA is indispensable for these processes. Autophagy-related proteins Atg and WI, but not D, required for biogenesis of ER-derived membrane compartments. Our findings propose a model for intracellular Bruc replication that exploits host UPR and ER-derived vacole machineries, both depend on YA-mediated IRE activation.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of Bruc replication within host cells, highlighting the pivotal role of the UPR and ER-derived vac formation in establishing a replicative niche. Identification of host factors essential for ER-derived replicative BC and characterization of their functions will elucidate these mechanisms. Our findings have implications for understanding Bruc pathogenesis and development of novel therapeutic strategies.

**Title:** Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus (TBSV) and Carnation Italian Ring Spot Virus (CIR) Recruit Cellular PI3 Kinase (V34) to Support Viral Replication

**Research Question:** How do Tomato Bushy Stunt Virus (TBS) and Carnation Italian Ring Spot Virus (IR) hijack cellular pathways to support viral replication?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of PI3 kinase (V34) in the replication of BS and IR in yeast and plant models.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that BS and IR recruit V34 into the viral replication compartment, where it produces PI3P, a critical for BS replication. Overexpression of PI3 phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibits BS replication on peroxomal membranes and IR on mitochondrial membranes. Purified PI3 phosphatase reduces BS replication in a cell-free system. Detection of PI3 with antibody reveals enrichment in the replication compartment. V34 is recruited through interaction with p33 protein. Gene analysis in yeast shows BS requires vesicle function of V34 for replication.

**Implications:** PI3 phosphoinide is a key component of BS replication, as V34 mutants cannot complement BS deficiency in yeast and act as dominant negative mutants. Expression of PI phosphatase in yeast or Arabidopsis reduces BS and IR accumulation. Sequesting PI with PI-binding proteins inhibits BS replication.

**Conclusions:** V34 and PI3 are necessary for optimal replication of peroxomal BS and mitochondrial IR. The interaction between p33 protein and V34 is critical for replication compartment biogenesis. V34 and PI3 are required for stability of p33 protein, which is degraded by 26S proteasome when PI3 abundance is decreased by V34 inhibitor.

**Title:** Evaluating the Transmission of Dengue Virus (DENV) from Humans to Mosquitoes: A Field-Based Cohort Study in Iquitos, Peru

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the transmission of Dengue virus (DENV) from humans to mosquitoes using both artificial and natural feeding methods in a field-based epidemiological study in Iitos, Peru.

**Methods:** Between 2011 and 2015, participants aged 5 years or older with 5 days of fever were enrolled from clinic and neighborhood studies in Iitos. Wild, laboratory-reared Aedes aegypt were fed on febrile individuals or blood collected from participants with or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after 14 days of extrinsic incubation for DENV infection and dissemination.

**Findings:** A total 58 participants with vireas from 1.3 × 102 to 2.9 × 106 focus-forming units/mL of serum participated in one or more feeding. DENV and dissemination rates were not significantly different following direct and indirect-ED feeding; however, they were lower for mosquitoes fed on blood with no additive. Dissemination rates were similar across all methods. No differences were detected in D infection or dissemination in fed on participants with different deng severity.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the feasibility of direct and indirect feeding for field-based studies on vector competence. Direct feeding is preferable in terms of ease, biosecurity, and reliability.

**Conclusion:** This study provides preliminary data on the ability of DENV from people with mild inapparent to infect and disseminate within mosquitoes. Our results suggest that direct and indirect feeding methods can be used for field-based studies on vector competence. Further research is needed to understand the transmission dynamics of DENV from humans to mosquitoes.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Basis of Variability in Topoisomerase II Sensitivity: A Caenorhabditis elegans as a Model for Personalized Medicine**

**Research Question:** Why do chemotherapeutic drugs exhibit differential efficacy in patients, and what are the underlying causes of this variability?

**Methods:** We employed an unbiased genetic approach to investigate the sensitivity of Caenorhabditis elegans to a panel of antineoplastic drugs targeting topoisomerase II. We identified a methion-to-glutamine substitution in topoisomerase II (TOP-2) as the cause of natural variation in drug response.

**Findings:** The presence of a non-polar methion at position 797 in TOP-2 increases hydrophobic interactions with etoposide, stabilizing the interaction and resulting in genomic instability. This residue is conserved from yeast to humans and is a difference between human topoisomerase isoforms (methion in hTOIα and glut in hIβ). We demonstrated that this amino acid difference influences cytotoxicity of topois II poisons in human cell lines.

**Implications:** Our results explain why hTOIα and hIβ are differentially affected by poisons and highlight the utility of C. elegans in understanding genetics of drug responses.

**Conclusions:** Using C. elegans, we identified a single amino acid variant (Q797) in topoisomerase that underlies differences in etopide response. Mechanistic insights into etide binding between glutamine and methion alleles enabled prediction of responses to a panel of topois poisons. This study demonstrates the power of combining phenotyping with classical genetics in C. Topoisomerase enzymes are targeted by antop regimens because proliferative cells require enzymatic activity to relieve topological stress ahead replication. Our results show divergent responses to etopide are determined by genetic variation in C. elegans topois enzyme. We used genome-ed human lines to show this residue in hI contributes differential toxicity various poisons, demonstrating the power of C. eleg natural variation to identify mechanisms in human cells informing health decisions on genetic information.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Determinants of Mammalian Lifespan: Insights from the Genomic and Transcriptomic Analysis of Rodent Species with Enhanced Longevity

**Research Question:** The genetic mechanisms underlying mammalian lifespan determination remain poorly understood, with most research focused on short-lived animals, raising concerns about the applicability to long-lived species like humans. African mole-rats (Bathyidae) exhibit life expectancies exceeding those of similar-sized, phylogenetically related rodents, prompting an investigation into the genetic underpinnings of enhanced longevity.

**Methods:** We obtained genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species across 11 evolutionary branches associated with the evolution of longevity, scanning for positively selected genes (PSGs) indicating relevance to aging. We identified 250 PSGs in the liver of long-lived naked mole-rats and short-lived rats, exhibiting an expression pattern consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.

**Findings:** PSGs were enriched for genes related to aging, including cellular respiration, ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway: translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Notably, PSGs included RHEB, a regulator of mTOR, IGF1, central components of aging-relevant pathways, as well as novel candidates, e.g., RBL, AM2, SM1, and GER. Exemplary protein modeling revealed functional consequences of amino acid changes under positive selection.

**Implications:** Our results provide a resource for mechanistic studies linking genes and amino acids to aging and lifespan determination. A systematic scan of PSG on African moleat and rodent branches offers higher resolution than previous studies, consistent with observed expression patterns in long-lived moleats and short rats. Lower expression of related genes and pharmacological inhibition associated with longer lifespan in worms, killfish, and mice. mTOR regulates inflammatory and immune responses.

**Conclusions:** PSGs are associated with expression changes during aging, consistent with antagonistic pleiotropy theory. Gene ontology analysis revealed significant downregulation in long-lived and upregulation in short-lived, fitting antagonistic pleiotropy. PSG enriched terms cover processes regulated by mTOR, e.g., translation, autagy, cellular respiration. Identified PSGs are related to aging, showing expression fitting antagonistic pleiotropy, linked to cellular res, ionostasis, mTOR regulation, inflammation, and antioxidant defense.

**Title:** Exploiting the Endosymbiont Wolbachia to Reduce Vector Competence in Aedes albopictus: A Promising Strategy for Vector Control

**Research Question:** Can the transfection of Wolbachia in Aedes albopictus with the wMel strain reduce its vector competence for Chikunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses?

**Methods:** Aedes albictus transfection (ARP-M) was generated by introducing wMel Wolbach in the ARP line, which had previously replaced wAlA and wB Wolbach with wip. Various infection and fitness parameters were studied by comparing ARP, ARP, and wild-type (SANG) Ae. albictus sharing the same genetic background. Vector competence of ARP related to Chikunya, Deng, and Zika viruses was evaluated in comparison with ARP.

**Findings:** ARP showed 100% maternal inheritance of w and wip Wolbach. Survival, fecundity, and fertility did not differ between the three Ae. albict lines. Crosses between ARP males and S females were infertile regardless of age, while egg hatch in reverse increased from 0 to 17% with S males aging 3 to 17. When competing with S males for S females, ARP males induced sterility significantly higher than expected (Fried index 1.71 instead of 1). Wolbach density in ARP females was 15 fold higher in ARP, mostly due to w infection. This corresponded to reduced competence for Chik and Deng viruses (5 and 0% transmission at 14 and 21 post-infection with ARP females). Results regarding Zika did not highlight differences ARP and ARP, however, none tested ARP females capable transmitting ZV.

**Implications:** These findings promote the exploitation of Wolbach to suppress wild Ae. albict populations. Introducing w in ARP Ae. albict had profound impact on vector competence. wA and wB Wolbach did not interfere transmission CHV, while wip Wolbach did not block CHV. Introducing w in ARP Ae. alb reduced CHV transmission compared to wild females (Calitti and Faill, unpublished). This study reports transfection w Wolbach in ARP combining suitability for mass rearing and mating with reduced competence.

**Conclusions:** Exploiting Wolbach in Ae. albict is a promising strategy for vector control. Introducing w Wolbach in Ae. alb reduces competence for Chik, Deng, and Zika viruses. This approach can be used to suppress wild Ae. alb populations. However, releasing females in epidemic areas should be avoided. Wolbach infection in Ae. alb has profound impact on vector competence.

**Title:** Elucidating the Structural Features of Peptide Motifs in Protein-Protein Interactions: A Novel Insights from High-Resolution 3D Structures

**Research Question:** How do peptide motifs, often found in unstructured regions of proteins, adopt a well-defined structure upon binding to their partner domains, and what are the structural features that distinguish them from other peptides of similar length?

**Methods:** We analyzed high-resolution 3D structures of protein-peptide interactions and found that the structure of the peptide can be characteristic of the consensus motif, identifying target peptides that do not match established patterns. We implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) strategy using structural features and encoded information about interfaces to scan 50,000 3D protein structures, identifying unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions. We derived consensus patterns for interactions and compared with established linear motifs and domains.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed that peptide motifs tend to have a stretched, elongated structure, unlike other peptides of similar length. We identified 64 novel domain-peptide interactions, 46 of which were previously undescribed, involving 6,000 interactions, suggesting molecular details of binding.

**Implications:** High-resolution 3 structures provide crucial information on protein recognition and specificity in domain-peptide interactions, including context and key residues in binding pockets. We exploited structural data to find new instances of peptide-mediated interactions in 50,000 3D structures in PDB. Our SVM recognized structural features, but not interactions surrounding domains, highlighting the need to consider environment for domain-peptide recognition.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of structural features in peptide motifs, often overlooked in sequence-based methods. Our strategy, combining structural and encoded information, identified novel interactions and validated on interactome data, providing a list of peptide domains with high-resolution 3 structures and consensus. These findings contribute to understanding protein-peptide interactions, essential for predicting and understanding biological processes.

**Title:** Unraveling the Cellular Mechanisms of Environmental Enteropathy: Impaired Barrier Function and Protective Mechanisms in Adults with Environmental Enteropathy in Lus, Zambia

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the cellular mechanisms underlying impaired barrier function in environmental enteropathy (EE) and explore protective mechanisms in adults with EE in Lus, Zambia.

**Methods:** We conducted a cross-sectional study of 49 adults with EE in Lus, using confocal endoscopy (CLE), histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of intestinal biops, and correlated with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and zinc uptake.

**Findings:** CLE images revealed ubiquitous intestinal epithelial defects, predominantly at villi tips, corresponding with leakage in vivo. Multivariate analysis showed log-transformed LPS correlated with cell shedding (β = 0.83; P = 0.035) and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (β = -0.13; P = 0.007). Zinc uptake was attenuated in 30/47 (64%) individuals, reduced by HIV, but correlated with GL-2 (β = 2.72; P 0.03). A U-shaped relationship between L and villus surface area was observed. Transcript analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in EE, including protective peptides and proteins.

**Implications:** Epithelial defects are sites of bacterial translocation, with increased surface area burden. GL-2 and other peptides may play a role in mucosal protection in EE. Biomarkers of microbial translocation and inflammation (LPS, LBP, CRP, CD163, GL-2, α-antitps) were correlated with confocal images and zinc uptake to explore barrier defects and identify potential biomarkers.

**Conclusions:** EE is associated with impaired micronutrient malabsorption and responses to oral vaccines. Epithelial defects are sites of bacterial translocation, with increased surface area burden. GL-2 and other peptides may play a role in mucosal protection. Biomarkers of translocation and inflammation were correlated with confocal images and zinc uptake. Transcript analysis identified differentially expressed genes in EE, including protective proteins.

**Title:** Mechanism of Superinfection Exclusion (SIE) in Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV) Revealed: A Novel Role of Protein p28 in Repression of Replication

**Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism of superinfection exclusion (S) in turnip crinkle virus (TCV) and how does protein p28 contribute to this phenomenon?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of p28, one of the two replication proteins encoded by TCV, in SIE using a combination of molecular and cellular biology techniques. We expressed p28 as a fusion protein with a C-terminal epitope tag (p-GFP) and examined its subcellular localization and interaction with other TCV proteins.

**Findings:** Our results show that p28 mediates SIE by forming multimeric complexes that intercept fresh p monomers translated from superfect genomes, thereby abolishing superfect replication. This is supported by the observation of large, mobile punctate inclusions in p28-positive cells that transaggregate non-coales, S-defective yet replication-compet p mutant. Furthermore, p28-mediated SIE is enhanced by C-terminal epitope tags but weakened by N-terminal modifications, and inversely correlates with the ability of p to complement p-defective TCV replicon.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of SIE in TCV, where p28 acts as a facilitator and repressor depending on its concentration, forming multimer inclusions that inactivate superfect p. This model could be applicable to other RNA viruses and offers a novel target for antiviral therapy.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide insights into TCV SIE: (i) p28 acts as facilitator and repressor in the same cell, (ii) p-mediated repression involves post-translational interaction with p encoded by different RNA. We propose a model where p28 forms multimer inclusions that intercept fresh p monomers from superfect, denying superfect replication. This simple mechanism could be applicable to many viruses and predicts a target for antiv therapy.

**Title:** Enhancing Long-Term Protection against Trypanosoma cruzi Infection through Co-administration of IL-15 with Trypanosoma cruzi-Sialase (TS) DNA Vaccine

**Research Question:** Can co-administration of IL-15 with Trypanosoma cruz-sialase (TS) DNA vaccine improve long-term protection against Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice?

**Methods:** BALB/c mice were immunized with plasmid DNA encoding TS in the presence or absence of IL-15, and immune responses were analyzed using TS-specific IFN-γ ELISP, serum IgG ELISA, intracellular cytokine staining (IF-γ, TN-α, IL-2), tetramer staining, and CFSE dilution assays. Mice were challenged with lethal Trypanosoma cruzi at 1-6 months post-vaccination.

**Findings:** Mice immunized with TS alone developed robust TS-specific IF-γ responses and survived lethal challenge within the first 3 months post-vacc. Addition of IL-15 to TS vaccination did not significantly alter T responses or protection during early postacc period. However, mice vaccinated with both TS and IL-15 were significantly protected against lethal T cruzi challenges 6 months postacc, correlating with higher TS-specific IF-γ producing CD8+ T cells.

**Implications:** Co-administration of IL-15 with TS DNA vaccine improved long-term T cell survival, memory cell expansion, and protection against Trypanoma cruzi.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that co-administration of IL-15 with TS DNA vaccine enhances long-term protection against Trypanoma cruz infection, a complex intracellular protozoan pathogen. The combination of IL-15 and TS induced higher CD4+ Th1 and TS-specific IF-γ CD8 T cells with enhanced proliferative capacity after antigenic restimulation compared to responses induced by TS alone.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel WD-Repeat Protein, WDR1, as a Receptor of the Cullin4-D1 Ubiquitin Ligase Complex for Degradation of Polo-like Kinase in Trypanosoma brucei

**Research Question:** How is the level of Polo-like kinase (PL) protein, essential for basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis, tightly controlled in Trypanosoma brucei?

**Methods:** We employed co-immunoprecipitation and immunostaining to investigate the interaction between WD-repeat protein W1 (WDR1) and the Cull4-D1 ubiquitin ligase complex in Trypanosoma bri cells.

**Findings:** We identified a WD-repeat protein, WDR, as a receptor of the Cull4-D1 ubiquitin ligase complex for degrading Polo-like kinase (PL) in the basal body and bilobe. Depletion of W1 inhibited bil duplication and basal body segregation, disrupted the assembly of the new flagum attachment filament, and detached the new flagum. Consistent with its role in PL degradation, depletion of W1 caused excessive accumulation of PL in the basal and bil, leading to phosphorylation of Cent2 in the bil at late cell stages.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel WD-repeat protein as a receptor of the C4-D1 ubiquitin ligase for degrading PL in the basal and bil, promoting bil duplication, basal separation, and flagum-cell adhesion.

**Conclusions:** The WD-repeat protein, W1, acts as a receptor of the Cull-D1 ubiquitin ligase for degrading Polo-like kinase in the basal and bil. Depletion of W causes excessive accumulation of PL, leading to defective bil duplication, basal segregation, and flagum attachment. This study identifies a novel WD-repeat protein as a receptor of the C-D ubiquitin ligase for degrading PL in the basal and bil.

**Title:** Sex-Specific Role of DDX3 Isoforms in the Innate Immune System: Implications for Microbial Resistance and Inflammation

**Research Question:** What is the role of DDX3 isoforms in the innate immune system, particularly in the context of sex-specific differences in microbial resistance and inflammation?

**Methods:** We investigated the impact of DDX3 deficiency in hematopoiesis on leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen, as well as susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infection in mice.

**Findings:** Mice lacking DDXX in hematopoietic system showed altered leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen, and impaired ability to combat Lister monocogen infection. Altered innate responses resulted from decreased effector cell availability and sex-dependent cytokine synthesis.

**Implications:** Our data provide in vivo evidence for essential contribution of non-RL DDX RNA helic to innate immunity and suggest sex-related differences in resistance to microbes and resilience to inflammation.

**Conclusions:** DDX isoforms play a pivotal role in innate immunity through hematopoies and regulation of innate response to Lister infections. Loss of DDX impacts the immune system through its role in hematopoies and regulation of innate response to Lister infections.

**Key Findings:**

* Mice lacking D3 in hematopoiet system show alterations in bone and splenic cell populations are highly susceptible to L infection
* Data demonstrate vital role of sex D3 isoforms in innate immunity to Lister
* Loss of D3 impacts the immune system through its role in hematopoies and regulation of response to Lister infections
* D3 regulates IF-I transcription in cells infected with viruses and intracellular pathogen Lister monocogen
* D3 belongs to DEAD RNA helase superfamily with functions in RNA metabolism, transcription, processing, splicing, and translation

**Discussion:** The discovery of R-like receptors as RNA sensors sparked interest in D RNA helases as innate modulators antimicrobial responses. D helases not with R contribute innate immunity in animals, as demonstrated D41 acts dendritic cells limit retroviral growth. Consequences D3 deficiency on expression genes contributing antimicrobial response macrophages examined RNA-Seq L-infected cells. Genes differentially expressed L-infection male or female cells enriched Immune terms, extent D3 altered transcriptome depended sex cells.

**Title:** A Biophysical Model of Receptor Generation in Male Olfactory Neuron: A Comprehensive Simulation of Pre- and Post- Effector Processes

**Research Question:** This study aimed to develop a biophysical model of receptor generation in male olfactory neurons, focusing on pre- and post-effector processes, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying olfactory transduction in moths.

**Methods:** The model incorporates pre-eff processes, including pherone molecule translocation from air to sensillum, deactivation, and interaction with receptors, and G-protein effector activation. Post-eff processes involve production and degradation of second messengers (IP3 and DAG), opening and closing of ionic channels (IP-gated Ca2+, DAGated cation, Ca2-gated Cl-, and Ca2-voltage gated K+), and Ca2 extrusion. The network is regulated by modulators (protein C and Ca2-calmodulin) exerting feedback inhibition on effector channels.

**Findings:** The model captures main features of dose-response curves, wide range of six decades with amplitudes, short rising, and falling times, and reproduces second messenger kinetics. Two types of depolarizing ionic channels play different roles at low and high pherone concentrations: DAGated cation channel at low, and Ca-gated Cl at middle and high.

**Implications:** This study provides a comprehensive understanding of pre and post-eff processes in male pherone-responding ORNs, shedding light on mechanisms of olfactory transduction in insects. The model can be used to predict responses to various pherone intensities and concentrations.

**Conclusions:** The biophysical model of receptor generation in male olfactory neuron provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions between pre and post-eff processes in pher-responding ORNs. It highlights the importance of DAGated cation channel at low pher concentrations and Caated Cl at middle and high concentrations. Future studies can test predictions and develop the model to improve understanding olfactory transduction in insects.

**Future Directions:**

* Investigate the role of ionotropic pathway in pher-responding ORs
* Examine the structural differences between insect and mammalian ORs
* Elucidate the role of G proteins in ph-responding ORs
* Develop the model to predict responses to various pher intensities and concentrations

**Title:** Genome-Wide Analysis of p53 Binding and Chromatin Interactions in Response to DNA Damage

**Research Question:** How do p53 sequences and chromatin context interact to affect p53 binding and gene activation in response to DNA damage?

**Methods:** We performed genome-wide mapping of p53 and H3K4me3 in untreated and doxorubicin (DX)-treated human lymphoblast cells, examining relationships among p occupancy, gene expression, H3me, chromatin accessibility (DNase hypersensitivity), ENCODE chrom states, pRE, and evolutionary conservation.

**Findings:** Inducible p-regulated genes were associated with steady-state chromatin status. Highly inducible p-regulated genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or CTC binding. pRE residing in open chromatin were weaker, while stronger pRE were located in enhancers and repressed chrom. p occupancy was correlated with similarity to pRE consensus, but inversely correlated with existing nucleosome accessibility and conservation. Occupancy of pRE in transposable element (TE) repeats was higher and correlated with stronger p sequences relative to non-TE p, particularly ML1, LTRB, and Mer TEs. However, binding was not associated with transactivation of adjacent genes. Occupied pRE in L-like TEs were unique, displaying negative Phylo scores and associated with altered H3me and DHS.

**Implications:** Our study highlights systematic interaction between chromatin and pRE in transactivation. p response appears tuned via evolutionary processes leading to repression/utilization of pRE from primate transon elements.

**Conclusions:**

1. Chromatin status and pRE context interact to affect p binding and gene activation in response to DNA damage.
2. Inducible p-regulated genes are associated with steady-state chrom status.
3. pRE residing in open chrom are weaker, while stronger p are in enhancers and repressed chrom.
4. Occupancy is correlated with similarity to p consensus, but inversely with existing nucleosome accessibility and conservation.
5. Occupancy of p in TE repeats is higher and correlated with stronger sequences relative to non-TE, particularly ML, LTR, and Mer.
6 Occupied p in L-like TEs are unique, displaying negative Phylo scores and associated with altered Hme and DHS.

This study sheds light on the complex relationship between chromatin and pRE in p genomic occupancy and highlights the importance of considering sequence and epigenetic factors in p-mediated stress responses.

**Title:** Tunable Signal Processing in Bacterial Two-Component Signaling Systems: A Novel Insights into the One-Histidine Kinase-Two Response Regulator Motif

**Research Question:** How does the one-histidine kinase-two response regulator (HK-RR) motif in bacterial two-component signaling systems enable rapid signal termination and sigmoidal response, and what are the implications for synthetic biology applications?

**Methods:** We investigated the dynamics of the HK-RR motif, where a single histidine kinase (HK) phosphorylates two response regulators (RRs) in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We developed a mathematical model and performed analytical and simulation-based analyses to understand the system's behavior.

**Findings:** Our results show that the HK-RR motif enables rapid signal termination, where one RR acts as a phosphate sink for the other (output RR), and exhibits a sigmoidal signal response. We identified two conditions on system parameters necessary for sigmoidal response and key parameters controlling threshold and sensitivity of the signal curve. We experimentally confirmed these findings by in vitro reconstituting the HK-RR motif in Sinorhizium meli chemotaxis pathway and measuring the resulting signal curve. The level of sigmoidality was controlled by the presence of RR and an auxiliary protein binding to HK, yielding Hill coefficients above 7.

**Implications:** The HK-RR motif allows bacteria and yeast to implement tunable switch-like signal processing, providing a basis for developing threshold devices in synthetic biology. Our findings have implications for understanding bacterial physiology and designing signaling circuits, particularly in two-component systems with multiple regulators competing for phosphorylation.

**Conclusions:** The HK-RR motif offers a novel perspective on signal processing in bacterial pathways and new avenues for reengineering. Exploiting this system in synthetic circuits requires coupling an output (e.g., RR as transcription factor) to a useful signal controlling HK activity. Our results have broad implications for two-component signaling in bacteria, eukaryotes, and plants.

**Title:** Investigating Heterogeneity in Stress Tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: A Single-Cell RNA Sequencing and Live-Cell Imaging Reveal Regulatory Mechanisms**

**Research Question:** What is the nature of heterogeneity in stress tolerance among individual cells within Saccharomy cerevisiae populations, and what cellular factors influence the stress-responsive transcriptome?

**Methods:** We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to quantify transcript heterogeneity in Saccharomy cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress, leveraging extensive knowledge of transcriptional regulation to identify covariates influencing the stress transcriptome.

**Findings:** We discovered significant variation in individual yeast cells before and after stress, with a subset of cells decoupling ribosomal gene expression from environmental stress response, partly correlated with cell cycle but unrelated to ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of fluorescent regulators, including transcription factor M2, Sfp, and MAP kinase Hog, revealed coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Transcript analysis suggests cells maintain a filter against decoupled transcriptional bursts but mount stress response upon coordinated, even in unstressed cells.

**Implications:** Understanding regulatory networks controlling heterogeneity and stress tolerance may open avenues for population behavior control. Our results provide new insights into heterogeneity in yeast stress response, but questions remain unanswered.

**Conclusions:** Single-cell RNA-seq coupled with transcription factor profiling revealed variable activation of Environmental Stress Response (ES) and condition-specific regulators after stress and heterogeneity ES activation in unstressed cells due to coordinated and discordant induction of ES regulators. Our findings suggest that cell-to-cell variation in M2 activation could explain heterogeneity stress tolerance in actively growing cultures, but unclear if correlates with broader transcript changes, magnitude in unstressed cells mimics stressed, or fluctuations with cell cycle phase. Decoupling of ES and Environmental Response (ES) gene regulation in wild-type cells is unclear, with M2 overexpression inducing multistress tolerance.

**Title:** Accumulation of Trypanosoma brucei in the Male Reproductive Organs of Mice: Implications for African Trypanosomiasis Diagnosis and Pathogenesis

**Research Question:** Can Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomias, accumulate in the male reproductive organs of mice and evade the immune system, and can they be transmitted through sexual route?

**Methods:** We investigated the accumulation of T. brucei in the male reproductive organs of mice using fine needle aspiration cytology and histopathological analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the presence and distribution of trypanosomes at different stages post-infection in the testis, epididym, and epidid adipose tissue.

**Findings:** Our results show that T. bruce accumulate in the stroma of the epididym, epidid adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the test, but not in the lumen of epididym duct or seminifer tubules of the test. Parasites were associated with inflammatory cell infiltration, degeneration, and tissue rupture of epidym duct, which may be related to reduced fertility. We detected a high number of parasites in these organs, opening the possibility of using fine aspiration cytology as a diagnostic tool in African Trypaniasis.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that, like in the bloodstream and other tissues, T. bruce are exposed to a strong immune response in the male reproductive organs. The majority of parasites are located in non-immune privileged sites, such as epidid adipose tissue and stroma of epidid, not in the test itself. This suggests that the male reproductive system is an important site for accumulation of trypanosomes, but the test has virtually no parasites.

**Conclusions:** We conclude that T. bruce infection is associated with moderate to marked inflammation of reproductive organs in mice, both tissues infiltrated by parasites, such as epidid and epid adipose, but also test, where parasites were not detected. Inflammatory infiltration is associated with disruption of blood-test and epidym barriers at late stages of infection. Our data show T. br accumulation in male organs since day 6 post-infection, epidid adipose and stroma epidid the most parasitized, epidid showing increase parasite density 105 per organ at late disease stages. This is similar to previously found gonadal adipose.

**Title:** Plasticity of the Chemosensory Transcriptome in Drosophila melanogaster: A Modular Regulation of Chemore Gene Expression in Response to Ecological and Physiological Conditions

**Research Question:** How is the expression of chemoreceptor genes, critical for chemosensation and survival, regulated in response to changes in the environment, sex, development, reproductive state, and social context in Dophila melanogaster?

**Methods:** We used customized cDNA microarrays to analyze chemore gene expression in D. melanogaster at different developmental stages, sexes, reproductive states, and social contexts.

**Findings:** Our results show that chemore genes clustered in the genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation, with distinct subgroups sensitive to reproductive and social interactions. Exposure to opposite-sex odor alters transcript abundance of chemore genes, distinct from those showing plasticity with same-sex interactions. Covariance analysis revealed 20 small, biologically relevant modules of highly correlated transcripts.

**Implications:** The finely pixilated organization of the chemens transcriptome enables fine-tuning of chemore expression in response to ecologically relevant and physiological conditions. This plasticity allows flies to adapt to changing environments and social contexts.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides a systematic description of the plasticity of the chemens window through which D. melanaster experiences its chemical environment. We show that genes in clusters are independently regulated in sexes, developmental stages, and conditions, and that expression is sexually dimorphic and frequently antagonistic. The finely pixilated organization of the chemens transcript allows phenotypic plasticity of the chemore repertoire under different conditions.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Meiotic Recombination and Nondisjunction in Human Oocytes: A Study of MLH1 Foci in Fetal Oocytes

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the relationship between meiotic recombination and nondisjunction in human oocytes, specifically examining the role of crossover events near or far from the centromere in the origin of human trisomies.

**Methods:** We analyzed 103 prophase oocytes from 31 fetal ovarian samples using immunofluorescence to examine the distribution and number of crossover-associated protein ML1 (ML1) on nondjunction-prone chromosomes and genome-wide recombination in human females.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the number of ML1 foci is lower than predicted from genetic analysis, but its pattern conforms to expected for a crossover-associated protein. Observations of individual chromosomes provide evidence for "vulnerable" crossover configurations in fetal oocytes, consistent with idea that these are translated into nondjunction events in adult oocytes.

**Implications:** Meiotic errors generate numerous chromosome abnormalities in humans, with most originating from first division in oocyte. Disturbances in recombination linked to various human tris of maternal origin. Our findings suggest that ML1 can be used as marker of crossover in females, and achmate and suboptimal patterns feature human meiosis.

**Conclusions:** Direct analyses of crossover in fetal oocytes reveal "ulnerable" configurations consistent with tris conceptions (e.g., chromosome 16 distal exchanges, chromosome 21 proximal and dist exchanges, achias chromosomes). However, not all situations clear, e.g., no evidence "spikes" in proportion dist or proximal ML1 on chromosome 21, despite proximal dist exchanges associated with meiosis II-derived trisomy 21.

**Title:** The Impact of Pre-exposure to Vector Saliva on Vector-borne Disease Dynamics and Control: A Mathematical Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** How does pre-exposure to vector saliva influence the dynamics of vector-borne diseases and the effectiveness of control measures targeting vectors?

**Methods:** We developed a mathematical model to investigate the potential effects of pre-exposure to vector saliva on between-host dynamics and modulate the consequences of interventions targeting vectors.

**Findings:** Our model predicts that the abundance of pre-exposed hosts increases when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality rates. If pre-exposure leads to rapid clearance of infection, increasing mortality may achieve greater disease control than expected. Conversely, if pre-ex prolongs infection duration, e.g., through asymptomatic cases unlikely to seek treatment, control may increase total infected hosts. Sensitivity analysis suggests negative consequences can be mitigated through integrated management.

**Implications:** Our results underscore the need to quantify how pre-exposure modulates recovery and transmission rates in vector-b diseases. The effect of pre-ex on acute symptoms is well-stud for leishiasis, but immunological and clinical consequences are largely uncharted for other vector-parasite-host combinations. We find a range of epidemiological outcomes, both positive and negative for public health.

**Conclusions:** Pre-exposure to vector saliva alters epidemiological outcomes in a manner that can be either beneficial or detrimental to public health. Understanding the contribution of pre-ex hosts to transmission is key to estimating the impact of pre-ex on epidemiology. Our model predicts adverse consequences of control can be avoided if transmission probability from pre-ex hosts is smaller than naïve. Classic epidemi models ignore pre-ex effects, predicting heightened vector mortality effectively controls vector-b disease by reducing abundance, bites, and probability surviving extrinsic incubation period.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Host Immune Response on Leishmaniasis Phenotype and Virulence: A Comparative Proteomic Analysis of Amastigote Proteomes from BAL/c and BAL/c Mice

**Research Question:** How does the host immune system influence Leish phenotype and virulence, particularly in the context of localized cutaneous leishmanias (LCL) and diffuse cutaneous leishmanias (DCL)?

**Methods:** We employed two-dimensional electrophoresis with fluorescent labeling (DIG) and mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF/ToF) to analyze the proteomes of amigotes isolated from BAL/c and BAL nude mice, a model of diffuse cutaneous leishiasis characterized by T-cell hyposensitivity to Leish antigens.

**Findings:** Among 44 differentially expressed spots, proteins related to oxidative/nitros stress and proteases were identified, including known virulence factors such as oligopeptase and tryparedin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting T cells restrain postlational modifications in BAL/c mice. Conversely, an isoform H70 was increased in amigotes from BAL mice.

**Implications:** Our study provides insights into the regulation of virulence factors and their expression in response to host immune pressure, highlighting the importance of proteomic analysis in understanding Leish phenotypes.

**Conclusions:** This is the first study to compare modifications amig proteomes driven by host response. Our findings suggest that host immune response modulates Leish virulence, particularly through oxidative stress and proteases, and postl modifications of known virulence factors. These results have implications for understanding immunopathology Leish infections, particularly in diffuse cutaneous leishias, and may identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

**Title:** Cell Cycle Regulation of Activation-Induced Cytosine Deaminase (AID) Determines Immunoglobulin Gene Diversification and Genomic Stability

**Research Question:** How does the cell cycle regulate the activity and stability of Activation-Induced Cytinease (AID), a mutagenic enzyme responsible for immunoglobulin gene diversification and genomic instability in B cells?

**Methods:** We employed high-content microscopy to investigate the subcellular localization and degradation of AID in G1, S, and G2/M phases. Mutations affecting phosphorylation or catalytic activity were introduced to alter A stability and abundance. We fused A to cell cycle regulators CDT and Gemin to test the role of cell cycle in A regulation.

**Findings:** AID degrades more slowly in G1 than in S/G/M phases. Mutations affecting phosphorylation or catalytic activity alter A stability and abundance. Enforced nuclear localization of A in G1 accelerates somatic hypermutation and class recombination, while compromising viability in S2/M phases. We identified A derivatives that accelerate somatic hypermutation with minimal impact on viability, useful for gene engineering and mutagenesis.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that cell cycle regulates A stability determines the ability of cells to respond to A-initiated DNA damage. We propose that cell cycle regulation of A may be applicable to studying DNA repair and engineering the genome.

**Conclusions:** The cell cycle regulates A activity and stability, influencing immunoglob gene diversification and genomic stability. Enforced localization of A in G1 accelerates somatic hyper and class recombination, while compromising viability in S/M phases. A derivatives that accelerate somatic hyper with minimal impact on viability will be useful tools for gene engineering and mutagenesis. Our findings highlight the importance of cell cycle regulation in A-initiated DNA damage response and suggest its potential application in studying DNA repair and genome engineering.

**Title:** Elucidating the Microbial Metabolism of Plant Polysaccharides: A Systematic Analysis of Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme (CAzyme) Assays, RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq), and Anaerobic Screening

**Research Question:** How do microbes, specifically Clostridium phyfermentans, degrade and metabolize plant polysaccharides, and what are the underlying enzymatic mechanisms involved?

**Methods:** We employed a comprehensive approach combining carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAzyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic screening to investigate how Clostridium phyferans ferments plant biomass components, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabin. We quantified growth on a panel of plant polyschar and sugars and strand-specific RNA sequencing revealed genes whose expression changed on various substrates.

**Findings:** Fifty-six up-regulated CAymes were purified and their activities showed polysacides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family but divergent specificities and localizations. CAymes were tested in combination to identify synergies between enzymes acting on same substrate different catalytic mechanisms.

**Implications:** This study advances our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass, crucial for understanding plant-degrading microbial communities and developing enzyme mixtures and recombinant microbes for industrial processing plant biomass. Clostridium phyferans, a soil bacterium with 171 CAyme-encoding genes, including 44 glycoside hydrolases in different families, ferments polysacides with variable efficiencies and diaux prioritizes metabolism preferred substrates.

**Conclusions:** This systematic analysis of enzymatic machinery used by microbes to degrade and metabolize plantacides highlights the importance of high-resolution anaobic measurements, RNA sequencing, and CAyme assays in understanding plant-degrading microbial communities. The presented strategy complements other methods such as proteomics and metagenomics, focusing on up-regulated CAymes and their organization into regulons responding specific polysacides. A set of 56 upregulated CAymes were cloned, purified, and each versus substrate quantified their abilities bind and cleave plantacides. Enzymes tested in combination identified synergies for polysacide degradation.

**Title:** Evaluation of the Impact of Integrated Mass Drug Administration on Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) in 12 Endemic Districts of Sierra Leone

**Research Question:** This study aimed to assess the impact of integrated mass drug administration (MDA) on lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 12 endemic districts of Sierra Leone, following three annual MDAs conducted between 2008-2010.

**Methods:** A mid-term assessment was conducted in 2011 to determine the impact of MDAs on LF in these districts. The prevalence and intensity of microfilaria (mf) in the 12 districts were determined using the thick film method and compared with baseline data from 2007-2008.

**Findings:** Overall, mf prevalence fell from 2.6% (95% CI: 2.3-3.0) to 0.3 (95% CI 0.19-0.47), a decrease of 88.5% (p=0.000). Prevalence was 0.0 (100%) in four districts: Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, and Kono (p=0.001, 0.025, 0.085, and 0 respectively); and seven districts had reductions in mf prevalence between 70.0 and 95.0 (p=0.000, 0.060, 0.001, 0.014,0, 0,0, and 0 for Bombali, Bon, the, Kahun, Kambia, Kadugu, Portoko, and Tonili respectively). Pehun had baseline prevalence 0.0, which was maintained. Bomb still had an mf prevalence ≥1.0 (1.58, 95 CI 0.80-3.09), this district had the highest mf baseline 6.9 (95 CI 5.3-8).

**Implications:** The results show mf decreased to <1.0 in all but one of the 12 districts after MDAs. mf reduced 65.0 among mf-positive individuals and 95.8 for the entire population.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of integrated mass drug administration in reducing lymphatic filariasis in endemic districts of Sierra Leone, with a significant decrease in prevalence and intensity of microfilaria. The findings support the use of integrated approach in managing onchercias and LF elimination.

**Title:** Mitigating Compositional Effects in High-Throughput Sequencing Data: A Novel Approach for Accurate Correlation Inference in Microbial Communities

**Research Question:** High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have revolutionized our understanding of microbial communities in oceans and human microbiomes. However, compositional analysis of these data can lead to unreliable results due to relative fractions of genes/species rather than absolute abundances.

**Methods:** Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, we investigated the impact of compositional effects on correlation analysis. We applied standard statistical methods to 16S rRNA gene data from the Human Microbiome, describing compositions of microbial communities in body sites.

**Findings:** Compositional effects were pronounced in 16S rRNA surveys of the human microbiome, leading to artifactual correlations and opposite signs. Community diversity modulated the severity of compos effects. We developed a novel approach, Spar (available at https://bitbucket.org/yonf/spar), estimating correlations from compositional data.

**Implications:** Spar inferred a rich network of interacting species across 18 human body sites. Compared to standard methods, Spar yielded 3 spurious species interactions and missed 60% true interactions in human microbiome data. Erroneous links were found in samples with lowest diversity.

**Conclusions:** Compositional effects are a significant challenge in high-throughput sequencing data. Spar mitigates this issue, enabling accurate correlation inference in microbial communities. Our approach can be applied to various compositional data, not limited to 16 rRNA gene surveys.

**Title:** The Role of Lysozyme and Peptoglycan Modifications in the Colonization of the Upper Respiratory Tract by Streptococcus pneumoniae

**Research Question:** How do lysoe and peogly modifications contribute to the colonization of the upper respiratory tract by Streptoccus pneumoniae, and what is the role of lyso's antimicrobial activity in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the contribution of lyso and peog modifications to the colonization of the upper respiratory tract by Streoccus pneumonia using competition experiments with wild-type and mutant strains in lyso-sufficient (LM+) and deficient (LM-) mice. We also examined the effect of lyso's antimicrobial activity on pneumoc in vitro.

**Findings:** Our results show that the antimicrobial effect of lyso is due to its muridase activity, and that peog modifications are required for full resistance pneumoc. The wild-type strain outcompeted the mutant in LM+, but not LM- mice, indicating the importance of resistance to the murid activity of lyso during mucosal colonization. In contrast, strains with single mutations in or prevailed over the wild-type in both LM+ and LM- mice. Our findings demonstrate that peog modifications diminish fitness during colonization.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that the combination of peog modifications reduces fitness, but is outweighed by the benefits of resistance to peog degrading activity lyso. This highlights the complex and pleomorphic effects of pe modifications on bacterial growth and survival in different environments.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the critical role of lyso and pe modifications in dictating the composition of the microflora of the mucosal surface of the airway. We show that ly's antimicrobial activity, specifically its murid activity, is crucial for pneumoc survival, and that pe modifications provide a significant advantage when lyso is abundant. Our findings have implications for understanding the colonization of the upper respiratory tract by Streoccus pneumonia and the role of lyso in this process.

**Title:** Evaluation of NS1 Capture Assays as a Diagnostic Tool for Dengue Virus Detection in Tissue Specimens from Fatal Cases in Brazil

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the usefulness of NS1 capture assays as an alternative tool for detecting Dengue virus (DENV) in tissue specimens from confirmed fatal cases in Brazil.

**Methods:** A total of 74 tissue specimens from 23 fatal deng cases in 2002 were analyzed, including liver (23), lung (14), kidney (4), brain (10), heart (2), skin (1), spleen (15), thymus (3), and lymph nodes (2). Three NS antigen capture tests were evaluated: Deng Early ELISA (Pan Diagnostics), Platelia NS (Bio Laboratories), and rapid NS1 Strip (Bio Laboratories).

**Findings:** The overall deng case diagnosis based on tissues analyzed by Deng Early EL, Platelia, and NS Strip was 34.7% (8/23), 60.8% (14), and 91.3% (21), respectively. Deng EL detected NS1 in 22.9% (17) of specimens and Plat NS in 45.9% (34). The highest sensitivity (78.3%) was achieved by NS Strip, with significant differences in sensitivities (p<0.05). NS Strip was most sensitive in liver (91.3%), lung (71.4%), kidney (100%), brain (80%), spleen (66.6%), and thym (100%) compared to other EL assays.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates DENV NS capture as a rapid and valuable approach for postmortem deng confirmation. With increasing DH and fatal cases, availability of new approaches for confirmation is crucial for disease surveillance.

**Conclusion:** This is the first study to evaluate EL and ICT for detecting DENV antigens in tissues. D was previously detected by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Real RT-PCR in Brazilian tissues. NS capture is a novel approach for deng diagnosis and may be used as pathological tool.

**Title:** Elucidating Molecular Differences in Multiple Myeloma (MM) Across Self-Reported Race and Genetic Ancestry: A Whole-Exome Sequencing and Clinical Data Analysis of 718 Patients

**Research Question:** What are the molecular alterations in Multiple Myeloma (MM) as a function of self-reported race and genetic ancestry, and how do these differences contribute to the higher incidence and mortality rates among African Americans (AA) compared to Caucasians (CA)?

**Methods:** This study utilized somatic whole-exome RNA-sequencing and clinical data from 718 patients with MM from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's Compass Interim Analysis 9. Somatic mutational analyses, corrected for self-reported race and ancestry, revealed significant differences in mutation frequencies between groups. Genes of interest, B7, BR3, and AUT2, demonstrated higher mutation frequencies among AA cases, involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies, while TP53 and IRF4 showed higher frequencies among CA.

**Findings:** Our study highlights significant differences in mutation frequencies of B7, BR, and AUT among AA cases, and TP and IR4 among CA. These genes are involved in B-cell malignancies. Notably, we observed a difference in TP53 frequency among patients with European admixture in our dataset. Our study represents the most comprehensive WES and RNAseq genomics of MM in patients of African descent, shedding light on ancestry-related biological mechanisms of myelagenesis.

**Implications:** These findings are of interest, and further functional characterization of these genes in myeloma models may shed light on their role in myogenesis, particularly in patients of African descent. A deeper understanding of oncogenic processes driving MM pathogenesis in multi-ethnic cohorts is needed to address disparities in incidence and outcomes among AA or African patients. Previous studies have provided a view of MM somatic landscape, but representation from AA has been limited.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of interrogating diverse cohorts to understand tumor genomics across populations. Genes known to be involved in B malignancy translocations represent new myoma candidates that may have been overlooked due to lack of AA in large genomic efforts. F46 mutation frequency in MM ranges 5-11, although 8.3% in CA, we observed 12.6% in AA. Functional role of F46 in myogenesis still to be determined, but potential enrichment in MM biology among African tumors.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mysteries of Cancer Evolution: Uncovering the Role of Passenger Mutations in Tumor Growth and Evolution

**Research Question:** How do passenger mutations influence the growth and evolution of cancer cells, and can they be used to infer the evolutionary history of an individual cancer?

**Methods:** We employed a stochastic model to describe the expansion of a population of cancer cells, analyzing the growth of primary tumors and metastatic lesions. We calculated fixation probabilities and frequencies of successive mutations ordered by time of appearance, computed likelihood of evolutionary trees, and phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer evolution in patients. We derived formulas to estimate the number of cancer cells present when a subclonal mutation arose and the ratio of birth and death rates of cells during early stages of clonal expansion.

**Findings:** The ratio of birth and death rates (δ) of cancer cells determines the shape of the phylogenetic tree, which is star-shaped for fast growth and linear for slow growth. We found that frequencies of the first and most abundant mutations are influenced not only by mutation rate but also by δ. If δ is close to 1, several clonal passengers may not be present in the first cell but collected during clonal expansion. Conversely, if δ = 0.99, there are about 150 passenger mutations in >1% of cells. Our formula can be fitted to sequencing data to determine the branching model of evolution and extract parameters.

**Implications:** Passenger mutations can provide information about the history of an individual cancer and serve as a molecular clock. They can also become targets for immunotherapy or confer resistance to treatment. Our results show that neutral evolution during clonal expansion can be used to infer parameters of the tumorig process. For δ close to 1, the number of subcl mutations with >50% is equal to the number collected during progression. Subtracting subcl with >50 from all cl will estimate the number in the first cell.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of passenger mutations in understanding cancer evolution and growth. The ratio of birth and death rates determines the shape of the phylogenetic tree and influences the number of mutations. Our model can be fitted to sequencing data to determine the process and extract parameters. These findings have implications for understanding cancer evolution and treatment.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Flanking Sequences in Huntingtin Misfolding and Aggregation: A Molecular Dynamics Study of Monomeric Huntingtin with Flanking Regions

**Research Question:** How do the flanking sequences surrounding the polyglutamine (Q) region of the huntingtin protein contribute to its misolding and aggregation in Huntington's disease?

**Methods:** We performed molecular dynamics simulations on monomeric huntingtin (X1) with full flanking regions, missing polyproline regions, and isolated polyQ peptides of varying glutamine lengths (23, 36, and 47) to investigate the role of flanking sequences in X1 misolding and aggregation.

**Findings:** Our results show a positive correlation between the probability of polyQ peptides to form a β-rich misfold state and their length. The flanking regions of X1 affect its probability to form a β state compared to isolatedQ. Notably, polyline regions form polytype II helices decrease the probability of Q to form β state. Additionally, lengthening Q, the first-terminal 17 residues are more likely to adopt β-sheet conformation than α-helix conformation.

**Implications:** Our study provides structural insights into X1 misolding and elucidates the possible role of flanking sequences in X aggregation. The findings suggest that flanking regions play a critical role in determining the structural rearrangement and aggregation mechanism of X1. The polyline regions may prevent aggregation by forming poly II helices, while the first-terminal 17 residues are more likely to adopt β-sheet conformation.

**Conclusions:** Our molecular dynamics study highlights the importance of flanking sequences in X1 misolding and aggregation. The results support the hypothesis that flanking regions initiate oligomerization and later β-amyloid formation. The findings have implications for understanding the molecular mechanism of X aggregation and developing strategies to inhibit X aggregation in Huntington's disease.

**Title:** Elucidating the CRIS/Cas Immune System: A Novel Insights into the Distribution and Diversity of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) in Human Microbial Communities

**Research Question:** How do Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindrom Repeats (CRPR) loci and their associated genes, CRIS/Cas, contribute to the adaptive defense mechanisms of bacteria and archaea against foreign nucleic acids, including phages and conjugative plasmids, and what is their distribution and diversity in human microbial communities?

**Methods:** We employed a targeted assembly strategy to reconstruct CRPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) to explore the distribution and diversity of known CRPRs and discover new ones. For each known CRPR type, we used its repeat consensus sequence to recruit reads from HMP datasets and assembled them into CRPR loci, extracting unique spacer sequences for analysis. We also identified novel CRPRs or CRPR variants from whole-genome assemblies and targeted assembly to comprehensively identify CRPR across samples.

**Findings:** Our results show that CRPR distributions, including 64 known and 86 novel ones, are largely site-specific. Detailed analysis of several CRPR loci, including novel CRPRs, revealed that streptocococcal CRPRs were identified in oral microbiomes with ~8,000 unique spacers, resampled from the same individual site shared most spacers, while different sites from the same individual shared fewer, and individuals almost no spacers, indicating subtle niche differences in evolution of CRPR defenses. We demonstrate potential applications of CRPR in tracing rare species and virus exposure in individuals.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of effective identification and characterization of CRPR loci in understanding the dynamic ecology of microbiomes. The availability of over 700 metagenomic datasets from HMP enables systematic exploration and discovery of CRPR across body sites. Our targeted assembly strategy improved detection of CRPR in metagenomic sequences, whole-genome assembly failed to reconstruct. Preliminary exploration of contigs searching CR spacers against whole-genome suggests identifying new virus in metagen assemblies, further computational and experimental confirmation needed.

**Conclusions:** This work indicates the significance of CRPR in understanding human microbiome biology, utilizing metadata with H datasets. The targeted assembly helps identify CRPR from metagen datasets, improving detection compared to whole-genome annotation. Known CRPRs were identified from bacterial genomes or drafts in IMG 3.3, using metaCRT and CRPRAlign, a list of CRPR repeats and novel ones for further study among H datasets. The strategy is crucial for comprehensive characterization of CRPR in human datasets.

**Title:** Identification of Circadian-Regulated Transcriptional Rhythms in Caenorhabditis elegans: Implications for the Evolution and Function of the Biological Clock

**Research Question:** Whether Caenorhabitis elegans, a nematode model organism, possesses a bona fide circadian clock that is regulated by environmental signals such as light and temperature.

**Methods:** Genome-wide expression profiling experiments were conducted to identify light- and temperature-entrained transcripts in C. elegans, which exhibited rhythmic expression with temperature-compated 24-h periods and sustained under constant conditions, indicating circadian regulation. Light and temperature cycles drove expression and entrained largely non-overlapping gene sets. Mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolished light and temperature-entrained gene expression, suggesting environmental cues act nonautonomously entrain circadian rhythms.

**Findings:** This study reports the first identification of circ-regulated transcripts in C. elegans, entrained by LD or WC cycles and oscillating during free-running conditions with temperature-compated phases dependent on entraining conditions. Both light and temperature act as zeitgebers, driving genome-wide expression. Circadian expression is regulated by environmental information received by a set of sensory neurons, similar to vertebrates, suggesting light and temperature may act nonautonomously entrain the clock in C. elegans. Findings imply C. eleg may utilize a timekeeping mechanism distinct from described in other animals.

**Implications:** C. elegans exhibits systemic responses to light and temperature, driving expression of many genes, with light- and temperatureentr transcripts largely nonoverlapping. Conserved clock homologs do not exhibit circadian rhythmic at mRNA level. Genes implicated in metabolism are enriched in temperature-driven sets, whereas circadian behaviors such as locomotion and reproduction are enriched in entrained datasets. The TAX-2 cyclicotideated channel is required to transduce both light and temperature to the clock, demonstrating C eleg has circadian entrained by light and temperature.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates C eleg has circadian clock entrained by light and temperature, indicating this model can be used to explore evolution and function of this critical timekeeping mechanism. The findings suggest C eleg may utilize a distinct timekeeping mechanism from other animals, with temperature driving a larger set of genes than light, and genes implicated in metabolism enriched in temperature-driven sets, whereas circadian behaviors in entrained datasets.

**Title:** Characterization of Recombinogenic Lesions in Saccharomyces cerevisae RAD3 Mutants: Implications for Nucleotide Excision Repair and Mitotic Recombination

**Research Question:** How do Saccharomyces cereae RAD3 mutants, homologous to human XPD, affect nucleotide excision repair (NER) and mitotic recombination, and what types of recombinogenic lesions are formed in these mutants?

**Methods:** We used a system to recover reciprocal mitotic recombination products and mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations, including crossovers, conversions, deletions, and duplications, in rad-101 and rad-102 mutants. We also compared these data with spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells.

**Findings:** Both rad-101 and rad-102 elevated the frequency of reciprocal crosso about 100-fold. Mapping showed that three-quarters of crosso reflect double-strand breaks (DSBs) formed at same positions in sister chromatids (double-chromat breaks, DSBs) and remainder DSBs in single chromatids (singleid breaks, SCBs). Ratio DSBs to SC similar to spontaneous events in wild cells. Mapped 216 genomic alterations, including crosso, conversions, deletions, and duplications, and found significant association with regions of recombination and gamma-H2AX. Hotspots for deletions and duplications at IMA and H11 near left of XV.

**Implications:** Our data indicate two types of recomogenic lesions in rad- strains: 1) unrepaired single-stranded nicks converted to singleid breaks by replication and 2) DSB TFH-bound lesions unreplicated converted to DSB by replication. Both types repaired S/G2. Our study genome-wide analysis shows rad mutations stimulate crosso and conversions one orders throughout genome. Patterns of conversions associated with mit crosso suggest that rad- strains have elevated recomogenic lesions. Alternative possibility that rad have same level lesions, but repair directed recombination homolog rather between chromatids.

**Conclusions:**

1) rad mutations stimulate both crosso and conversions genome-wide.
2) Patterns of conversions associated with mitrosso suggest rad have elevated recomogenic lesions.
3) Alternative possibility that rad have same level lesions, but repair directed re homolog rather chromatids.
4) Majority DSB in rad strains occur S/G, as shown differing widths Fig 7.
5) rad mutations affect processing broken chromosomes, patchiness mismatch, or tendency switch templates during repair.
6) rad mutations in ATP groove lead enhanced TFH attachment to promoter, challenging repair.
7) Some recombination events in rad- strain consequence G-associated lesions, as argued Golin and Esposito.

**Title:** Mechanism of Transcriptional Regulation by Promoter-Proximal Simple Sequence Repeats in Helicobacter pylori**

**Research Question:** How do promoter-proximal simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in Helicobacter pylori regulate the expression of the sialic acid adhesin, SabA, in response to the changing host environment?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of SSRs in modulating Sab expression in H. pylori using T-tract variants in an isogenic background. We analyzed the length of the T-tract and its effect on Sab promoter activity, RNA polymerase binding, and sial-Lewis receptor binding.

**Findings:** The length of the Ttract generates multiphas output from the Sab promoter, altering H. pyl binding to sial-Lewis receptors on gastric mucosa. Fragment analysis of post-infection clones shows the T- length is highly variable in H. pyl, mirroring the host-pathogen interplay where the bacterium generates clones with best-fit phenotypes. In silico and in vitro analyzes revealed the length of T affects DNA structure and RNA polymerase binding, shifting axial alignment between promoter and UP elements. We identified additional H. pyl genes with T or Atracts similar to Sab, showing variations acting as rheostats to modulate cognate output.

**Implications:** This mechanism, mediated by promoter-prox SSRs, provides an alternative transcriptional regulation in bacteria like H. pyl, with limited classical transacting factors. The Ttract length varies between strains, influencing Sab expression and sial-L receptor binding. Variations in T length affect local DNA structure, RNA polymerase interaction, and promoter activity, fine-tuning gene expression.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that Ttract length, in isogenic strains, affects Sab activity, inducing multiphas alterations in mRNA and protein levels, adjusting sial receptor activity. H. pyl changes local structure, by rheostat mechanism, via strand mispairing, fine-tuning gene expression. This mechanism is applicable to other bacteria with limited transacting factors.

**Title:** High-Risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Evades Innate Immune Surveillance by Activating STAT5 to Establish Persistent Infections and Amplify Viral Genomes

**Research Question:** How does the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) evade innate immune surveillance to establish persistent infections and amplify viral genomes, and what role do members of the JAK/STAT family play in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of STAT5, a member of the J/STAT family, in regulating the innate immune response, in HPV-infected cells. We used Western blot analysis to detect STAT5 phosphorylation and total levels in primary cells persistently infected with retroviruses expressing HPV E6 or E7. We treated cells with pozide, an inhibitor of STAT5 activation, to determine its effect on viral replication and gene expression in differentiated keratinocytes.

**Findings:** Our studies show that HPV activates STAT5 phosphorylation without altering total levels. Inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation by poz abolishes genome amplification and late expression in differentiated keratinocytes. In contrast, treatment of undifferentiated cells stably maintaining episomes has no effect on viral replication. Knockdown studies reveal that STAT5 isoform is mainly responsible for this activity, mediated through ATM damage response. Downstream of STAT5, peroxis proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) contributes to effects on ATM pathway.

**Implications:** These findings identify a new mechanism by which innate regulator STAT5 promotes viral replication through activation of DNA damage response. Suppression of PAR by H531 interferes with damage signaling in HPV keratinocytes. HPVcoproteins E and E7 play roles in transformation and immortalization.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that STAT5 is activated in HPV-infected cells and necessary for genome amplification. STAT5 regulates amplification through activation of ATM response, mediated, in part, by PAR. These findings highlight the importance of STAT5 in the viral life cycle, particularly in differentiated cells. While HPV activates STAT in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, STAT activity is only for amplification and expression in supasal cells.

**Title:** Identification of Novel Biomarkers for Asymptomatic Salmonella Typhi Carriage using In Vivo-Induced Antigen Technology (IVAT)

**Research Question:** Little is known about the interaction between the host and pathogen in the biliary tract of chronic Salmonella Typhi carriers, and there is no reliable diagnostic assay to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriage.

**Methods:** To study host-pathogen interactions in the biliary during S. Ty carriage, we applied an immunoscreen technique called In Vivo-Induced Antigen Technology (IVAT) to identify biomarkers unique to carriers. IV identifies humorally immunogenic antigens expressed in vivo and hypothesized S. Ty surviving the biliary tract of humans may express distinct antigen profile.

**Findings:** Thirteen S. Ty antigens were immunactive in carriers but not healthy individuals from typh endemic area were identified. The antigens included number of putative proteins, liproteins, and hemolys-related proteins. YE (ST147), an uncharacter protein with ATP-binding motif, gave prominent responses in screen. Response to YE in patients biliary contained S. Ty was compared responses in patients biliary did not contain S. Ty, patients acute typh fever, and healthy residing typh endemic. Seven of (70%) carriers, of 8 culture-negative (0%), of 8 healthy (0%), and 1 of (12.5%) Bangladeshi acute typh fever had detectable-YE Ig in blood. Ig responses also present.

**Implications:** Further evaluation Y and other antig identified by IV could lead to development improved diagnostic to identify asymptomatic S. Ty carriers in typh endemic, and analysis Y along other identified could understanding host-path interactions during carriage S. Ty during human.

**Conclusions:** Understanding mechanisms involved development persistence carrier may facilitate improved diagnostic and therapeutic for S Ty carriage. Currently, little known host-path interactions biliary chronic carriers extrapolated in vitro and murine with S Typhium, which enteric-like illness mice. Despite limitations, used IV to identify subset immunactive S Ty, including YE. Evaluation Y and other could lead improved diagnostic detect asymptomatic S Typh in typh zones, and analysis Y along other could understanding host-path during chronic S Ty infection.

**Key Findings:**

* 13 S. Ty antigens immunactive in carriers but not healthy from typh endemic identified
* Antigens included putative proteins, liproteins, hemolys-related
* Y (ST147) uncharacter protein ATP-binding motif prominent responses
* Response Y patients biliary contained S Ty compared responses patients biliary did not S Ty, typh, healthy ty endemic
* 70% carriers, 0% culture-negative, 0%, 0 healthy, 12.5% Bangadeshi typh had detect-YE Ig blood
* Ig responses also present

**Future Directions:**

* Evaluation Y and other antig identified IV lead improved diagnostic asymptomatic S Typh
* Analysis Y along other identified understanding host-path during chronic S Ty

**Title:** Homologous RNA-Mediated Transcriptional Reactivation: A Novel Epigenetic Mechanism of Gene Expression Control in Heterochromatic Genes

**Research Question:** We investigated the role of cellular RNA produced by homologous loci in defining the transcriptional state of silenced genes, specifically examining the effect of non-functional alleles of the white gene in the presence of a functional copy silenced by heterochromatin.

**Methods:** We tested the ability of non-functional white alleles, unable to produce a coding transcript, to reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochatin.

**Findings:** Our results show that non-functional white alleles can indeed reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of white silenced by heterochatin. This epigenetic phenomenon, termed trans-reactivation, relies on the presence of homologous RNA and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional silencing.

**Implications:** Our data suggest a novel level of gene expression control mediated by homolog RNA in the context of heterochromatic genes, challenging current understanding of epigenetic mechanisms.

**Conclusions:** Trans-react is a new epigenetic phenomenon controlling gene expression in heterochatin through homolog RNA, distinct from previously characterized epigen reprogramming events such as paramutation, transduction, and transvection. Unlike these, trans-react regions transcribing RNAs unable to produce a full transcript can positively influence transcriptional state of homolog locus silenced heterochatin. Notably, non-functional white alleles increase wmh transcript and open chromatin structure at wmh locus. Importantly, trans-react is heritable, relying on diffusible homolog RNA and affected by post-transcription silencing genes.

**Title:** Hematophagous Mosquitoes and Ticks Avoid Host Hemostasis through Expression of Enzyme Inhibitors Targeting Proteolytic Reactions of Coagulation and Complement Cascades

**Research Question:** How do hematophagous mosquitoes and ticks evade the host hemostatic system through the expression of enzyme inhibitors targeting proteolytic reactions of coagulation and complement cascades, and what is the role of Boophil, a multifunctional inhibitor of thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein, in this process?

**Methods:** We expressed Boophil in HEK cells and purified it to homogeneity. Using amidolytic and surface plasmon resonance experiments, we demonstrated that Boophil behaves as a classical, non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to chromogenic substrates by a mechanism dependent on exosite and catalytic site. Inhibition is accompanied by blockade of platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot thrombin in vitro. We also identified Boophil as a non-competitive of FXa, preventing activation. In addition, Boophil inhibits kikrein activity and reciprocal activation, indicating it targets the contact pathway. Furthermore, Boophil abates catheps G and plmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially elastase cleavage Tissue Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). Finally, Boophil inhibits carot artery occlusion in vivo by Fe3 and promotes bleeding according to mice transection.

**Findings:** Boophil is a multifunctional enzyme inhibitor of thrombin, elastase, and kikrein, and plays a major role in keeping the midgut microenvironment low hematic and inflammatory response, allowing ticks to successfully digest blood meal critical for metabolism and development. Boophil is the first midg FXa anticoagulant found to inhibit thromosis.

**Implications:** These results emphasize the importance of Boophil in several aspects associated with feeding and metabolism. The kinetics of Boophil interaction with distinct enzymes, how modulates platelet function, and inhibits thromosis in vivo have not been determined. Several aspects of Boophil have been elucidated in this study, respect kinetics on platelets and antithromic activity. Bo expressed in HEK cells behaves a classical non-competitive of throm with respect chromogenic substrate with Ki 100 nM amidolytic and SPR experiments. This value higher than previously calculated Ki50M and KiM. Bo inhibits throm in noncanonical manner possessing canonical site. Importance Bo has demonstrated by silencing Bo gene resulted 20 reduction egg production. This might explained inhibition midut proteases initiating sustaining reactions detrimental tick and survival.

**Conclusions:** Boophil plays a major role in keeping midut micro low hematic and inflammatory response, allowing ticks to digest blood meal critical for metabolism and development. Boophil is first midg FXa anticoag found inhibiting thromosis. Further studies are needed to determine kinetics Bo interaction distinct enzymes modulates plate function and inhibits throm in vivo.

**Title:** The Spatially Explicit Model of Enteric Tissue (SEMT): A Novel Computational Framework for Understanding the Role of Inflammation in Enteric Mucosal Patterning

**Research Question:** How does inflammation influence the enteric mucosal patterning, and what are the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that determine epithelial crypt-villus architecture across a range of conditions from health to disease?

**Methods:** We developed the Spatially General-purpose Model of Enter Tissue (SEMT) to represent the behavior of enteric epithelial tissue influenced by inflammation and generate a variety of pathophysiological processes within a common platform from a knowledge base. SEMT integrates multiple modules including intra-cellular morphogenic pathway, intra-cell inflammatory pathway, cell transitions proliferation, differentiation, and movement, and diffusion of morphogens to define epithelial behavior for homeostatic maintenance of spatial of enteric mucosa.

**Findings:** SEMT reproduces healthy ileal mucosal dynamics as well as series of morph knock-out/inhibition experiments, providing insight into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, such as putative role of Phosphase tensin homophosphosit 3-kinase (PT/PIK) as key crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis, protective of enterocyte slough in enter ischemia-reper and chronic low inflammation as driver colonic metaplas.

**Implications:** SEMT can serve as integrating platform for study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease, unifying broad spectrum of intestinal by view mucosal architecture as maintained by morph pathways subject control complex interplay multiple objectives in state health, but disturbed pathological conditions.

**Conclusions:** SEMT is a novel computational framework for understanding enteric mucosal pattering and its response to inflammation, providing insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in maintaining enteric mucosal architecture morphogenesis and its response to perturbations. Our results suggest that SEMT can be used to study a range of gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, and other conditions where mucosal architecture plays key role in pathogenesis. Future work will focus on expanding SEMT to include additional components and interactions to achieve more comprehensive representation of mechanisms involved in enteric mucosal pattering.

**Key Findings:**

* SEMT reproduces healthy ileal mucosal dynamics
* Provides insight into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, such as PT/PI as key cros between inflammation and morph
* Protective role of enterocyte slough in enteria and chronic inflammation
* Driver of colonic metaplas

**Future Directions:**

* Expand SEMT to include additional components and interactions to achieve comprehensive representation of mechanisms in enteric patter
* Apply SEMT to study range gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel, cancer, and conditions where mucosal plays key role in pathogenesis

**Title:** Assessing the Efficacy of Wolbachia as a Tool for Arbovirus Transmission Mitigation: Implications of Insecticide Resistance in Aedes aegyti Populations

**Research Question:** Can Wolbach, a symbiotic bacterium, be an effective in mitigating arbovirus transmission in Aedes aegti populations, and what are the implications of insecticide resistance on its deployment?

**Methods:** Aedes aegti mosquitoes were released with Wolbach strain (wBr) in a community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for 20 weeks, with 87% of households participating. Wolbach frequency peaked at 65% but dropped after releases stopped. High maternal transmission (97.56%) was observed. Releasing mosquitoes with high wing length and low mortality had no effect on invasion trend. Investigating lab procedures, pyrethroid resistance in wBr decreased from 68% to 3.5% after 17 generations.

**Findings:** Initially, released mosquitoes were susceptible to pyreoids, associated with household insecticide use, jeopardizing Wolbach invasion. A new strain (wRio) was produced by backcrossing wBr females with field males, introducing pyreoid resistance. wRio increased survival but negatively affected Aeegi fecundity, reducing egg clutch size and hatch. Despite fitness costs, wRio established where wBr failed, highlighting the importance of matching local genetics and insecticide background for invasion.

**Implications:** Wolbach deployment should match insecticide profile of wild population to achieve invasion. Pyreoid resistance is widespread in Aeeg populations, future deployments must maintain resistance in lab colonies.

**Conclusion:** Wolbach-infected Aeeg mosquitoes are being deployed worldwide, but pyreoid resistance is common in wild Ae populations. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering insecticide status in natural Aeeg populations for Wolbach usage as a disease control strategy.

**Title:** Unraveling the Complex Signaling Pathways of Poxviruses: A Novel Insights into the Role of the Vaccinia B Kinase and Pseudokinase Pair

**Research Question:** How do poxviruses employ sophisticated signaling pathways to modulate cellular defense mechanisms and ensure proper viral replication, and what is the role of the vaccinia B kinase and pseudokinase pair in this process?

**Methods:** We employed experimental evolution of a B deletion virus to search for suppressor mutations and identify novel pathways involving B. After several passages of the ΔB virus, we observed a robust increase in viral titer of the adapted virus. Characterization of the adapted viruses revealed mutations correlating with loss of function of the vaccinia B pseudokinase provided striking enhancement to the virus.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the vaccinia B kinase plays a vital role in inactivating the cellular antiviral factor B and likely orchestrates other pathways. Expression of full-length B leads to fitness reduction in viruses with a defect in B, but no impact on wild-type or mutant poxviruses, indicating B possesses potent inhibitory activity masked by the presence of B kinase. Investigation of B revealed it localizes to the nucleus, a characteristic rarely found among poxiral proteins. Surprisingly, B phosphorylation is reduced under conditions with B present in infected cells without B, suggesting B may function by enhancing antiral activity of B.

**Implications:** Our studies of B and B present novel evidence a paralog kinase-pseudase pair exhibit epist relationship in virus, serving to enhance conservation during pox evolution and orchestrate yet-to-discovered nuclear events. Loss of B can suppress fitness of B mutant viruses, but not enhance replication of containing wild-type B gene, consistent with model B pseudokin acting repressor in B-dependent manner. Inference masked by B is consistent with single knockout studies. Future investigation of inhibitory B extends to other poviruses lacking B kinase and other pathogens will be intriguing.

**Conclusions:** Our study of vaccinia B kinase yields unexpected insights pox adaptation and signal transduction. Results contribute to fitness via antagonism B and B proteins, raise questions mechanism action pseudokin and governed by B. To expand understanding B signaling, we subjected B deletion to evolution with whole-genome sequencing, identifying vacc mutation correlating suppression fitness caused deletion B gene. Together, studies B and B present evidence paralog kinase-pseudase exhibit epist in virus, enhancing conservation pox and orchestrating nuclear events.

**Title:** Investigating the Conformational Behavior of Amphiphilic Peptides in Bulk and at Interfaces: A Molecular Dynamics Simulations of LKKKLLKKLL and EALA

**Research Question:** What is the conformational behavior of amphiphilic peptides in bulk and at interfaces, and how do they respond to environmental conditions such as pH, salts, and presence of interfaces?

**Methods:** We employed molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the conformation behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKLLKKKKLL (L) and EAAEAAEAAE (ALA), with built-in amphiphicity forming an alpha-helix. We studied their aggregation and influence of macroscopic and molecular interfaces on conformation preferences.

**Findings:** Our results show that the peptides are neither random coils in bulk nor fully formed helices, but adopt multiple conformations and secondary elements with short lifetimes. These conformations provide a basis for conformation and population-shift upon environmental changes. Differences in peptides' response to macro and molecular interfaces presented by aggregation can be linked to inherent helical tendencies in bulk. We found that peptides' aggregation is strongly affected by presence or absence of interface and subtly depends on surface charge and hydrophobicity.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of amphiphicity in secondary elements forming energetically favorable contacts, giving rise to tertiary structure. Small peptides, on the other hand, are too short to form multiple elements and stabilize internally, leading to structural ambiguity and intrinsic disorder in solution. Conformation preference is susceptible to environmental conditions such as pH, salts, or presence of interfaces.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the conformation behavior of amphiphic peptides in bulk and at interfaces using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that these peptides are neither random coils nor fully helices, but adopt multiple conformations and secondary elements with short lifetimes. This provides basis for conformation and population-shift upon environmental changes. Differences in peptides' response to macro and molecular interfaces presented by aggregation can be linked to inherent helical tendencies in bulk. We find that peptides' aggregation is strongly affected by presence or absence of interface and subtly depends on surface and hydrophobicity.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Telomeric Repeats in Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) Integration and Latency

**Research Question:** What is the role of telomeric repeats (TMR) in the integration of Human Herpesvirus 6 (HH-6) into host chromosomes during latency?

**Methods:** We generated recombinant HH-6 viruses with deletions of perfect (pMR) and imperfect (impMR) telomeric repeats and assessed their replication and integration properties in vitro and in latently infected cells.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that TMR are dispensable for HH-6 replication, but crucial for integration and maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells. Deletion of both pMR and impMR revealed that pMR plays a major role in HH-6 integration, while impMR makes a minor contribution.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that T of HH-6 and other herpesviruses facilitate integration into host telomeres, depicting a novel mechanism for maintenance of the genome in latently infected cells. Integration occurs not only in vitro but also in vivo.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first experimental evidence for the role of T in HH-6 integration, resolving the long-standing hypothesis that T facilitate integration by homologous recombination. Our data establish a model for HH-6 integration, highlighting the importance of pMR in this process. These findings have implications for understanding latency and persistence of HH-6 and other herpesviruses in the human host.

**Abstract:**

Human Herpesvirus 6 (HH-6) and 6 (HH-6) are ubiquitous betaherpesviruses that infect humans within the first years of life and establish latency in various cell types. Both viruses integrate their genomes into telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells. The mechanism of integration remains elusive. Interestingly, HH-6, HH-6 and other herpesviruses harbor telomeric repeats (T) identical to human telom sequences at the ends of their genomes. HH- and HH- genomes harbor two T arrays, the perfect (pMR) and imperfect (impMR). To determine if T are involved in integration, we deleted p and imp in the HH- genome. Upon reconstitution, the T mutant replicated comparable to wild-type (wt) virus, indicating T are not essential for HH- replication. To assess integration properties of recombinant viruses, we established in vitro system that allows assessment of integration and genome in latently infected. Integration HH- was impaired in absence of T and virus was lost, suggesting integration crucial for maintenance of genome. Deletion of p and imp revealed p plays major role in HH- integration, while imp makes minor. Our data show that HH- T are dispensable for replication but crucial for integration and maintenance of genome in latently cells.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Poxvirus Morphogenesis: Structural Insights into the Ancestral Lipid Remodeling Strategy of Poxviruses

**Research Question:** How do poxviruses, a family of enveloped viruses, assemble their infectious particles, and what is the role of the protein D13 in this process?

**Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy to determine the 2.6 Å structure of the vaccinia virus protein D13, a key component of the viral scaffold of crescent precursors. We also analyzed the membrane-remodeling capabilities of D13 using 2-D crystals and reconstituted virus-like particles.

**Findings:** The crystal structure of D13 reveals a double-barrel organization consisting of two jellyrolls (J1 and J) decorated by a β-sand forming head domain. D forms trimers that are homologous to double-barrel capsid proteins of adenovirus and lipid-containing icosahedral viruses. When tethered onto artificial membranes, D forms a honeycomb lattice assembly structurally similar to viral crescent and immature particles. The architecture of the D honey lattice and lipid-remodeling abilities of D support a model of assembly similar to mimivirus.

**Implications:** Our findings establish that the first step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipidremodel strategy common to icosahedral viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. D13 is a driving force in this process, as it forms immature particles in the absence of other viral factors. Neutralization of D by mutation or rifampic completely inhibits assembly.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first structural insights into the mechanisms of poxirus morphogenesis, revealing an ancestral lipidremodel strategy shared with icosah DNA viruses. The structure of D will aid the development of poxirus inhibitors.

**Title:** Elucidating the Complex Interplay between Auxin and Ethylene Signaling in Root Elongation in Brachodium distachyon

**Research Question:** How do auxin and ethylene signaling pathways interact to regulate root elongation in the monocotyledonous plant Brachodium distachyon, and how do these mechanisms differ from those in the dicotyledonous Arabidopsis thaliana?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the role of tryptophaninotransferase activity in root elongation in Brachodium. We isolated and characterized a mutant in the TAR-LIKE (BdARL) gene, which severely downregulates tryophanotransferase activity, resulting in a hypomorphic Bdt2 allele (Bdt2hypo). Contrary to expectations, dt2 mutants displayed elongated roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This phenotype was also observed in a stronger dt2 allele and mimicked by treating wild-type plants with L-kyunine, a T1/T inhibitor. Surprisingly, Lkyine-treated and dt2 roots showed elevated, not reduced auxin levels, which did not result from alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways.

**Findings:** Expression of YCCA genes, rate-limiting IPA to auxin conversion, was increased in dt2 mutants, consistent with suppression of dt2 root phenotypes upon application of ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). YCCA were downregulated upon ACC treatment, and upregulated in a downstream ethylene-signaling component mutant, ethylene insensitive 2-like 1, also displaying dt2 root phenotype. Our results reveal a delicate homeostasis of auxin and ethylene activity controlling elong in Brach roots and suggest alternative wiring of aux-ethylene crosstalk compared to Arabidopsis.

**Implications:** Our findings contrast with reduced root growth and aux levels in Arabidopsis t1/t mutants, suggesting that ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an IPA-dependent manner, conferring suboptimal aux levels for cell elong. This is supported by elevated aux levels in dt2 seminal roots, particularly in elongating and mature parts with high BdARL expression. Collectively, genetic and pharmacological analyses indicate reduced tryophanotransfer activity in Brach results in increased cell elongation anisropy, contrasting reduced growth in Arabid t1/t mutants.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a complex interplay between auxin and ethylene signaling in root elong in Brach, differing from Arabidopsis. The most parsimonious explanation is that aux levels are supraoptimal for elong in Brach, as proposed for rice. Elevated aux levels in dt2 roots suggest that eth inhibits the rate-limiting step of aux biosynthesis, conferring subopt levels for cell elong. Our results suggest a delicate balance of aux and eth activity controlling elong in Br roots and alternative wiring of aux-ethylene cstalk compared to Arabid.

**Title:** The Role of Promoter Organization in Shaping the Evolutionary Dynamics of Yeast Genes

**Research Question:** Why do genes evolve at different rates in yeast species, and how does promoter organization influence this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the relationship between gene expression divergence and promoter organization in yeast, focusing on genes with and without nucleosome-free regions (OP) and those with depleted proximal nucleosomes (DPN). We artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins and examined the genomic response to selection.

**Findings:** Surprisingly, selection was equally successful for OP and DP genes, with ~80% of each group increasing expression by a similar amount. However, the two groups adapted through distinct mechanisms: DP-selected strains duplicated genomic regions, while OP-selected favored mutations involving duplications. When selection was removed, DP but not OP genes reverted to wild-type levels, consistent with lower diversity between species.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that promoter organization constrains early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution.

**Conclusions:** The divergence of gene expression in yeast is linked to promoter organization, connecting evolutionary divergence with physiological regulation. Genes lacking proximal nucleosomes (OP) diverged rapidly, while those with proximal nucleosomes (DP) remained conserved. Our results indicate that promoter impacts early dynamics and biases long-term evolution. We propose that OP and DP genes differ in responding to identical selection forces, with OP being more flexible due to their structure. This supports the idea that flexible organization directs the evolutionary path.

**Key findings:**

* OP and DP genes responded similarly to selection, increasing expression by ~80%
* DP strains duplicated genomic regions, while OP favored mutations involving duplications
* selection removed, DP but not OP reverted to wild-type levels, consistent with lower diversity
* promoter constrains early dynamics and biases long-term evolution
* OP and DP differ in responding to selection, with OP being more flexible due to structure

**Title:** Activation of IKK/NF-κ by HTLV-1 Transactivator/Oncoprotein Tax Promotes Cell Proliferation and Transformation, but Induces p21/p27-Mediated Senescence as a Checkpoint against IK/NF-κ Hyperactivation

**Research Question:** How does the HTLV-1 transactivator/oncoprotein Tax regulate cell proliferation and transformation, and what is the role of p21/p27-mediated senescence as a checkpoint against IK/NF-κ hyperactivation?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of Tax on IK/NF-κ activation, p21/p27 expression, and cellular senescence in HeLa cells using mutations, small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, and NF-κB degradation-resistant mutant Iκα.

**Findings:** Tax-induced IK/NF-κ hyperactivation triggers p21/p27-mediated senescence, independently of p53/pb, which acts as a checkpoint against IK/NF-κ hyperactivation. RelA induces senescence by stabilizing p27 and p21 mRNA through the anaphase-promoting complex. Downregulation of NF-κ by HT-1 anti-s protein HB prevents Tax-induced senescence.

**Implications:** The balance between Tax and HB expression determines the outcome of HT-1 infection. Elevated Tax replication and expression drive IK/NF-κ hyperactivation and senescence, while HB modulates Tax-mediated replication and NF-κ activation, allowing HT-1-infected cells to proliferate and persist.

**Conclusions:** IK/NF hyperactivation by Tax or other means triggers a p21/p-mediated senescence, which acts as a checkpoint against IKF- hyperactivation. NF-κ is constitutively active in many cancers, including leukemia, suggesting that changes disabling this senesc pathway accompany NF-κ deregulation in cancers. Impairments of p and p function have been observed in HT-1-transformed cells. Constitutive IK activation and NF-κ hyperactivation cause Tax-induced senescence, and RelA is the major driver of senescence. NF-κ acts upstream of APC to stabilize p27, and its unscheduled activation remains to be elucidated. Loss of Sk2 facilitates p/p21/p27 and Arf53-independent senescence. Induction of p21 by Tax is due to promoter activation and mRNA stabilization.

**Title:** A Computational Model of Frontal Lobe Function: Explaining Decision-Making in Uncertain and Open-Ended Situations

**Research Question:** How does the frontal lobe, responsible for decision-making and executive control, manage the selection and coordination of goal-directed behaviors in uncertain, changing, and open-ended environments?

**Methods:** We propose a computational model of frontal function that clarifies this issue, using behavioral experiments to show that it predicts human decisions and variations across individuals in naturalistic situations.

**Findings:** Our model reveals that the frontal lobe monitors up to four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict outcomes, choosing the most reliable strategy to guide selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. Otherwise, a new strategy is tentatively formed from stored in long-term memory, probed, and confirmed to drive action. The executive has a limited capacity to three or four strategies, compensated by a binary structure of control in ambiguous situations promoting exploration and creation of new strategies.

**Implications:** Our results support a model of frontal function integrating reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in service of decision-making and behavior. The PRO model suggests how the executive regulates exploration versus exploitation of rules and creativity in adaptive behavior.

**Conclusions:** The frontal lobe creates and manages an expanding repertoire of flexible strategies for action in uncertain, changing, and open-ended environments. This faculty manages task representations in long-term memory for driving action. According to reinforcement learning models, the actor is adjusted to maximize utility. However, little is known about how the executive continuously arbitrates between adjusting the current set, switching to other learned, and creating new sets for action. Our model clarifies this issue, proposing a computational of frontal function controlling creation, learning, storage, retrieval, and selection of strategies driving action.

**Title:** Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Trajectories (ADAPT): A Novel Approach to Investigate Long-term Effects of Pharmacological Interventions and Identify Potential Side Effects

**Research Question:** How can we develop a computational model to predict the long-term effects of pharmacological interventions and identify potential side effects in disease progression?

**Methods:** We introduce Analysis Dynamic Adaptations in Trajectories (ADAPT), a novel approach that employs mathematical modeling to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations in response to pharmacological interventions. A time-dependent model parameters are introduced to describe the progression of adaptations, enabling the identification of necessary changes in parameters to describe transitions between experimental data at different stages of treatment.

**Findings:** ADAPT was applied to investigate the metabolic adaptations induced by pharmacological activation of liver X receptor (LXR), a potential target to treat atherosclerosis. Trajectories revealed a counterintuitive insight into the function of scavenger receptor B1 (SR1), which facilitates hepatic cholesterol uptake. Although LXR activation promotes cholesterol efflux and excretion, our analysis showed reduced hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol upon prolonged treatment, confirmed by immunoblot measurements of SR1 in hepatic membranes.

**Implications:** AD can be used to identify potential side effects and design new interventions to prevent them. This approach provides an integrated understanding of the outcome of pharmacological or disease progression, linking experimentally observed phenotypes as a function of time.

**Conclusions:** ADAPT offers a novel approach to investigate long-term effects of pharmacological interventions and identify potential side effects in disease progression. By integrating time-dependent parameters, AD captures the dynamics of molecular adaptations, providing insight into affected biological systems and molecular events to unravel mechanistic basis of treatment outcome.

**Title:** Reconciling Sensory and Motor Signals in the Spino-Cerebellar Pathways: A Novel Hypothesis for Multi-Segment Limb Coordination

**Research Question:** How do sensory and motor signals combine in the neurons of the spino-cerebell pathways, and why do granule cells receive this input with respect to their output? How can the spino-cerebell system and cerebell cortex interact to support multi-segment limb coordination?

**Methods:** We synthesize existing findings into a new hypothesis that spinoerebell systems and cerebell cortex interact to support multi-segment coordination by recombining sensory and motor signals. We find that random recombination is not a good strategy due to the limited number of granule cells. Instead, we propose that spinal circuitry provides useful recombinations, described as linear projections in multi-dimensional sensorimotor space. Granule cells, aided by Golgi cells, enhance these projections, allowing Purkin cells to approximate non-linear functions.

**Findings:** Our hypothesis provides a novel view on spinoerebell and cerebell granule function, illustrating how cerebell coordination is supported by recom performed by spinoere neurons. The correspondence between sensory and motor signals in individual neurons may avoid superfluous recombinations, which the system cannot afford, and form good recom close to optimal with high probability.

**Implications:** The spinoere circuit makes sensorimotor functions available to cerebell cortex via MF/SCT systems. The structure of spere network prior to granule must be considered to lift curse dimensionality. We illustrate multi-segment coordination with a planar double arm example.

**Conclusions:** The spinoere and cerebell neuronal circuitry provide integration across dimensions for multi-se coordination. The cerebell is crucial for coordination, but little is known about mechanisms. Our hypothesis explains how spino and cerebell interact to support multi-se coordination.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Host MicroRNAs in Chikunya Virus Infection in Aedes albopictus: A Novel Insights into Vector-Based Antiviral Strategies

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the impact of Chikunya virus (CHV) infection on the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in Aedes albictus, a primary vector of CHV transmission.

**Methods:** High-throughput sequencing was employed to profile miRN expression in uninfected and CHV-infected Ae. albict cell lines. A total of 88 and 79 miRNAs were identified in uninf and CHV-infected cells, respectively, with nine novel miRNAs discovered in Ae. albict. Differential expression analysis revealed 77 common miRN between uninf and CHV-infected cells, with eight mi specifically altered by CHV infection.

**Findings:** Putative targets of regulated miRN were identified and classified into pathways, providing insight into cellular modification by mi during CHV infection. The study highlights potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies.

**Implications:** This investigation sheds light on the role of host mi in CHV infection, underscoring the importance of mi in disease transmission and pathogenesis. The identified miRN may serve as targets for novel antiviral interventions.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to understanding the complex interplay between host and CHV, providing a foundation for the development of vector-based antiral approaches. Further research is warranted to explore the functional significance of mi in CHV infection and their potential as therapeutic targets.

**Title:** Estimating the Economic Burden of Cysticercosis in Iran: A Cost Analysis of Human and Livestock Disease

**Research Question:** What is the economic burden of Cystercosis (CE) in Iran, a parasitic disease affecting humans and livestock, and what are the costs associated with human and animal disease?

**Methods:** Epidemiological data, including prevalence and incidence of CE in humans and animals, were obtained from regional hospitals, scientific literature, and government reports. Economic data on human and animal disease, including cost of treatment, productivity losses, and livestock losses were obtained from national and international datasets. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to represent uncertainty in parameters.

**Findings:** The estimated number of surgical cases per year 2000-2009 was 1,295. The number of asymptomatic individuals in the country was 635,232 (95% CI 149,466-1,120,998). The overall cost of CE in Iran was estimated at $232.3 million (95 CI $103.1-397.8 million), including direct and indirect costs. The cost with human was $93.39 million (95 CI $6.1-222.7) and the cost with livestock was $132 (95 CI $61.8-246.5). The cost per case was $1,539.

**Implications:** CE has a considerable impact on Iran, with cost approximating 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. Establishment of a surveillance and implementation of control are necessary to reduce the burden of CE on the country. Cost-benefit analysis of control programs is recommended incorporating knowledge of losses to CE in Iran.

**Conclusion:** Estimating the economic of zoonotic disease is a way of quantifying significance in human and populations. This type of analysis helps decision-makers prioritize resources for control and prevention. Findings indicate CE costs more than $230 million per year, a considerable burden equating 0.1% of the country's gross product. Productivity in asymptomatic, prevalence in sheep, and fecund in sheep had the largest impact on cost. Accurate assessment is crucial to raise awareness and prioritize resources for preventive measures.

**Title:** Comprehensive Analysis of Mouse Polyomavirus (MPV) Infection Reveals Dynamic Changes in Viral and Host Transcriptomes

**Research Question:** How does Mouse Polyomavirus (MPV) infection modulate the host cell transcriptome and viral transcriptome during its lifecycle, and what are the implications of these changes on host cell growth and metabolism?

**Methods:** We employed deep sequencing to analyze the viral and host transcriptomes of NIH3T6 cells at various times post-infection. Alignment of sequencing reads to the viral genome revealed the transcriptional profile of early-to-late switch, with both early-strand and late-strand RNAs transcribed at all times. We identified novel insights into viral expression, including widespread RNA editing of transcripts late in infection.

**Findings:** By 36 hours post-infection, 359 genes were significantly upregulated, while 857 were downregulated. Gene ontology analysis indicated transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated, whereas transcripts in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc binding, SH domain, and GTP activation were downregulated. Levels of noncoding RNAs were also altered, with MALAT1, involved in splicing and used as a marker in late-stage cancer, downregulated and several abundant noncoding RNAs upregulated.

**Implications:** Our study provides the first global analysis of viral and host transcript changes in MPV infection, revealing changes in RNA expression, especially respect to early-late times and confirming previous observations of MPV lifecycle. These findings contribute to understanding MPV life cycle and its effects on host growth and metabolism.

**Conclusions:** This study presents a comprehensive view of MPV infection with respect to both virus and host transcriptomes, generating a detailed picture of viral expression throughout lifecycle and how infection impacts host gene expression. New insights into viral regulation were obtained, including changes in start sites of transcripts and RNA editing throughout genome. These results have implications for understanding MPV lifecycle and its effects on host cell biology.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mystery of "Hitting the Wall": A Physiologic Constraints on Endurance Running Revealed

**Research Question:** What are the physiologic variables that determine the likelihood of "hitting the wall" during a marathon, and how can they be used to optimize endurance performance and safety?

**Methods:** A computational model was developed to estimate the distance at which runners exhaust their glycogen stores as a function of running intensity, incorporating variables such as muscle mass, liver glycogen density, and running speed as a fraction of aerobic capacity.

**Findings:** The model reveals that energetic constraints on endurance are subtle and depend on individual physi variables, including muscle distribution, liver glycogen, and running intensity, in quantifiable and predictable ways. Carbohydrate loading prior to running influences performance, permitting runners to run at greater speeds without exhausting glycogen reserves. Typical glyc loading levels permit completion of a marathon in 4-5 hours, as indicated by intersections with the "Glyc Loading Supercompensation" region. The likelihood of "hitting wall" peaks around mile 21, followed by a decline.

**Implications:** This work sheds light on physiologic standards for marathon running, previously empirically defined, such as qualifying times for Boston Marathon. The model provides a basis for setting personalized paces and prescribing mid-race fueling to avoid "the wall", ensuring safety and optimizing endurance performance.

**Conclusions:** The physologic constraints on endurance are more complex than previously thought, influenced by multiple factors including muscle, liver, glycogen, and running intensity. Carbohydrate loading is not a universal requirement for completing a marathon, but can enhance performance by allowing runners to run at higher speeds without exhausting glycogen. The model can be used to predict distance to glyc depletion and optimal pace for a given distance, such as a marathon.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Basis of Toxoplas Pathogenesis: A Comparative Analysis of Canonical and Non-Canonical Toxoplas Strains in Host-Parasite Interactions**

**Research Question:** To what extent do non-canonical Tooplas strains differ in their interactions with host cells, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences in pathogenesis?

**Methods:** We infected murine macrophages with 29 Tooplas strains representing global diversity and used RNA-sequencing to determine host and parasite transcriptomes. We identified differences in expression of known effectors and chromosomal variation in some strains, as well as novel strain-specific regulated pathways, including regulation of the type I interferon response by atypical strains.

**Findings:** Our study reveals large differences in host-parasite interactions between canonical and non-canonical Tooplas strains. We identified clusters of co-regulated macroage and parasite genes, enriched for functional annotation, and host signaling pathways modulated by atypical Tooplas strains. Notably, we observed large differences in activation of inflammatory response between strains, with some strains inducing high levels of IFβ production, independent of interferon activation, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic retic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG) in fibroblasts.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that non-canonical Toop strains have unique interactions with host cells, which may contribute to variable outcomes of toxoplas in patients. These differences in host-parite interactions may be key to understanding disease severity, as atypical strains have been associated with more severe symptoms in North America.

**Conclusions:** This study provides global insight into host-parite responses upon infection with both canonical and non-canonical Toop strains, and identifies novel strain-specific host responses and effectors. Our results highlight the importance of host-parite interactions in toxoplas pathogenesis, and suggest that specific Toop strains may have adapted to certain hosts, differing in virulence in same species.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Heterologous Recombination in Enteroviruses: A Novel Insights into the Emergence of Neuropathogenic Poliovirus Variants

**Research Question:** Despite the significance of heterologous recombination in the emergence of neuropathogenic poliovirus variants, the underlying mechanisms of this process remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate heterologous recombination using a reverse genetic approach to isolate chimeric intertypic poliruses with extensive sequence duplications at the recombination junction.

**Methods:** We employed a novel genetic approach to generate chimeric interic poliruses with extensive sequence duplications at the recombination junction. Serial passage of these viruses yielded progeny with increased fitness, which lost the duplicated sequences. Mutations affecting polymerase fidelity or coales of replication complexes altered the yield of recombinants, but not non-replicative recombination, indicating that the process is replicative and can be enhanced or reduced.

**Findings:** We propose that extant recombinants result from a biphasic process: an initial recombination followed by resolution of extraneous sequences and optimization of fitness. Analysis of 136 intertyp polirus 1/type 3 recombinants revealed 70% contained additional sequences, 85% distinct junctions. In contrast, a recent next-generation sequencing study of polirus recombinants tagged with synonymous mutations showed sequence and structure correlated with recombination hotspots.

**Implications:** Our findings have implications for understanding evolution by duplication in positive-strand RNA viruses. The biphasic process of recombination may enhance or reduce recombination-mediated evolution. The conservation of 2-13 nucleotides at recombination junctions hindered identification of junctions in intra-seric recombinants.

**Conclusion:** This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of heterolog recombination in enteriruses, shedding light on the emergence of neuropogenic polirus variants. The bipic process of recombination may be exploited to enhance or reduce recombination-mediated evolution. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of recombination in positive-strand RNA viruses.

**Title:** Organic Catecholamine Transporter 3 (OCT3) Regulates Catecholamine Clearance and Thermogenesis in White Adipocytes: Implications for Metabolic Disorders

**Research Question:** What is the role of organic cation transporter 3 (OCT) in catecholamine clearance and thermogenesis in white adipocytes, and how does it impact metabolic disorders?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression and function of CT in white adipose tissue (WAT) and its impact on cateolamine clearance, thermogenesis, and lipolysis. We used mouse models of adipose-specific CT knockout (KO) and wild-type (Ctrl) mice to study the effects of CT ablation on body temperature, thermogenesis, lipolysis, and gene expression of thermogenic and glycolytic genes.

**Findings:** We found that CT is highly expressed in W and displays the greatest uptake of catechamine as a non-neural route of clearance in whiteocytes, differing from other routes such as neurons or macrophages. Adipocytes express high levels of degradation enzymes MAO, MAO, and COMT, providing molecular basis for cateol clearance by adipocytes with reuptake CT. CT ablation induces higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipysis compared to littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, WAT in adip-specific CT-deficient mice shows stronger browning and elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes than litter controls, involving β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive binding (CREB) pathway. Glycol genes are reprogrammed to higher levels to compensate for loss of ATP in adip-specific CT knockout (KO) mice, indicating fundamental role of glucose metabolism beig. Inhibition β-AR abolishes higher lipolytic and therm activities in CT-deficient W, indicating NE overload in vicinity adipocytes CT KO.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate CT governs β-activity as NE transporter in whiteocytes, offering potential applications for metabolic disorders. Reduced alleles in human CT are associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). CT is essential for cateol clearance in adipocytes and blunts intracellular responses sustained cateol stimulation regulating β-activity. Development CT-specific inhibitors may shed light on metabolic disorders.

**Conclusion:** Our study highlights the importance of CT in cateol clearance and thermogenesis in whiteocytes and its implications for metabolic disorders. Further investigation of extraneural NE through CT versus neuronal clearance is needed.

**Title:** The Chromoshadow Domain of Heterochromatin-Enriched Protein 1 (HP1) Plays a Critical Role in Regulating Transcription by Interacting with Histone H3 at the Nucleosome Entry/Exit Point

**Research Question:** How do heterochrom-enriched protein 1 (HP) proteins regulate transcription by interacting with chromatin, and what is the role of their chromadow domain in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between HP proteins and chromatin using in vitro and in vivo experiments, focusing on the chromadow domain and its interaction with histone H3.

**Findings:** We found that the chromadow domain of HP proteins interacts with histone H3 at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome, a region also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. In vitro, SWI/S remodeling requires this contact and is inhibited in the presence of HP proteins. The antagonism between SWI/S and HP proteins is observed on a series of interferon-regulated genes. We also show that SWI activity favors HP loading onto chromatin in vivo and vitro.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that HP chromadow domains benefit the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and HP proteins use this property to detect and arrest chrom remodeling. We propose a model where SWI functions as repressor, opening chrom may initiate HP stable recruitment, and where SWI as activator, HP proteins bind methylated histone H tails as sensors of unwanted SW activity, blocking remodeling.

**Conclusions:** The chromadow domain of HP proteins plays a critical role in regulating transcription by interacting with histone H at the nucleosome entry/exit point. This interaction is essential for HP to detect and arrest chrom remodeling. Our findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between HP, SWI, and chromatin remodeling in transcriptional regulation.

**Title:** Investigating the Property of Self-Containment in RNA Sequences: Implications for Function and Evolution

**Research Question:** Do RNA sequences exhibit a tendency to maintain their secondary structure regardless of their surrounding nucleotide context, and if so, what are the implications for their function and evolution?

**Methods:** We developed a scoring method, the self-containment index, to measure the degree of self-containment in RNA sequences and applied it to various classes of functional RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and other structured RNAs. We found that miRNAs exhibit high self-containment, consistent with their requirement for structural invariance during biogenesis, while other structured RNAs do not.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed a trend of higher self-containment among conserved miRNAs, suggesting that self-containment may be a characteristic of miRN acquiring new genomic contexts. We also found that miRN display enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, and a trend toward selection for self-cont in most functional classes. Furthermore, we found that self-cont is not solely determined by physicochemical characteristics of folded RNA, but may be an evolved feature of particular RNA classes.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that self-cont arises from selection for robustness against perturbations and invariance during biogenesis and modular composition of function. Analysis of self-cont will be important for annotation and design of functional RNAs. We provide a Python implementation and Web interface to calculate self-cont index at http://kim.bio.upenn.edu/software.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that self-cont is a property of certain RNA sequences, particularly miRN, which require structural invariance during biogenesis. We propose that self-cont is an evolved feature of particular RNA classes, not solely determined by physico characteristics of folded RNA. Our findings have implications for understanding RNA function, evolution, and design of functional RN.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Plant Susceptibility to Necrotrophic Fungal Pathogens: Identification of Novel Transcription Factors and Provulence Factors

**Research Question:** How do plants respond to invasions by necrotrophic pathogens, and what are the molecular components and processes that contribute to disease susceptibility?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of forward and reverse genetic approaches to identify transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that limit pathogen spread. Mutants defective in these TFs displayed increased susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea and Plectphaella cucina, and activation of non-immune host processes contributed to disease. Transcriptome analyses revealed a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes, encoding secreted peptides, which we named PROIR (provulence factors).

**Findings:** We characterized several PROIRs, which are important for disease susceptibility to necrophic pathogens. Overexpression of PROIR in Arabid increased susceptibility to P cucina, while loss-of-function mutants conferred resistance, indicating PROs role in pathogenesis. We also identified four TFs, ZFP, BHL99, P2, and ATG10, required for resistance to necrophic pathogens. Mutants in these TFs showed remarkable susceptibility to cin and cucina.

**Implications:** Our study reveals novel genetic determinants of plant susceptibility to necrophic pathogens, filling a knowledge gap in understanding of disease mechanisms. The upregulated genes encoding secreted peptides, PROIR, facilitate fungal access to host cells and growth, while TFs, such as ZFP, BHL, P, and ATG, are required for resistance. These findings highlight the complexity of plant-pathogen interactions and potential targets for disease control.

**Conclusions:** Our research contributes to understanding of plant susceptibility to necrophic pathogens, highlighting the importance of PROIR and TFs in disease progression. Further investigation of these factors may lead to novel strategies for disease management and resistance.

**Title:** Forkhead Box O1 (FOX1) Regulates Endometrial Receptivity and Embryo Implantation

**Research Question:** What is the role of the transcription factor Forkhead O (FOX1) in regulating endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation?

**Methods:** We used a progesterone receptor (PGR) Cre mouse model to ablate FOX1 in the uterus and analyzed the effects on endrial receptivity and embryo implantation. We also analyzed the uterine transcriptome after FOX1 ablation and identified alterations in gene expression transcripts involved in cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, β-caten (CTN1) signaling, and P signaling.

**Findings:** Uter ablation of FOX1 resulted in infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing embryo penetration of the luminal epithelium. Analysis of the utine transcriptome after FOX1 ablation identified alterations in gene expression transcripts involved in cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, βaten (CTN) signaling, and increase P signaling. The increase in P signaling was due to PGR being retained in the utine epithelium during the window of recept. Constitutive expression of epithelial P during this period inhibited expression of FOX1 in the nucleus of utine epithelium. Reciprocal expression of P and FOX1 was conserved in human endrial samples during proliferative and secretory phase.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that FOX1 is a critical regulator of endrial receptivity and embryo implantation. FOX ablation affects multiple signaling pathways with implications on biological processes, including P signaling and growth factor, required for proper utine function during implant. Transcript analysis of FOX1/d uterus at 4.5 of pregnancy showed activation of P pathway. Collectively, these indicate spatiemporal and localization of FOX and P in endrial epithel requires mutual regulation for successful implant during pregnancy.

**Conclusions:** We propose that FOX and P may be involved in mutually regulatory relationship in endrial epithel at Window of recept, substantiated by sequestration of FOX in cytoplasm response constitutive expression P in nuclei endrial during implant in mice. FOX regulates expression of multiple components signaling pathways establish receptive including activation cell, molecular, transport, apoptosis, CTN signaling, as well, inhibition P in murine endrial epithel. This study highlights the importance of FOX in regulating endrial receptivity and embryo implant, with implications for understanding recurrent pregnancy loss and IVF failure.

**Title:** Spatial Mapping Dengue Incidence in Resource-Limited Settings: A Bayesian Modeling Approach Accounting for Zero-Inflation and Spatial-Temporal Effects in Bangladesh**

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the spatial variation in deng incidence in Bangladesh, accounting for zero-inflation and spatial-temporal effects, to inform targeted interventions.

**Methods:** A negative binomial generalized linear mixed model was developed to account for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal effects. The model was fitted to district-level (64) monthly deng cases aggregated over 2000-2009. Bayesian inference was performed using the integrated Laplace approximation.

**Findings:**

* Mean temperature and its interaction with mean diurnal range, lagged by two months, were significantly associated with deng incidence.
* Mean rainfall at two months was positively associated with deng.
* Densely populated districts and bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others.
* 92% of annual deng cases occurred between August and September.
* Cases were identified across the country, with 94% in Dhaka (middle of the country).
 Less than half of affected districts reported cases observed from surveillance.
 Proportion varied by month, with higher in high-incidence districts, dropped towards end transmission.

**Implications:** This study provides model-based estimates of monthly deng distribution in Bangladesh, accounting for underreporting. Our findings inform prioritizing and targeting deng control and elimination across Bangladesh.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to understanding deng situation in Bangladesh, accounting for underreporting. However, underreporting not considered, nor geographical variation d transmission (climate, socio-demographic) factors. Our aim maps monthly variation deng incidence at district-level Bangladesh, climate, demographic factors adjusting underreport.

**Title:** Exploratory Behavior in Novel Environments: Unveiling the Role of Knots and Knot-Cribling in Mice

**Research Question:** What are the characteristics of preferred places established by mice during exploratory behavior in a novel environments, and how do these places influence overall behavior?

**Methods:** In this study, mice were introduced to a large empty arena and their exploratory behavior was observed. The arena was divided into quadrants, and the number of visits and cumulative time spent in each quadrant were recorded. Mice were also injected with saline and placed in an exposed portion of the arena to examine the effect of stress and arousal on establishment of preferred places.

**Findings:** Mice established preferred places, termed "knots", characterized by tortuous paths of twists and turns, which we termed "knotcribling". Knots were mostly situated near the point of introduction, away from walls, and had high inbound speed and low outbound speed. The establishment of knots was enhanced by injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed portion of arena, suggesting stress and arousal consolidated a long-term contingency between locale and knotcribling. In an environment devoid of proximal cues, mice marked a locale with twisting and turning, creating a self-generated, centrally located landmark. The tortuosity of path implied multiple views of the environment, suggesting knotcribling as a way to obtain an overview and re-calibrate the mouse's map and compass.

**Implications:** Knots and knotcribling may serve as a way to obtain an overview of the environment, allowing mice to re-calibrate their locale and compass. The vestibular input generated by scribling may improve interpretation of the scene. Knots are distinct from home bases, characterized by high inbound speed and low outbound speed.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a new type of preferred places, knots, established by mice during exploratory behavior in an open arena. Knots are characterized by high density of visits, frequent non-scribling, and high inbound speed. Knotcri is mediated by a different mechanism than rushing to home. Mice tend to perform knotcri at point of introduction, but leave immediately after. Preference for entry point expressed by longer dwell time in entry quadrant described in rats.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel Antifungal Compound, NG04, Targeting the Lipid Transfer Protein Sec14 in Cryptococcus neoformans

**Research Question:** Can we identify a novel antifungal compound targeting the lipid transfer protein Sec14 in Cryptoccus neoformans, a pathogenic fungus responsible for more deaths worldwide than malaria?

**Methods:** We employed a high-resolution chemogenomics approach to screen for antifungal compounds with selectivity over mammalian cells and identified the ergoline compound NG04 as a potent inhibitor of Cryptoccus neoans growth. We used genetic and biochemical assays to elucidate the mechanism of action of NG04 and identified Sec14 as the target protein.

**Findings:** NG04 inhibits the growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoans and NG04-related compounds exhibit equal or higher potency against C. neoans. NG04 also showed fungicidal activity against fluconazole-resistant C. neoans strain. Mutations in Sec14 define the compound-target interactions in the substrate pocket of the protein.

**Implications:** Beyond its essential lipid transfer function in pathogenic fungi, Sec14 is involved in secretion of virulence determinants essential for the pathogenicity of C. neoans, making it an attractive antif target. Our data support NG04 as a novel antif starting point.

**Conclusions:** We present genetic evidence that NG04 inhibits Sec14 and initial data supporting NG04 as a novel antif starting. Given the high unmet medical need for Cryptoccus infections, we prioritized testing NG04 and related ergoline analogs against this pathogen. Sec14 proteins are evolutionary conserved, suggesting targeting Sec14 may be efficacious in C neoans. Sec14-dependent virulence has been described for C neo but not other pathogen. Future studies may yield novel antif targets at different nodes of lipid transfer pathway.

**Title:** Antimalarial Drug Mefloquine Exhibits Promising Antischosomal Activity against Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum in Mice Models

**Research Question:** Can the antimal drug mefloquine exhibit antischosomal activity against Schistoma mansoni and S. japon in mice models?

**Methods:** We investigated the antischosomal efficacy of mequine, a marketed for malaria prophylaxis and treatment, in mice infected with adult and juvenile stages of S. mansoni and S. japon, two major schistosome species. Mice were administered a single oral dose of mequine (200 or 400 mg/kg) and worm burden reductions, including changes in worm distribution, were assessed.

**Findings:** Mefloquine exhibited high total and complete female worm reductions (72.3-100%) in mice infected with adult S. mans and S. japon. High worm reductions were also observed in developing stages of S. mans and S. japon harbored in mice. Both meflo enantiomers resulted in comparable worm reductions when administered to mice with subpatent or patent S. mans infection.

**Implications:** Our findings hold promise for the development of a novel antischosomal drug based on aminoal functionality. In vitro and in vivo studies have been launched to elucidate the mechanism of action and effect of meflo on S. haematium and other trematodes. It will be interesting to investigate whether mequine, widely used for malaria treatment, has an impact on schos in areas where both malaria and schos coexist.

**Conclusions:** Mefquine, an antimal drug, exhibits promising antisch properties against S. mans and S japon in mice models. High worm reductions were observed in all stages of schist worms in the rodent model, an advantage over prazant, which only displays activity against young and adult schist. Meflo enantiomers resulted in comparable worm reductions when administered to mice with subpat or patent S mans infection. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of action and effect of me on S haemat and trematodes.

**Title:** Mapping the Prevalence and Distribution of Podoconiosis in Cameroon: A Nationwide Survey of a Neglected Tropical Disease

**Research Question:** What is the prevalence and distribution of podoiosis, a neglected tropical disease causing massive swelling of the lower legs, in Cameroon?

**Methods:** A multi-stage sampling design stratified by environmental risk of podoiosis was used to survey 76 villages from 40 districts in 10 regions of Cameroon. Individuals 15 years and older were house-to-house screened for lymphedema. A clinical algorithm was used to diagnose podoiosis excluding filarial lymphedema. Individuals with lymphed were tested for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen and IgG using Alere Filasis Strips (F) test and Standard Diagnostics (BIOL) lymphatic filasis Ig4 (W123) tests, in addition to thick films. Presence of DNA to W. bancft was checked on blood using qPCR.

**Findings:** 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated. 83 individuals with lymphema were identified, of which 2 were FTS positive and W123 negative. No microfilar W bancft were found in blood of individuals with lymphema. None were positive for W bancft using qPCR. 2 F positive cases were positive for Mansonella perst DNA and Loa loa microilar. 52 with podoiosis were identified after applying clinical algorithm. Prevalence of podoiosis was 0.5% (95 CI 0.4-0.7). At least one case podo found in every region except Adamawa. 40 districts had no cases, 15 had 0.2-1% and 8 had 1.2-2.7%.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates low but widespread distribution of podoiosis in Cameroon. Designing podo control program vital. Health response to burden podo important through surveillance and morbidity services.

**Conclusions:** This study provides first population-based survey of podo in Cameroon, estimates prevalence using clinical, parasological and serological results among 15 years. Prevalence lymphema and podoiosis 0.8 and 0.5 respectively. Podo found in 9 of 10 regions. Nationwide distribution unclear, intervention minimal. Major differential podo is lymphatic filasis. Differentiating from p difficult due confounding diseases.

**Title:** Notch Signaling Regulates Germline Stem Cell Niche Occupancy and Aging in Drosophila

**Research Question:** What is the role of Notch signaling in regulating germline stem cell (GSC) occupancy and aging in Drosila?

**Methods:** We used mitotic recombination to generate GSC with mutations in Notch (N) and altered Notch signaling in Gs using RNA interference (RNAi) or a constitutively active Notch (NNIC) driven by nos-GAL. We examined the number of Gs at different ages and their adhesiveness to the niche.

**Findings:** Notch signaling is increased with age in Gs, leading to their removal from the niche. Gs with low levels of Not signaling exhibit increased adhesiveness to the niche, outcompeting neighbors with higher levels. Not signaling is regulated by E-cadherin expression. Enhancement of Not in G hastens age-dependent loss from the niche, and is partially mediated by lethal. Disruption of Not in Gs does not delay loss during aging, nor affect BMP signaling, which promotes self-renewal of Gs. In contrast, Not activation in the niche maintains niche integrity and mediates G retention.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel role of Notch in controlling G-niche adhesion response to aging, relevant to metastatic cancer, where Not signaling suppresses cell adhesion.

**Conclusions:** Not signaling regulates G niche occupancy both intrinsically and extrinsically. Not signaling in the niche is decreased with age, contributing to age G loss. Both intrinsic and extrinsic Not signaling control residency of Gs during aging. Further investigation is required to pinpoint the mechanism behind this phenomenon.

**Title:** Conservation and Functional Divergence of Conserved Herpesvirus-Encoded Kinases (CHPKs) in Human Herpesviruses

**Research Question:** Do the conserved herpesvirus-encoded kinases (CHPs) encoded by different human herpesviruses share similar kinase activities, particularly cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) function, and non-dk activities?

**Methods:** We expressed epitope-tagged alleles of each CHP in human Sa-2 cells to test Rb phosphorylation, U-2 cells to monitor lamin A phosphorylation and disruption, and S. cerevisiae cdc-13 cells to assay C function. We found that beta- and gamma-herpesirus CHPs, but not alpha-herpesirus homologs, phosphorylated Rb and lamin, disrupted the nuclear lamina, and displayed bona fide Cdk activity in S. cerevis.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the conserved activity of CHPs is their C-like function, shared by beta and gamma-herpesviruses, but not alpha-herpesviruses. However, non-dk activities, such as dispersion of promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies (PMLBs) and disruption of cytoplasmic nuclear aggres, showed weak conservation among CHPs, not segregating to specific families.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that these kinases, some of which are targets of approved antiviral drugs, likely serve overlapping and non-overlapping functions during infections. The genomic conservation of kinases has not been fully maintained at functional level.

**Conclusions:** We identified virally-encoded C-like kinases, nomenclatured vCks, and found that beta and gamma-herpesirus CHPs, but not alpha-hervirus homologs, displayed Cdk function. The conservation of kinases is limited, with nonk activities poorly conserved among family members.

**Title:** Defining the Global Distribution of Burkholderia pseudalle, a Tier 1 Select Agent and Cause of Melioidosis: A Systematic Review and Consensus Guidelines for Environmental Sampling

**Background:** Burkholderia pseudalle, a Gram-negative bacillus, is a Tier 1 select agent and cause of meloidosis, a community-acquired infectious disease prevalent in tropical countries. Defining the global distribution of B. pseudalle is crucial for developing a risk map for meloidosis and informing preventive measures.

**Research Question:** What is the current global distribution of Burkia pseudalle in the environment, and what are the methods used to detect it?

**Methods:** A systematic review of literature from PubMed (January 2012-2011) using MeSH terms "pseudalle" and "melioidosis" was conducted. Bibliographies were hand-searched for secondary references. Geographical distribution of B pseudalle was categorized as definite, probable, or possible. Methods for detecting B pseud were extracted and collated.

**Findings:** Global coverage was patchy, with lack of studies in areas where meloid is suspected. Sampling and bacterial methods were variable, not robust. Only 3/61 studies (Kenya, Australia) reported negative surveys for B pseud.

**Main Findings:**

1. Global distribution of B pseud is patchy, with lack of studies in areas where meloid is suspected.

**Title:** Mechanism of Membrane Fusion by Class II Viral Fusion Proteins: Inhibition by Stem-Der Derived Peptides

**Research Question:** What is the mechanism of membrane fusion by class II viral proteins and how can it be inhibited by stem-derived peptides?

**Background:** Membrane fusion is a critical step for infectious entry of enveloped viruses into cells, facilitated by viral fusion proteins responding to molecular cues from the cellular compartment where penetration occurs. For deng and other flaviviruses, penetration occurs in endosomes following clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with protonation triggering fusion.

**Methods:** We investigated the mechanism of membrane fusion by class II viral proteins and inhibition by stem-derived peptides. Peptides from the membrane proximal region of deng-virus E bind specifically to the post-fusion conformation of E, a model for fusion intermediate. In vitro assays, these peptides block viral infectivity with potency proportional to affinity for the conformation intermediate, even when removed from preincubated inoculum before infecting cells. We propose a two-step model for mechanism inhibition targeting viral entry.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that stem-derived peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried into endosomes, where acidification initiates fusion. Binding depends on dynamics, with no inhibition at 4°C rather than 37°C. This suggests that targeting viral entry pathway can block infection effectively.

**Implications:** Our data support proposed mechanisms for conformation change promoting fusion, suggesting strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry.

**Conclusions:** The mechanism of membrane by class II viral proteins involves large domain rearrangements of glycoprotein E and transition from dimers to trimers. Rearrangement proceeds by outward rotation ectodomain loss of dimer interface, followed by reassociation into trimers. ∼-residue membrane proximal stem zips along domain II, bringing transmembrane segments C-terminus and loops tip domain II. Stem-derived peptides bind post-fusion conformation E, inhibiting infectivity with potency proportional affinity. We propose a two-step model for inhibition targeting viral entry.

**Key Findings:**

* Stem-derived peptides bind virions before attachment and carried into endosomes, where acidification initiates fusion
* Binding depends on dynamics, no inhibition at 4°C rather 37
* Targeting viral entry can block infection effectively
* Data support proposed mechanisms conformation change promoting fusion
* Strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Dyne in Epithelial Polarity: A Novel Insights into the Regulation of Apico-Basal Determinant Localization

**Research Question:** How do individual proteins become localized within epithelial cells, and what is the role of cytoplasmic dyne motor in regulating apico-basal polarity?

**Methods:** We conducted a genetic screen for epithelial defects in Drosophila follicle cells and identified cytoplasmic dyne as an essential regulator of apico-basal polarity. Using molecular biology techniques, we investigated the interaction between dyne and cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Stardust (Sdt) in localizing transmembrane protein Crumbs to the apical surface.

**Findings:** Our data suggest that dyne acts through Sdt to localize Crumbs, and mapped the S mRNA signal to an alternatively spliced exon. Intriguingly, the presence/absence of this exon corresponds to a developmental switch in S localization, with ap transcripts found in early epithelial stages and unlocalized in mature epithelia. This is the first demonstration of dyne's role in epithelial polarity and suggests mRNA localization may regulate ap-basal organization.

**Implications:** This study introduces a unique mechanism where alternative splicing of exon controls mRNA localization during development. We propose that dyne is required for proper targeting a subset of apical proteins in follicle cells, particularly S, a central regulator of embryonic epithelial polarity.

**Conclusions:** Loss of dy in Dophila follicle epithelium leads to defects in ap-basal polarity, suggesting dy could affect cell architecture by targeting apical proteins to their site of action. Cr, a transmembrane apical determinant, is a potential dy cargo. We show dy is required to enrich S transcripts in ap cytoplasm during epith polarity defects. To understand dy dependence and developmental regulation of S localization, we mapped the cis-acting signal targeting S to ap cytoplasm using U-transgenes.

**Future Directions:** A complementary study examining dy and mRNA contributions to ap-b regulation can be found in Li et al. (2007). Our findings indicate dy is required for proper targeting subset apical proteins in follicle and is important for S localization.

**Title:** Intraclonal Genetic Exchange in Leishmania infantum: A Novel Insights into the Reproductive Biology of a Clonal Parasite

**Research Question:** Does Leishmania infantum exhibit intraclonal genetic exchange within its natural vector, Phlebotus periciosus, and what are the implications for its reproductive biology and virulence?

**Methods:** We generated transgenic L. infant lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters and hypothesized that cells with identical genotypes could recognize and mate. We fed Phbotus pericios individuals with a mixture of parental clones and analyzed the midgut for genetic exchange. Using yellow and drug markers, we provided evidence for genetic exchange in L. infant. Hybrid progeny were triploid based on DNA content and stable throughout the parasite life cycle. Infections by the hybrid in BAL/c mice reduced parasite loads in spleen and liver and weight, similar to uninfected mice. Sple argin activity was significantly lower than parental strains.

**Findings:** We isolated doubly drug-resistant L. infant hybrids, confirming Leish's capacity to mate within the sand vector. Using a co-express system, two hybrids were isolated, extending exchange to cutaneous and visceral strains. Yellow hybrids were generated with same L. genome, demonstrating functionality during infections in fly. Triploid hybrids were generated by proposed fusion between haploid and diploid cells. Viability and virulence of L. infant hybrid were significant results.

**Implications:** Leish's absence of polyploids in clinical isolates may be due to loss of virulence in tetraploids or reduction diploid stage. Gene expression analysis will clarify this question. L infant retains mating capacity within natural fly. Cutaneous leishiasis in Turkey showed similar meiosis frequency to co-infected fly studies. Genetic exchange was demonstrated by Beverley's group co-infections Phbotus dubqi with L major and aethopica. Our goal is to explore Leish recombination between same genotype during mating. We chose L strain MC/AN/199/BC150 zodemon-1 from infected dog in Spain.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates intracl genetic exchange in L. infant within Phbotus pericios, suggesting ability to recognize same genotype and mate. Hybrid progeny stable throughout life cycle with reduced virulence, correlating with lower argin activity in vitro and vivo. These findings have implications for understanding Leish reproductive biology and virulence.

**Title:** Genetic Characterization of Leishmania donov Strains from Visceral Leishmanias Patients in Ethiopia: Implications for Diagnostic and Vaccine Development**

**Background:** Visceralishmanias (VL), caused by Leishmania donovani, is a significant public health problem in Ethiopia, with disparate parasite strains transmitted by different vectors and genotypes. This study aimed to characterize recently isolated strains from VL and HIV-VL co-infected patients in north and south Ethiopia.

**Methods:** Sixty-three L. donani strains were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS), cystine protease B (cp), and HAS (26). ITS and cp-PCR identified strains as L. donani, while k-PCR amplicon size varied depending on patient's geographic origin.

**Findings:** Most strains from northwestern Ethiopia (36/40) produced a 290bp product, with minority (4/40) giving 410 amplicon, all latter from HIVL co-infections, while former contained both VL and HIV co-infections. Almost all strains (20/23) from southwestern produced 450bp, with smaller products (290 or 360) observed for three. Sudanese strains amplicons identical to northwestern; Kenyan gave larger products (500 650). High-resolution (HR) analysis distinguished different products. Sequence analysis showed k repeat in L. donani comprised polymorphic 13 and 14 amino motifs, 13 prevalent in L. don, rare in L. infant, and order varies between regions.

**Implications:** HAS repeat (26) shows considerable polymorphism among L don strains different Africa. This should be considered when designing assays and vaccines based on antigen.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the genetic diversity of L. donani strains in Ethiopia, with implications for diagnostic and vaccine development. Further research is needed to understand transmission dynamics and develop effective control measures.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Recombinant HIV-1 Genomes in the HIV/AIDS Pandemic: A Probabilistic Model of Recombination and Breakpoints

**Research Question:** Do recombiant HIV-1 genomes contribute to the diversity of variants within the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and are some mosaic genomes with novel properties that lead to their prevalence, particularly in circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)?

**Methods:** We developed a probabilistic model of HIV-1 recombination based on local sequence identity and compared it to the distribution of breakpoints from the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We applied this model to recombin sequences from the HIV-1 pandemic and found that the observed frequencies of inter-sub recombination are accurately predicted by our model, indicating that local sequence-dependent recombination is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations.

**Findings:** Across the HIV-1 genome, we identified regions with significant over- or under-representation of breakpoints, suggesting natural selection influencing recombination patterns. The paucity of recombination within the envelope gene indicates recombinants in this region are less likely to be successful. Breakpoints at higher than predicted by our model are at either side of the envelope, indicating selection for recombinants as a consequence of this region or part of it having a tendency to be recombined as an unit.

**Implications:** Our findings provide the first indication of a specific portion of the genome deviating from a probabilistic model for recombination, suggesting that only a minority of recombination events are significant to HIV-1 evolution. We predict the distribution of inter-sub recombination across the viral genome based on parental subtypes from the Los Alamos HIV Database and compared it to distributions of inter-sub breakpoints from complete HIV recombinants. The observed frequencies fall within a 90% confidence interval, capturing large-scale variation between regions.

**Conclusions:** Our study indicates that most recombin breakpoints in HIV-1 provide limited selective advantage, except specific regions with higher probability of importance to viral evolution. We expect recombination hotspots associated with drug resistance. Our findings provide a clear understanding of the influence of sequence on template switching and the significance of recombination events in HIV-1 evolution.

**Title:** Hierarchical Bayesian Inference for Concurrent Model Comparison and Parameter Estimation: A Novel Approach to Addressing Interdependent Problems in Neuroscience Research

**Research Question:** Can a novel hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework be developed to concurrently estimate model parameters and compare models at the population level, addressing the interdependence between parameter estimation and model fitting in neuroscience research?

**Methods:** We propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference (H) framework that integrates model comparison and parameter estimation at the population level, leveraging Bayesian techniques to estimate individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects and compare candidate models according to their fits to each subject.

**Findings:** Our results show that the HBI framework has advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison theoretically and experimentally. Parameters estimated by HBI exhibit smaller errors compared to other methods, and model comparison by H is robust against outliers and not biased towards simplistic models. Furthermore, the fully Bayesian approach enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters by H-test.

**Implications:** The H framework has important consequences for both parameter and model estimation, enabling quantifying uncertainty at the group level to develop statistical tests about parameters and corresponding errors. Empirical Bayesian methods play an increasing role in modern statistics.

**Conclusions:** This work introduces a novel, hierarchical Bayesian inference method addressing both model fitting and comparison within the same framework using variational techniques. The random effects of inference have important for parameter and model. We took a fully Bayesian approach quantifying uncertainty at the group, enabled to develop statistical about parameters and quantify errors. The H framework is hierarchical in the sense that parameters at individual are regularized by statistics across individuals in the group, and Bayesian in that uncertainties both individual and group are represented by distributions.

**Title:** Rhombomeres Contribute to Brainstem Auditory Development: Hox Genes Determine Rhom-derived Fate and Connectivity

**Research Question:** How do individual rhomeres and their associated Hox genes contribute to the development of auditory sensorimotor circuits in the brainstem?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of rhomeres and Hox in the assembly of functionally linked sensory and motor components, including the ventral nucleus of lemniscus, ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN), and olivocochlear neurons. We analyzed the effects of functional inactivation of Hox1, H2, and H2 on the development of auditory pathways.

**Findings:** Our results show that rhom-derived components are involved in sound perception and depend on regulatory interactions between Hox1 and H2. In Hox1 and H2 mutant mice, transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is lost, resulting in hearing impairments. On the other hand, H2 regulates Rig1 axon guidance and contralateral projections from VC to the nucleus of the trapezoid, a circuit in sound localization. Individual rhomeres and their Hox control distinct, functionally segregated circuits in the developing brainstem.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that rhom and H genes are crucial for the assembly of sensorimotor circuits in the developing brain. We demonstrate that rostral rhomeres and associated H genes are required for establishing and maintaining two major circuits in the central auditory system, with different rhom origins.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of rhom and H in the development of auditory pathways. Our results show that H1, H, and H2 are prime candidates for involvement in the assembly of sensorotor functional circuits in the hindbrain. We propose that rhom-specific and H-dependent assembly of main auditory subcircuits is essential for proper hearing.

**Title:** Unveiling the Secrets of Saccharophagus degradans Strain 2-40: A Marine Bacterium with Unprecedented Polysacide Degradation Capabilities

**Research Question:** What is the complete genome sequence of Saccharagus deans strain 2-40 (S2-40) and how does it facilitate the degradation of complex polysacides in the marine environment?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the S-40 genome, including genomic sequencing, RT-PCR, enzyme activity, and mass spectrometry studies to elucidate the mechanisms of polyside degradation.

**Findings:** The S-40 genome encodes an unusually large number of enzymes that degrade complex polysides, exhibiting novel combinations of catalytic and substrate modules. Our results show that: (1) S-40 carbohydrases are regulated by multiple mechanisms; (2) the more complex the polyside, the more enzymes are induced; and (3) glucose repression is a key regulation mechanism. Furthermore, S-40 was shown to degrade plant cell walls as sole carbon source, the first marine prokaryte to do so.

**Implications:** This study reveals S-40 as a key player in the marine carbon cycle, mediating the breakdown of complex polysides from plants and invertebrates. Its enzymatic capabilities position it as a "superdegrader" in the marine ecosystem, enhancing turnover of recalcant polysides and contributing to atmospheric CO2 inputs.

**Conclusions:** The S-40 genome provides insights into the mechanisms of polyside degradation in the marine environment, highlighting the importance of this bacterium in the marine carbon cycle. Its polyside degrading systems contain multiple enzymes with synergistic activities, such as endo- and exo-acting cellulases, which liberate cellobiose from cellulose chains. This study underscores the understudied role of S40 in the marine ecosystem and its potential applications in biotechnological applications.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Culex pipiens Mosquitoes in Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) Genotype Shift in China

**Background:** Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus responsible for significant childhood neurological infections in Asia. Over the past 20 years, the dominant genotype has shifted from III (GIII) to I (GI). The mechanism of this shift remains unknown. Culex pipiens mosquitoes are the primary vector in China and play a crucial role in JE transmission.

**Research Question:** Do Cx pip mosquitoes play a role in JE genotype shift?

**Methods:** We used Cx pip mosquitoes from China as an in vivo model to explore their potential role in JE genotype shift. Female Cx pip mosquitoes were orally exposed to GI or GIII JEV strains. Midgut, whole, organs, and salivary glands of infected mosquitoes were collected at 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) and subjected to measure infection rate, replication, dissemination, and transmission of JEV in C pip mosquitoes by 50% tissue infective dose assay.

**Findings:** Cx pip mosquitoes were competent for both GI and GIII infection with similar rates and kinetics. After establishment, C pip disseminated both genotypes to secondary organs at similar rates. GI-infected saliv glands (16.2%) were positive for GI, whereas GIII was undetectable at 7dpi. However, 29.4% (5/17) and 36.3% (8) were positive for GI- and G-infected saliv glands at 14, showing an increase in J positive rate. No difference in transmission rate between GI and G-infected was detected.

**Implications:** Our data suggest GI and GIII have similar infectivity in C pip mosquitoes, indicating pip may not play a critical role in JE shift. Although data obtained solely from pip, conclusion may be extrapolated to role of mosquitoes in genotype shift.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates GI and GIII have similar infectivity in pip, suggesting pip may not play a role in JE genotype shift. Further studies with different GI and GIII strains are needed to confirm.

**Title:** Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of Dengue Deaths in Malaysia: A Nationwide Retrospective Study (2013-2014)

**Research Question:** What are the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with deng deaths in Malaysia, and what are the leading causes of mortality among different age groups?

**Methods:** We conducted a retrospective review of all deng deaths that occurred in Malaysia between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2014. Relevant data were extracted from mortality reports and investigational forms. Cases were categorized into children (<15 years), adults (15-59 years), and elderly (≥60) to compare clinical characteristics.

**Findings:** A total of 322 deng deaths were reviewed, with a mean age of 40.7±19.30 years, 72.5% were adults. Diabetes and hypertension were common comorbidities among adults and elderly. The most common symptoms were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy being more common in children (p=0.038) and abdominal pain in adults (p=0.040). 22.4% had no symptoms. Only 34% were suspected deng at initial presentation. Adults developed severe plasma leakage (p=0.018). More than half (54%) suffered multi-organ involvement and 20.2% no organ involvement. Deaths occurred at median 3 days post-admission. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) contributed >70% of deaths, followed by severe involvement (69%) and bleeding (29.7%).

**Implications:** deng deaths primarily occurred in adults, with SS leading cause of death regardless of age. Atypical presentation and progression prompts early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent deaths.

**Conclusion:** This study is the first national-scale investigation of epidemiology, clinical, and causes of fatal deng cases in Malaysia. Despite supportive management, deng is associated with severe and deaths. Our findings highlight the need for strengthened surveillance to capture deng-related deaths at home or outpatients. Majority of deng-related deaths occurred in working age group 15-59. Local data on epidemiological characterization and clinical of fatal deng cases limited. This review aims to study epidemiology, clinical, and causes of fatal deng cases nationwide 2013-2014.

**Title:** Dissecting the Mechanistic Links between Insulin Signaling, Reproduction, and Attractiveness in Drosila melanogaster

**Research Question:** What are the specific mechanisms underlying the relationship between insulin signaling, reproduction, and attractiveness in the fruit fly Drosila melanogaster, and how do different tissues contribute to this relationship?

**Methods:** We manipulated insulin signaling in various tissues, including the fat, ovaries, and follicle cells, and measured the effects on attractiveness and fecundity. We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of insulin signaling in oocytes, the cells responsible for producing cuticular hydrocarbons.

**Findings:** Insulin signaling in the fat produced opposite effects on attractiveness compared to global and follicle manipulations, suggesting a competitive relationship between the two tissues. Tissue-specific manipulations of insulin changed attractiveness and fecundity in the same direction, indicating insulin activity as a link between the two. Cuticular hydrocarbons responded distinctly to body and follicle manipulations, indicating independent readouts of pathway activity from these tissues.

**Implications:** Our results reveal a system in which attractiveness results from connection between attractiveness cues and organismal state of fecund, both created by lowered signaling in fat and increased in follic cells. This suggests that reliability in mate assessment may be compromised when pathways determining fecund are independent of those influencing attractiveness.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides mechanistic insights into the relationship between insulin, reproduction, and attractiveness in Dilaogaster, highlighting the importance of tissue-specific insulin signaling in determining attractiveness and fecund. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution of mate choice and reproductive strategies in animals.

**Title:** Estimating District-Level Transmissibility of the 2013-2015 Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic in West Africa: A Statistical Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** The 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa exhibited heterogeneous transmission patterns across the hardest-hit countries, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. This study aimed to investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD by estimating the basic reproduction number (R0) for each district and country using weekly incident numbers.

**Methods:** We applied a statistical approach to estimate R0 for each district and country using exponential regression of case counts on the first eight weeks since onset. To account for heterogeneity within countries, we fitted a mixed model and calculated R based on predicted growth rates and serial interval distribution.

**Findings:** At district level, R ranged from 0.36 (Dubka) to 1.72 (Bey) in Guinea, 0.53 (Maryland) to 3.37 (Margibi) in Liberia, and 1.14 (Kadugu) to 2.73 (Rural) in Sierra Leone. At national level, we estimated R0 0.97 (95% CI 0.77-1.18) for Guinea, 1.26 (95 CI 0.98-1.55) for Liberia, and 1.66 (95 CI 1.32-2) for Sierra. Socio-demographic variables, such as high population density and wealth index, were positively associated with R, suggesting urban growth in West may have contributed to EVD spread.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of district-level analysis in understanding EVD transmission dynamics and the role of socio-demographic factors in driving EVD spread. Our findings support the notion of geographical heterogeneity in EVD transmission in West Africa.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the suitability of mixed models in quantifying epidemic growth during large-scale multifocal epidemics and confirms geographical heterogeneity in EVD transmission in West. Our results contribute to the understanding of EVD dynamics and inform control strategies for future outbreaks.

**Title:** Unraveling the Determinants of Protein Evolutionary Rate: The Interplay between Structural Properties and Age**

**Research Question:** What are the relative contributions of intrinsic and historical factors, such as protein age, to the rate of protein evolution?

**Methods:** We investigated the interplay between structural properties and age as determinants of evolutionary rate using a large dataset of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins with mapped PDB structures.

**Findings:** Our results show that previously observed correlations between structural properties and evolutionary rates hold within each age group, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and rates. However, age also plays a crucial role in modulating the relationship between solvent and rate. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, tend to evolve faster than older proteins. We demonstrate that reported relationships between age and rate cannot be explained by structural biases among groups.

**Implications:** Our findings underscore that determinants, both intrinsic and historical, can interact to determine protein evolutionary rates. We introduce a knowledge-based function to study the stability of proteins through large-scale computation and find that older proteins are more stable in their native structure and robust to mutations than younger ones.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of age in shaping evolutionary rates, beyond the influence of solvent and secondary structure. We show that age modulates the correlation between structural and rates, and younger proteins evolve faster despite being less designable. Our results underscore the complex interplay between intrinsic and historical factors in determining protein evolution.

**Title:** Polycomb-like 3 (P3) Promotes Self-Renew and Histone Methylation in Embryonic Stem Cells through Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)

**Research Question:** What is the role of Poly-like 3 (P3) in regulating self-renew and histone methylation in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) through Poly Repressive Complex 2 (PR2)?

**Methods:** We used mass spectrometry to identify P3 as a binding partner of Suz12, a core component of PR2, and confirmed P3 interactions with PR2 components by co-immoprecipitation. Knockdown of P3 in ESCs increased spontaneous differentiation, yet did not affect early decisions assessed in teras and embryoid bodies, indicating P3 has a specific role in regulating selfnew. Consistent with P3 promoting PR function, decreasing P3 reduced H3me levels while overexpressing P3 increased Hme levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (IP) revealed P3 co-localized with Suz, and depletion of P3 decreased Suz binding at 60% PR targets.

**Findings:** P3 is a component of PR critical for selfnew, histone methylation, and recruitment of PR to a subset of genomic sites. P3 and its paralog P2 exist in different PR complexes but bind many of the same PR targets, particularly Cp islands regulated by P3. Mutation of conserved residues in the P Tudor domain, implicated in recognizing methylated histones, compromised Hme formation, suggesting the Tud domain of P is essential for function.

**Implications:** The developmental plasticity of ESCs requires repression of cell-specific genes. Two multiprotein complexes, PR1 and PR, participate in gene repression. Core of PR include Suz, E, E, and E2, methyltransfer that participates di- and triethylation lysine on histone H (H2/3). In effort to understand mechanisms regulate PR, we discovered PR interacting P, P, which promotes selfnew and mediates PR binding a number genes in ESC. P3 promotes expression multiple pluripotency markers. Consistent a role P in PR, P also promotes H formation. P-dependent H may regulate genes promote upon P inhibition. Thus, diminishment P does not derepress PR targets but may derepress subset restrain differentiation.

**Conclusions:** P is a component of PR critical for selfnew, histone methylation, and recruitment PR to subset genomic sites. P and its paralog P exist different PR complexes bind many same PR targets, particularly Cp regulated P. Mutation conserved residues Tud domain compromised H formation, suggesting Tud essential for function. Understanding P role in PR may provide insight how upregulation cancer cells transcriptional states selfnew capacities.

**Title:** Cell-Autonomous and Non-Cellautonomous Regulation of Chemoreceptor Gene Expression in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How do Caenorhabitis elegans modify their chemosensory behavior in response to changes in feeding state, and what are the mechanisms underlying these changes in chemoreceptor gene expression?

**Methods:** We investigated the regulation of the chemore gene sr-234 in the AD sensory neuron of C. elegans, which is dynamically modulated by feeding state. Using a 165 bp upstream sequence of the sr- transcription start site (sr-::fp), we found that expression is strongly in AD neurons in fed animals, but significantly downregulated in starved animals. We identified a cis-regulatory M2 binding site necessary for starvation-induced downregulation of sr- and an E-box required for expression in AD neurons.

**Findings:** We show that M2 acts with basic-helix-helix (HL) transcription factors to regulate sr- as a function of feeding state. HL-2, HL-3, and HL-4 act in AD neurons to regulate sr-, while MX-3 and HL-30 in the intestine regulate sr- levels in AD neurons, dependent on insulin signaling in AD. Intestine-to-neuron regulation of sr- involves a subset of insulin peptides.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that chemore gene expression is regulated by cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms mediated by M2 and HL factors, allowing animals to fine-tune chemens responses to changes in feeding state.

**Conclusions:** This study provides insights into how feeding-state information is translated into expression changes in chemore genes in chemensory neurons, highlighting the importance of cell-autonomous and non-autonomous transcriptional mechanisms in regulating chemore gene expression in C. elegans.

**Title:** Investigating the Association between Mycobacterium ulcerans in Mosquitoes and the Risk of Buruli Ulcer Disease in Southeastern Australia

**Research Question:** Does the presence of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes correlate with the incidence of Buruli ulcer disease in humans in southeastern Australia?

**Methods:** Adult mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria, Australia, from December 2004 to December 2009, and screened for M. ulcer using real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of BU in permanent residents of these towns during the same period was tallied to determine the average incidence of BU in each location. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between the proportion of M. ulcer-positive mosquitoes per town and incidence of BU per town.

**Findings:** A strong dose-response relationship was found between detection of M. ulcer in mosquitoes and risk of human disease (r = 0.99; 95% CI 0.92-0.99; p < 0.001). The results strengthen the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in transmission of M. ulcer in southeastern Australia.

**Implications:** This study has significant implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent BU. Public health measures to minimize mosquito bites in residents and visitors should be encouraged in endemic areas.

**Conclusions:** In the absence of alternative transmission theory that explains clinical and laboratory observations, we believe mosquitoes play a role in spread of M ulcer to humans in southeastern Australia. Further research is needed to determine if mosquitoes are involved in transmission in other BU endemic areas, such as Queensland and Africa, where majority of cases occur.

**Title:** Molecular Characterization of the Dmy Mutation and Its Implications for Myelin Maintenance in the Central Nervous System

**Research Question:** What is the molecular basis of the demyelination observed in the dmy rat model, and how does it relate to myelin maintenance in the central nervous system?

**Methods:** We employed positional cloning to identify the genetic defect responsible for the demel phenotype in dmy rats and found a G-to-A transition 177 bp downstream exon 3 of the MRS2 gene, creating a novel splice acceptor site that inactivating the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type MRS2DNA validated our findings.

**Findings:** M2 encodes an essential component of the Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria of yeast and human cells. We observed mitochondrial deficits in dmy rats, including elevated lactate concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, 60% reduction in ATP, and swollen mitochondria in oligodendrocy cytoplasm. M2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats showed M2 dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodrocytes and ultrastructurally observed in inner mitochondria membrane.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that dmy rats suffer from mitochondrial disease and myelin maintenance has different mechanism from its production. Mg2 homeostasis in mitochondria is essential for myelin maintenance.

**Conclusions:** We identified M2my as loss-of-function mutation of M2 gene encoding Mg+ protein of mitochondrial membrane. Characterization by cloning the defect responsible for demel phenotype in dmy led us to incriminate mutation in M2 allele, previously unreported in any mammalian species. M2 encodes inner Mg+ channel in mitochondria and belongs to family with orthologs in wide species. Pathological features and genetic localization suggest demel syndrome unique, no homologue reported mammalian, including humans. We demonstrate causative gene M encodes protein essential component major electrophic Mg+ influx in mitochondria. Considering pathological M2 features and M2 functions, demel in mutant likely results mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction observed multiple sclerosis, common demel disease, but pathophysiology require further investigation. Our mutant may tool investigating this matter.

**Key Findings:**

* M2 encodes Mg+ channel in mitochondria
* Mitochondrial deficits in dmy rats
* Elevated lactate cerebrospinal fluid
60% reduction ATP
Swollen mitochondria oligodcytoplasm
M2-GFP recombin B transgenic
M2 dominantly expressed neurons
Ultrastruct inner mitochond membrane

**Implications:**

* Mitochondrial disease in dmy
Myelin maintenance different from production
Mg homeost in mitochond essential

**Title:** Improving the Reliability of Microarray Gene Expression Signatures for Disease Diagnosis and Prognosis: A Study on the Importance of Unambiguous Documentation

**Background:** Microarray gene expression signatures hold great promise for improving disease diagnosis and prognosis, but current documentation standards hinder their unambiguous application to external studies, delaying their use in clinical practice.

**Research Question:** How can we improve the reliability of microarray gene expression signatures for disease diagnosis and prognosis by addressing the issue of unambiguous documentation?

**Methods:** We analyzed eight publicly available clinical microarray studies and evaluated the consistency of study-internal with study-external diagnoses. Study-external classifications were based on documented information, demonstrating that documenting a signature is conceptually different from reporting a list of genes. We found discrepancies between study-internal and studyexternal diagnoses as high as 30% (worst case) and 18% (median). To address this issue, we proposed a documentation value strategy that documents quantitative information, reducing the discrepancy to 1%.

**Findings:** Our results show that the consistency of diagnoses based on gene expression signatures depends on the documentation of the signature. Optimal consistency was obtained using the proposed documentation value strategy. We did not find evidence favoring one approach over the other.

**Implications:** The process of evaluating microarray gene diagnostic signatures and bringing them to clinical practice can be improved and made more reliable by better documentation of signatures. Unambiguous documentation is crucial for external evaluation and use in clinical practice.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of unambiguous documentation in microarray gene signatures for disease diagnosis and prognosis. We propose a documentation strategy that reduces ambiguity to a minimum, improving the reliability of microarray expression signatures. Our findings emphasize the need for attention to documentation in the field of microarray diagnostics.

**Title:** Amyloid Fibrils Secreted by Enterobacteriaceae Mediate Host Adhesion and Contribute to Biofilm Formation, Promoting Bacterial Resistance to Environmental Stress

**Research Question:** How do amyloid fibrils secreted by Enterobacteraceae mediate host adhesion and contribute to biofilm formation, thereby promoting bacterial resistance to environmental stress?

**Methods:** We investigated the crystal structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit, Csg, revealing steric fibrils of tightly mated β-sheets, demonstrating a structural link between curli and human amyloids. Dantiomic peptides, originally developed to interfere with Alzheimer's-associated amyloid, inhibited Csg fibrillation and biofilm formation in Salmonella typhim.

**Findings:** Our results show that Danti peptides, designed to interfere with oligomers of Alzheimer's-associated amyloid-β (Aβ) [–60], inhibited fibrillation of CAspines as well as full-length CAs and reduced biofilm in cur-expressing Salmonella typhim. Furthermore, in accordance with structural, fibr seeds of CAs and amyogenic facilitated fibrillation Aβ.

**Implications:** These findings provide structural insights into amyogenic regions for cur formation, suggest a novel strategy disrupting amyloid biofilms, and hypothesize on formation self-propagating prion-like species from microbial source influencing neurodegenerative diseases.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals that amyloid fibrils secreted by Enterobacter mediate host adhesion and contribute to biofilm formation, promoting bacterial resistance to environmental stress. The crystal structures of amy-forming segments from major curli sub, C, reveal steric fibrils of mated β-sheets, demonstrating structural link between cur and human amyloids. Danti peptides, developed to interfere Alzheimer-associated amyloid, inhibited C fibrillation and biofilm in Salmonella. Moreover, previously shown C fibr cross-seeded fibr of amy, supporting proposed resemblance and potential cross-species amy interactions. The findings provide structural insights amyogenic regions for cur formation, suggest novel strategy disrupting amyloid bio, and hypothesize formation self-propagating prion species from microbial influencing neurodegenerative diseases.

**Title:** Epidemiology of Japanese Encephalitis in the Philippines: A Systematic Review and Surveillance Data Analysis (2011-2014)

**Research Question:** What is the epidemiology of Japanese Encephitis (JE) in the Philippines, and what are the implications for vaccine introduction into the national immunization schedule?

**Methods:** A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011-2014 was conducted, including searches in four databases and one library. Data from acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and JE surveillance from the national laboratory from January 2011-2014 were tabulated and mapped. 29 reports on JE in the Philippines were identified, including 5 serologic, 18 clinical, and 8 animal studies (2 with both clinical and animal data). 18 studies reported 257 laboratory-confirmed JE cases from 1972-2013.

**Findings:** JE virus (JE) was the causative agent in 7-18% of cases of meningitis and encephalitis, and 16-40% of encephalitis. Predominantly affected children under 15 years, with 6-7% cases resulting in death. Surveillance from 2011-2014 identified 73 laboratory-confirmed JE out of 497 tested.

**Implications:** This review demonstrates the endemicity and geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting vaccine introduction in the country. Continued surveillance with laboratory confirmation is needed to quantify the burden, guide prioritization of high-risk areas, and age and schedule of vaccine introduction, and measure impact of preventive measures against this public health threat.

**Conclusions:** JE constitutes a significant public health burden in all regions of the Philippines, supporting consideration of inclusion in national immunization. JEV circulation in the Philippines was first identified in 1943, and has been a cause of encephitis in humans since. However, the epidemiology has not been well defined. JE is a vector-borne disease endemic in Asia, with 68,000 cases annually, 40,000 in the Pacific. Most cases occur in children under 15, with 30% fatality and 30-50 neuropsych sequelae.

**Title:** Deciphering the Origins of Genetic Robustness in Bacterial Metabolic Networks: A Large-Scale Computational Study Reveals Ecological Adaptations and Novel Drug Targets

**Research Question:** What are the origins of genetic robustness in bacterial metabolic networks, and how do environmental and intrinsic factors contribute to its evolution?

**Methods:** We conducted a large-scale computational analysis of metabolic networks from hundreds of bacterial species across various growth environments to investigate the relationship between robustness and ecological adaptations.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that variations in robustness among species reflect ecological adaptations. We decoupled robustness into two components: environmental-dependent (20% of non-essential reactions) associated with species' lifestyle (specialized/generalist) and environmental-independent (correlation=0.6) with intrinsic metabolic capacities (higher in fast growers with extensive secondary metabolite production). We identified reactions uniquely susceptible to perturbations in pathogens as novel drug targets.

**Implications:** Our findings support the notion that increased metabolic capacities have driven the evolution of robustness in bacterial networks. Robustness can be studied at various biological levels, from molecular to organismal, where it is considered robust if a mutation has insignificant effect on trait. Environmental robust differs across species, with some exhibiting wide habitat adaptability and others specialized nutritional requirements. Contribution of environmental robust to robust demonstrated by evolution of new metabolic pathway using alternative metabolite, promoting robustness.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that environmental and intrinsic factors contribute to robust in bacterial metabolic networks. Environmental robust correlates with modularity of networks (-0.43, P<e-16). Effect of environmental on robust in networks studied in yeast: half genes non-essential under nutrient-rich conditions active under restricting growth. However, environmental cannot fully explain dispensability genes. Two hypotheses proposed for evolution robust: adaptive origin and intrinsic. Our study supports notion that increased capacities have driven evolution robust in bacterial networks.

**Title:** Schistosoma Infection Modulates Immune Responses to Non-Schosome Antigens: Impaired Vaccine Responses in S. mansoni-Infected Individuals

**Research Question:** Does Schistosoma infection affect the immune response to nonchosome antigens and impair vaccine responses in S. mansoni-infected individuals?

**Methods:** The Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunization (IMCh) study was a randomized trial conducted in Enteb, Uganda, enrolling 193 S. mansoni-infected and 61 uninfected children aged 3-5 years. Children were randomized 1:1 to receive prazantel 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles catch-up immunization. Plasma-meas Ig was measured at enrollment, 1 and 24 weeks post-immunization.

**Findings:** Anti-meas Ig levels increased following immunization, but at 1 post-immun, S. mans-infected children had lower levels (adjusted mean ratio 0.4 [0.2-0.7] and percentage with protective levels also lower (odds ratio 0.1[0.9]). Among S mans-inf children, anti-meas Ig post-imm was higher in those treated with prant than those not (treated before immun, adjusted ratio 2.3[1.5-4.8]; at immun adjusted 1.8[1.1-3.5]. At 24 post-imm, Ig levels did not differ between groups, but tended lower in previously-inf children still mans-positive than those stool-negative.

**Implications:** S. mans infection among pre-school children is associated with reduced response to catch-up immunization, and prant treatment improves response. S mans infection may contribute to impaired responses in endemic populations; schistos control may enhance vaccine efficacy.

**Conclusion:** This study provides evidence that S. mans infection impairs immunogenicity to measles vaccine and prant treatment improves response. S mans may be a contributing factor to continued measles cases in Uganda and impaired responses to vaccines in tropical settings.

**Title:** Unveiling the Hidden Patterns of Bacterial Evolution: A Novel Statistical Tools for Large-Scale Analysis of Population Structure and Recombination in Neisseria Species

**Research Question:** How can we accurately infer the genetic structure and ancestry of bacterial populations with high levels of recombination using large-scale sequencing data?

**Methods:** We introduce novel statistical tools in BAPS 5.2 software to detect and represent recombination between populations, and a model-based description of population sequence space in terms of molecular variability and affinity. We apply these tools to extensive data from Neisseria species, combining with phylogenetic analysis.

**Findings:** Our methods capture distinct biological signals in molecular data, requiring careful interpretation with complementary phylogen methods and strain knowledge. A sample of 508 strains (Neisseria meningitis and Neisser lactica) demonstrates the approach's potential. We assume a simplified evolutionary model: each population has a local ancestor, local ancestors from a global ancestor, enabling tree representation of relationships (Figure 1). Traditional genetic tools are inapplicable due to lack of population conditions, while phylogenies may distort relationships with recombination.

**Implications:** Our tools enable bacterial structure analysis on unprecedented scale, overcoming computational complexity of standard Bayesian methods. We validate on Neisser species with frequent homologous recombination and horizontal gene flow.

**Conclusions:** Our statistical tools in BAPS 5.2, available at http://web.ab.fiak.fi/matec/software/baps.html, facilitate large-scale population analysis of bacterial structure and recombination. Careful interpretation with phylogen methods and strain knowledge is necessary. This approach can be applied to growing bacterial and eukaryotic databases, such as MLST (http://www.mlst.net).

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Top-Down Beta Rhythms in Cortical Activity: A Computational Modeling Approach to Attentional Modulation

**Research Question:** Can top-down beta rhythms in the beta frequency band (20 Hz) play a crucial role in attentional modulation, and if so, how do they achieve this?

**Methods:** We developed a computational model of sensory cortical areas to investigate the functional roles and mechanisms of top-down beta rhythms. Our simulation showed that top-down beta can activate synaptic projections from layer 5 (L5) to layers 4 and 2/3, responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow inhibitory interneurons were found to resonate at 20 Hz and modulate activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner.

**Findings:** Our results suggest that top-down beta rhythms can modulate activity in superficial layers by generating ascending projections to upper layers. Specifically, we found exclusive roles for excitatory and inhibitory projections from L5 to upper layers. Two types of ascending projections associated with top beta rhythms activity in superficial layers are consistent with neural modulation patterns induced by attention (Fries et al. [5, 6]. Top beta rhythms associated with attention inside the receptive field (RF) enhance gamma in L2/3, reduce beta in L2/3, and 3, and spiking of L3 cells. Excitatory interneuron connections throughout cortices gave rise to biased competition, consistent with lateral connections in our model.

**Implications:** Our model is in line with previous models that top-down signals can bias competition. However, we propose that interlamin interaction regulated by top beta rhythms support selective attention. Neural correlates of attentional control are not well understood, but biased competition has been thought to be a mechanism [10-17]. Recent studies indicate beta can be associated with top-down [18-23]. This study used a model to address whether top beta can bias competition and how they achieve. We tested top beta reproduce neurophysiological findings (Fries et. [5, 6] that stimulus generated gamma rhythms and spiking activity, and attention enhanced neural responses. Our bottom inputs simulated by 100 Hz trains of EPs to L and cells of columns.

**Conclusions:** Our results provide a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention. Top-down beta rhythms can modulate activity in superficial layers by generating ascending projections to upper. We propose that interamin interaction regulated by top beta rhythms support selective attention. This study contributes to understanding neural correlates of attentional gain and biased competition.

**Title:** Calibration and Prediction of Stochastic Transmission Models of Epidemics using Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS)

**Background:** Stochastic dynamic models are crucial for studying the emergence of novel pathogens, particularly when the number of infectious individuals is small. However, methods for parameter estimation and prediction of these models remain limited. This study proposes a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics.

**Research Question:** Can a novel method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS), accurately estimate key parameters and predict the course of epidemics using imperfect surveillance data?

**Methods:** SS applies a linear approximation to describe size fluctuations and updates the belief about the epidemic state using each new observation. Simulated outbreaks of a viral pathogen evaluate the accuracy of SS for real-time estimation and prediction.

**Findings:** SS produces accurate estimates of key parameters (mean infectious duration, R0, and Reff) and the unobserved number of individuals during an epidemic. It also predicts the number and timing of hospitalizations and attack rate. SS outperforms three benchmark methods: 1) likelihood with Poisson assumption; 2) particle filtering; and 3) Kalman filter in most scenarios.

**Implications:** SS is a promising method to improve current approaches for calibration and prediction of stochastic epidemics.

**Conclusions:** SS addresses major challenges in parameter estimation and prediction during outbreaks when the state is partially observed and disease spread is stochastic. The posterior from observations can be used as prior once new data available. Developing better methods for stochastic models improves predictions about future epidemics. Experiments compare SS with competing approaches in accuracy, estimating parameters, predicting behaviors, and inferring the state. The performance is sensitive to noise and misspecification.

**Title:** Serial Dependence in Visual Perception: A Unified Account of Sensory and Decisional Forces

**Research Question:** Do sensory and decisional processes interact to shape visual perception, and if so, how?

**Methods:** We employed multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches in a series of experiments to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during forced-choice tasks.

**Findings:** Our results revealed that perceptual reports are permeated by biases from a hierarchy of serially dependent processes: low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, whereas decisional attracts perceptual reports toward the past. This hierarchy of serial dependence arises from decisional inertia, not low sensory processes.

**Implications:** Our findings support a Two-process model of serial dependence, where persistence of readout in decision compensates for adaptation, leading to attractive biases in perception. We propose a unified account of serial dependence where functionally distinct mechanisms, operating at stages, promote differentiation and integration of visual information over time.

**Conclusions:** Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of serial dependence, revealing two contrasting forces shaping perception at any given moment, biasing appearance toward or away from past. Low-level adaptation dominates stimuli, whereas decisional forces attract recent perceptual reports. We conclude that serial dependence in perception depends on decision history, not physical stimuli, and propose a hierarchical model where adaptation and decisional forces interact, shaping experience and reactions to environmental stimuli.

**Title:** The Role of Transcription in Circadian Timekeeping in Drosophila: A Novel Insights from the CY-VP16 Fusion Protein

**Research Question:** What is the role of transcription in circadian timekeeping in Dophila, and how does the addition of a potent transcriptional activator, VP16, to the CLK-CYC heterodimer complex affect circadian function?

**Methods:** We analyzed the effects of a CY-VP16 fusion protein, a potent transcriptional activator from Herpes virus, on the CLK-CYC heterodimer complex in S2 cells and flies. The addition of VP16 to the CLK-CYC-16 complex enhanced transcriptional activity relative to the normal CLK-CYC complex, as measured by reporter gene expression and mRNA levels of CLK-C target genes, including per and tim.

**Findings:** Flies expressing CY-VP had increased levels of CLK-C target mRNAs and a short period, implicating circadian transcription in period determination. Detailed examination of reporter gene expression in CY-VP-expressing flies suggested the short period was due to rapid transcriptional phase. Importantly, behavioral effects required per promoter, indicating increased transcription, not merely higher levels, was responsible for CLK-CVP effects. This suggests timing of transcription activation, not activation itself, is key to behavioral effects in CYVP-express flies.

**Implications:** Our results indicate circadian transcription contributes to circadian function in Dophila. The addition of VP to CLK-C-16 complex drives increased transcription, leading to rapid PER accumulation and advanced phase repression. This is consistent with reporter profiles in CYVP-express flies. Increased activity was manifested in reporter genes and transgenic flies had levels CLK-C target mRNAs, including per and tim. Importantly, CYVP-express flies had short, implicating circadian in period determination.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of transcription in circadian timekeeping in Doph. The addition of VP to CLK-C16 complex enhances transcriptional activity, leading to rapid PER accumulation and advanced phase. This suggests timing of transcription activation, not activation itself, is key to behavioral effects in CYVP-express flies. Our results indicate circadian contributes to period determination in Dila.

**Title:** Species-Specific Functionality of Horizontally Acquired Genes: The Role of Ancestral Proteins in Confining the Functionality of Acquired Genes

**Research Question:** How do pre-existing proteins in an organism constrain the functionality of a horizontally acquired gene if it operates on an ancestral pathway?

**Methods:** We investigated the horizontally acquired pmr gene in Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli, two closely related bacteria, and found that the pmr protein activates the PA/PB system in Salmonella but not in E coli. coli.

**Findings:** The pmr protein in Salmonella binds to phosphorylated PA (PA) and protects it from dephosphorylation by PB, resulting in transcription of PA-dependent genes, including polymyxin resistance. In contrast, the E coli pmr protein cannot activate the PA/PB system in E coli, suggesting species-specific differences in controlling PA levels. We found that E coli PB exhibits higher phosphatase activity towards PA than Salmonella PB and identified a PB domain responsible for this property. Replacement of E coli pmr with Salmonella homolog rendered E coli resistant to polymyx B under pm-inducing conditions.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that quantitative differences in biochemical activities of orthologous proteins dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene to confer species-specific traits, suggesting that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate ancestral loci.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a singular example of how an ancestral protein controls the ability of a horizontally acquired gene to confer new traits. Our results indicate that E coli and Salmonella differ in an additional component controlling PA levels, and that pmr was acquired by lateral transfer. We show that divergent E coli pmD can rescue Salmonella pmD to activate PA/PB in low Mg+, reinforcing the notion that E pmD specifies a functional protein.

**Title:** Identifying Key Regulators of Pluripotency and Differentiation using a Novel Statistical Approach to Analyze Gene Expression Data

**Research Question:** How can we identify genes that regulate pluripotency and differentiation in embryonic stem cells using a novel statistical approach to analyze gene expression data without prior separation of cell types?

**Methods:** We developed a statistical method, Different-Test, to identify differentially expressed genes at early stages of differentiation by analyzing gene expression data without separating cell types. We applied this method to murine embryonic stem cells differentiating into embryoid bodies and experimentally verified Smad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renew.

**Findings:** Different-Test identified Smad as a critical regulator of pluripotency and selfnew, which is downregulated in differentiated cells and detectable in 4-day embryoid bodies. We further validated this finding using short hairpin RNA to knockdown of Smad and P2, two regulators detected by Different-Test.

**Implications:** Our approach provides a principled method to identify regulators of pluripot and differentiation, a long-sought goal in stem cell biology. By analyzing gene expression data without separating cell types, we can detect differentially expressed genes at early stages of differentiation, including those that promote or inhibit the process. This method is generally applicable to other differentiation processes.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the power of Different-Test in identifying key regulators of plurot and differentiation, a crucial for understanding stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. By applying this approach, we can uncover novel targets for promoting or inhibiting differentiation, advancing our understanding of complex biological processes.

**Key points:**

* Developed a novel statistical method, Different-Test, to identify differentially expressed genes at early stages of differentiation without separating cell types
* Applied to murine embryonic stem cells differentiating into embryoid bodies, identified Smad as regulator of plurot and selfnew
* Validated using short hairpin RNA knockdown of Smad and P2, regulators detected by Different-
* Provides principled approach to identify regulators of plurot and differentiation, a long-sought in stem biology
* Generally applicable to other differentiation processes

**Title:** Addressing Confounding Bias in Functional Genomic Studies: A Novel Method for Identifying Associations between Genes in Polygenic Disorders

**Research Question:** How can we accurately infer functional associations between genes in polygenic disorders, accounting for confounding biases in large-scale omics data?

**Methods:** We developed an integrative method to address confounding bias in coding sequence length, a known to exaggerate p-values in functional studies. We inferred associations between human genes from diverse data types and assessed with a phenotype-based method, controlling for heretofore unexplored confounding in coding sequence.

**Findings:** Examining functional between de novo variants, we found disease genes cluster more significantly in integrated phenotypic-link network than other networks.

**Title:** Evaluation of the Impact of Mexico's Sugar-Sweetened Beverage and Non-Essential Food Taxes on Household Purchases: A Longitudinal Analysis

**Research Question:** Did the implementation of an 8% tax on non-essential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100g and a peso-liter tax on sugar-sweet beverages (SBs) in Mexico in January 2014 lead to changes in the volume of taxed and untaxed food purchases among the urban population, stratified by socioeconomic status (SES)?

**Methods:** This study used data from the Nielsen's Mexico Consumer Panel (CPS) on 6,248 households that participated in the panel for at least 2 months during 2012-2014, with an average follow-up of 32.7 months. We analyzed the volume of purchases of taxed and untaxed foods from January 2012 to December 2014 using a longitudinal, fixed-effects model that adjusted for pre-existing trends to test whether the post-tax trend was significantly different from the expected based on pre-trend. We controlled for household and contextual factors such as salary and unemployment rate.

**Findings:** The volume of taxed food purchases in 2014 decreased by 25% (95% CI -46, -11) per capita per month, a 5.1% change beyond what was expected based on pre-tax 201-2013 trends, with no change in purchases of untaxed. Low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods than expected (-44 -16 g capita per month), medium SES purchased 5.8% less taxed than expected (-28 -11 g capita month), whereas high SES' purchases did not change.

**Implications:** This evaluation of Mexico's SSB and non-essential taxes shows that taxed food purchases declined more than expected, with larger declines among lower SES households. These results are similar in direction and magnitude to declines in SSB in response to S tax. Lower SES were more responsive to tax than middle SES, while higher SES showed no significant change, consistent with evaluation of Mexico's S tax. Our results can inform policymakers deciding on tax continuation and those considering implementation. However, impact on overall intake, quality, and patterns, as well as relation to status, remains to be studied.

**Conclusions:** The implementation of Mexico's sugar-sweet beverage and non-essential food taxes led to a significant decline in taxed food purchases among the urban population, with larger declines among lower SES households. These findings suggest that taxes can be an effective tool in reducing consumption of high-calorie foods. Future studies should evaluate the impact on overall intake, quality, and patterns, as well as how changes relate to status.

**Title:** A Biophysically Plausible Model of Collision-Sensitive Neurons with η-Like Response: Predicting the Lobula Giant Detector Neuron (LG) Characteristics

**Research Question:** Can a biophysically plausible model of collision-sensitive neurons with η-like response properties be developed to predict the characteristics of the Lobula Giant Detector Neuron (LG), a well-studied visual neuron that responds to objects approaching on a collision course with the locust's compound eyes?

**Methods:** We present a biophysically plausible model of collision-sensitive neurons with η-like response, assuming each channel is noisy and has a response threshold. An approximative power law is obtained as a result of pooling these channels. We show that this mechanism can successfully predict many response characteristics of the LGMD.

**Findings:** Our results critically depend on noise in the inhibitory pathway but are fairly robust against noise in the excitatory pathway. The synaptic input is re-scaled according to an approximate law, and we use this property in a computational model aimed at explaining many characteristics of the LG neuron.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that biophysical principles underlie the computations carried out by the LG. A possible answer comes in the guise of a simple model "nψ" that based on an equation describing the membrane potential of the LG neuron. Like η, nψ receives Θ(t) and Θ(t) as input. Integration could be carried out, for example, by the dendritic of the LG.

**Conclusions:** A biophysically plausible model of collision-sensitive neurons with η-like response can predict the characteristics of the Lobula Giant Detectoruron (LG), a well-stud visual neuron that responds to objects approaching a collision with the locust's compound eyes. Our results show that noise plays a key role in approximating a power in the inhibitory pathway by means of threshold smoothing. Threshold is predicted as a consequence of integrating inhibitory inputs. A power law alone does not suffice, as η would predict the LG's response to objects would be distorted. Our model, nψ, is biophys more plausible than η, but not biophys detailed compared to other models.

**Title:** Evolution and Challenges of the National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme in Cameroon: A 14-Year Retrospective Analysis (2002-2014)

**Research Question:** What are the achievements and challenges of the National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme (NBPUC) in Cameroon, and what suggestions can be made for scaling up the programme?

**Methods:** We analyzed data from 2001 to 2014 and reviewed reports from the NUC Cameroon. Case detection and key control indicators were plotted on a timeline to determine trends in performance. A linear regression analysis of detection rate from 2005-2014 was done, and the coefficient was tested for statistical significance.

**Findings:** In 14 years of control, 370 cases were notified. The detection rate dropped significantly from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of endemic districts rose from 2 to 64. Five diagnostic and treatment centers are functional, with two more planned for 2015. The health system has been strengthened, and research and education gained interest in Cameroon.

**Implications:** Although control began 30 years after first reported in 1969, significant progress made in detection, management, system reinforcement, and research. However, reduction in resources and activities led to steady drop in indicators since 2010.

**Conclusion:** The NUC in Cameroon has made significant strides in case detection, management, system strengthening, and research, despite beginning 30 years after first reported. However, reduction in resources and activities led to steady decline in indicators since 2010. To improve, major challenge of resource allocation must be addressed.

**Title:** The Impact of Outcome Valence on Confidence in Reinforcement Learning: A Domain-General Bias and Functional Consequences

**Research Question:** How does the valence of outcomes (gains or losses) influence confidence in reinforcement learning, and what are the underlying mechanisms driving this bias?

**Methods:** Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of outcome valence on confidence in a trial-and-error learning task, where participants learned stimulus-outcome associations. Participants were more confident in their choices when seeking gains compared to avoiding losses, despite equal performance in both contexts. Computational modeling revealed that this bias was driven by context-value, a dynamic estimate of the average expected value of options, explaining performance in both gain and loss domains.

**Findings:** The bias effect of context on confidence was observed for the first time in a reinforcement learning context and is domain-general, with significant functional implications. In volatile environments, the flexibility of individuals' learning strategies differed when outcomes were framed as gains or losses. Despite similar behavior, profound asymmetries existed between learning to avoid losses and learning to gains.

**Implications:** Confidence is a crucial in mediating factor in learning and decision-making, influencing subsequent processes and strategies. Biases in confidence can have critical consequences on reinforcement and reveal features of learning and decision-making in different contexts. This study contributes to the understanding of the flexibility of learning and decision-making processes in various contexts.

**Conclusions:** The valence of outcomes influences confidence in reinforcement learning, with individuals exhibiting lower confidence in choices while avoiding losses compared to seeking, despite equal performance and difficulty. This bias is driven by context-value, a latent variable in reinforcement models. The findings highlight the importance of investigating confidence and its biases in reinforcement learning, with implications for decision-making and learning processes.

**Title:** Alphavirus NS3 Protein Interacts with Amphiphin through SH3 Domain to Promote Viral Replication

**Research Question:** What is the role of NS3 protein in alphavirus replication and how does it interact with amphiphin?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of NS3 protein in alphavirus replication and its interaction with amphin using biochemical and cell-based systems. NS proteins from Semli Forest virus (SF), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Chikungunya virus (CHV) were analyzed for their ability to bind amphin-1 and -2 through their SH domains. Mutations in NS3 disrupting amphin SH binding and RNA-mediated silencing of amphin-2 expression impaired viral replication in HeLa cells infected with SINV or SF. Infection of Bal/c mice with SF carrying SH binding-defective NS3 was associated with decreased mortality.

**Findings:** NS proteins from SF, SINV, and CH showed avid and SH-dependent binding to amphin-1 and -2 in biochemical and cell-based systems. A proline-rich region in SF NS3 also supported binding to amphin SH. Western blotting confirmed SH-dependent interaction of NS with endogenous amphin during alphavirus infection. The PPR motif was identified as conserved amphin docking site for alphaviral NS proteins, and R426 mutation created an amphin-binding defective derivative of SINV NS. Mutations disrupting amphin SH binding sites in SF or SINV NS resulted in impaired RNA synthesis, indicating a positive role for NS/amphin interaction in alphiral replication.

**Implications:** The interaction between NS3 and amphin is crucial for alphavirus replication and pathogenicity. Amphins are recruited to replication sites and mutations in NS SH motifs led to reduced replication in culture and attenuated pathity in mice. This study highlights the importance of NS/amphin interaction in alphavirus life cycle.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the role of NS protein in alphavirus replication and its interaction with amphin through SH domain. The PPR motif is a conserved amphin docking site for alphiral NS proteins, and R426 mutation creates an amphin-binding defective derivative of SINV NS. Mutations in NS disrupting amphin binding impaired viral replication, indicating a positive role for NS/amphin in alphiral replication. The interaction between NS and amphin is crucial for alphavirus replication and pathogenicity.

**Title:** Molecular Diversity of Chromoblastomycosis Agents in Brazil: A Phylogenetic Analysis of 123 Clinical Strains

**Research Question:** What is the genetic diversity of chromobomycosis-causing agents in Brazil, and how do they cluster within the order Chaetothyales?

**Methods:** We analyzed 123 clinical strains of chromobomycosis from Brazil using DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region and partial β-tubulin genes.

**Findings:** Strains were grouped into three clusters within the family Herpotiaceae, with Foncaea being the most prevalent (80%), followed by F. monora (13%), F. nica (3%), and a single isolate of F.pnacius. Additional agents belonged to Rhinadiella and Cyphora, with frequencies of 3% and 1%, respectively.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the genetic diversity of chromomyc agents in Brazil, with Fonca being the primary cause of the disease, followed by F. mon and F. nica. Novel species Rhadi and Cyphora were also identified as agents of chromomyc.

**Conclusions:** Our phylogenetic analysis of 123 clinical strains of chromomyc from Brazil revealed three clusters within the family Herpotiaceae, with Fonca being the most prevalent agent, followed by F. mon and F nica. Novel species Rhadi and Cyora were also identified as agents of chromyc. This study contributes to the understanding of the genetic diversity of chromyc agents in Brazil and highlights the importance of Fonca as the primary cause of the disease.

**Title:** Bacterial Subversion of the DNA Damage Response Pathway: Listeria monocytogen Dampens Host DNA Damage Signaling to Promote Infection

**Research Question:** How does Listeria monocytogen manipulate the host DNA damage response to facilitate infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of Lister monocogen infection on host DNA integrity in vitro and in vivo. We infected cells with L monocogen and measured DNA breaks and activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. We also examined the role of listeriolysin O (LO), a virulence factor, in modulating DDR.

**Findings:** Lister monocogen induces DNA breaks and activates DDR in host cells. However, surprisingly, the response to these breaks is only moderately activated. We found that LO degrades Mre11, a key sensor of DNA damage, through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Knocking out proteins involved in DDR promotes bacterial replication, highlighting the importance of this mechanism for infection control.

**Implications:** Our data demonstrate that dampening DDR is critical for successful Lister infection. Deletion or inhibition of proteins in DDR leads to higher infection levels, showing DDR can be a negative regulator of bacterial infection. Several extracellular bacteria induce DNA damage, but this has not been studied during Lister infection.

**Conclusions:** Our study uncovers subversion of DDR during L monocogen infection and a role in blocking bacterial proliferation. L monocogen provokes DNA breaks in host while controlling DDR. Although wild-type bacteria modestly induce DDR, Δly mutant lacking LO does so significantly. We reveal LO dampens DDR through degradation of host M11. Consistent results show extracellular Lister induces DNA breaks during infection.

**Title:** Bromodomain Protein 4 (BRD4) Regulates Human Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) Infection through Epigenetic Modulation and Transcriptional Activation**

**Research Question:** What is the role of bromodomain protein 4 (BR4) in the regulation of human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, and how does the pan-BD inhibitor JQ enhance HSV-1 infection?

**Methods:** We screened a chemical library of epigenetic regulation and identified BR4 as a critical player in HSV-1 infection. We treated cells with pan-BD inhibitor JQ and found that it enhanced HSV-1 infection. Using JQ as a probe, we determined that JQ acts through BR4 since BR4 knockdown ablated JQ's effect on HSV-1 infection. We investigated BR4's role in HSV-1 replication complex formation involving CD9 and RNA polymerase II, and found that JQ promotes HSV-1 infection by allocating the complex to viral gene promoters.

**Findings:** BR4 regulates HSV-1 replication by forming a complex with CD9 and RNA polymerase II, whereas JQ promotes HSV-1 infection by allocating the complex to viral gene promoters. Suppression of BR4 or inhibition of CD9 activity impeded HSV-1 infection. Our data support a model that JQ enhances HSV-1 infection by switching BR4 to regulation of viral gene expression from chromatin.

**Implications:** This study identifies BR4 as a modulator of JQ's action on HSV-1 infection and demonstrates BR4's essential role in HSV-1 infection. BR4's participation in epigenetic regulation and transcriptional activation of cellular genes suggests that JQ promotes HSV-1 infection by diverting BR4's function to viral gene expression.

**Conclusions:** BR4 regulates HSV-1 infection by recruiting transcription factors to viral promoters, and JQ enhances infection by allocating BR4 to these sites. BR4's BD domains may function similarly to JQ on HSV-1, competing for acetyl lysine interactions. We generated vectors for BR4 BD1, BD/2 expression and BR4 with BD deletion (Δ1) to eliminate chromatin targeting, and found that these mutants supported HSV-1 infection. These results demonstrate BR4's role in HSV-1 infection and provide a new target for antiviral therapy.

**Title:** Elucidating the Microbial Ecology of Noma Canorum: A Cross-Sectional Study of Gingival Fluid Samples Reveals Candidate Pathogenic Organisms

**Research Question:** What are the microbial communities present in noma lesions, a devastating oral gangrenous infection causing facial disfigurement in 140,000 malnourished children annually, and can we identify candidate noma-triggering organisms?

**Methods:** We conducted a cross-sectional study of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of gingival fluid samples from 60 children: 12 healthy, 12 with noma lesions, 12 with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG) lesions, and 12 healthy sites, and 12 healthy controls. Relative to healthy samples from diseased mouths were enriched with Spirocha and depleted Proteobacteria, while healthy sites from diseased had similar proportions of Spiro and Proteobacteria to controls. Samples from n mouths did not show higher Fusobacter abundance, casting doubt on its causative role.

**Findings:** Microbial communities from n and AN lesions were dominated by Prevotella intermedia OT, less abundant in healthy sites from same mouths. Multivariate analysis confirmed different bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites. Several OTUs in Erysotrichales, Clostriales, Bacteriales, and Spirotales were identified as indicators of n, suggesting one or more microbes within these orders associated with n lesion development.

**Implications:** This study highlights the complex interplay of microbial, oral hygiene, and immune function in n development. Future longitudinal sampling of viral and microbial components before early n lesion development is crucial.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that one or more microbes within orders Erysotrich, Clostr, Bacter, and Spirota are associated with noma development. Further research should investigate longitudinal sampling of viral and microbial components of this community before early n lesion development.

**Title:** Quorum Sensing Regulator Npr Coordinates Sporulation and Necrotism in Bacillus thuringis through a Novel Mechanism of Action

**Research Question:** How does the quorum sensing regulator Npr control sporulation and necrotism in Bacillus thuringis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Npr, a quorum sensing regulator belonging to the RNPP family, in the regulation of sporulation and necrotism in Bacillus thuringis, a model organism for studying quorum sensing in natural conditions.

**Findings:** In the absence of its cognate signaling peptide Npr, Npr acts as a negative regulator of sporulation, inhibiting the expression of SpoA-regulated genes by preventing KinA-dependent phosphorylation of phosphotransferase SpoF, thus delaying the initiation of sporulation. Npr displays similarities with Rap proteins, devoid of DNA-binding domain, controlling gene expression via protein-protein interactions. Conservation of residues interacting with SpoF suggests common inhibition of sporulation phospholay. Crystal structure of Npr reveals a flexible Rap-like structure. We propose a regulatory mechanism where key residues of bifunctional Npr are involved in two functions: Npr binding switches N from dimer inhibitor of sporulation to tetramer transcriptional activator of necrotrophic lifestyle.

**Implications:** Our results reveal unexpected properties of Npr and Npr in developmental program of B. cereus group, indicating Npr-NX regulation as a typical Gram-positive quorum sensing system with Npr as signaling peptide. Npr tightly coordinates sporulation and necrotism, ensuring survival and dissemination of bacteria during infection.

**Conclusions:** Npr, a quorum regulator, plays a dual role in regulating sporulation and necism in Bacillus thuring. In the presence of its cognate peptide Npr, N acts as transcriptional activator of necrotrophic genes, while in its absence, it inhibits sporulation by preventing SpoA phosphorylation. This mechanism ensures survival and dissemination of bacteria during infection. Our findings provide new insights into quorum sensing in Gram-positive bacteria, highlighting the role of Npr-NX system in modulating sporulation and necism.

**Title:** Enhancing HIV Treatment Prediction with Proteochem Models: Integrating Genotypic and Phenotyp Data for Personalized Therapy

**Research Question:** Can proteochem models, combining genotypic and phenotyp data, improve the prediction of antiretroviral treatment efficacy in HIV patients with diverse viral genotypes?

**Methods:** We constructed a large-scale dataset of 300,000 drug-mut bioactivity points, including 4 NNIs, 8 NIs, and 9 PIs, and 10,700 NNIs, 10,500 NIs, and 27,000 PIs. We applied protechem models, integrating chemical and protein properties, to predict phenotyp resistance based on genotyp data.

**Findings:** Our models achieved a prediction error below 0.5 Log Change, outperforming previous sequence-derived models (0.76 vs 0.91). We confirmed known and identified novel resistance-conferring mutations in Reverse Transcriptase (e.g. K102,216) and Protease (e.g.18,88) from our dataset. Prospective application to the Stanford HIV database yielded an 84% correct prediction rate, surpassing 80% in a high-quality subset.

**Implications:** Protechem models accurately predict phenotyp resistance on genotyp, even for novel mutants and mixtures. Our approach informs users about prediction reliability, adding applicability to real-world scenarios.

**Conclusion:** By integrating chemical similarity and mutational information, protechem models enhance antiretroiral treatment prediction. Our robust models can predict activity of untested drugs on unseen genotypes, aiding clinical decision-making.

**Title:** Revisiting the Mechanism of Chemotaxis: A Pseudopod-Based Computational Model Predicts Complex Cell Behavior**

**Research Question:** Despite extensive research, the mechanism of chemotaxis remains unclear, with most studies attributing it to actin polymerization leading to pseudop formation and movement. We proposed an alternative mechanism where pseudods are self-generated, modulated by chemoattractants, not directly causing actin polymerization.

**Methods:** We developed a computational model of cell movement and chemaxis based on pseudod autocatalysis, testing its explanatory and predictive powers. The model reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemaxis, simulating polarization, persistence, and pseudod selection in chemoattract gradients.

**Findings:** The model predicts pseudod bias in low chemotract gradients and lateral pseudod initiation in high gradients. We tested the model's predictive ability by measuring angles between pseudods in Dictyostelium cells under different conditions, finding agreement with the model.

**Implications:** Our model and data suggest that rapidly moving cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils have an intrinsic pseudod cycle at the heart of motility, implying chemaxis relies on modification of pseudod behavior, not generation or actin polymerization by chemotract.

**Conclusions:** The similarity between modelled and real cells is striking, given the model's simplicity and robustness to parameter changes. Two mechanisms, pseudod selection and orientation, emerge from the same model, and patterns of actin polymerization and depolymerization follow stimuli are observed without multiple pathways. This suggests complex behavior is an emergent from simple pathways, requiring a change in experimental approach. Current research focuses on external signal amplification and pathways initiating actin and pseudods, but observed chemaxis in moderate gradients disagrees with compass explanations, with pseudod generation and orientation only slightly changed by chemo.

**Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Early-Phase Transmission of Yersinia pestis by Fleas: The Role of Rodent Blood Source and Post-Infection Esophageal Reflux

**Research Question:** How does the source of rodent blood used for the infectious meal affect the efficiency of early-phase transmission (EPT) of Yersinia pestis by fleas, and what is the role of post-infection esophage reflux (PIER) in this process?

**Methods:** Fleas were fed bacteremic blood from mice, rats, guinea pigs, or gerbils, and the location and characteristics of infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pest were assessed 1-3 days post-infection.

**Findings:** Surprisingly, 10-28% of rodent fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea blood refluxed a portion of the infected meal into the esophagus within 24 h of feeding, a phenomenon termed post-infection esophage reflux (PIER). PIER was rarely observed in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER correlated with accumulation of a dense aggregate of Y. pest, red blood stroma, and oxyoglobin that filled the proventulus. At next feeding, fleas with PIER were 3-25 times more likely to appear partially blocked with blood retained in the esagus than fleas without PIER. Three days feeding on bacter rat blood, groups Oropsa mont transmitted significantly more CFU than groups using mouse blood, and this transmission was bio-dependent.

**Implications:** Our data support a model where EPT results from regurgitation of Y. pest from partially obstructed foregut and EPT and BDT can temporally overlap. The insolubility of hemoglobin of rats and slower digestion of their blood appears to promote regitative transmission, which may why rodents are prominent in plague ecology.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of rodent blood source in modulating early-phase transmission of Y. pest by fleas and the role of post-infection esophage reflux in this process. Our findings suggest that fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea blood are more likely to transmit Y. pest than those fed mouse or gerbil blood, and that PIER is a key factor in this increased transmission. These results have implications for understanding the ecology and control of plague.

**Title:** Positive Correlations in Neuronal Activity Enhance Coding Performance by Orders of Magnitude

**Research Question:** Can positive correlations among neurons in the brain activity enhance coding performance, and if so, if yes, to what extent?

**Methods:** We investigated the effect of positive correlations on coding fidelity in a two-alternative discrimination task using a population of neurons. We analyzed the probability of error suppression and capacity enhancement as a function of correlation strength and number of neurons.

**Findings:** We found that positive correlations can suppress errors by orders of magnitude and enhance capacity more than tenfold, without necessitating unrealistic correlation values or large populations. This effect is due to heterogeneity in population activity, which can be tuned to achieve perfect coding. Specifically, a pattern of correlation leads to a "lock" of response probabilities, eliminating variability in subspace for discrimination.

**Implications:** Our results challenge previous findings that correlations are detrimental or marginally favorable to independent codes. Instead, we show that positive correlations can have a profound effect on coding, modulating performance with number of neurons and yielding massive enhancement. This phenomenon, which we term high-fidelity coding, is a general feature of population and has been observed in various approaches.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that positive correlations can be favorable to coding, contrary to previous claims. The degree of enhancement is extreme, several orders of magnitude rather than a few percent, and can occur in populations with tens of neurons. The role of heterogeneity is a general feature of coding, illustrated in various studies. We suggest experimental tests to identify the pattern of correlation leading to high-fidelity.

**Title:** Development of a Conjugate Vaccine against Cholera using the O-Specific Polysacchar (OSP) Component of Lipopolyschar (LPS) and Recombinant Heavy Chain of Tetanus Toxin (rHTc)

**Research Question:** Can a conjugate vaccine against cholera be developed using the O-specific polysacchar (OSP) component of lipopolyschar (L) from Vibrio cholera and recombinant heavy chain of tetanus toxin (rHT)?

**Methods:** A conjugate vaccine was prepared using OSP from Vibrio cholera O1 Inaba strain O18 and rHT. A range of vaccine doses (10-50 μg) were assessed based on OSP content, varying molar ratio of OSP to rHT (3:1, 5:1, 10:1), effect of adjuvant, and route of immunization. Immunized mice developed anti-OSP and anti-HT serum Ig responses, as well as vibriodal and memory cell responses following intramus or intrader vaccination.

**Findings:** Immunized mice developed prominent anti-OSP and anti-HT serum Ig responses, as well as vibriodal and memory cell responses following intramus or intrader vaccination. Intestinal lamina prop IgA responses targeting OSP occurred following intrader vaccination. Comparable immune responses were found in mice immunized with variations, although memory cell and vibodal responses were blunted in mice receiving highest dose (50 μ). No appreciable change in immune responses when conjugate was administered with or without adju. Administration rHT resulted in 55% protective efficacy in mouse cholera challenge model.

**Implications:** Development of Inaba OSP-HT conjugate vaccine induces memory and protection against cholera in mice. An effective cholera conjugate vaccine inducing high and long-term immune against OSP would be beneficial, especially in children responding poorly to polyschar antigens.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the development of a conjug vaccine against cholera using OSP component of lipys and rHT. Results show that OSP-HT conjugate induces immune responses and protection against cholera in mice. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this vaccine in humans.

**Title:** Evaluation of the Immunochromatographic Test (ICT) for Mapping of Wuchereria bancrofti in Areas with Contrasting Levels of Loa Endemicity in Cameroon

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the cross-reactivity of the Immunochromatographic (ICT) test with lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas with contrasting levels of Loa loa endemicity in Cameroon.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 villages across three regions (East, North, West, and South) of the Cameroon rainforest domain. Blood samples were collected from participants for detection of circulating filarial antigen (CFA) by ICT and assessment of microfilaria (M) using thick smear. Clinical manifestations of LF were also assessed. Individuals with positive ICT and clinically diagnosed lymphedema were subjected to night blood collection for detection of W bancroif.

**Findings:** Overall, 219 individuals participated in the study, with 24 residing in 14 communities testing positive by ICT, with prevalence ranging from 0% in South to 2.1 in North. Lymphedema diagnosed in 20 individuals, with majority in North (11/20), none tested positive ICT. No microf W. bancif found in blood of individual with positive result or lymphedema. Positive ICT strongly associated with high Loa M intensity, with 21 having over 8,000 Loa M/ml blood (Odds ratio 15.4; 95%CI 6.1-39.0; p<0.001). Strong association observed between prevalence Loa and ICT area, with 1% or more positive results in areas Loa M above 15%. No association ICT and Mperans prevalence (Spearman rho -0.200; p0.747) and M density (Odds 1.8;95CI 0.8-4.2; p0.192).

**Implications:** This study confirmed association between ICT positivity and Lo intensity (M/ml blood) at individual level, and demonstrated strong association between ICT and Lo prevalence. Results suggest main confounding factor for positive test results are high Lo levels. Findings indicate W bancif less prevalent in Central region where Lo highly than previously assumed, accurate re-mapping region useful for shrinking LF distribution map.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to understanding of ICT specificity in areas with contrasting Lo endemicity levels, highlighting need for reevaluation of LF endemicity assessed by ICT in areas with contrasting Loa rates in Cameroon. Data analysis considered association between ICT positivity and Loa intensity, prevalence, and contribution Mperans to cross-reactivity not fully resolved. This study designed to reevaluate LF endemicity assessed by ICT in areas with contrasting Loa rates in Cameroon.

**Title:** Unveiling the Replication Network of Positive-Strand RNA Viruses: A 3D Electron Tomography of SARS-CoV-Infected Cells Reveals a Reticular Network of Modified Endoplasmic Reticulum

**Research Question:** How do positive-strand RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, replicate in host cells, and what is the role of modified cell membranes in their replication?

**Methods:** We employed cryo-electron tomography to image SARSV-infected cells at high resolution, revealing a unique reticular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) integrating convol membranes, double-membr vesicles (DMVs), and vesicles arising from DM merger.

**Findings:** Our analysis shows that DMVs are not isolated vesicles, but part of a reticular network of modified ER, with convol membranes primarily immunolabeled for viralase subunits, while double-stranded RNA, presumably the site of RNA synthesis, is localized to DM interior. No connection between DM and cytos was observed, raising questions about DM formation and SARSV RNA synthesis.

**Implications:** Our study documents virus-induced reorganization of host membranes into a network for viral replication and hiding from antiviral defense. Together with biochemical studies, our ultrastructural description of replication network will dissect early stages of coronavirus cycle and virus-host interactions.

**Conclusions:** Our 3D tomography of SARSV-infected cells reveals a reticular network of modified ER integrating convol membranes, DMVs, and vesicles, with viralase subunits and dsRNA associated. This structure, not DM, is primarily immunolabeled with viralase subunits. Our findings contradict previous assumptions of DM as "free" vesicles associated with RNA synthesis and highlight the need for further investigation of DM formation and SARSV RNA synthesis.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Suberin in Regulating Water and Ion Transport in Arabidopsis thalian Roots

**Research Question:** Does suberin act as a chemical barrier limiting extracellular or apoplastic transport of water and solutes in plant roots?

**Methods:** We employed the newly characterized suberin (es1) mutant in Arabidopsis thalian to investigate the function of suberin in root water and solute transport.

**Findings:** es mutants with increased suberin exhibited reduced transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during vegetative growth, associated with decreased accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn, and increased accumulation of Na, S, K, As, and Mo in the shoot. We established a direct connection between suberin in the root and water movement through the plant and solute accumulation in the shoot.

**Implications:** Our findings provide genetic evidence that suberin in roots plays a critical role in controlling water and ion transport to the leaves. Changes in elemental accumulation in leaves suggest a significant component of radial transport of Ca, Mn, and Zn occurs in the apoplast.

**Conclusions:** Our results support the model that suberin acts as an extracellular transport barrier limiting apop radial transport of water and solutes. Elevated suberin, found in es1, enhances this barrier, reducing water movement to the shoot and loss from the root to soil. Reduced transpiration and wilting after water withdrawal in es1-1 and es1-2 were approximately 15% of wild-type plants. These observations provide strong support for the standard model that suberin acts as an extracellular barrier to apop radial transport of water and solutes. Elevated suberin may represent an approach to develop drought-resistant crops with improved water-use efficiency.

**Title:** Investigating the Dynamics of Rhodopsin Deactivation in Vertebrate Phototransduction: Unveiling the Sources of Variability in Single Photon Response (SPR)

**Research Question:** How do the dynamics of rhodin deactivation, including phosphorylation, catalytic activity, and sojourn time at each phosphorylation level, contribute to the variability of the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction?

**Methods:** We employed a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model based on the biochemistry of rhodin activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction, to investigate the kinetics of rhodin deactivation. Parameters were extracted from photoresponse data of wild-type (WT) and mutant mice with variable numbers of phosphorylation sites. The model reproduced both WT and mutant responses, allowing us to dissect the sources of variability into its components.

**Findings:** Our results show that the randomness of sojourn times in each phosphorylated state contributes to the Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the response, whereas the randomness of number of turn-off steps has a negligible effect. This contradicts the prevailing view that larger number of decay steps of rhin leads to more stable photoresponse. Instead, our results indicate that rhin shutoff is responsible for variability, while diffusion of second messengers acts as a suppressor.

**Implications:** This study provides a stochastic framework for the biochemistry of rhin deactivation, capable of reproducing SPR in WT and mutant mice, and analyzing randomness of each phosphorylation state. Our findings challenge the current understanding that activation is responsible for variability and deactivation for suppression, suggesting that rhin shutoff is the primary source of variability.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of soourn times in phosphorylated states in determining the variability of photoresponse, while diffusion of second messengers acts as a suppressor. Our results have implications for understanding the mechanisms of vertebrate phototrans and the role of rhin in regulating variability. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of rhin shutoff and its impact on photoresponse.

**Title:** Decoupling Stochastic Reaction Networks from Extrinsic Fluctuations: A Novel Mathematical Framework for Analyzing Biochemical Systems

**Research Question:** How can we develop a mathematical framework to decouple stochastic reaction networks from extrinsic fluctuations, allowing for a self-contained model that summarizes system behaviors under all possible realizations of extrinsic variations?

**Methods:** We propose a novel approach to marginalize the dynamics of a reaction network with respect to extrinsic fluctuations, incorporating the environment's effect into a new model. We derive the corresponding process and master equations and demonstrate how stochastic simulations can be performed using several case studies.

**Findings:** Our decoupled dynamics provide a novel tool to study environmental stochasticity propagation along reaction networks. We show that extrinsic noise splits into two terms: suppressed and effective noise sensed by the network. In Monte Carlo simulations, the decoupled process yields a significant reduction in computational effort compared to standard SSA, especially when the environment is costly to simulate.

**Implications:** This framework offers a general tool to split biochemical networks into parts easier-to-simulate components. The decoupled model can be used for uncoupled analysis of a network subject to extrinsic noise, providing a self-contained model summarizing system behaviors under all extrinsic realizations.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for extrinsic fluctuations in biochemical models. The decoupling approach provides a novel analytical tool for studying stochasticity propagation in reaction networks. By marginalizing the system with respect to extrinsic fluctuations, we obtain a self-contained model that can be used for uncoupled analysis of reaction subject to extrinsic noise. This work highlights the role of the framework as a general tool to split biochemical networks into parts that are easier to simulate.

**Key contributions:**

**Title:** Development of a Novel Closed-Loop Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) Architecture with Unified Control-Theoretic Framework for Spike-Based Adaptation and Training

**Research Question:** Can a novel closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMI) architecture with a unified control-theoretic framework for spike-based adaptation and training improve the performance and robustness of BMI control in various tasks?

**Methods:** We developed a novel closed-loop BMI architecture with two main components: (1) a unified control-theoretic optimal feedback (OFC) framework for intention estimation and assisted training, and (2) dynamic spike-based adaptation opposed to batch-based adaptation. We used this architecture to investigate the effect of spike-based time-scales on decoder convergence in a non-human primate over tens of days.

**Findings:** Our results show that the OFC estimation improved BMI performance compared to current intention techniques, and OF-assisted training allowed the subject to achieve proficient control. Spike-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent convergence compared to batch-based methods and was robust to initialization. The architecture extended to tasks beyond those used for training.

**Implications:** Our results have significant implications for the development of clinically viable neuroprosthetics. The unified control-theoret framework generalizes across different BMI setups, enabling intention estimation, training, and adaptation. Spike-based adaptation enables faster and more robust control than current methods.

**Conclusions:** We developed a novel closed-loop BMI architecture with unified control-theoret framework for spike-based adaptation and training, improving BMI performance and robustness in various tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of spike-based adaptation and OF-assisted training, enabling faster and more consistent convergence than batch-based methods. This work contributes to the development of clinically viable neuroprosthetics.

**Title:** Investigating the Effect of Stimulus Structure on Retinal Correlations in the Mammalian Retina

**Research Question:** How does the mammalian retina process and respond to stimuli with varying degrees of spatial and temporal correlations, and what are the implications for neural resource allocation and coding efficiency?

**Methods:** We presented retinal ganglion cells with natural and artificial stimuli that varied in structure, including movies, white noiseboards, and checkerboards, and recorded simultaneous responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells. Recordings are publicly available online.

**Findings:** In response to spatio-temporally structured stimuli, ganglion cells were modestly correlated, but less than predicted by a non-adap functional model of retinal response. In contrast, responding to stimuli with purely spatial correlations, ganglion showed increased correlations consistent with static, non-ad receptive field nonlinearity. Temporally correlated gang cells had faster kernels and stronger surrounds, which explained pairwise correlations across receptive field measurements.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the mammalian retina maintains moderate output correlations across a range of spatio-temporally correlated stimuli, from white noise to natural movies. Correlations vary between stimuli, but are less than predicted by non-ad linear model. The retina does not fully decorrelate input, even for least correlated stimuli, with some correlations present between retinal ganglion spike trains.

**Conclusions:** Our results support the idea that the retina dynamically adjusts its coding strategy to represent stimuli efficiently. We found that retinal ganglion responding to correlated stimuli changes with effective contrast, i.e., standard deviation of input to nonlinearity in linear-non model cells. The retina may adjust its strategy to represent new stimulus class.

**Title:** Predicting Synthetic Lethal Interactions in Yeast: An Integrative Multi-Network Approach

**Research Question:** Can we develop an integrative, multi-network approach to predict synthetic lethal (SL) interactions in yeast that improves upon existing methods and expands the set of known SL interactions?

**Methods:** We devised an integrative, multi-network approach for predicting SL interactions, which extends the previously proposed MND approach. First, we defined a large set of features characterizing relationships between pairs of genes from various data sources, independent of known SL interactions. Using these features, we developed a non-parametric multi-classifier system for predicting SL that enabled simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures.

**Findings:** Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that SL-independent features in conjunction with advanced classification led to improved performance compared to current state-of-the-art. Using this approach, we derived the first transcription factor genetic network, which was supported by literature. We also predicted interactions between non-essential gene pairs in yeast.

**Implications:** This integrative approach is expected to be effective in uncovering new interactions from tens of millions of unknown gene pairs in yeast and hundreds of millions in higher organisms like mouse and human, where few interactions have been identified.

**Conclusions:** We developed an integrative multi-network approach for predicting SL interactions that improves upon existing methods and expands the set of known interactions. This approach is expected to be effective in uncovering new interactions in yeast and higher organisms.

**Title:** Elucidating the Redox Metabolism in Plasium falciparum: A Comprehensive Subcellular Localization of Redox Proteins and Implications for Therapeutic Interventions

**Research Question:** How does Plasium falcum, the causative agent of malaria, regulate its redox balance to adapt to various environments and maintain pathogenicity, and what are the implications for therapeutic interventions?

**Methods:** We employed a systematic approach to study the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox proteins in Plasium falcum, providing the first complete map of red compartmentation in this malaria parasite.

**Findings:** We demonstrate the targeting of two Plasium peroxiredoxins and putative glyoxal system to the apoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid, and obtain a complete picture of compartmentation of thiorexin and glutaredin-like proteins. Notably, Plium utilizes alternative translation initiation (ATI) to achieve differential localization of two major antioxidant enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioreductase.

**Implications:** Our study provides the first comprehensive picture of subcellular compartment of red metabolism in malaria, highlighting the apoplast as a crucial site for antioxidative processes. The absence of catalase and glutathione peroxidase in the parasite offers potential for chemotherapeutic agents targeting redox equilibrium. We also demonstrate the existence of ATI in Plasium, enabling differential localization of proteins, opening avenues for therapeutic interventions.

**Conclusions:** This study contributes to understanding cellular functions and interactions of the redox network in malaria, providing a tool for future research. Experimental verification of protein localization is essential, as predictions often lack significance and reliability, and targeting has rarely been considered. Our findings highlight the importance of subcellular compartmentation of red-related proteins in Plium, with implications for the development of targeted therapies.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Electrostatic Interactions in the Coupled Folding and Binding of the Intrinsically Disordered Protein PUM and its Partner M-1

**Research Question:** How do electrostatic interactions influence the coupled folding and binding process of the intrinsically disordered protein PUM and its partner M-1?

**Methods:** We employed a structure-based coarse-grained model with an explicit Debye-Hück charge model to investigate the importance of electrostatic interactions in the early and later stages of the coupled folding and binding process. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and affinity and shown to be consistent with previously published data on binding changes with respect to ionic strength.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that intramolecular electrostatic interactions have a marginal influence on the unbound state of PUM, whereas intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native electrostatic interactions, play a crucial role in the formation of the initial complex. We reveal the binding mechanism in more detail than possible with experimental data alone, uncovering the role of non-native electrostatic interactions.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of electrostatic interactions in describing the binding of intrinsically disordered proteins. Such approaches can provide predictions for results of mutational studies.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the significance of electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding process of PUM and M-1. Our results suggest that non-native electrostatic interactions are involved in the formation of the initial complex, and that intramolecular electrostatic interactions have a minimal effect on the unbound state of PUM. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of binding of intrinsically disordered proteins and highlights the importance of electrostatic interactions in protein-protein interactions.

**Title:** Nuclear Dynamics of Polycomb Group Proteins and Chromatin Domains during Drosophila Embryogenesis

**Research Question:** How do Polycomb group (Pc) proteins and chromatin domains interact and move within the nucleus during Drosila embryogenesis, and what are the implications for gene silencing?

**Methods:** We used a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins to analyze the formation and motion of Polycomb bodies (PC) and Polyhomeotic (PH) in Drosila embryos during embryogenesis.

**Findings:** Our results show that PC bodies correspond to 3D counterparts of linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During embryogenesis, PC and PH progressively accumulate in PC bodies, forming structures localized on euchromatin domains with histone H3-methylated K27. Time-lapse analysis reveals two types of motion: (1) coordinated long-range motion of PC bodies and chromatin domains, corresponding to whole chromosome movement, and (2) fast, highly constrained motion of individual PC bodies and chromatin domains within volumes larger than condensed chromatin, but smaller than chromosome territories.

**Implications:** The motion of PC and chromatin domains during early embryogenesis decreases in late stages, suggesting chromatin dynamics contribute to gene silencing maintenance. The formation and positioning of PC bodies may depend on developmental processes, as their motion is less sensitive to temperature than chromatin in late embryos.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the nuclear dynamics of Poly group proteins and chromatin during Dila embryogenesis, highlighting the importance of chromatin dynamics in gene silencing. The buffering of environmental effects, such as temperature, by Poly proteins may ensure stability of Poly-dependent silencing during development.

**Title:** Somatic Mutations in Mitochondrial DNA Implicated in Aging: A Quantification by Ultra-Deep Sequencing

**Research Question:** Can somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contribute to the aging process, and if so, how can they be accurately quantified?

**Methods:** We used ultra-deep sequencing to study the genome-wide mtDNA load in the liver of normally aging and prematurely aging mice that are homozygous for an allele expressing proof-reading-deficient mtDNA polymerase (mt mutator mice) and their wild-type siblings.

**Findings:** mt mutator mice have 10-times higher mutation loads than wild-type siblings, with increased levels of truncated mtDNA and decreased sequence coverage in deleted regions. In contrast, circular mt molecules with deletions occur at low frequencies in mtator mice and do not drive premature aging. Sequence analysis shows that the majority of mutations in heterozygous mtator and wild-type mice are inherited from heterozygous mothers, consistent with germline transmission. No increase in point mutations or deletions in wild-type C57/6 mice with age, questioning causative role of these in aging. No frequency transversions with time in any genotypes, arguing against oxidative damage as major cause mt mutations.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that somatic mt mutations occur as replication errors during development, not from accumulation in adult life.

**Conclusions:** mtDNA mutations are implicated in aging, but not universally accepted method for quantification. Our ultra-deep sequencing study shows that mtator mice have 10 higher mutation loads than wild-type, with increased truncated mtDNA and decreased sequence in deleted regions. Circular deletions occur low in mtator and do not drive premature aging. Sequence analysis shows germl transmission of mutations in heterozygous and wild-type mice. No increase in point or deletions in wild-type with age, questioning causative role. No transversions with time in any genotypes, against oxidative damage as major cause. Our results indicate somatic mt occur replication errors, not adult accumulation.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Na+ Coupling in the Anaerobic Bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum: A Novel Insights into ATP Synthesis and Opportunistic Pathogen Drug Design**

**Research Question:** How does the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum utilize glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of Na+ and couple it to ATP synthesis via F1-ATP synthase, and what are the implications for opportunistic pathogen drug design?

**Methods:** We employed biochemical and biophysical approaches to investigate the mechanism of Na+ coupling in Fusobacterium nucleatum F1-ATP synthase, including molecular dynamics simulations, X-ray crystallography, and biochemical assays.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that Na+ is directly coupled to ATP synthesis via F-AT synth with a novel Na recognition motif shared by human pathogens. Molecular modeling and energy simulations of the rotary element of the c-ring indicate Na specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity measurements showed Na stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP was sensitive to Na ionophorin. Furthermore, Na has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting ion-binding sites in both the ATPase and c-ring. Definitive evidence of Na coupling is provided by two crystal structures of the c-ring solved by X-raylography at 2.2 and 2.6 resolution at pH 5.3 and 8.7, respectively. Na ions occupy binding sites, coordinated by four amino acids and a water. Intriguingly, carboxylates mediate ion binding. Simulations and experiments demonstrate this implies a proton is bound to all sites, although Na alone drives rotary mechanism.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a new mode of ion coupling in ATPases and provide a basis for drug design against opportunistic pathogen. The novel Na-binding motif in c-ring of F-AT synth from Fusobacterium is physiologically coupled to SM and features two glutamate residues in each of 11-binding sites, instead of single carboxate-chain typical. This motif has been observed in other Na-binding proteins and anticipated c-rings, but implications for mechanism and specificity unclear. Biochemical study of PM-driven ATPase from E. coli shows near-identical amino composition Na-binding and glyc-rich motif in N-terminal helix c-sub, influencing stoichi of c-ring.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides insights into the mechanism of Na coupling in Fusobacterium F-AT synth and implications for opportunistic pathogen drug design. The novel Na-binding motif in c-ring F- synth is physiologically coupled to SM and features two glutamate residues in each 11 sites, instead of single carboxate-chain typical.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Role of T Cell Receptor (TCR) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Interactions in Adaptive Immunity: A Novel Insights from In Vivo Studies

**Research Question:** How do the characteristics of TCR-MHC interactions influence CD4+ T cell activation and effector responses in vivo, and what are the implications for vaccine design?

**Background:** TCR recognition of peptides bound to MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) initiates adaptive immunity. High-affinity and long-lived TCR-MHC interactions correlate with potent T cell activation in vitro. However, the influence of TCR-MHC parameters on T responses in vivo is poorly understood.

**Methods:** We investigated the impact of TCR-MHC characteristics on CD4+ T cell activation and effector responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting a range of T-M half-lives and in vitro activation potencies.

**Findings:** Contrary to in vitro predictions, optimal T responses in vivo occurred to ligands with intermediate T-M half-lives. Diminished responses to the ligand with longest T-M half-life were associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling, expansion, and function at multiple time points.

**Implications:** Our results reveal a level of control over T activation in vivo not recapitulated in vitro, highlighting the importance of considering in vivo efficacy of T ligands in vaccine design.

**Conclusion:** Our findings challenge the assumption that more potent T responses result from higher-avid T recognition, suggesting that vaccine strategies aiming to elicit maximum-avid T recognition may warrant reconsideration.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genomic and Chromosomal Diversity of the Ascomycete N. haematocca (Fusarium solani): Implications for Environmental Adaptation and Pathogenicity**

**Research Question:** What are the genomic and chromosomal characteristics of the ascomete N. haematocca (Fus solani), a member of the Fusarium species complex, and how do they relate to its diverse habitats and pathogenic properties?

**Methods:** We analyzed the most studied member of the Fusarium complex, N. haematocca mating population VI (MP), using optical mapping and pulsed field gel electrophoresis to determine its chromosomal structure and gene content.

**Findings:** N. haocca MPVI has 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb, with a physical genome size of 54.43 Mb and 15,707 predicted genes, the largest among ascomycetes. Supernumerary chromosomes 3, 14, 15, and 17 were confirmed by pulsed field electrophores and lack chromosome-specific sequences on their ends. Supernary chromosomes contain enriched repeat sequences, unique genes, and lower G+C content compared to other chromosomes.

**Implications:** The large genome size and gene expansion of N. haoc MP are consistent with its diverse habitats and pathogenic properties. Unique genes on supernary chromosomes may account for individual isolates' different environmental niches.

**Conclusions:** N. haoc MP's genomic and chromosomal diversity are key to its adaptability and pathogenicity. Further sequencing of isolates and species within the Fusarium complex will elucidate genome sizes and organization.

**Title:** Elucidating the Dynamics and Mechanisms of Herpesvirus Egress: A Live-Cell Fluorescence Microscopy Reveals the Role of the Secretory Pathway in Viral Egress

**Research Question:** To elucidate the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of herpesvirus egress, we investigated the transport and exocyt of pseudorabies virus (PR) particles in non-polar epithelial cells using live-cell fluorescence microscopy.

**Methods:** We employed total internal reflection (TIR) microscopy to selectively image fluorescent virus particles near the plasma membrane and utilized a virus-encoded pH-sensitive probe to visualize the precise moment of exytosis. Single-particle tracking and mean displacement analysis characterized particle motion, while imaging a panel of cellular proteins identified those spatially and dynamically associated with exyt.

**Findings:** Our data revealed that individual virus particles travel to the plasma inside acidified secretory vesicles, containing Rab GTPases Rab6, Rab8, and Rab11, regulators of the plasma-directed secretory pathway. These vesicles undergo fast, directional transport to the site of exyt, frequently near patches of LLβ, part of a complex anchoring microtubules to the plasma. Vesicles are tightly docked at the site of exyt for seconds before membrane fusion, displacing the virion across the plasma. After exyt, particles remain confined on the outer surface.

**Implications:** Our findings propose an integrated model linking intracellular pathways and exyt mechanisms mediating herpesirus egress, contradicting previous studies suggesting specialized cytoskeleton-depleted exyt sites. Transyt, a process of extracellular materials, including virus, can be taken by endyt, retained in intracellular vesicles, and released exyt.

**Conclusions:** Our live-cell fluorescence method reveals the secretory pathway working in concert with viral components to facilitate herpesirus egress. Rab GTPases Rab6, Rab8, and Rab11 are key regulators of the plasma-directed secretory pathway present on secretory vesicles. Vesicles undergo fast, directional transport to the site of exyt, which is frequently near patches of LLβ, part of a complex anchoring microtubules to the plasma. Ves are tightly docked at the site exyt for seconds before membrane fusion, displacing the virion across the plasma. After exyt, particles remain confined on the outer surface.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Enterobius vermic Infection and Mebendazole Treatment on Intestinal Microbiota and Immune Responses in Primary School-Aged Children

**Research Question:** Does exposure to Enterobius vermic infection and mebendazole treatment alter intestinal microbiota composition and immune responses in primary school-aged children?

**Methods:** We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 109 primary school children (30 pin-negative, 79 pin-infected) in Taich, Taiwan. Fecal samples were collected at baseline and 2 weeks post-mebazole administration (100mg). Gut microbiota and intestinal cytokine (SIgA) analysis were performed.

**Findings:** Enterob infection increased gut diversity, peaking after meb treatment. Phylum-wise, pin and meb were associated with decreased Fusobacteria and increased Actinob. Genus-wise, probiotic Bifobacterium increased post-infection and meb treatment. SIg levels were lower in pin-inf, elevated post-meb.

**Implications:** Exposure to pin and meb is associated with increased bacterial diversity, Actin, and probiotic Bifobacter, and decreased Fusob. SIg levels were lower in pin-inf, elevated posteb.

**Conclusion:** This study examines the impact of Enterob infection and meb treatment on intestinal microbiota and immune responses in primary school children. Both pin and meb altered microbiota, consistent with previous helmin-inf studies. Further metabolomics studies are needed to evaluate pin and me effects on commensal bacteria and host immune. The change in composition post-meb may be confounded by late effects of infection. More experiments, including animal studies, are needed to understand relationships between pin, microbiota, and immune. The immunomodulatory effect of pin may depend on interaction with individual microbi.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Architecture of Root Length in Arabidopsis thaliana: Uncovering the Role of Epistasis in a Complex Trait with Low Additive Heritability

**Research Question:** We investigated the genetic architecture of root length in Arabidopsis thalian, a model organism commonly used to study complex traits, and found that the narrow-sense heritability was statistically zero, while broad-s heritability was significant, primarily due to epistasis. We aimed to identify loci contributing to epist genetic variance using epist genome-wide association (GWA) analysis.

**Methods:** We analyzed genome-wide genotypes and phenotypes of a population of Arabidopsis thalian accessions and performed epist GWA to map loci contributing to epist genetic variance. Four pairs of interacting loci were revealed, involving seven chromosomal loci that passed a multiple-testing corrected significance threshold. We estimated the false-positive risk using a new statistical approach, suggesting half of the pairs were true associations. Experimental evaluation of candidate genes within associated loci suggested a conservative estimate.

**Findings:** Epist analyses were indispensable for confirming and identifying candidate genes for root length in this population. Accounting for epist interactions, we identified seven loci in four epistatically interacting pairs that explained a large fraction of phenotypic variance. One pair was significant even accounting for population size risk, while two of three pairs were likely false-positives. The presence of this architecture explains low-s heritability and why no loci were found in standard genome-wide association (GWA) analyses.

**Implications:** Our results contrast the common view in quantitative genetics that most variance for complex traits is additive. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for both additive and non-additive variance to detect contributing loci, as allele frequencies and genotype-phenotype maps are not known for contributing loci. We completed comprehensive G analyses to identify additive and epist loci affecting this trait, consistent with low genetic variance captured by genotyped markers, no additive loci reached significance. However, considerable epist variance was captured by genomic relationships between accessions.

**Conclusions:** The genetic contribution to this trait was unlikely to be detected using standard genetic models, and it was not surprising no locus was associated with length in standard-model GWA analyses. Our findings highlight the need to utilize GWA methods that account for both additive and non-additive variance to detect contributing loci. The epist analyses were indispensable for confirming and identifying candidate genes for root in this population.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Mutations and Haplogroups: A Global Analysis of 30,506 Sequences Reveals Insights into Disease-Causing Mutations and Recurrence**

**Research Question:** Do mitochondrial DNA (mt) mutations associated with disease have a specific haplogroup background, and if so, is this a general phenomenon or limited to a few examples?

**Methods:** We analyzed 30,506 mtDNA sequences from diverse global populations to determine the characteristics of disease-causing mutations and their association with mt haplogroups. After quality control and pathogenic score assignment, we found significant differences in pathogenic scores between mt macro-haproups.

**Findings:**

* Disease-causing mutations were more frequent in young sequences and genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected by chance.
* Macro-haproup sequences had 6-fold fewer mtDNA harboring two or more disease-causing mutations than expected (p-value = 5.96e-09, Fisher test).
* 57 disease-causing mutations were found in major haplogroups, raising the possibility that some are rare-haproup markers, not pathogenic.
* 10 (29.4%) of 34 disease-causing mt mutations showed haplog clustering (p < 0.01, Fisher test).

**Implications:**

* mtDNA background plays a role in acquiring and retaining disease-causing mutations, explaining low frequency in specific ethnic groups.
* Our dataset is representative of global populations, not enriched with rare variants or pathogenic mutations from patients.

**Conclusions:**

* The association between disease-causing mt mutations and haplog is not limited to few examples, but a general phenomenon.
* mtDNA background influences the likelihood of acquiring or retaining disease-causing mutations.
* This study highlights the importance of considering haplog in understanding disease-causing mt mutations.

**Title:** Modeling Collective Cell Motility: Unveiling the Dynamics of Cell-Cell Interactions in Cancer, Embryonic Development, and Wound Healing

**Research Question:** How do cells coordinate their motion to exhibit collective motility during cancer metastasis, embryonic development, and wound healing, and what are the underlying mechanisms that govern cell-cell interactions?

**Methods:** We employed a computational phase field model of collective motility that incorporates cell mechanics and a minimal model of contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL) to simulate cell-cell collisions on microped substrates. This approach allowed us to reproduce all observed outcomes in two-cell collisions, including direction reversal, sticking, and walking past one another.

**Findings:** A balance between internal polarization and cell-cell adhesion governs the collision outcome. We identified parameters controlling transitions between cases, including cell-cell adhesion strength, propulsion, and CIL rates. These parameters suggest why different cell types exhibit distinct collision behavior and interventions modulate outcomes.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate the importance of modeling cell-cell interactions at a biochemical level, rather than using generic mechanisms like flocking, alignment, or others. Minimal models, such as simplified CIL, would intuitively expect cell adhesion to monotonically reduce walking. However, our detailed model reveals non-monotonic effects of adhesion on collective migration. Combining cell shape and biochemistry leads to unintuitive behaviors.

**Conclusions:** We present a model describing crawling and collision dynamics of cells on microped stripes, reproducing distinct phenotypes observed in neural crest and metastatic epithelial cells. Our results argue that biochemical interactions and contact dynamics are necessary for understanding cell-cell interactions. The coupling of shape and biochemistry leads to new effects, such as nonotonic adhesion. Collective migration is crucial in various biological processes, including immune response, embryonic development, and cancer invasion. Cell interactions driving behavior create dynamics not seen in isolated cells.

**Title:** Elucidating the Dissociation Mechanism of Thioredoxin (Tr) Mixed Disulfide Complexes: A Multidisciplinary Approach

**Research Question:** The dissociation mechanism of thioredoxin (Tr) mixed disulfide complexes has been debated for over twenty years, with opposing arguments for the activation of the nucleophilic cysteine as thiol during dissociation of the complex. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism using a model complex between Tr and its endogenous substrate arsenate reductase (Ars).

**Methods:** Theoretical analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical experiments with cysteine mutants were employed to study Tr mixed disulfide dissociation.

**Findings:** Conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide Cys32Tr brought CysTr in contact with CysTr. CysTr was activated for nucleophilic attack by hydrogen bonds, and CysTr was found to be more reactive than CysArs. Cys directed its nucleophil attack on susceptibleysTr not CysArs.

**Implications:** This multidisciplinary approach provides fresh insights into universal thiol/disulf exchange mechanism resulting in substrate oxidized and reduced Tr.

**Conclusion:** Thioredoxin oxidizes Ars back to its initial state. CysTr nucleically attacks CysArs of CysArs-Cys disulf, reducing Cys and forming Tr-Ars mixed disulf intermediate between CysTr and Cys (Figure 1 and 2). In this complex, CTr performs nucleic attack CTr of CysTr-Cys disulf (Figure 2). CysArs is intrinsically more reactive to nucleic attack Cys, forming CTr-Cys disulf and releasing Cys. In productive cycle, CTr-Cys disulf is dissociated by nucleic CTr, oxidizing Tr and reducing Ars. The deproton mechanism of CTr thiol has been debated for twenty years. In Bsrx-AC dissociation occurs via nucleic CTr on CTr of CTr-Cys disulf (Figure 2). Both Cys and Cys can be stabilized as thiol, both considered possible nucleiles. Nucleic attack CTr on CTr is favored. Before forming disulf Tr and Ars, CTr must be stabilized as thiol to nucleic exposed Cys-Cys dis in oxid Ars. Active Bsrx site, α-helix and CTrS-CTrNH bond stabilize CTr as thiol. Presence CTr-CNH bond calculated pKa CTr 5. Oxidized Ars as substrate, CTr nucle of Bs attacks Cys of Cys-Cys dis (Figure 2). This addresses regioselectivity of nucleic attack C on Cys disulf. In reaction, CTr is stabilized as nucleic thiol, contrasting CTr.

**Key Findings:**

* Conformation changes around intermediate disulf CTr bring CTr in contact with CTr
* CTr is activated for nucleic attack by hydrogen bonds
* C is more reactive than CArs
* directs nucleic attack on susceptible CTr not CArs

**Implications:**

* Multidisciplinary approach provides insights into universal thiol/disulf exchange mechanism in substrate oxidized and reduced Tr
* Thiorexin oxidizes Ars back to initial state
* CTr nucleically attacks CArs of Cys-C disulf reducing C and forming Tr-Ars disulf intermediate between CTr and C

**Conclusion:**

This study elucidates dissociation mechanism thiorexin mixedulf complexes using multidisciplinary approach, providing fresh insights into universal thiol/disulf exchange mechanism resulting substrate oxidized and reduced.

**Title:** The Dynamic Nature of Taste: Uncertainty and Bayesian Updating in Preference Formation

**Research Question:** Do people's tastes and preferences exhibit uncertainty, and can they update their beliefs about their preferences based on evidence, such as the preferences of others?

**Methods:** We conducted a large-scale study of 14-24 year olds, assessing discounting behavior, including variability, and decision-making before and after observing another person's choices.

**Findings:** Our results provide evidence for taste uncertainty and Bayesian updating. Firstly, participants' decision variability was better accounted for by a random-taste than a response-noise model. Secondly, taste shifts were described by a Bayesian model taking into account uncertainty and social information relevance. Temporal discounting coefficients, an example of taste-for-patience, quantified impulsivity, showed good psychometric properties and changed upon observing others' choices.

**Implications:** Our findings have neuroscientific, clinical, and developmental significance. We modelled subjects as uncertain about their tastes, reflected in choices even before learning others' preferences. The taste-uncertainty (K) model assumed subjects maintained a distribution over taste and sampled to make a choice on trial. We tested our ideas on a substantial sample with discount preferences and demographics.

**Conclusions:** Uncertainty about one's preferences, in absence of social influence, is a basis for subsequent preference shift. The paradigm of discounting modelled how someone's preferences lead to learning about one's own. Our study of over 700 young people made novel contributions. Firstly, social information Bayesian updates beliefs, better fit the K model, dependence on preference-shift choice and decrease in uncertainty with age, suggesting variability reflects taste rather than taste-independent noise. Uncertainty does not necessitate variability, like observed. People might estimate own taste by samples and act on it.

**Key Takeaways:**

* People's tastes and preferences are uncertain and can be updated based on evidence, such as the preferences of others.
* Uncertainty about one's preferences, in absence of social influence, is a basis for subsequent preference shift.
* Temporal discounting coefficients, an example of taste-patience, quantified impulsivity, showed psychometric properties and changed upon observing others' choices.
* Our findings have neuroscientific, clinical, and developmental significance.
* The taste-uncertainty (K) model assumed subjects maintained a distribution over taste and sampled to make a choice on trial.

**Title:** Deciphering the Regulatory Hierarchy of Filamentous Growth in Budding Yeast: A Systems-Level Integration of Signaling Pathways

**Research Question:** How do different signaling pathways integrate to produce a coordinated response in filamentous growth in budding yeast under specific environmental conditions?

**Methods:** We employed a novel approach called secretion profiling to measure the extracellular domain of Msb2, a mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth (FG) MAPK pathway. Using genomic collections, we identified regulators of filament growth (AS, R101, O1, PI, and RT) also required for FG activation, sensitizing the pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronizing it with the global network.

**Findings:** Several regulators were required for MS2 expression, identifying MS2 as a "hub" where multiple signals converge. Accessibility to MS2 was regulated by histone deacetylase (HD) Rpd3L, positively regulating FG activity and filament growth. Our findings provide the first glimpse of regulatory hierarchy among pathways controlling filament growth.

**Implications:** Systems integration of signaling circuitry likely coordinates other regulatory networks controlling complex behaviors. Unexpectedly, major filament regulatory pathways (AS, R101, O1, PI, and RT) were required for MAP activation, revealing co-regulatory circuits and systems-level coordination of differentiation.

**Conclusions:** Our study shows four regulators of filament growth also required FG signaling (Figure 5). Connections between R101, O1, and RT to FG regulation are novel. The AS and other pathways (MAP, Swi, R3L) converge on MS2 promoter, a key regulator of FG. Other FG regulators include AS components and inositol transcription factor O1, recently tied to filament regulation. Discovery of pathways impinging on FG suggests systems coordination between regulating growth. We tested filament regulatory proteins, questioning whether they function together or independently. This is compounded by hundreds implicated in filament response.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Gene Expression Changes in the Evolution of Divergent Morphologies: A Genome-Wide Expression Profiling of Fruiting Body Development in Sordomycetes

**Research Question:** How do changes in gene expression contribute to the evolution of divergent morphologies in filamentous fungi, specifically in the genus Sordycetes?

**Methods:** We investigated differences in fruiting body morphology of five Sordyc species by culturing them in a common environment and profiling genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages. We reconstructed ancestral expression phenotypes and identified genes with the largest increases in expression across development. Conducting knockouts and phenotypic analysis in divergent species demonstrated altered fruiting development in species with increased expression.

**Findings:** Our study revealed that few genes retain common phenotypes or phenotypes across developmental stages, yet numerous genes function within the fruiting body process. Fruiting bodies are morphologically comparable, making them an ideal system for analyzing questions central to evolutionary biologists: common and divergent developmental sources of homolog phenotypes and how novelty arises despite constraints extant gene networks.

**Implications:** Our approach proved more efficient than gene studies targeting whole genomes or families. Combining expression with phenotypes refined Bayesian networks underlying fruit body regulation, one of least understood multicellular processes. We identified key genes regulating sexual development and reproduction in Neurospora and Fus spp. using systematic comparison and contrast gene programs across taxa.

**Conclusions:** Mapping variational properties developmental processes critical understanding why evolution occurs the way it does. Bayesian networks based on wild type measurements verified by gene-specific studies. Combining with phenotypes rigorous understanding relationships among genes morphological process and evolved. Estimation ancestral lineages provides changes expression may key morphological innovation. If phen dependent changes gene control processes, morphology map changes regulation expression.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Gene expression changes contribute to evolution divergent morphologies in Sordyc.
* Few genes retain common phenotypes across developmental stages, yet numerous function in fruiting process.
* Fruiting bodies ideal system for analyzing evolutionary questions homolog phenotypes and novelty.
* Our approach more efficient than gene studies whole genomes or families.
* Combining expression phenotypes refined Bayesian networks fruit regulation.
* Identified genes regulating sexual development and reproduction Neuroora and Fus.
* Estimation ancestral expression changes key morphological innovation.

**Title:** Efficient Delivery of Transgenes and Macromolecules into Schistosoma mansoni Eggs via Square Electroporation

**Research Question:** Can square electrop facilitate the introduction of transgenes and macromolecules into Schistoma mansoni eggs, a developmental stage with a high ratio of germ to somatic cells, making it an attractive target for transgenesis?

**Methods:** We investigated the utility of square electrop to deliver trans and macromolecules, including fluorescent Cy3-labeled siRNA, messenger RNAs, and virions into eggs of Schistoma mansoni. Eggs were incubated in Cy-labeled siRNA with or without square electrop, and signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy. Electrop was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs, and luciferase activity was detected 3 hours later. Schosome eggs were exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virions (ML) pseudyped with vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (SVG), and proviruses were detected by PCR in genomic DNA from miracid hatched vir-exposed eggs.

**Findings:** Square electrop facilitated the introduction of trans into schosome eggs, with electrop being more effective for transduction with pseudyped ML than simply soaking eggs in virions. Fluorescence was detected in eggs and miracid hatched from treated eggs incubated in Cy-labeled siRNA. Luciferase activity was detected 3 hours after electrop of mRNA, whereas lucase was not evident in eggs soaked in mRNA. Proviruses were detected in miracid h from vir-exposed eggs, indicating presence of trans in larval schosomes. Quantitative PCR analysis showed electrop of vir resulted in 2-3 times copies of provirus in schosomes compared to soaking alone.

**Implications:** These findings underscore the potential of targeting schosome for germ transgenesis. Square electrop efficiently delivered exogenous nucleic acids into eggs, traversing the criiform pores of the eggshell and entering the mirium. Fluorescence was detected at the posterior of the larva, where germinal cells are located, suggesting germinal can be reached by reporter genes introduced into schosome. Luciferase activity was detected in extracts 3 hours after electrop of mRNA, but not after soaking.

**Conclusions:** Square electrop is a viable method for introducing trans and macrom into Schoma eggs, a developmental stage with a high ratio of germ to somatic cells, making it an attractive target for transgenesis. Our results demonstrate the potential of targeting schosome for germ transgenesis, with electrop being more effective for transduction with pseudyped ML than simply soaking eggs in virions.

**Title:** Elucidating the Dynamic Behavior of Macromolecular Assemblies through Perturbation-based Markov Transmission (PM) Modeling

**Research Question:** How do macromolecular assemblies respond to perturbations, and what are the key residues involved in signal transduction and binding processes?

**Methods:** We developed a novel Perturbation Markov Transmission (PM) model to study the dynamic responses of macromolecular assemblies. We applied this approach to the GroEL-Gro chaperone system, monitoring over 8,000 residues across 6 decades of time, using the Kry subspace projection method. We analyzed relaxation time, flow, amplitude, and oscillation dynamics to identify pivotal, messenger, and binding residues.

**Findings:** Our PM model accurately predicted 71-84% of functionally important residues in the Gro-Gro system, surpassing previous studies. This approach can be applied to other macrom machineries, such as the capsid and ribosomal complex.

**Implications:** The Perturbation Markov Transmission (PM) model provides a novel framework for understanding macromolecular dynamics, enabling the identification of key residues involved in signal transduction and binding. Our results demonstrate the potential of this approach for elucidating complex biological processes in large macrom assemblies.

**Conclusions:** The Perturbation-based Markov Transmission (PM) model offers a powerful tool for studying the dynamic behavior of macromolecular assemblies. By monitoring responses to perturbations, we can identify pivotal residues, messenger, and binding sites. This approach can be applied to various macrom machineries, such as the capsid and ribosomal complex. Our results on the Gro-Gro system demonstrate the accuracy of this method, highlighting its potential for elucidating complex biological processes.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Fungal Galectins in Defense against Nematodes: A Novel Insights into the Interaction between Galectin and Fucose Glycoconjugate

**Research Question:** Can fungal galectins play a role in the defense of fungi against predators, specifically nematodes, by binding to specific glycojugates of these organisms?

**Methods:** We investigated the nematotoxic activity of Coprinopsis cinerea galectin C2 (CGL2) in Caenorhabditis elegans, a genetically tractable nematode model. C. elegans was fed E. coli expressing either authentic CGL, C2 or carbohydrate-binding defective C2 (W72) in the cytoplasm, compared to empty vector-containing E. coli transformants.

**Findings:** GL2 inhibited C. elegans development and reproduction, ultimately leading to its killing. The lack of toxicity of carbohydrate-defective C2 and resistance of C. elegans mutants defective in GDP-fucose biosynthesis suggested C2-mediated nematotoxicity depends on the interaction between GL and fucose-containing glycojugate. A screen for C2-resistant worms identified the glycojugate as Gal1,4Fuc1,6 modification of C. elegans N-gly cores. Analysis of N-gly structures in wild and C2-resistant nematodes confirmed this finding and identified a novel glycosyltransferase required for biosynthesis of this glycopeptide. X-ray structure of complex between C2 and Gal1,4uc,6Glc trischar at 1.5 resolution revealed the biophysical basis for this interaction.

**Implications:** Our results suggest fungal galects play a role in defense against predators by binding specific glycojugates of these organisms. The identified ligand of C2 in C elegans, Gal1,4uc,6 modification of proximal GlNA of Nly cores, is a feature of octopus, squid, and keyhole limpet hemocyan. The physiological significance of this Nly modification is unknown, and identification of novel glycosylase may shed light on its distribution and function.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the role of fungal galect in defense against nematodes, highlighting the importance of interaction between galect and fucose glycojugate in nematotoxicity. The identified glycojug, Gal,4uc,6 modification of C eleg Nly cores, is a potential target for future studies on its physiological significance and biosynthesis. The putative glyylase, M03.4, may be directly or indirectly involved in biosynthesis of this Nly modification. Our findings have implications for understanding fungal defense mechanisms against predators and potential applications in biotechnology.

**Title:** The Latent CD4+ T Cell Reservoir: A Hidden Driver of HIV Evolutionary Dynamics at Both Within and Between Hosts

**Research Question:** How does the existence of long-lived reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells impact the evolutionary dynamics of HIV within individuals and at the population level?

**Methods:** We developed a within-host quasis model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4 T cells and nested it into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. Using biologically plausible parameter values, we investigated the effects of the reservoir on within-host and between-host evolutionary dynamics.

**Findings:** Our results show that the presence of a latent reservoir severely delays within-host evolutionary dynamics, with longer delays associated with larger reservoir sizes and homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. This delay can fundamentally change the dynamics of the virus at the epidemiological scale. Specifically, the within-host delay can be sufficient for the virus to evolve intermediate loads consistent with maximising transmission, as observed, rather than the high loads previously predicted by models. This effect can be further enhanced if viruses similar to those initiating infection are preferentially transmitted.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the latent reservoir plays an underappreciated role in both within and between-host evolution. The presence of latently infected cells can significantly impact the evolution of the virus, influencing both the within-host rate and population-level outcome of virulence.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of considering the latent reservoir in understanding HIV evolutionary dynamics, both within individuals and at the population level. The delay caused by the reservoir can lead to intermediate levels of virulence, optimising transmission at the population level. Our results underscore the need to quantify the number of latently infected cells containing provirus in patients, a major challenge in HIV research.

**Title:** Coxsackievirus B3 Evades CD8+ T Cell Immunity by Inhibiting MHC Class I Antigen Presentation

**Research Question:** How does Coxsievirus B3 (CV3) manipulate the host immune response to evade CD8+ T cell immunity?

**Methods:** We employed transgenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as sensors to evaluate in vitro and in vivo antigen presentation by CV3 and assessed the virus' ability to inhibit MHC I and II antigen presentation.

**Findings:** CV3 almost completely inhibits antigen presentation via MHC I, thereby evading CD8+ cell immunity. In contrast, presentation of CV3-encoded MHC II epitopes is relatively unimpeded, and CV3 induces in vivo CD+ T responses that display an effector phenotype and mature into multi-functional CV3-specific CD+ T cells. These cells expand following infection and differentiate into secondary effector cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines.

**Implications:** Our findings have implications for the efficiency of antigen presentation during coxsiev infection.

**Conclusions:** CV3 inhibits MHC I antigen presentation, providing a plausible explanation for the weakness of primary CD+ T response. In contrast, M II presentation is relatively unimpeded, and CV3 induces primary and memory CD+ T responses that display an effector phenotype and Th1 cytokine profile. These cells are enriched among CD+ T in peripheral sites of infection that are major targets of CV pathogenesis.

**Title:** Investigating the Efficacy of High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisone in the Treatment of Leprosy Type 1 Reactions and Nerve Impairment: A Randomized Controlled Trial

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of high-dose intravenous methylprednisone (MP) as an adjunct to oral prednisone in the treatment of leproy Type 1 reactions (T1) and nerve impairment (N) and to determine the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroid treatment.

**Methods:** A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 42 individuals with T1 and N. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose IV MP (1g) followed by oral predone (n=20) or oral predone alone (n=22). The primary outcome measures were the rate of adverse events, clinical improvement, and nerve function at the completion of the study.

**Findings:** There were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement between the two groups. However, individuals treated with MP were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and 113 of the study compared to those treated with predone alone. Additionally, 50% of participants with T and N required additional predone treatment despite 16 weeks of corticosteroids.

**Implications:** The study supports the use of prolonged courses of corticosteroids to treat T and investigate risk factors for recurrence of T and N during corticoid treatment. The findings also suggest that high-dose IV MP is safe and may not have a larger therapeutic effect than predone on symptoms and signs of T and N in this study.

**Conclusions:** The study provides evidence for the use of highose IV MP as an adjunct to oral predone in the treatment of T and N and highlights the need for further investigation of risk factors for recurrence of T and N during corticoid treatment.

**Title:** Defective Regulatory T Cell Function in HIV Infection: Impaired Modulation of CD8 T Cell Responses and PD-1/PD-L Expression

**Research Question:** How do regulatory T cells (Treg) from HIV-infected individuals modulate CD8 T cell responses and PD-1/PD-L expression in chronic HIV infection?

**Methods:** We compared the effects of Treg from HIV-infected (Treg/HIV) and HIV-negative (Treg/H-) individuals on autologous CD8 T cell function, proliferation, differentiation, and PD-1/PD-L expression. CD8 T cells were stimulated with CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) or HIV-Gag antigens in the presence or absence of Treg.

**Findings:** T/H+ did not inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8 T function, indicating a defect in suppressive capacity or lack of sensitivity of effector T in HIV infection. However, T/H inhibited IFNγ expression of autolog CD8 T stimulated with CEF antigens, but not HIVag-specific CD8 T. Cross-cultures showed T/H inhibited differentiation of CEF or HIV-specific CD8 T from infected patients. PD-1 and PD-L expression was higher on HIV-specific CD8 T compared to CEF CD T, and did not change after T depletion or co-culture with T/H.

**Implications:** Our results suggest a defect in Treg modulating differentiation and PD-1/P-L expression on HIV-specific CD8 cells, contributing to exhaustion of HIV-specific T responses.

**Conclusions:** In HIV infection, Treg exert subset-specific inhibitory effects on CD8 cells, with HIV-specific cells being less sensitive to suppressive effects and resistant to PD-1/P-L modulation. This defect may contribute to failure to contain HIV-associated immune activation, a result of impaired T function and decreased responsiveness of effector clones, associated with high PD-1/P-L levels.

**Title:** Evaluation of Wuchereria bancrofti Glutathione-transferase (WGST) as a Vaccine Candidate Against Lymphatic Filariasis

**Research Question:** Can Wuchereria bancroft glutathione-transferase (WGST) be a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis?

**Methods:** The WGST gene was cloned from the third larval (L3) cDNA of Wuchereria bancroft and recombinant WGST (rWGST) was expressed and purified. Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area were analyzed for reactivity with rWGST. Subsequent functional analysis of rWGST showed the rW protein retained enzymatic activity of GST and antibodies in sera could inhibit this activity.

**Findings:** Serum from endemic individuals (EN) showed significant levels of anti-WGST IgG antibodies compared to microfilaremic (M) or clinical pathology (CP) subjects. Isotype analysis of anti-WGST IgG showed predominance of IgG and Ig3 in EN. rWGST retained enzymatic activity and antibodies EN sera could inhibit this activity. Similar results were obtained with anti-W antibodies raised in mice in neutralization assay. Brug mal GST and WGST showed significant similarity.

**Implications:** WGST is a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. Approximately 61% protection could be achieved against B. mal L3 challenge in jirds immunized with rGST.

**Conclusion:** This study shows WGST is a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filari. WGST retained enzymatic activity and this appears critical for parasite survival in host. Our results support previous studies on schistosome GST, fasciola, and filarial Seteria vaccines. Mechanisms underlying protection following immunization with S mans GST due to inactivation enzymatic activity. Glutione-transfer extensively investigated vaccine against parasitic infections.

**Title:** Evaluating the Off-Target Effects of CRISPR-C9 Genome Editing: A Whole-Genome Sequencing of Parent-Offspring Trios Reveals No Significant Differences in De Novo Mutations

**Research Question:** Despite the immense potential of CRISPR-C9 technologies in genome editing organisms, concerns persist regarding off-target effects remain. Recent studies have employed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of edited embryos or animals to detect de novo mutations (DNMs), which may represent changes introduced by poor editing fidelity. However, these studies used strain-matched, not pedigree-matched controls, making it difficult to distinguish generational or colony-related differences from true DNMs.

**Methods:** We employed a trio design, whole-genome sequencing 8 parents and 19 embryos, 10 of which were mutagenized with well-characterized gRNAs targeting the coat Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. Detailed analysis of whole-genome data revealed that if CRPR mutagenesis caused SN or indel off-target mutations in embryos, the number of these mutations was not statistically distinguishable from background DNMs due to other processes.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that if CRPR mutagenesis performed under described conditions caused SN or indel off-target mutations in embryos, the number of these was not statistically distinguishable from background DNMs due other processes. This supports efforts to develop CRPR-C9 as therapeutic tool.

**Implications:** This study addresses concerns regarding off-target effects of CRPR-C9 genome editing, a crucial for its therapeutic applications. Whole-genome sequencing of parents-offspring trios revealed no significant differences in de novo mutations, suggesting that CR mutagenesis under described conditions did not introduce off-target mutations.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence that CR-C9 mutagenesis performed under described conditions did not cause significant off-target mutations in embryos. This supports further development of CR-C9 as therapeutic tool.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Hypersensitive Red 1 (HR1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7) in Regulating Stomatal Aperture in Response to Blue Light

**Research Question:** How do Hypersensitive Red 1 (HR) and Proteinosphatase 7 (PP) interact to regulate stomatal aperture in response to blue light, and what are the underlying biochemical and genetic mechanisms involved?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology, biochemical, and genetic approaches to investigate the role of HR1 and PP in stomatal regulation under blue light. We isolated HR1 and PP as hypocotyl mutants under red and blue light and characterized their defects in light-induced stomatal response. We also examined the subcellular localization of HR and PP in guard cells using transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying HR1::CF and PP::YFP.

**Findings:** We found that mutations in HR or PP lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. HR and PP are expressed in guard cells in response to light-dark or dark-light transition. HR interacts with PP through its N-terminal zinc finger motif and requires PP for stomatal response. HR is phosphorylated in vivo and PP can dephosphorylate HR. The size of the HR complex changes from 193 kDa in dark to 285Da under blue, while this shift is impaired in PP mutant and HR is predominantly phosphorylated.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that modification of HR by PP under blue is essential for acquiring proper conformation and assembly of functional HR complex. Guard cells control stomatal response to multiple environmental stimuli, and this study may provide strategies for plants to benefit from constitutive ABA protection under water-limiting conditions.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies HR and PP as key players in stomatal regulation under blue light and reveals their genetic and biochemical interactions. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying stomatal response to environmental cues and highlight the importance of HR and PP in plant water use efficiency and agricultural yields.

**Title:** The Mediator Complex Subunit MDT-15 Integrates Transcriptional Responses to Nutrient Availability and Xenobiotics in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How does the Mediator subunit M-15 (MDT-15) contribute to transcriptional regulation in response to nutrient availability and xenobiotics in Caenorhabditis elegans?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of MDT-15 in transcriptional responses to nutrient availability and xenobiotics in C. elegans using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and microarray-based approaches. We depleted MDT-15 protein or mutated the mdt-15 gene in C. elegans and analyzed transcriptional responses to nutrient and xenobiotics using microarrays.

**Findings:** Depletion of MDT-15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene abrogated induction of detoxification genes in response to certain xenobiotics or heavy metals, rendering animals hypersensitive to exposure. MDT-15 selectively affected stress responses related to ingestion, as M-15 functional defects did not abrogate other stress responses, e.g., thermotolerance. We identified M-15 targets in an unbiased manner using microarrays comparing transcription profiles of wild-type worms fed for 40 hr.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that M-15 integrates transcriptional responses to nutrient and xenobiotics employing different regulatory factors. We propose a model whereby M- integrates several transcriptional pathways to monitor availability and quality of ingested materials, including nutrients and xenob compounds.

**Conclusions:** M-15 is a critical for at least two detoxification pathways in C. elegans. M- integrates expression of metabolic genes interacting with at least two metabolic factors, N-49 and SB-1. Our results suggest M- may integrate transcriptional response environmental stressors such as xeniotics and metals employing different regulatory factors. We propose M- is part of a system that coordinates adaptation to ingestion-related stress, ensuring health and longevity.

**Title:** Deciphering the Hippocampal Map: Unraveling the Topological Secrets of Spatial Navigation through Neuronal Firing Patterns

**Research Question:** How does the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for spatial navigation, encode spatial information, and what role does the pattern of neuronal firing play in conveying topological information about an animal's environment?

**Methods:** We employed a computational model of hippocampal activity, varying three parameters: firing rate, place field size, and number of neurons, in simulations of rat trajectories in topologically and geometrically distinct environments. Utilizing tools from Persistent Homology, a field of algebraic topology, we analyzed patterns of neuronal co-firing to determine if they convey topological information about the environment.

**Findings:** Our simulations revealed that patterns of coiring can indeed convey topological information about the environment in biologically realistic time. Furthermore, we identified a "learning" region where interplay between parameters produces hippocal states more or less adept at map formation. For instance, lower number of neurons can be compensated by adjustments in firing or place size, but beyond a point map begins to fail.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the hippocal map is topological, meaning it can be computed using algebraic methods for each environment and model of firing, relating geometric and topological features of space to biological activity. We propose this learning region provides a theoretical lens to view conditions impairing spatial learning by altering cell rates or specificity.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that topological information can be derived from place firing, with quantifiable predictions for the hippocal spatial map. Our results support the hypothesis that connectivity is topological, and can be computed using algebraic methods for each environment and model firing. This challenges the assumption that ensemble of spatially firing cells naturally encodes a map, instead highlighting the importance of coiring patterns in conveying spatial information.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Secretion: A Combined RNAi Analysis and Live Imaging Reveals Novel Host Factors and Trafficking Pathways

**Research Question:** What are the key host factors and cellular pathways involved in the secretion of infectious Hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles from infected cells?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of RNA interference (RNAi) analysis and live cell imaging to investigate the dynamics of HCV trafficking and identify host factors required for its secretion.

**Findings:** Our RNAi screen identified multiple components of the constitutive secretory pathway, including ER-to-Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Gol network (TGN), VAMP vesicles, and adaptor proteins, and recycling endosomes. We propose a model where HCV is enveloped at the ER and exits via the secretory pathway. Live imaging of infectious HCV with a tetrysteine (TC) tag in the core (TC) revealed trafficking to the periphery along microtubules, which can be inhibited by nocodazole. Subpopulations of TC localize to Gol and co-traffic with components of the recycling endosome. Silencing the recycling component Rab11 results in accumulation of H core at Gol. The majority traffics with apolipoprotein (ApoE) and VAMP vesicles.

**Implications:** This study identifies new host cofactors of H egress and presents dynamic studies of H core trafficking in infected cells. Our findings support a model of H secretion that interplays with the constitutive secretory pathway, similar to other Flaviviridae viruses.

**Title:** The Role of the Imprinted Gene Grb10 in Tumorigenesis: A Novel Insights from a Mouse Model of Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Tumorigenesis

**Research Question:** What is the role of the imprinted gene Gr10 in tumorigenesis, particularly in the context of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF) tumorigenesis?

**Methods:** We used a mouse model of NF tumenesis, where mice were heterozygous for the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, to study the expression of Gr10, an imprinted gene. We analyzed Gr10 expression in tumor cell lines established from our models and primary tumors, and performed functional studies to test the effect of Gr10 restoration or loss on tumor growth features.

**Findings:** We found that Gr10 is an imprinted, and the expressed allele is commonly lost in NF mutant tumors arising in our models. Restoring Gr10 in NF mutant tumors decreased proliferation, soft agar formation, and downregulated Ras signaling. Conversely, Gr silencing in untransformed mouse fibroblasts increased proliferation and Ras-GTP levels. Expression of constitutively activated ME rescued cells from Gr10-mediated reduction in colony formation.

**Implications:** Our studies reveal that Gr10 loss can occur in tumenesis, with functional consequences in untransform primary cells. In tumors, Gr10 loss promotes Ras hyperactivation, a feature of tumenesis. In the context of a NF mutant mouse model, this identifies a novel role for an imprinted in tumenesis.

**Conclusions:** This work identifies a previously undescribed role for an imprinted in disease and suggests that mutations in im genes should be considered with regard to parental origin. The loss of Gr10 has implications for the types of tumors that can be expected after Gr10 loss. Our data suggest that Gr10 functions as a negative regulator of Ras signaling, contributing to Ras dysregulation in the setting of NF-mediated tumesis.

**Title:** Probabilistic Inference and Uncertainty in Pavlovian Threat Learning: A Computational Modeling of Autonomic Nervous System Responses

**Research Question:** How do humans learn to predict threats from environmental cues during Pavlovian conditioning, and what computational mechanisms underlie this process?

**Methods:** We investigated autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlov fear conditioning using a psychophysiological modeling framework to obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS activity. We compared three computational models: probabilistic, non-probabilistic, and non-learning models, as well as different functions to link learning with ANS activity.

**Findings:** Across three experiments, both skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size (PSR) responses were best explained by a probabilistic model. Notably, SCR tracked a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PS tracked expected outcome alone.

**Implications:** This study provides systematic evidence that Pavlov threat formation and maintenance in humans relies on probabilistic inference and estimation of uncertainty, informing theories of neural implementation of aversive learning.

**Conclusions:** Pavlovian threat learning, exemplified by Pavlov conditioning, is a fundamental skill across species. However, computational understanding of this process is fragmented, with different models giving opposing predictions for trial-by-trial dynamics of AN activity. By combining psychophysiological modeling with computational theory, we provide evidence that Pavlov threat learning in humans relies on probabilistic inference and estimation of uncertainty. This informs theories of neural implementation of aversive learning.

**Key findings:**

* Probabilistic model best explains AN responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlov fear
* SCR tracks mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty
* PS tracks expected outcome alone
* Pavlov threat formation and maintenance in humans relies on probabil inference and estimation of uncertainty
* Informing theories of neural implementation aversive learning

**Title:** Crosstalk between the Septation Initiation Network (SIN) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Pathways Regulates Fungal Cytokinesis and Conidiation

**Research Question:** How do the Septation Initiation Network (SIN) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAP) pathways interact to regulate fungal cytokinesis and conidiation in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of SepH, a conserved Cdc7 kinase, and Pom, a putative kinase, in the regulation of septation and conidiation in A. nidans. We analyzed the effects of Sep and Pom on the phosphorylation of HogA, a MAPK, and examined the interaction between Sep and Pom in the absence and presence of Pbs, a putative upstream kinase of Hog.

**Findings:** Sep positively regulates phosphorylation of Hog, while Pom reversely affects this process. In the absence of Pbs, Sep and Pom are unable to affect Hog phosphorylation. Under osmotic stress, induced phosphorylated Hog bypasses the requirement of Sep, a key player in early cytokinesis, but not Mob/Sid, last in the SIN kinase cascade, indicating osmotic-induced septation bypasses Sep but not SIN requirement. We demonstrate crosstalk between SIN and MAP pathways, Pom and Sep indirectly regulate Hog phosphorylation through Hog upstream kinases.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that Sep and Pom coordinately regulate Hog phosphorylation, playing a key role in septation and coniation. Reduced Hog-P in sep1 may cause septation defects. Phosphorylated Hog may play a role in septation and coniation under non-osmotic stress conditions.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals crosstalk between the SIN and MAP pathways, highlighting the importance of Sep and Pom in regulating Hog phosphorylation for septation and coniation. We propose a model where Sep and Pom indirectly regulate Hog phosphorylation through Hog upstream kinases, suggesting Hog may be an upstream of Mob/Sid for septation. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of fungal cytokinesis and coniation and the interaction between SIN and MAP pathways.

**Title:** Investigation of Leishmania Species and Leish RNA Virus 1 (LRV1) in Patients with Cutaneous and Mucosal Leishiasis in the Amazon Region of Brazil

**Research Question:** This study aimed to identify Leish species and investigate the presence of LRV in patients with cutaneous and mucosal leishias in the Amazon region of Brazil to provide evidence on the relationship between the frequency of LRV and different Leish species with clinical manifestations of Tegumentary Leishiasis (TL).

**Methods:** A total of 156 patients diagnosed with leishias at Rondonia's Hospital of Tropical were included in the study. Clinical diagnoses were confirmed by PCR targeting hsp and DNA sequences, and species were determined by HSP PCR-RPL. LRV was tested by RT-PCR. Five Leish species were detected: 121 (77.6%) Leish Viannia braziliensis, 18 (11.5%) Leish V. guyensis, 3 (1.8) Leish V laini, 2 (1.3) Le Leish amazonensis, and 2 (1.3) Leish V shawi. 6 (3.9) samples were Leish sp. but species not determined, and 4 (2.6) suggestive of mixed infection by L. V. brazili and L. V. guy.

**Findings:** LRV was detected in L. brazili (54), L. guy (5), L. amazon (2), L. laini (1), and inconclusive (6). Patients with CL+ML and DCL were excluded from analysis. Association between LRV and disease was tested among remaining 147 patients (CL=109 and ML=38). 71.1 (n=27) muc lesions were LRV+, 28.9 (n=11) negative. Cutaneous 36.7 (n=40) were LRV+, 63.3 (n=69) negative LRV. Ratio LRV+/LRV- was 2.93 (95%CI 1.57-5.46; p<0.001), corroborating LRV association with mucosal leishias, previously described in animal models.

**Implications:** LRV is associated with mucosal leishias, but not the only factor contributing to disease. Prognostic significance of Leish species involved and LRV indicates need to be considered in diagnosis and treatment of TL.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new evidence on relationship between LRV and Leish species with clinical manifestations of TL in the Amazon region Brazil. LRV is associated with mucosal leish, but not the only factor contributing to disease. Prognost significance of Leish species and LRV indicates need to be considered in diagnosis and treatment of TL.

**Title:** Type I Interferon (IFN) Plays a Crucial Role in Host Defense Against Streptococcus pneumoniae Infection by Regulating Bacterial Transmigration from Lung to Blood

**Research Question:** What is the role of Type I Interferon (IF) in host defense against Streptoccus pneumoniae infection, a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis with high morbidity and mortality?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of IF in host defense against pneumoc using mice lacking the Type I Interferon receptor (If1−/−) or treated with neutralizing antibody against Type Interferon receptor. We also treated mice with IFβ or IF-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C) and measured bacterial numbers in lung and blood after intranasal pneumoc infection.

**Findings:** Mice lacking Type Interfer receptor or treated with neutralizing antibody exhibited enhanced bacteremia following intranasal pneumoc infection, while maintaining bacterial numbers in lung. Treatment with IFβ or IF-inducing poly(I) reduced bacteremia following intranas infection. IF led upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation pneumoc uptake receptor Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) receptor. IF reduced pneumoc invasion across epithelial and endothelial layers and If− mice showed enhanced lung permeability.

**Implications:** Our data identify IF as an important component of host defense regulating mechanisms involved in pneumoc invasion, i.e. PAF-mediated transcytosis and tight-dependent perellular migration, limiting progression from site-restricted lung to invasive disease.

**Conclusions:** IF plays a crucial role in host defense against pneumoc by regulating bacterial transmigration from lung to blood. IF upregulates tight junction proteins and downregulates PAF receptor, reducing pneumoc invasion across epithelial and endothelial layers. Our findings highlight the importance of IF in host defense against pneumoc infection and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting IF to prevent invasive pneumoc disease.

**Title:** Multilayer Spiking Neural Networks with Reward-Modulated Spike-Dependent Plasticity for Advanced Foraging Tasks

**Research Question:** Can a multilayer spiking neural network with reward-modulated spike-dependent plasticity (STDP) learn and perform complex foraging tasks, including pattern discrimination and decision-making?

**Methods:** We designed a multilayer spiking network with two layers of plastic connections, implementing both reward-modulated and non-rewardulated STDP. The network consisted of one-to-many connections from the input layer to the middle layer and all connections from the middle to the output layer. We implemented synaptic mechanisms for homeostatic regulation, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, and normalization of STDP, and limits on synaptic strength.

**Findings:** The addition of a hidden layer with non-reward ST neurons responded to specific input combinations and performed basic pattern classification. Combining with a layer implementing reward ST, the network learned to discriminate between rewarding and punishing patterns without labeled data. Synaptic noise enabled trial-and-error learning to identify effective strategies for solving the task.

**Implications:** Our study reveals critical properties of spiking networks with ST sufficient to solve complex foraging tasks involving pattern classification and decision-making. We expanded upon a single-layer network previously designed to learn foraging in a virtual environment, incorporating two layers of plastic connections and both reward and non-reward ST. The multilayer network combining both plasticities achieved higher performance in discrimination between elementary food patterns than the single-layer reward ST network.

**Conclusions:** This study links unsupervised ST for sensory learning and reward ST for decision-making in a new way, demonstrating advantages of interaction between plastic mechanisms for complex task-solving. Synaptic plasticity followed rules and reward ST paradigm between layers, while nonward ST between input and hidden layers. Our results suggest that multilayer spiking networks with reward-mod ST are capable of advanced foraging tasks, including pattern discrimination and decision-making.

**Title:** The Transcription Factor ELF5 Drives Metastasis in Luminal Breast Cancer by Co-Opting the Innate Immune System

**Research Question:** How does the transcription factor ELF5 contribute to the development and progression of luminal breast cancer, particularly in the context of metastasis?

**Methods:** We employed an inducible mouse model of mammary ELF expression in the context of luminal mammary tumors induced by PyMT to investigate the roles of ELF during mammary carcinogenesis and progression to metastatic disease.

**Findings:** In the MMT-Py mouse model, ELF levels increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood vessel permeability in primary tumors and greatly increased the size and number of metastases. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a group of immature neutrophils recently identified as mediators of vasogenesis and metastasis, were recruited to the tumor in response to ELF. Depletion of these cells using Ly6G antibodies prevented ELF from driving vasogenesis and metastasis. Expression in luminal breast cancers indicated increased myel cell invasion and inflammation correlated with ELF expression, and ELF immunohistochemical staining predicted shorter metastasis-free and overall survival of luminal patients, defining a group who experienced early disease progression.

**Implications:** In the MMT-Py mouse model, increased ELF drives metastasis by co-opting the innate system. ELF has previously been implicated in the development of anti-estrogen resistance, this finding implicates ELF as a factor in the acquisition of the lethal phenotype in luminal breast cancer.

**Conclusions:** ELF is a major determinant of the lethal phenotype in luminal breast cancer. Observations suggest ELF produces a similar response in luminal breast cancer to observed in ELF-driven Py model. Together, findings confirm observations in human cancer regarding ELF function, indicating in vivo effects coupled with the system, in Py model and luminal human cancer. Given ELF role in progression to antiest insensitivity lum breast, results show this pathway likely leads to metastasis attraction of innate system. Data indicate lum ER+ tumors with Elf levels higher intratum lymphocytes, however cytotoxic CD8+ population selectively reduced. Results human cancer consistent with suggesting implication ELF in permissive environment.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Chromatin Loops in Cell-to-Cell Variability in Gene Expression: A Stochastic Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** How do chromatin loops, characterized by connection pattern, distance, and communication, influence cell-to-cell variability in gene expression?

**Methods:** We developed a stochastic model that maps three fundamental patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of transcription to address this question. We analyzed the effects of different loop patterns on gene expression, including side-by-side, nested, and alternating loops, as well as facilitated and direct looping.

**Findings:** Our results show that nested loops enhance expression and reduce noise, whereas alternating loops have opposite effects. Facilitated looping outperforms direct looping in controlling mean expression and tuning noise, but this control is distance-dependent, with a moderate loop length limit where the difference between the two forms disappears.

**Implications:** Our analysis supports the chromatin-looping hypothesis, suggesting that chromatin looping plays a crucial role in cell-to-cell variability in gene expression.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a systematic understanding of how chromatin looping affects gene expression, addressing a long-standing question in the field. Our results highlight the importance of considering loop patterns, distance, and communication in modeling gene expression. The stochastic model reveals that facilitated looping is more effective than direct looping in controlling expression and noise, but this effect is dependent on loop length, with a limit where the difference between the two forms diminishes. These findings justify the chromatin-looping hypothesis, emphasizing the significance of chromatin looping in cell-to-cell variability in gene expression.

**Title:** De Novo Design of Repress Riboregulators: A Framework for Efficient Gene Expression Modulation through Translation Inhibiting RNAs

**Research Question:** How can we develop a reliable and efficient framework for designing repress riboregulators to modulate gene expression without the need for burdensome coexpressed proteins?

**Methods:** We employed a design of experiments (DOE) approach to analyze the influence of previously attributed post-transcriptional features on translation initiation, generating a library of 12 structural and thermodynamic features. From this library, 18 riboregulators were selected and coexpressed with target regions to link translation inhibiting features to functionality. We constructed a partial least squares model to link properties of inhibiting riboregulators to gene repression.

**Findings:** The designed riboregulators showed repression of up to 6% of original protein levels, which was partially explained by ordinary least squares model. Both structural and thermodynamic features were important for efficient gene repression by ribg.

**Implications:** This approach enables reliable de novo engineering of effective ribg, expanding the RNA toolbox for gene modulation.

**Conclusion:** We propose a framework for de novo design of repress ribg, translation inhibiting RNAs (tiRNAs), which repress expression by blocking initiation. To develop this framework, we analyzed features attributed to postcriptional modulation in DOE. Our results show that structural and thermodynamic features are crucial for efficient gene repression by ribg, enabling reliable de novo engineering of ribg. This expands the toolbox for gene modulation, reducing the need for laborious and inefficient screening of multiple designs.

**Title:** Deciphering the Enigmatic Associations: Unveiling the Mechanisms of Coherence Propagation in Cortical Networks

**Research Question:** How do transient associations among neurons underlie memory and behavior, and how can they be identified?

**Methods:** We recorded local field potential (LFP) activity at multiple sites within the cortex of awake and organotypic cultures of cortex to investigate the propagation of coherence, a phenomenon thought to underlie memory and behavior.

**Findings:** Our results show that when the composite activity of a local neuronal group exceeds a threshold, its pattern, reflected in LFP, occurs without distortion at other cortex via synaptic transmission. Large-amplitude LFPs, termed coherence potentials, extend hundreds of milliseconds and periods, marking loss-less spread of temporal information akin to action potentials at single-cell level. Coherence potentials exhibit an additional degree of freedom in waveform diversity, providing a high-dimensional parameter for encoding and identification of associations.

**Implications:** This nonlinear behavior is analogous to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks. Our findings suggest that coherence propagation represents the transfer of meaningful information in cortical networks, supported by the preservation of temporal characteristics of underlying activity. Temporal properties of LFP serve better predictors of behaviors than spikes, consistent with this explanation.

**Conclusions:** Coherence propagation across cortical regions may occur through the preservation of underlying pattern activity. Our results provide evidence for the preservation of spike activity associated with coherence propagation. While LFP represent activity of several hundred neurons, only a small number close to electrode can be resolved, a small sampling of contributing to aggregate activity.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Nuclear Size Control in Fission Yeast: Identification of Essential Factors and Processes Involved in Nuclear Size Regulation

**Research Question:** Despite the established correlation between nuclear size and cell size, the underlying mechanisms governing this relationship remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify essential factors and processes involved in nuclear size control in fission yeast.

**Methods:** We conducted a genetic screen of deletion mutants in Schizoscharomyces pombe, a genetically tractable organism undergoing closed mitosis, to uncover factors influencing nuclear size. Our screen identified 25 essential genes altering nuclear size, and bioinformatic analyses implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in size control.

**Findings:** Our study revealed a 35-fold range of cell volumes, with a constant nuclear-to-cell volume (N/C) ratio across this range. In small-scale experiments, nuclear volume increased with cell volume during the cell cycle, maintaining a constant N/C ratio throughout interphase, with a sudden increase in size accompanying DNA replication in S phase. Bioinformatic analyses implicated nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis regulation in size control.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that regulation of global processes, including nucleoplasmic transcription and cytoplasmic translation, and levels of specific nuclear components are crucial for size control. In multicellular organisms, the N/C ratio varies between cell types, but is restricted to a narrow range for each. Evidence indicates size is determined by volume or related to it, not directly by DNA content. Nuclear correlates with volume across a wide range in both budding and fission yeasts.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of nuclear size control in fission yeast, implicating RNA processing and LINC complexes in size regulation. Our findings highlight the importance of cellular processes and structural components in maintaining a constant N/C ratio. These results contribute to understanding the complex relationship between nuclear and cell size, with implications for future studies in multicellular organisms.

**Title:** Optimizing Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) for Neurological Disorders: A Mathematical Modeling and Experimental Validation

**Research Question:** Can a mathematical model of coupled oscillators be used to predict the optimal stimulation strategy for closed-loop DBS in patients with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET)?

**Methods:** We employed a reduced form of the Kuramoto model to analyze how patients respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude, under specific conditions. We compared our predictions with data from ET patients and proposed a new hybrid strategy combining phase-locked and adaptive DBS.

**Findings:** Our model predicts that stimulation should be phase-specific and have greater effect when oscillation amplitude is lower. This is supported by data from ET patients. We also propose a hybrid strategy combining phase-locked and adaptive DB.

**Implications:** Closed-loop DB has the potential to improve efficiency and reduce side effects. Success depends on devising a stimulation strategy that minimizes oscillations associated with motor disorders. Our model provides a stepping stone towards this by describing how brain oscillations change with stimulation. Coupled oscillator models have been shown to generalize to other models and biologically realistic neural circuits.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest that coupled oscillator models can be used to predict optimal stimulation strategy for closed DB. This has implications for treatment of neurological disorders such as PD and ET. We propose a new hybrid strategy combining phase-locked and adaptive DB, which may improve efficacy and reduce side effects. Future studies should experimentally validate our predictions and compare with other closed-loop approaches.

**Title:** Development and Evaluation of a LAMP Assay for Detection of Schistosoma mansoni in Biomphalaria Snails: A Novel Diagnostic Tool for Schistosomiasis Control

**Research Question:** Can a novel Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay combined with a simple DNA extraction method be developed to detect Schistoma mansoni in experimentally infected Biomph snails as a diagnostic tool for field conditions?

**Methods:** A set of six primers targeting the S. mans ribosomal intergenic 28S-18 rRNA sequence was designed for the LAMP assay. The detection limit of the LAMP was 0.1 fg of S mans DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes. The assay was evaluated by examining S mans DNA in Biom snails experimentally exposed to miracid at different times post-exposure: early patent period (before cercarial shedding), light (sn exposed to low miracid), and detection snails in pooled samples within a group uninfected snails. DNA LAMP was obtained using a commercial extraction kit or simple NaOH method.

**Findings:** S mans DNA was detected in all snail groups using no complicated procedure for DNA obtaining. Our LAMP, named Biom-LAMP, is specific, sensitive, rapid, and potentially cost-effective for screening intermediate hosts with S mans in snails and pooled samples. The assay is suitable for large-scale surveys schosomes campaigns in endemic areas.

**Implications:** The development of inexpensive, field-applicable assays for large screening individual or pooled snails to detect presence schosomes is crucial for snail control related schosias elimination. Our LAMP is a novel, rapid, specific, and sensitive method for detecting S mans in Biom snails, suitable for monitoring in endemic areas with basic facilities.

**Conclusion:** This study developed and evaluated a rapid, sensitive LAMP combined with simple DNA extraction to detect experimentally infected sn with S mans. This methodology is potentially for monitoring infected sn in endemic schos areas with laboratory facilities. Our LAMP, Biom-L, is specific, rapid, and cost-effective for screening intermediate hosts with S mans in snails and pooled samples, suitable for large-scale surveys sch campaigns in endemic areas.

**Title:** Estimating the Economic Burden of Dengue in the Public Health Sector in Colombo, Sri Lanka: A Cost Analysis of Deng Control Activities and Hospitalizations in 2012

**Research Question:** What are the public sector costs of deng control and hospitalizations in Colombo, the most urbanized district in Sri Lanka, during the year 2012 from the Ministry of Health's perspective?

**Methods:** This study employed a combination of activity-based and gross costing approaches to retrospectively analyze the costs borne by public agencies and hospitals for deng control activities and hospitalizations in Col district during the epidemic of 201. The costing was conducted from the Ministry's perspective, focusing on operational and administrative costs.

**Findings:** The total cost of deng control and hospitalizations was estimated at US$3.45 million (US$1.50 per capita) in Col district in 201. Personnel costs accounted for the largest share of total deng control (79%) and hospitalizations (46%). The per capita cost of deng control was US0.42. Average hospitalization costs ranged US216-609 for pediatric and US196-866 for adult cases according to disease and treatment severity.

**Implications:** This is the first attempt to assess the economic burden of deng response in the public sector in Col, Sri Lanka's heavily urban and densely populated district. Results suggest deng poses a significant economic burden on the public sector. The estimated US0.42 per capita of d control in Col corresponds to a monthly cost0.03 capita, below the range-0. The substantial resources used for d prevention and care represent an opportunity cost that can be reallocated to other health services.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the need for country-specific evidence to set public health priorities and deploy existing or new technologies. The substantial costs of d control and hospitalizations in Col underscore the importance of effective resource allocation and management in public health sector.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Origins of European Y-Chromosomal Lineages: A New Insights into the Paleolithic-Neolithic Transition

**Research Question:** The origins of European Y-chromosomal lineages, specifically Haplog Rb1b2 (R-M269), have been debated, with previous studies suggesting a Paleolithic origin. However, we investigate the geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity to determine the origin of this lineage.

**Methods:** We analyzed the distribution of microsatellite diversity within Haplog Rb1b2 to determine its origin, using a single-source spread model from the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity is best explained by a single-source spread from the Near East Anatolia during the Neolithic, contradicting previous suggestions of a Paleolithic origin.

**Implications:** This reinterpretation suggests that most European chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion, linking technological and cultural change with the expansion of Y-chrom lineage. This pattern contrasts with maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, indicating a unique role for males in the transition.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the origins of European Y-chrom lineages, specifically Hlog R1b2, and its expansion during the Neolithic period. The predominance of Ne-expansion lineages among chromosomes is reflected in other parts of the genome, while mitochondrial diversity presents a different picture, with Paleolithic lineages and postglacial expansions. This study highlights the importance of Y-chrom lineages defined by binary markers, such as microsatellites, in understanding human migration and expansion. The major European lineage, Hlog Rb2, is carried by 110 million men, and its frequency increases from east to west, indicating a single-source spread from the East Anatolia during the Neolithic.

**Key Findings:**

* The geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity within Hlog R1b2 is best explained by a single-source from the East Anatolia during the Neolithic.
* The predominance of Ne-expansion lineages among chromosomes is reflected in other parts of the genome.
* Mitochondrial diversity presents a different picture, with Paleolithic lineages and postacial expansions.
* Y-chrom lineages defined by binary markers, such as microsatellites, provide new insights into human migration and expansion.
* The major European lineage H Rb2 is carried by 110 men and increases from east to west, indicating a single-source from Anatolia during Ne.

This study contributes to our understanding of the Paleolithic-Neolithic transition and the role of Y-ch lineages in technological and cultural change.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Role of Variability in Motor Learning: A Computational Modeling and Experimental Insights

**Research Question:** Does variability in movement directly increase the speed of motor learning, or does it have a more complex relationship with learning outcomes?

**Methods:** We employed computational modeling and experimental approaches to investigate the effects of variability on motor learning. Using simulations of motor adaptation, we found that variability can have both positive and negative effects on learning. Experimentally, we observed decelerating effects. A meta-analysis of published papers revealed no statistical relation between variability and learning rate across a range of experiments.

**Findings:** Contrary to previous suggestions, our simulations and data indicate that increased variability does not typically enable faster learning, and sometimes slows it down. Our findings do not preclude a possible positive correlation between variability and learning. We hypothesize that variability is correlated with learning in a task-specific way, depending on which factor affects performance. To test this, we performed simulations of error-based learning with a widely accepted model.

**Implications:** Motor variability poses a fundamental problem for neural control of movements and has received attention. However, studies on the relation of variability with learning are sparse, except those demonstrating reduction is a characteristic of learning. Our results suggest the relation between variability and rate varies in adaptation, depending on which factor dominates performance in a task. The divergent results can be explained by taking into account uncertainty or noise.

**Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the complexity of motor learning and the need for further research to understand the importance of involved factors. Variability may be correlated with learning in a task-specific way, depending on which factor affects performance. This study contributes to the understanding of variability's role in motor learning and highlights the need for further investigation.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of RelA-CBP300 Interaction in NF-κB Transcriptional Regulation: A Structural and Functional Insights

**Research Question:** How does the interaction between RelA and CB/p300 regulate the transcription of NF-κ-dependent genes, and what is the role of this interaction in the NF-κ pathway?

**Methods:** We employed NMR spectroscopy, mutational analysis, and isothermal calorimetric analysis to determine the structure of the RelA-CBP complex and design Rel mutants that selectively abrogated the interaction. We used cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide expression analysis to study the effect of these mutants on Rel-activated genes.

**Findings:** The structure of the RelA-CBP complex reveals the folding of Rel-TA2 upon binding to TAZ through conserved hydrophobic sites on the TAZ surface. Mutational and calorimetric analysis allowed the design of Rel-mutants that selectively abated the two components of the Rel-CBP interaction. Detailed studies of these Rel mutants showed that a major set of Rel-activated genes, larger than previously believed, is affected by this interaction.

**Implications:** The Rel-CBP interaction controls the response of NF-κ through a negative feedback loop of the NF- pathway. Chromatin analysis of Rel target promoters showed constitutive recruitment of CB300, indicating a role of CB300 in recruitment of Rel to target sites.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that CB300 is preloaded on promoter/enh regions of NFκ target genes, raising the question of the role of NF-CBP binding in NF transcription. We show that disrupting the Rel-TAZ component of the RelBP interaction disturbs the temporal profile of nuclear of Rel, interfering with the negative loop of the NF pathway. This deregulates the expression of subset NF-dependent genes, independent of overall RelBP interaction. We found genes previously independent of RelBP to be dependent on it, explaining regulation of NF following TNα stimulation.

**Title:** Time-Course Set Analysis (TSA): A Novel Method for Analyzing Gene Expression Data in Longitudinal Studies

**Research Question:** How can we effectively analyze gene expression data in longitudinal studies using predefined gene sets, accounting for heterogeneity within sets and missing measurements?

**Methods:** We introduce Time-Course Set Analysis (TSA), an extension of gene set analysis for longitudinal data, using random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates, allowing for repeated measurements and unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. TSA is a hypothesis-driven method that identifies a prior-defined sets with significant variations over time, accounting for heterogeneity within sets.

**Findings:** We applied TSA to two real datasets: the DAL-1 trial and a study on influenza and pneumoc vaccines. In the DAL-1 trial, TSA revealed significant changes in 69 gene sets over time, while standard univariate gene analysis and Gene Set Enrich Analysis (GSEA) failed to detect patterns. In the second dataset, TSA identified 4 sets linked to influenza, previously associated with pneumoc vaccine. Simulations demonstrated TSA's good statistical properties and increased power compared to other approaches.

**Implications:** TSA offers a solution for exploiting repeated gene expression data using set analysis, sensitive to subtle changes and controlling false discovery. Unlike previous approaches, TSA combines features of gene-by-gene analysis, dimension reduction, and set analysis.

**Conclusions:** TSA fills the gap in longitudinal gene expression analysis, accounting for heterogeneity within sets and missing measurements. Its application to real datasets demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting subtle changes over time. The method is available through an R package, providing a valuable tool for the scientific community.

**Title:** Mapping the Global Endemicity of Plasmodium vivax: A Systematic Effort to Inform Control and Elimination Strategies

**Research Question:** The spatial epidemiology and geographical distribution of Plasium vivax is less understood compared to P. falcum, hindering control and elimination strategies. This study aimed to map the global endemicity of this neglected parasite.

**Methods:** We updated the 2010 estimate of P. viv transmission limits, using 9,970 geopositioned P. viv parasite rate (PvPR) surveys (1985-2010) and a spatiemp Bayesian-based geostatistical model to estimate endemic age-standardized P. viv rate (Pv-99) every 5x5 km grid. The model incorporated Duffy phenotype frequency to suppress endemic predictions, particularly in Africa.

**Findings:** Endemic was predicted within a narrow range worldwide, with P-99 rarely exceeding 7%. The Americas contributed 22% of global risk, but high areas were sparsely populated, contributing 6% of 2.5 billion people at risk. Africa, Duffy negativity constrained transmission to Madagascar and Horn, 3.5% global. Central Asia had 82% global PAR, with high areas in India and Myanmar. South Asia had highest endemicity in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, 9% global.

**Implications:** This depiction of spatial endemicity contributes to a paradigm shift towards geographically-based planning for P. viv control and elimination.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first comprehensive map of P. viv endemic and populations at risk worldwide, informing control and elimination strategies. The high certainty of low endemic values reflects the precision gained by incorporating Duffy information, compensating for paucity of P. viv surveys. Pockets of higher endemicity in Madagascar and East Africa were predicted with less certainty. The model-based geostat (MB) framework generated continuous surfaces of endemic based on retrospectively assembled rate data. The map of P viv endemic and populations at risk in Africa was influenced by the assumption of Duffy negativity refractory to P. falcum, leading to global maps integrated into policy.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Clumping Factor B in Staphylococcus aureus Skin and Soft Tissue Infections: A Novel Insights for Vaccine Development

**Research Question:** What is the role of Clumping factor B (ClB) in Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), and can it be a potential target for vaccine development?

**Methods:** This study investigated the function of ClB in S aureus SST using a mouse model of skin infection, examining bacterial burden, abscess formation, and immune responses.

**Findings:** ClB was found to be crucial in determining abscess structure and bacterial burden early in infection, dependent on interaction with ligand loric expressed in abs tissue. Targeting Cl using a vaccine induced both humoral and cellular responses, leading to protection against S aure skin infection.

**Implications:** This study identifies Cl as an important antigen for future SST vaccines, providing proof-of-concept for its inclusion in next-generation vaccines targeting S aure SST.

**Conclusions:** Cl plays a novel role in S aure SST, exerting effect early in infection, and its interaction with loric is specific to skin. Cl is a good candidate for inclusion in vaccines targeting S aure SST.

**Title:** Predictive Modeling of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Efficacy with Dolutegravir (DT) to Achieve the UNAIDS 90-90 Goals

**Research Question:** Can a novel stochastic simulation approach integrating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and viral factors predict the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (Pr) with dolutegravir (DT) to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90 goal of reducing new HIV infections to 500,000 by 2020?

**Methods:** We developed an efficient stochastic simulation framework combining population pharmacokinetics of DT with viral characteristics to predict plasma concentrations required to prevent 50-90% and 90% sexual transmissions. We predicted the reduction in HIV infections when DT was used in PrEP, Pr-on-demand, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before/after virus exposure.

**Findings:** Our simulations showed that once-daily oral DT (50mg) prevented 99-100% infections and 85% when 50% of dosing events were missed. Pr-on-demand prevented 79-84 infections and P >80 when initiated within 6 hours after exposure and continued as long as possible. The framework can be adapted to other Pr candidates, indicating oral DT is non-inferior to Truvada. Predicted 90% concentrations guide release kinetics of developed DT nano-formulations.

**Implications:** Our integrative approach prioritizes and designs Pr regimens by integrating pharmacological, viral, and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy, addressing the translational gap between preclinical testing and clinical efficacy. This tool can rule out or prioritize candidates, reducing clinical failure and costs. Initiating prophyl earlier has a more pronounced effect than prolonging P, arguing for immediate P in known or suspected exposure.

**Conclusions:** A stochastic simulation integrating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and viral factors predicts the efficacy of Pr with dolutavir (DT) to achieve the UNIDS 90-90 goal. Our framework can be adapted to other Pr candidates, indicating oral DT is non-infer to Trada. Predicted 90 concentrations guide release kinetics of DT nano-formulations.

**Title:** Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Exploits Autophagy to Enhance Replication through Differential Regulation of Rubicon and UVR

**Research Question:** How does Hepatitis C virus (HCV) regulate the autophagic pathway to enhance its replication?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of autophagy in HCV replication by analyzing the expression of Rubicon and UVR, which inhibit and stimulate the maturation of autophosomes, respectively. We used siRNA knockdown and over-expression of Rubicon to confirm its role in inhibiting maturation of autosomes in H-infected cells.

**Findings:**

* HCV induces the expression of Rubicon and UVR, which inhibit and stimulate maturation of autosomes, respectively.
* Induction of Rub by HCV is prompt, while induction UVR is delayed, resulting in accumulation of autosomes in early points of viral infection.
* Role of Rub in inhibiting maturation autosomes in H-infected cells confirmed by siRNA knockdown and over-expression of Rub, which enhanced and suppressed maturation autosomes, respectively.
* Rub plays positive role in H replication, suppression of expression reduced H and over-expression enhanced replication.
* Over-expression UVR facilitated maturation autosomes and suppressed H replication.
* H subgenomic RNA replicon, expressed nonstructural proteins, induced Rubicon and accumulation autosomes.
* Analysis indicated HCV NS4 protein sufficient induce Rub and autosomes.

**Implications:**

* HCV differentially induces expression Rub and UVR to temporally regulate autagic to enhance replication.
* Autophagy "rate" caused by higher UVR enhances initiation [18].
* Studies demonstrated Rub enhanced H replication UVR inhibited H (Fig.5).
* Cells harboring H subomic RNA replicon demonstrated effect Rub likely on H RNA replication (Fig.6, S6).

**Conclusions:**

* H induces expression Rub to accumulate autosomes, which serve sites for H RNA replication in early replication stage.
* Results confirmed Rubicon by H played role inhibiting maturation autosomes H-infected and Rub positive in replication (Fig.2,3).
* Maturation autosomes and autagic degradation efficient 24 hours post-infection, significant increase UVR level 48 hours (Fig).
* H induces expression both Rub and UVR, induction Rub prompt UAG delayed, delayed maturation accumulation autosomes early points H infection.
* H temporally regulates autagic to enhance replication.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Cyclin-Like 1 (Cny1) in Spermatogenesis: A Novel Insights into Male Fertility Regulation

**Research Question:** What is the function of Cyclin-Like 1 (Cny1) in spermatogenesis, and how does it interact with cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16) to regulate male fertility?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression and function of Cny1 in mice, comparing it to its homologue Cny, and examined the interaction between C1 and CD16 in the testis.

**Findings:** C1 was highly expressed in the testis, seven times higher than Cny, and C1/- mice were infertile, while C/- mice displayed normal fertility. Spermatoa from C/- mice showed impaired motility and morphology. C1 interacted with CD16, increasing its stability and kinase activity. Phosphorylation sites on CD16 were identified, crucial for C1 binding and modulation of CD16 activity.

**Implications:** The C1-CD16 complex is essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility in mice. C1 is a potential target for male contraceptives or drug development. Our study reveals a novel role of C1 in regulating spermatogenesis through interaction with CD16.

**Conclusions:** C1 is specifically expressed in testis, and C/- mice are sterile, despite normal testosterone levels and mating ability. C may be an ideal molecule for male contraceptives or drug development. Our study highlights the importance of C1 in spermatogenesis and its interaction with CD16.

**Title:** Mechanism of Action of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHE) Hemolysin (EC-H) Associated with Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) on Human Microvascular Endothelial and Intestinal Epithelial Cells

**Research Question:** What is the mechanism of action of Enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (HE) hemolys (EC-H) associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) on human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells?

**Methods:** We used microscopic, biochemical, and flow cytometry analyses to investigate the effects of OM-associated EC-H on human brainvascular endothelial (HBME) and Caco-2 cells.

**Findings:** Our results show that OM-associated EC-H does not lyse target cells but triggers apoptosis. The OM-associated toxin is internalized by HBME and C-2 cells via dyn-dependent endocytosis and trafficked with OMVs into endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon endosome acidification and pH drop, EC-H is separated from OMVs, escapes lysosomes via pore-forming activity, and targets mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and cytochrome translocation to cytos. Subsequent activation of casp-9 and cas-3 leads to apoptotic cell death evidenced by DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation.

**Implications:** The ability of OM-associated EC-H to trigger the apoptotic pathway in humanvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells indicates a novel mechanism of EC-H involvement in the pathogenesis of HE diseases. OM-mediated intracellular delivery represents a new mechanism for bacterial toxin to host cells to target mitochondria.

**Conclusion:** Our study demonstrates that OM-associated EC irreversibly injures humanvascular endoth and intestinal epithelial cells, key players in pathogenesis of HE diseases. Our data support the model that toxin is internal via OM by dyn-dependent endyt and trafficked with carriers to endo-lys compartments. The biological consequences of interactions OM-associated with humanvascular endoth, major site injury during HE, and epithelial, first encountered by HE, are unknown. We investigated OM-associated for ability to bind cells, deliver intracellular, and trigger injury. Association OM increases stability and prolongs hemtic activity compared to soluble form, indicating OM-associated is biologically efficient.

**Title:** Bidirectional Communication between Histone Ubiquitinase H2 (H2ub1) and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9 (Cdk9) Regulates Transcription Elongation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe

**Research Question:** How do histone modifications, specifically ubiquitination of histone H2 (H2ub) and phosphorylation of transcription factor S5 (S5) by cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (C9), regulate transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPI) in the fission yeast Schosaccharomyces pombe?

**Methods:** Chemical and classical genetic analyses were used to investigate the relationship between H2ub and C9 in vivo. Mutations in H2ub or C9 were generated, and their effects on S5 phosphorylation and chromatin association were examined. Additionally, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed to analyze the distribution of RNAPI on transcribing chromatin.

**Findings:** Lowering C9 activity or preventing phosphorylation of S5 reduces H2ub in vivo. Conversely, mutations in H2ub impair C9 recruitment to chromatin and S5 phosphorylation. An S5 phosphorylation-site mutation combined with deletion of histone H3 Lys methyltransferase Set1 phenocopies morph and growth defects due to Hub loss. Surprisingly, mutation of histone H2 ubiquitin-acceptor relaxes C9 activity in vivo and C9 mutations suppress cell-mology in Hub-deficient strains. Genome-wide ChIP demonstrate opposing effects C9 and Hub on distribution of transcribing RNAPI.

**Implications:** Our results reveal a novel function of conserved co-transcription histone modification in regulating elongation. Mutual dependence of Hub and S phosphorylation indicates positive feedback, while mutual suppression by C9 and Hub-pathway suggests antagonistic functions that must be kept balance to regulate elongation. Loss Hub disrupts balance and leads to deranged expression and aberrant cell morphologies.

**Conclusions:** This study uncovers a bidirectional communication between H2 and C9 in regulating transcription elongation in Schoscharomyces pom. Our findings strengthen the notion that PTEb activity is required to overcome repressive effects of histone modifications, as suggested by previous work in budding yeast. The roles of C and their substrates in regulating histone in yeast have not been explored, and this study reveals a mutual dependence of H and PTEb function. H also acts independently of histone methylation, and its mechanism is unknown. Our results imply other pathways can modulate functions C and H in elongation.

**Title:** Unveiling the Evolutionary History of Yellow Fever Virus in South America: A Phylogenetic Analysis of the Largest Dataset to Date**

**Research Question:** What is the evolutionary history of Yellow Fever (YF) virus in South America, and how did it spread across the continent?

**Methods:** We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the largest YF dataset to date, comprising 133 isolates from 22 countries over 76 years, focusing on the prM gene region. We included 71 additional sequences from GenBank to create an alignment of 133 wild-type isolates representing 22 countries (14 African, 8 American).

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed that circulating YF strains arose in Africa within the last 1,500 years and emerged in the Americas following the slave trade approximately 300-400 years ago. These viruses spread westwards across the continent and persist to this day in the jungles of South America.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates how sequence data can be used to test hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, and document the role of human migration in the spread of infectious disease. We found no difference in evolutionary dynamics between viruses in South and Africa, and neither exhibited increases in diversity expected of epidemic expansion. Subsequent devastating outbreaks in cities on both east and west coasts of South led to establishment of sylvatic cycle in Amazon, Aragua, and Orin river basins vectored by Haagog and Sabeth mosquitoes.

**Conclusions:** Our findings support the hypothesis of slave introduction of YF to the Americas, previously repeated but not rigorously examined using gene data and phylogenetic techniques. YF is a member of Flivirus family (Flaviridae), containing important vector-borne pathogens such as deng, encephalitis, and West viruses. Previous studies suggest Y originated in Africa, with deepest phylogen split among genotypes between isolates from East and West.

**Title:** Investigating the Dynamics of Streptococcus pneumoniae Colonization and Transmission in the Presence of Influenza A Virus Co-infection in an Infant Mouse Model

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the impact of influenza A virus (IAV) co-infection on the colonization and transmission dynamics of Streptococcus pneumoniae in an infant mouse model, with a focus on identifying bottlenecks in the pneumocococcal pathogenesis process.

**Methods:** We employed an infant mouse model of colonization and disease transmission, both with and without IAV co-infection, to analyze the population bottlenecks involved in pneumoccal pathogenesis. The mouse model recapitulates key features of pneumoccal disease, including localized and systemic colonization and host-to-host transmission.

**Findings:** Our results show that in the setting of IAV co-infection, S. pneumoniae must pass through a single bottleneck during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and transmission between hosts. Passage through these bottlenecks was not associated with genetic adaptation of the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission between exit from one host and establishment in another is explained by the number of shed organisms in secretions, which is critical to overcome. These findings demonstrate that viral infection and T-dependent innate immune responses stimulate and are required to control bacterial contagion.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of bottlenecks in pneumoccal pathogenesis, particularly in the presence of IAV co-infection, and the role of innate immune responses in controlling bacterial contagion. These findings have significant implications for understanding pneumoccal disease in infants, where IAV co-infection is common.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the utility of the infant mouse model for studying pneumoccal colonization and transmission, and the impact of IAV co-infection on pneumcal dynamics. Our results suggest that bottlenecks in pneumcal path are critical, particularly in the presence of IAV, and that innate immune responses play a key role in controlling bacterial contagion. These findings have implications for understanding pneumcal disease in infants, where IAV co-infection is prevalent.

**Title:** Identification of Recombinant Salivary Antigens for Detection of Phleomus orientalis Exposure in Human Populations from Visceral Leishmanias Endemic Areas

**Research Question:** Can recombinant salivary antigens derived from Phleom orientalis be used to detect exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from visceral leishmanias endemic areas?

**Methods:** Recombinant proteins from Phom orient secreted salivary proteins were produced using bacterial and mammalian expression systems and tested as antigens for detection of anti-P orient Ig in human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia. ELISA and immunoblot were used to identify potential markers of exposure to Phom bites.

**Findings:** Two recomant proteins, mY1 and m5, were identified as promising antigens showing high correlation and specificity to whole fly saliv gland homogen. Combination of both proteins increased correlation and positive predictive values of Ph exposure.

**Implications:** This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P orient antibodies using recomant salary proteins. Recombinant salary mY1 and m5 proved valid antigens for screening sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for exposure to Ph bites. Utilization of both proteins increased capability to detect anti orient responses.

**Conclusion:** This study identified combination of two Phom salary antigens, yellow protein mY1 and antigen-related m5, as valid tool to screen fly exposure in human from Sudan and Ethiopia. This combination of recomant proteins substitutes Phom SG, simplifying studies detecting antibodies in bitten people endemic areas visceral leishias.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Tra Genes in the Mobilization of Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI) and its Association with Multidrug Resistance in Pathogenic Enterobacteraceae

**Research Question:** How do the Tra genes of Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI) interact with Inc plasmids to facilitate its mobilization and contribute to multidrug resistance in pathogenic Enterobacteraceae?

**Methods:** This study employed a combination of molecular biology techniques, including transcriptional fusions, mating experiments, and complementation assays to investigate the role of Tra genes in the mobilization of SGI and its association with multidrug resistance in pathogenic Enteracter.

**Findings:** Our results show that the Tra genes of SGI are under the control of the transcriptional activator ACD encoded by Inc plids and are essential for the mobilization of SGI. We found that Tra and Tra are required for Inc plid transfer, but SGI can rescue mutants of each gene, indicating that Tra, Tra, and Tra are functional proteins. Complementation of Tra and Tra mutants showed that Tra and Tra can replace Tra and Tra in the mating pore encoded by Incids, and that both Tra and Tra are required for optimal SGI transfer. Furthermore, remodeling of the Inc-encoded pore by SGI enhances the transfer rate of SGI over the helper plid, and Tra is crucial for DNA transfer between cells bearing Inc helperids, suggesting that SGI disables an Inc-encoded exclusion mechanism.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that Tra genes facilitate the invasion of SGI into populations bearing Incids, contributing to the spread of multidrug resistance in pathogenic Enteracter. This study highlights the complex interaction between SGI and Incids in the mobilization of S and its association with multidrug resistance in pathogenic Enteracter.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the role of Tra in the mobilization SGI and its association multidrug in pathogenic Enteracter. Our findings have implications for understanding the spread of multidrug resistance in pathogenic Enter and the development of strategies to combat it.

**Title:** Saccharomyces cerevisiae Polo-like Kinase Cdc5 Promotes Adaptation to DNA Damage by Attenuating Rad53 Hyperphosphorylation

**Research Question:** How does Saccharomy cerevisiae polo-like kinase C5 (Cdc5) regulate the DNA damage checkpoint response in response to persistent or irreparable DNA damage?

**Methods:** We overexpressed CDC5 from the GAL promoter in damaged cells and examined key steps in checkpoint activation individually. We found that C5 overproduction had little effect on early steps leading to Rad53 activation, but significantly reduced damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad53.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that C5 attenuates the DNA checkpoint through loss of Rad hyperphosphorylation, allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage. Polo kinase homologs have been shown to inhibit the ability of Clas to facilitate activation of downstream kinases, suggesting this function is conserved in vertebrates.

**Implications:** This mechanism is likely conserved in S. cerevisiae given the Rad FHA domains and Mec1 phosphorylation sites are required for hyperosphorylation. If unable to repair damage, yeast will override the checkpoint and continue division, a process called adaptation. The timing of adaptation correlated with loss of Rad activity, suggesting adaptation may be a consequence of C5-mediated inhibition.

**Conclusions:** Our data suggest C5 does not inhibit formation of the Rad-Rad complex but blocks the ability of Mec-primed Rad molecules to produce hyperphosphorylated Rad in vivo. Adaptation to damage occurs after 6-8 hours of cell arrest if unable to repair. Loss of signaling correlates with onset of adaptation. We propose that an unidentified step in the damage checkpoint is turned off to allow cells to adapt. However, adaptation is a long and asynchronous process, making mechanism difficult to study. Several pathways downregulate the checkpoint to promote adaptation.

**Key findings:**

* C5 overexpression promotes adaptation to DNA damage
* C5 attenuates DNA checkpoint through loss of Rad hyperphosphorylation
* Polo kinase homologs inhibit Cl to facilitate activation downstream kinases
* Mechanism conserved in S. cerevisiae
* Adaptation correlates with loss of Rad activity
* Unidentified step in checkpoint turned off to allow adaptation
* Several pathways downregulate checkpoint to promote adaptation

**Title:** Elucidating Electrodiffusive Effects in the Extracellular Space of the Brain: A 3D Kirchhoff-Nern-Plan Framework for Large-Scale Simulations

**Research Question:** Understanding the dynamics of ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is crucial for elucidating pathological conditions such as seizures, stroke, and depression. However, tracking both ion concentrations and electric potential simultaneously in relevant brain regions is currently unfeasible experimentally, but achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles.

**Methods:** We present the 3D Kirhoff-Nern-Plan (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiff effects on large spatiotemporal scales. Assuming electroneutrality, the KNP circumvents charge-relax processes on spatiemp scales of nanoseconds, making it feasible to run simulations on spatiemp scales millimeters on a standard computer.

**Findings:** We used the 3D KNP to simulate the dynamics of ion and electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell, elucidating the single neuron's contribution to electrodiff effects in ECS and demonstrating the framework's efficiency. Future applications to complex biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathologies associated with large ECS variations.

**Implications:** Simultaneous knowledge of all ion species is necessary for reliable electrodiff estimates in ECS, currently unfeasible experimentally but achievable with computational models. Most neuroscience ion-concentration models are partially modeled or ignored. In contrast, the 3D model predicts ion concentrations in all directions surrounding sources, applicable to broader biological problems. Diffusion addressed by K-scheme arise from ECS gradients on large spatial scales. Models neglecting ion-con dynamics are inapplicable to pathologies, neglecting diff effects on ECS.

**Conclusions:** The 3D KNP is the first framework to handle 3D electrodiff in tissue at large spatiemp scales without insurmount computer power. Long ECS-concentration (100 s) in 1 mm was run on a desktop within a day. The KNP was developed for a hybrid setup where ion and potential in ECS were computed with K, while neurodynamics with NEON tool. This shares limitations of NEON in handling intracellular dynamics, default not electro in NEON environment.

**Title:** The Consequences of Halting Vector-Borne Disease Surveillance: A Mathematical Modeling Study of the Impact of Delayed Response to Dengue Epidemics in a Developed Environment

**Research Question:** What are the consequences of halting surveillance and research funding for mosquito-borne diseases, such as deng and West Nile virus, on the preparedness and management of emerging and existing diseases in the United States?

**Methods:** We used a mathematical model to generate hypothetical scenarios of delayed response to deng introduction in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia, and coupled the results with surveillance and case management costs to estimate the cumulative costs of each scenario.

**Findings:** Our study shows that halting mosquito surveillance can increase epidemic management costs by an order of magnitude compared to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early detection. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance are lower than those needed to respond to introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without consideration of human lives and well-being.

**Implications:** The proposed 2011 U.S. fiscal year budget cut of $26.7 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vector-borne program could paralyze surveillance and research for diseases already circulating in the U.S. such as deng and West virus, jeopardizing existing health infrastructure for early detection of exotic mosquito-transmitted pathogens.

**Conclusions:** Our analysis provides a science-based justification for reassessment of the proposal to slash the CDC vectororne program budget and emphasizes the need for sustainable systems for vectororne disease surveillance. Delayed response to Cairns deng outbreaks demonstrates vulnerability of developed countries to mosquito-b pathogens, a major public health concern. Our study highlights the importance of continued investment in cost-effective public health strategy through vector-b disease surveillance.

**Title:** Unrecognized Dengue Infection in Rural Nicaragua: A Prospective Study of Acute and Convalescent Sera in Children and Adults with Undifferent Fever

**Research Question:** What is the seroprevalence of deng among children and adults with undifferent fever in semiurban and rural Nicaragua, and what are the clinical features of acute deng infection in this population?

**Methods:** We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients (n=740) aged ≥1 year with acute febr illness in a hospital in western Nicaragua and obtained epidemiologic and clinical data as well as acute and convalescent sera 2-4 weeks after onset of illness. We tested sera for deng IgG and IgM and seryped deng virus using reverse transcriptase PCR.

**Findings:** Among 740 febr patients, 90% had paired sera. We found 470 (63.5%) were seropositive for deng at enrollment. The deng serreval increased with age, reaching >90% in people over 20 years. We identified deng serotypes 1 and 2 in 38.1% patients. Only 8.1% (3/37) of cases were clinically suspected.

**Implications:** Dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in rural Nicaragua. Since Zika virus is transmitted by the same vector and associated with severe congenital infections, the population studied is at risk of being devastated by the Zika epidemic that has reached Central America.

**Conclusions:** We identified deng as etiologic responsible for 5.1% (38/740) of acute febr illnesses. In addition to confirmatory testing by assaying paired sera IgM and Ig, 24.3 were confirmed by PCR. A limitation of serology is ser cross-reactions between deng and other flaviviruses. However, deng was the only flavivirus circulating in Nicaragua. Overall, 470 (63.5%) patients were serositive for deng Ig at enrollment. The serreval was 22% in <5, 57 in 5-9, 77 in 10-14, 86 in 15-19, 91 in 20-24, 95 in 25-29, and ~100 in ≥30. Patients with acute deng had similar clinical features to other febr illnesses. Only symptoms and signs independently associated with deng were.

**Key Findings:**

* 63.5% of patients were seropitive for deng at enrollment
* d serval increased with age, reaching 90% in people over 20
* identified deng serotypes 1 and 2 in 38.1 patients
* only 8.1% of cases were clinically suspected
* deng is important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in rural Nicaragua
* population is at risk of being devastated by Zika epidemic

**Title:** Identification of a Novel Immune Receptor, NIL1, Essential for Plant Defense Against Nematodes in Arabidopsis thaliana

**Research Question:** How do plants recognize and respond to nematode pathogens, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-nemat interactions?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of plant-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) recognition by surface-localized receptors leading to activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis thaliana-nemat interactions.

**Findings:** Nemat-derived proteinaceous elicitors are capable of inducing PT in Arabid in a manner dependent on the common co-receptor BAK. We identified a leucine-rich receptor-like receptor kinase, NIL1 (NIL1), specifically regulated upon nemat infection. NIL1 is essential for PT responses initiated by nematodes, and loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to broad nematodes.

**Implications:** NIL1 is the first example of an immune receptor involved in induction of basal PT in plants or animals in response to nemodes. Manipulation of NIL will provide new options for nemode control in crops.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying plantemat interactions and identifies a novel immune receptor, NIL1, essential for plant defense against nematodes. This discovery opens new avenues for nemode control in crops.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Mechanism of Action of Milteine against Schistosoma mansoni: Exposure of Surface Antigens and Immune Response

**Research Question:** How does milteine, an anti-cancer drug repurposed for Leishmaniasis treatment, affect the surface antigens of Schistoma mansoni worms and induce an immune response against the parasite?

**Methods:** This study investigated the effect of miline on Schistoma mansoni adult worms in vitro, using indirect immunofluorescence assay and western blotting to identify exposed antigens on the worm surface. Rabbit anti-S. mansoni worm homate and anti-S mans infection antisera were used to detect antigens on miline-treated worms, which were previously shown to synergistically enhance schosidal activity of prazantel. Antibodies recognizing surface antigens on miline worms were eluted and used in western blot to identify antigenic targets in homogen extract of adult worms.

**Findings:** Four proteins, fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase (SmPA), 22.6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase, were identified as antigenic targets on the surface of miline-treated worms. These antibodies also bound to 3-hour schosula and induced agglutination of parasites, suggesting a role in immune protection. This study reveals a novel mode of action of miline as anti-schosome agent.

**Implications:** The findings suggest that miline unmasks surface antigens not normally exposed to the host during infection, similar to prazantel (PQ). Antigens involved in this mechanism could be targets for intervention, and antibodies against these antigens may enhance drug efficacy and prevent re-infection.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into the mechanism of action of miline against Schistoma mansoni, highlighting the importance of surface antig exposure and immune response. Future research may investigate combined effect of miline and prazol on schosome surface proteins, and potential of antibodies against exposed antigens to enhance drug activity and prevent re-infection.

**Title:** Host-Pathogen Interactions: The Struggle for Iron and the Outcome of Disease

**Research Question:** How do bacteria acquire iron from host ferritin, a 24-mer protein capable of storing thousands of iron atoms within its cavity, and what is the role of the surface protein IlsA in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between the opportunistic pathogen Bacillus cereus and ferritin using isothermal calorimetry, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and bacterial growth assays.

**Findings:** IlsA, a leucine-rich surface protein A, binds to ferritin and causes its aggregation on the bacterial surface. Isothermal calorimetry data indicate direct interaction between Ils and ferritin subunits. UV-Vis data show significant enhancement of iron release from ferritin in the presence of Ils. Disruption of siderophore bacibactin production reduces B. cereus ability to utilize ferritin for growth and attenuates bacterial virulence.

**Implications:** Our results propose a new model of iron acquisition in B. cereus involving binding of Ils to ferritin followed by siderophore-assisted iron uptake. This highlights interplay between surface protein and siderore and provides insights into host adaptation of B. cereus and bacterial pathogenesis.

**Conclusion:** A new model of iron mobilization from ferritin in bacteria is proposed, involving destabilization of ferritin subunits by Ils leading to enhancement of iron release from ferritin core. B. cereus siderore bacibactin acquires mobilized iron for growth. Our study and additional work [14] suggest conserved ability of Ils to bind ferritin in other pathogenic bacteria. Ils-ferritin interaction enhances iron release from ferritin, a major finding since no direct microbial effect on ferritin iron mobilization has been reported. Importance of this strategy evidenced by effects of iron homeostasis on innate and acquired responses [2, 6].

**Title:** A Thermodynamically Consistent Model of the Circadian Clock in Synechococcus elongatus Reveals the Role of ATP Hydrolysis and Phosphorylation in Oscillations

**Research Question:** Despite extensive studies on the circadian clock of Synechoccus elongatus, the thermodynamic driving force behind its oscillations has remained elusive. This study aims to address this question by developing a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of the clock.

**Methods:** Inspired by experimental observations and previous mathematical models, we present a model that incorporates two key ideas: (i) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic force for the clock switching Kai between active and inactive conformation states, and (ii) phosphorylation of the CII domain provides the timer for hydrolysis in the CI. The model also explains how KaiA stimulates phosphorylation of KaiC and the differential affinity of Kai for different Kai phosphforms generates the temporal order of Kai phosphorylation.

**Findings:** The model naturally explains how the release of ADP from CI slows the inactive conformation state of Kai, making it more stable. In the inactive state, Kai binds KaiB, stabilizing it and sequestering KaiA, leading to dephosphorylation. Using a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, we simulate the system of over a billion reactions, demonstrating the model's ability to describe a wealth of experimental data.

**Implications:** Our model reveals the central role of ATP hydroly in driving conformation transitions and phosphorylation oscillations, resolving the long-standing question of the clock's thermodynamic driving force. By explicitly tracking phosphorylation sites and nucleotide states, our model provides a more detailed understanding of the circadian mechanism.

**Conclusions:** This study presents a novel, thermodynam consistent model of the circadian clock in Synechoccus elongatus, shedding light on the thermodynamic driving force behind its oscillations. The model highlights the importance of ATP hydroly in conformation transitions and phosphorylation, and the role of KaiA in stimulating phosphorylation and sequestration of Kai. This work contributes to the understanding of circadian biology, a fundamental to organisms' anticipation of day-night changes.

**Title:** Hepatitis B Virus Suppresses Innate Immunity by Recruiting Parkin to Mitochondria to Abrogate Interferon-β Synthesis

**Research Question:** Despite the activation of the RIG-MAVS axis by hepatitis B virus (HBV) pre-genomic RNA, the underlying mechanism of how HBV fails to induce interferon-β (IFN) synthesis remains uncharacterized.

**Methods:** We investigated the role of parkin, a mitochondrial E3 ubiquitin protein ligase, in HBV-induced suppression of interferon synthesis. Parkin was found to interact with MAVS and accumulate unanchored polyubiquitin chains on MAV via the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LAC) to disrupt MAV signalosome and attenuate IRF activation.

**Findings:** HBV-induced parkin recruits LAC to mitochondria, leading to the enrichment of M1-linked polyubiquitin chains on MAVS, which disrupts its interaction with TRAF and abrogates IRF activation. Parkin has been shown to modulate LAC activity and LAC is reported to abrogate MAV signaling via MAV-TR3 or TRIM. Park silencing restores IF synthesis in HB-expressing cells upon stimulation with R-I agonist p:C.

**Implications:** This study highlights the novel role of park in antiviral signaling involving LAC recruited to mitochondria, providing avenues for investigations on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in immunity. HB is considered a stealth virus due to its ability to evade immunity and establish chronic infection. Previous reports establish HB cripples R-MA signaling and a recent study shows R senses HBpg to stimulate IF production not IF. Notably, perisomal MAV stimulates IF via IR.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that HB-induced parkin suppresses MAV signaling by recruiting LAC to mitochond to abrogate IF synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAV and potentiates this interaction. Park has been shown to modulate LAC activity and LAC is reported to abrogate MAV signaling via MAV-TR or TRIM. Park silencing restores IF synthesis in HB-express cells upon stimulation with R agonist p:C. These findings establish the novel role of park in influencing MAV signaling during HB infection, providing molecular mechanisms of HB-induced suppression of innate immunity.

**Title:** Crystal Structure and Function of pT, a T-Cell Superantigen Encoded by Pseudomonas fluorescens, Associated with Crohn's Disease

**Research Question:** What is the crystal structure and function of pT, a T-cell superant encoded by Pseudomonas fluorescens, and how does it interact with human class II MHC molecules in the context of Crohn's disease?

**Methods:** We determined the crystal structure of pT at 1.7 Å resolution and analyzed the interaction of pT and its homolog PA5 with human class II MHC molecules. We also evaluated the binding of pT and PA5 to mammalian cells and stimulated proliferation of human lymphocytes.

**Findings:** pT and PA5 bound to mammalian cells and stimulated proliferation of human lymphocytes, which was inhibited by anti-class II MHC HLA-DR antibodies and to a lesser extent by anti-HLA-D and DP antibodies, indicating class IIHC-specific binding. GST-pT precipitated both endogenous and purified recombinant HLA-DR molecules, indicating direct interaction with HLA-DR. Competition studies revealed pT and superantigen Mycoplas arthidis mitogen (M) competed for binding to HLA, indicating overlapping binding sites. Structural analysis established pT belongs to TetR family of DNA-binding regulators.

**Implications:** The structure of pT indicates a new family of T-cell superantigens. Immune activity of peptide encoded by p is a distinguishing biomarker for disease and clinical phenotype of Crohn disease. There is an intensifying focus on interplay of microbiota in Crohn disease, as source of antigens in adaptive activation and microbial products targeting innate epithelial function. Primary T responses elicited by microbial superigens via interaction TCRβ elements and in some Tα chains.

**Conclusions:** pT, a novel T-cell superant encoded by Pseudomonas fluoresens, is associated with Crohn disease. Its interaction with class MHC is specific, primarily to HLA-DR. The structure of p indicates a new family of T superigens. The discovery of pathogenic and serological marker pT suggests these proteins play a role in pathogenesis of Crohn disease.

**Title:** Allelic Regulation of Nanog Expression Influences Heterogeneity in Stem Cell Populations: A Multiscale Stochastic Population Equation Framework

**Research Question:** How does allelic regulation of Nanog expression influence the heterogeneity in stem cell populations, and what are the implications for stem cell fate decisions?

**Methods:** We developed a multiscale stochastic population equation framework to investigate the role of allelic control of Nanog expression on heterogeneity in stem cell populations. We considered allelic regulation, gene noise, and random partitioning at cell division, and simulated the dynamics of Nanog content in individual cells with different allelic patterns.

**Findings:** Our results show that allelic expression of Nanog leads to three distinct states, while combined with transcriptional noise results in a bimodal distribution. Regardless of allelic pattern, uniform populations of stem cells give rise to the same Nan heterogeneity within 10 cycles. Depletion of NANOG in cells is slower than accumulation of intracellular NAN after turning on at least one Nan gene, pointing to Nan state-dependent dynamics. Allelic transcription of Nan raises issues in stem cell lines with reporter genes knocked in single locus.

**Implications:** Our findings underline the role of allelic control of Nan expression as a determinant of stem population heterogeneity, warranting further investigation in contexts of cell specification and reprogramming.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of allelic regulation of Nan expression on stem cell heterogeneity, shedding light on observed heterogeneity in stem populations with respect to Nan profile. Allelic regulation facilitates maintenance of self-renew cells with sufficient Nan content, preventing aberrant loss of pluripotency. The stochastic model developed is aligned with experimental findings on alle switching Nan expression and heterogeneity with single allele deletion. Our results illustrate alle regulation pivotal for observed heterogeneity ESCs respect Nan content, likely influencing diverse stem populations other markers.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Allelic regulation of Nanog influences heterogeneity in stem populations
* Allelic expression leads to distinct states, combined with transcription noise results in bimodal distribution
* Depletion of NAN in cells is slower than accumulation of intracellular NAN after turning on at least one Nan

**Title:** Balancing the Costs and Benefits of Protein Expression: Unveiling the Unutilized Proteome in Escheria coli

**Research Question:** What is the magnitude and variability of unutilized protein expression in different environments, and how does it impact cellular growth rates in Escheria coli?

**Methods:** We combined genome-scale proteomics data with a recently developed genome-scale model of Escheria coli to compute environment-specific costs and utilities of the proteome on a gene-by-gene basis.

**Findings:** Nearly half of the proteome is unused in certain environments, and accounting for the cost of unused protein explains >95% of variance in growth rates across 16 distinct environments. Reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase growth in adaptive experiments. Unused protein encodes nutrient and stress-prepared functions, conveying benefits in varying environments.

**Implications:** Unused protein is a source of large and pervasive costs providing benefits hedging against environmental change.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals the unutil proteome, varying greatly across environments, and quantifies the cost of unused protein and processes underlying change in expression. Unused protein is a source of large and pervasive costs providing benefits hedging environmental change.

**Abstract:**

The costs and benefits of protein synthesis on organism fitness shape evolution and regulation of prote expression. For microbes, growth rate is a component of fitness, and much prote devoted to growth in certain environments. Costs and benefits are quantified by effects on growth. However, we lack understanding of percentage prote unutil in given environment and how unutil fraction varies or remains constant. We combine genome-scale model of prote allocation Escheria with genome prote measurements to quantify allocation across 16 environments. Notably, overexpression unused results in predictable reduction growth. Microbes express some unused in any environment, reducing rates. However, magnitude and variability unknown, due environment-specific prote activity. We use genome model prote allocation Escher, termed ME, to quantify un and underutil. ME formalizes function and synthesis necessary for growth, which we refer proteome.

**Title:** Investigating the Genetic Architecture of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Diverse Populations: A Genome-Wide Association Studies in Chinese, Malays, and Indians

**Research Question:** Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci harboring genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), many of which encode proteins not previously suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of T2. However, most GWAS for T2 have focused on populations of European descent, and GW conducted in populations with different ancestry offer a unique opportunity to study the genetic architecture of T2.

**Methods:** We performed genome-wide association scans for T2 in 3,955 Chinese (2,010 cases, 1,945 controls), 2,034 Malays (794,1,240), and 2,146 Indians (977,169). In addition to searching for novel variants in T2, multi-ethnic cohorts assessed the transferability and relevance of previous findings from European populations in the major populations of Asia, comprising half the world's population.

**Findings:** Of the SNPs associated T2 in GWAS, variants CDK1 and HX/IDE/K11 showed the strongest association T2 in meta-analysis including three groups. However, consistent direction was observed for many other SNPs in our study and those in European populations. Examination of associations at CD1 and H/IDE11 loci provided evidence locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation T2. We also detected variation linkage disequilibrium between populations most loci previously identified. Factors combined with limited power may contribute failure detect associations populations diverse ethnicity.

**Implications:** These findings highlight the value surveying diverse racial/ethnic towards fine-mapping causal and searching variants population-specific. Our study is the first GW performed Malays, largest group in Southeast, comprising 300 million. Meta-analysis showed associations CD1 and H/11 consistently emerged T studies multiple populations. However, signals CD1 useful calibrating extent effect sizes Chinese and Indian populations similar European reported frequencies alleles. GW allows unbiased survey entire genome novel loci causally responsible T2 onset.

**Conclusions:** The availability three GW scans heterogeneous populations offers unique explore genetic underlying loci CD1 and H11 strongest association T2 more population meta.

**Title:** Evolutionarily Conserved Aurora Kinase I1 Regulates Nuclear Envelope Breakdown and Timely Nuclear Division in the Budding Yeast Cryptococcus neoformans

**Research Question:** How does the evolutionarily conserved Aurora kinase I1 (I1) regulate nuclear envelope breakdown and timely nuclear division in the budding yeast Cryptoccus neoformans?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of in vivo and in silico approaches to investigate the role of I1 in nuclear envelope breakdown and nuclear division in C. neoans. We used live cell imaging and microscopy to visualize I localization and dynamics in C. neo, and generated an in silico models to predict the effects of I1 on kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration.

**Findings:** We found that I1 localizes to the nucleus upon nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis in C. neo and is required for timely breakdown of the envelope. I1 is essential for viability and regulates microtub stability. Compromised cytoplasmic microtub stability upon I1 depletion results in delayed kinet clustering and nuclear migration. Our in sil model predicts that cytoplasmic microt and dyin regulate atypical division in C. neo. Improving the in sil model by introducing additional parameters, we predict that cortical generated by cytoplasm B1 and dyin regulates kinet clustering and migration. Indeed, in vivo alterations B1 or dyin levels delay nuclear migration.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that timely breakdown of the envelope by I allows its nuclear entry, which spatiotemporally regulates nuclear division during semi-mitosis in C. neo. We propose that I1 orchestrates pre-anaphase nuclear movement from mother to daughter in the human pathogenic yeast C. neo. I plays a critical role in maintaining microt stability to facilitate kinet clustering and migration.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of I in regulating nuclear envelope breakdown and timely division in C. neo. We propose that I spatiotemporally regulates cytoplasm microt and distribution B1/dyin activity to ensure timely onset of nuclear division. In absence I impairs cortical bias and microt leading to defects in kinet clustering and migration. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of nuclear division in C. neo and highlight the conserved role of I across species.

**Title:** Synonymous Mutations in the RET Proto-Oncogene Contribute to Cancer Progression of Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma

**Research Question:** Can synonymous mutations in the RET proto-oncogene contribute to the progression of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)?

**Methods:** We investigated a case of aggressive, apparently sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) harboring a somatic RET p.Cys634 mutation, a known to be a driver of MTC. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissues revealed that the RET mutations were in cis, with no evidence of gene amplification. Expression analysis showed an increase of RET transcript in p.Cys=p.C634 in the patient compared to 7 MTCs harboring p.C634 mutations. Minigene assays demonstrated that the presence of the synonymous mutation was sufficient to explain the increased mRNA level. In silico and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the p.C variant created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs, enhancing SR55 recruitment to the mutant, leading to efficient maturation of preRNA and increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET.

**Findings:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression. We found that a synonymous substitution in the RET proto-onc, previously considered clinically irrelevant, was in cis with a somatic driver mutation and exerted appreciable effects on preRNA splicing. Expression analysis showed increased RET transcript levels in the patient compared to 7 MTCs with amino acid substitutions at position 634, including a missense mutation present in the tumor.

**Implications:** These findings have significant implications for understanding the role of synonymous mutations in cancer. Synonymous mutations are often filtered out of large-scale genome studies, but our results suggest they can play a role in neoplastic disease.

**Conclusions:** This study documents a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression. Synonymous mutations can create new splicing enhancer motifs, leading to efficient maturation of preRNA and increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active receptor. Our findings highlight the importance of considering synonymous mutations in cancer research and their potential therapeutic implications.

**Title:** Enhancing Metagenomic Sequencing for Accurate Diagnosis: Development of a Bioinformatics Pipeline for Contamination Removal and Low-Complexity Sequence Elimination in Eukaryotic Pathogen Genomes

**Research Question:** How can we improve the accuracy of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosing human infections by eliminating contamination and low-complex genomic sequences in eukotic pathogen genomes?

**Methods:** We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences from a comprehensive database of sequenced eukotic pathogen genomes, as well as low-complex genomic sequences, a source of false positives. We applied this pipeline to 245 eukotic path genomes, producing a "clean" eotic pathogen database for bioinformatics analysis.

**Findings:** Our pipeline significantly improved sensitivity and reduced false positives when identifying eotic pathogens in metagen samples compared to using original genomes.

**Implications:** Metagen sequencing is a promising for diagnosing human infections, but contamination and low-complex sequences hinder its accuracy. Our pipeline addresses these issues, providing a "clean" e pathogen database for bioinformatics, reducing false positives and negatives.

**Conclusions:** Our study presents a method for eliminating contamination and low-complex sequences in eotic genomes, applicable to both complete and draft genomes. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a large eotic path dataset, producing a filtered database for bioinformatics, including NGS diagnostics, with decreased false and false rates.

**Title:** Investigating the Evolutionary Dynamics and Host-Parasite Genetic Diversity of Trypanosoma brucei in Uganda: Implications for the Spread of Human African Trypanosomiasis

**Research Question:** What are the evolutionary dynamics underlying the origin of new foci and host-parasite diversity of Tryosoma bruce in Uganda, and how do they impact the spread of the disease in the region?

**Methods:** We genotyped 269 Tryosoma bruce isolates from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the presence of the S gene conferring human infectivity to T. rhodesense. Bayesian methods and Discriminant Analysis of Components partitioned Tryoma bruce isolates into three distinct clusters: cluster 1 and 3 from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 mostly from southwestern Kenya.

**Findings:** Our results show the expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda from northward spread of T. rhense (br) and emergence of human infect strains from non-infect T. bruce (bb) of different genetic backgrounds, and the importance of cattle as reservoir in shaping the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.

**Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for the control and prevention of African Trypanosomias in Uganda, as they highlight the importance of cattle as a reservoir and the emergence of human infect strains from non-infect strains. They also suggest ongoing gene flow between genetic clusters and long-range dispersal, indicating the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of the disease.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into the evolutionary dynamics and host-parite diversity of Tryoma bruce in Uganda, highlighting the importance of cattle as a reservoir and emergence of human infect strains from nonfect strains. Our results have implications for the control and prevention of African Tryosomias in the region, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of the disease.

**Title:** Thioredoxin-interacting Protein (TXIP) Regulates Nitric Oxide Synthesis and NLRP Inflamome Activation during Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Endotoxic Shock

**Research Question:** What is the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXIP) in regulating nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and NLR inflamome activation during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock?

**Methods:** We investigated the susceptibility of TXIP knockout (Tx−/−) mice to LPS-induced endotoxic shock and the role of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in this response. We measured NO and iOS levels in Tx/− macrophages and rescued Tx/− mice from endotoxic shock with an iOS inhibitor. We also examined IL-1 secretion and S-nrosylation of NLR3 in Tx/ and wild-type mice.

**Findings:** Tx/− mice were significantly more susceptible to LPS-induced endotoxic due to increased NO and iOS production. iOS rescued Tx− mice from endotoxic death, indicating NO is a major factor in TXIP-mediated endotoxic susceptibility. Despite reduced IL-1 secretion, Tx/ mice had increased S-nrosylated NLR3 compared to wild-type controls. We observed cross-talk between TXIP and NFκB/iOS pathways, regulating disease states associated with sepsis.

**Implications:** TXIP is a novel molecule linking NO synthesis and NLR inflam activation during endotoxic. Our data suggest that TXIP regulates NFκ, affecting iOS in response to LPS, and excessive NO inhibits NLR-dependent IL-1 secretion via S-nrosylation of NLR inflamome.

**Conclusions:** TXIP plays a critical role in modulating NO and iOS expression during LPS-induced endotoxic. Our results indicate that iOS activation is mediated by NFκ pathway in absence of TXIP. Enhanced NO and iOS in Tx− macrophages suggest TXIP is involved in NO-mediated NLR inhibition. We propose that S-nrosylation of NLR by NO reduces IL-1 and sensitivity to lethal endotoxin shock. Overall, our data demonstrate that TXIP is a negative regulator of NO and iOS during LPS-induced endotoxic.

**Title:** Identification of ZTF-8 as a Novel Factor in Mitotic and Meiotic DNA Double-Strand Break Repair and Damage Response in Caenorhabditis elegans Germline

**Research Question:** Understanding the molecular mechanisms of DNA damage response and repair (DDR) and double-strand break (DSB) repair (DSBR) in the germline is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. We investigated the role of ZTF-8, a previously uncharacterized conserved protein from worms to humans, in DDR and DSBR in Caenorhabditis elegans germl.

**Methods:** We analyzed ztf-8 mutants, which exhibit sensitivity to γ-irradiation and hydroxyurea, mitotic arrest at S-phase, accompanied by activation of ATL-1 and CHK-1 DNA checkpoint kinases, and accumulation of mitotic and meiotic recombination intermediates, indicating ZTF-8 functions in DSBR. Impaired meiotic DS progression fails to trigger CEP-1/p53-dependent damage checkpoint in pachene, supporting a role for Z-8 in meiotic DDR. TF-8 co-localizes with 9-1-1 DDR complex and interacts with M-2/Rad, a component of this complex. Human RH rescues phenotypes in ztf- mutants, suggesting conservation across species.

**Findings:** We identified Z-8 as a novel factor in repair of both mitotic and meiotic DS and activation of pachene damage in C. elegans germl. TF- localizes to chromatin and nucleus, with changes in subcellular localization in response to damage, and ATL- and ATM-dependent chromatin localization, supporting role in DDR and repair. Impaired meiotic DS in z- mutants contributes to elevated recombination intermediates in germl. Data support Z- promoting normal progression DS repair in mitotic meiotic germl nuclei. Persistence unrepaired DS activates damage resulting apoptosis in lateachene C elegans germl.

**Implications:** Our findings define conserved function for Z- in promoting genomic stability in germl. Z- plays role in repair stalled replication forks and meiotic DS as well as meiotic damage response via 9-1 pathway.

**Conclusions:** ZTF-8 is a novel factor in both mitotic and meiotic DS repair and meiotic damage response in C. elegans germl. Its localization to chromatin and nucleus, changes in response to damage, and interaction with 9-1 complex support role in DDR and repair. Impaired meiotic DS in z- contributes elevated recombination germl. Persistence unrepaired DS activates damage resulting apoptosis lateach C eleg germl. Our analysis supports model in which Z- plays role in repair stalled replication and meiotic DS as well as meiotic response 9-1 pathway.

**Title:** Mechanism of Progenitor Differentiation in the Neural Tube: A Role of Olig in Coordinating Spatial and Temporal Pattern of Motor Neuron Generation

**Research Question:** How do neural tube progenitors differentiate into specific cell types in a spatial and temporal pattern, and what is the role of Olig in this process?

**Methods:** We employed single-cell transcriptomics to investigate the transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into motor neurons (MN) in the neural tube. We reconstructed gene expression dynamics from these data and found that Olig plays a pivotal role prior to MN differentiation.

**Findings:** Olig represses the Notch signaling effectors Hes1 and H5, and O2 repression of H5 is direct via a conserved element within the H5 locus that restricts expression from MN progenitors. This reveals a tight coupling between regulatory networks controlling patterning and differentiation, with O acting as a developmental pacemaker coordinating spatial and temporal MN generation.

**Implications:** Our findings establish a mechanism where neural patterning and neurogenesis intersect. By modulating the Notch pathway, Shh and retoid induction of O not only specifies MN identity but also determines the rate of differentiation, imposing distinctive kinetics of MN production. Notch signaling controls the transition between phases of O2 expression, restraining O2 in MN progenitors. Inhibition of Notch increases expression of neurogenic markers and neuronal genes, suggesting Notch controls the transition between phases of O2 expression.

**Conclusions:** Olig dynamics underlie the progression of p cells to MNs and p progenitors. Notch pathway effectors H1 and H5 decrease as cells switch from early O2 expression to O2. Inhibition of Not signalling upregulates O2. O binding represses H5 through an element, interrupting the oscillator, allowing N2 to reach maximal levels and differentiation to commence. By inserting into the Not-regulated neural program, O2 shuts Not activity, ensuring MN proceeds spatially and temporally controlled.

**Title:** Cross-reactive T cell responses mediate early clearance of antigenically novel influenza virus in nonhuman primates

**Research Question:** Can cross-reactive T cell responses induced by infection with a seasonal influenza virus protect nonhuman primates against subsequent challenge with an antigenically distinct pandemic virus?

**Methods:** We employed a translational nonhuman primate model to investigate the role of cross-reactive T responses in clearance of 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza (H1Npdm) virus. Five rhesus macaques were first infected with a human seasonal H1 isolate, resulting in detectable cellular and antibody responses but no neutralizing antibodies against H1p. Four months later, the "primed" animals and naive controls were challenged with HNp.

**Findings:** In naive animals, CD8+ T cells with activated phenotype (Ki-67+CD38+) appeared in blood and lung 5-7 days post-inoculation (p.i.) with HNp, reaching peak magnitude 7-10 p.i. In contrast, activated T cells were recruited to lung as early as 2 p.i. in "prim" animals, peaking in blood and lung 4-7 p.i. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) Elisp and intracellular cytokine staining showed virus-specific response peaked and reached higher magnitude in "prim" than naive animals, involving both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Strikingly, "prim" animals cleared HNp infection significantly from upper and lower respiratory tract before appearance HN-specific neutralizing antibodies.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that cross-react T responses can mediate early clearance of antigenically novel virus in non primates. Vaccines capable of inducing cross-react T may protect against severe disease caused by emerging influenza viruses.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that animals "primed" to influenza-specific T responses by infection with seasonal virus mount stronger cellular response upon HN challenge and initiate more quickly than naive. HN-specific neutralizing responses develop later than T responses in both "prim" and naive animals. These findings are consistent with previous studies in ferrets and mice, suggesting cross-react T protect against lethal H1p while antibodies cannot. Our results provide evidence that cross-react T play key role in facilitating clearance HN in macques.

**Title:** Development of a Rapid and Sensitive Loop-Med Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) Assay for the Detection of Coxiella burnetii, the Causative Agent of Q Fever

**Research Question:** Coxiella burnii is the most widespread zoonotic disease, and domestic animals are the primary sources of transmission. However, its diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of specific clinical manifestations in humans and identifiable features in carrier animals. Conventional serodiagnosis requires sera from acute and convalescent stages, which are unavailable for early diagnosis.

**Methods:** We developed a Loop-Med Isothermal Amplification (L) assay to identify Coxi burnii rapidly and sensitively. A universal L primer set was designed to detect the repeated sequence IS1 of the hAB gene of Coxi using Primer V software. The sensitivity of the L assay was evaluated using known quantities of reference plasmids containing the targeted gene. Specificity was determined using 26 members of Ricketiae and 18 common pathogens. Utility was compared with real-time PCR on 24 samples, including 6 confirmed and probable fever cases diagnosed by serological and real PCR. Additionally, 126 animal samples from 4 provinces, including goats, cattle, horses, marmots, and deer were compared by both methods.

**Findings:** The limits of detection of the L assay for the h gene were 1 copy/reaction. Specificity was 100%, and no cross-reaction among bacteria in the study. Positive rate of febrile patients was 33.3% (95CI 30.2-36.4) for L and 8.3% (7.4-9.2) for real (P<0.05). Similarly, total rate was 7.9 (7-8.7) for L and 0.8 (0.7-0.9) real (P<0.01).

**Implications:** The developed L assay is a potential tool for diagnosis of fever in humans and animals, especially in rural areas of China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without sophisticated equipment or complicated protocol. It is a rapid, simple, and cost-effective method for detecting Coxi infection in humans and animals.

**Conclusion:** We developed a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective L assay to detect Coxi infection in humans and animals. Compared to real-time PCR in our laboratory, the L assay is a tool for diagnosis of fever in humans and animals, especially in rural areas of China, due to its rapid and detection without sophisticated or complicated operations.

**Title:** Epigenetic Mutations of Hematopoietic Enhancers in Cancer: A Novel Regulatory Framework for Gene Reactivation

**Research Question:** How do epigenetic mutations of hematopoietic enhancers contribute to cancer development and progression?

**Methods:** We investigated the epigenetic landscape of hematopoietic enhancers during normal development and cancer using DNA methylation data. We identified a novel class of enhancers, hematopoietic-specific enhancers (ES), which are prone to DNA methylation changes and associated with transcriptional activity in cancer.

**Findings:** Hematopoietic ESs are hypermethylated in cancer relative to normal cells and co-localized with silenced genes, whereas unmethylated ESs are hypomethyl in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. Constitutive hematopoietic enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ESs in cancer. Further analysis of hypomethyl ES downstream the VFA gene revealed a novel regulatory circuit affecting VFA transcript levels across cancers and patients.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that enhancer sites provide a framework for reactivation of genes in cancer. DNA methylation is closely linked to enhancer states and expression of cancer genes, and enhancers are prone to methylation perturbations in cancer. Genes proximal to cancer-hypethyl ESs are expressed in ES but downregulated in hematiet cells and tend to be expressed in cancer. These results indicate an association between hypomethylation of ESs and upregulation of genes in cancer.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel class of epigenetic mutations in hematopoiet enhancers that contribute to cancer development and progression. Hematopoiet ES are prone to methylation and associated with transcriptional activity in cancer. Methylation of ES is associated with VFA expression in cancer, and unmethyl ES with reactivated genes. Constitutive hematopoiet enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ES in cancer. We provide evidence that DNA methylation of ES affects its activity as a transcription enhancer in leukemia. Our results support the idea that enhancers are cis-acting regulators of gene reactivation in cancer.

**Title:** Quantifying the Effect of Subdivision on the Crossing of Fitness Valleys and Plateaus in a Rugged Landscapes

**Research Question:** How does subdivision of a population into demes connected by migration affect the time it takes to cross fitness valleys and plateaus in a rugged landscape?

**Methods:** We employ a generic and minimal model that includes population subdivision into demes without significant changes in deme size, environmental heterogeneity, or geographic structure. Using Markov chain theory, we derive analytical expressions for the conditions under which the subdivided population crosses valleys and plateaus as fast as its fastest deme.

**Findings:** We show that isolated demes must be in the sequential regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. Subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters, extending beyond the optimal window. Our results hold for weakly beneficial mutations. We also investigate the effect of varying degree of subdivision and the trade-off between magnitude of speedup and width of parameter range.

**Implications:** Subdivision with migration can significantly accelerate crossing fitness valleys and plateaus, shedding light on quantitative conditions necessary for this to occur. Our study demonstrates that subdividing a population into demes connected by migration can accelerate crossing without additional ingredients. This has implications for understanding evolution on rugged landscapes, where multiple valleys and plateaus may exist.

**Conclusions:** Our generic model enables quantitatively determining conditions under which subdivision accelerates valley or plateau crossing.

**Title:** Elucidating the Metabolic Landscape of Aedes aegypt during Dengue Virus Infection: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Midgutome and Implications for Arbovirus Transmission**

**Research Question:** What are the metabolic alterations in the midgut of Aedes aegypt, the primary vector for arboviruses such as deng, Zika, chikunya, and yellow fever viruses, during DENV infection, and how do these changes impact viral replication and transmission?

**Methods:** We employed high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze the temporal perturbations in the midut metabolome of Aedes aegpt following DENV infection, focusing on the primary site of infection and replication, the midut tissue. We identified metabolites exhibiting dynamic profiles across early, mid, and late-infection time points.

**Findings:** We observed a marked increase in lipid content, specifically glycerophosphipids, sphingipids, and acyls, coinciding with viral replication kinetics. Elevated glycerolip levels suggested diversion of resources from energy to synthetic pathways, while elevated acyl-citines indicated disruptions in mitochondrial function and energy production. A critical hub in the sphingip pathway, dihydroceramide to ceramide ratios, was identified as crucial for the virus cycle.

**Implications:** This study provides the first insight into the metabolic environment during arvirus replication in Aedes aegpt, highlighting biochemical chokepoints that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by this mosquito. Our results suggest that lipid alterations in the midut facilitate viral replication and dissemination, underscoring the importance of lipid metabolism in arvirus-host interactions.

**Conclusions:** This study reconstructs the sphingip pathway in Aedes aegpt, a conserved in replication mechanisms of flaviruses transmitted by this vector. Our findings have implications for the development of novel strategies to disrupt transmission of arboviruses by mosquitoes.

**Title:** Elucidating the Underlying Mechanisms of Cardiac Arrhythmias: A Simplified Electrophysiological Model of the Rabbit Ventricular Action Potential

**Research Question:** Existing electrophysiological models of the ventricular action potential (AP) are complex and overparameterized, leading to dissimilar predictions. We aim to develop a parsimonious, mathematically identifiable model that reproduces significant phenomena using few parameters.

**Methods:** We combined a novel Hodgkin-Hux formulation of the rapid sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological model of repolarization similar to the voltage-dependent, time-independent rectifying potassium (IK) current. The model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit ventricular myocytes under physiological conditions: current-voltage (I-V) relationships during the AP upstroke, rapid recovery of excitability during the refractory period, and steady IN inactivation via voltage clamp.

**Findings:** Simulations reproduced emergent phenomena, including alternans rates >250bpm observed in rabbitocytes, reentrant waves on the surface of the heart, and spiral wave breakup. Model variants elucidated minimal requirements for alternans and wave up, namely kinetics of IN inactivation and non-linearity of IK.

**Implications:** The simplicity of the model, with physiological parameters, makes it ideal for generating mechanistic insight and a building block for more detailed ionic models of rabbit electrophiology.

**Conclusions:** Our parsimonious model provides a solid foundation for understanding cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms, integrating electrophys experiments and theory. It highlights the importance of INa kinetics and IK non-linearity in alternans and wave up. This model can be extended to other species and conditions, providing a generalizable framework for understanding cardiac electrophiology.

**Title:** Precise Genome Assembly of Somatic Genes in Parameium: Unveiling the Role of Non-Homologous End Joining Pathway and Domesticated Transposases

**Research Question:** How does the ciliate Parame process double-strand breaks (DSBs) to achieve precise assembly of somatic genes during its sexual cycle, and what is the role of non-homous end-joining (NHE) pathway and domesticated transases in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Lig4 and Xccp, components of the NHE pathway, in the repair of Internal Eliminated Sequences (IES) excision sites and circularization in Parame. We used RNAi-mediated silencing to knockdown Lig and Xccp expression and observed the effects on IES excision and circularization.

**Findings:** Our results show that Lig and Xcc are required for IES excision and circularization, and that their expression is induced early in the sexual cycle. RNAi-mediated silencing of either gene results in persistence of free DNA ends, protected against resection. At the nucleotide level, removal of the 5-terminal nucleotide occurs in Lig-silenced cells, while addition to the 3 ends of breaks is blocked, indicative of coupling between NHE polymerase and ligase activities.

**Implications:** Our data indicate that IES excision is a "cut-and-close" mechanism involving introduction of DSBs at both ends of IES, followed by precise repair via NHE. This broadens our understanding of how cellular NHE cooperates with domesticated transases for genome dynamics.

**Conclusions:** This study provides strong evidence that the Lig-Xccp complex, a key actor of NHE, carries out DSB repair during developmentally programmed I excision in Parame. Joining is precise at the nucleotide level, critical for assembly of functional reading frames in somatic genome. Tight coupling between cutting and repair contributes to precision. Domesticated transases, such as PigMac, are essential for initial cleavage, while Lig and Xp are required for final repair. This work highlights an essential role of NHE in precise repair of developmentally programmed DSB at genome-wide scale.

**Title:** Mode of Death in Patients with Heart Failure Caused by Chagas Disease: A Comparative Study with Non-Chagas Cardiomyopathy

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas disease, comparing it with non-Ch cardiomyopathy, in the era of modern heart failure treatment.

**Methods:** We analyzed 342 patients from the REMHE trial, grouped according to etiology (Chagas vs. non-Ch) and mode of death. The primary endpoint was all-cause and heart failure and sudden mortality.

**Findings:** 185 (54.1%) patients died, with 56.4% in Chagas and 53.7% non-Ch patients. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart mortality was higher in Chagas compared to non-Ch. No difference in cumulative sudden mortality between groups. Cox model showed Ch etiology (HR 2.76; CI 1.34-5.69; p=0.006), LVED (HR 1.07; CI 1.04-1.10; p<0.001), creatinine (HR 0.98 CI 0.97-0.99; p=0.006), and amiodarone (HR 3.05 CI1.47-6.34; p=0.003) associated with heart mortality. LVED (HR 1.04 CI1.01-1.07 p=0.005) and beta-blocker (HR 0.52 CI0.34-0.94 p=0.014) with sudden mortality.

**Implications:** In severe Chagas disease, heart failure is the main mode of death. This challenges current understanding of Chagas disease and has implications for treatment selection, considering mode of death.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of understanding the natural history of patients with systolic dysfunction for adequate health planning and survival. Chagas disease management is complex, including treatment of arrhythmias and heart failure.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanism of NIK-Mediated Defense against Geminivirus Infection: The Role of Ribosomal Protein rp10 as a Downstream Effector of NIK Signaling

**Research Question:** How does the N-interacting kinase (NIK) mediate defense against gemivirus infection, and what is the molecular mechanism underlying this antiv response?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between NIK and ribosomal protein rp10, a potential downstream effector of NIK signaling, and its role in gemivirus infection.

**Findings:** Phosphorylation of cytosolic rp10 by NIK redirects the protein to the nucleus, where it may modulate viral infection. Ectopic expression of NIK or hyperactive NIK mutant promotes accumulation of phosphorylated rp10 within nuclei, while inactive NIK fails to redirect rp10 to nuclei. Mutant rp10 defective for NIK phosphorylation is not redirected to nucleus. Loss of rp10 function enhances susceptibility to gemivirus, similar to nik null alleles. Geminivirus interferes with NIK-mediated nuclearization of rp10 as countermeasure.

**Implications:** NIK-mediated defense neither activates RNA silencing nor hypersensitive response but inhibits plant growth. Virulence of gemivirus studied overcomes this layer defense in Arabid, but NIK response may restrict host range other viruses.

**Conclusions:** We identified rp10 as a specific substrate and partner of NIK, functioning as immediate effector of NIK response. Phosphorylation of rp10 by N redirects to nucleus, where it may modulate viral infection. Geminivirus interferes with NIK-mediated localization of rp10 as countermeasure. NIK signaling may be involved in restricting host range other viruses.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Alternative Oxidase (AOX) in the Pathogenicity of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis: Implications for Fungal Survival and Virulence

**Research Question:** How does the alternative oxidase (AO) enzyme contribute to the survival and virulence of Paracidioides brasiliensis, a thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungus, in the presence of oxidative stress imposed by host immune cells?

**Methods:** We generated a mitotically stable P. brasili AOX (PbAO) antisense RNA strain with a 70% reduction in gene expression and evaluated its interaction with IF-γ activated alve macrophages in a mouse model of infection. We also determined fungal viability in the presence of H2O2.

**Findings:** Interaction with IF-γ activatedve macrophages induced higher levels of AO gene expression in Pbt conidia than Pbt yeast cells. AO-a conidia and yeast had decreased viability after interaction with macrophages. In a mouse model of infection, absence of wild-type AO in P. brasili resulted in reduced fungal burden at weeks 8 and 24 post-challenge and increased survival. In presence H2, we observed Pbt yeast increased AO expression and higher viability compared to AO-a yeast.

**Implications:** Our data support the hypothesis that AO is important in fungal defense against oxidative stress imposed by immune cells and relevant in virulence of P. brasiliensis. AO has been associated with reduction of mitochondrial ROS and intracellular redox balance in yeast and putative role in mycelia-yeast morphological switch. Our results implicate AO in resistance P. brasili to oxidative burst by alve macroph and agree with previous reports indicating AOX required for Aspergillus pathogenicity. Fungal burden in mice with AO-a conidia were lower at all evaluated periods, suggesting AO important for establishment of infection, especially initial phase when cells face temperature-induced morph shift to yeast while interacting with immune (e.g. alve macro) that induce oxidative response (e.g ROS).

**Conclusions:** AO plays a crucial role in P. brasili survival and virulence, particularly in response to oxidative stress imposed by host cells. Our findings highlight the importance of AO in fungal pathogenicity and suggest its potential as a target for antifungal therapy.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Attractor Dynamics in Episodic Memory: A Neural Substrate for Contextual Representation in the Hippocampus

**Research Question:** Do attractor dynamics in the hippocampus support episodic memory, and if so, what is the neural substrate for this mechanism?

**Methods:** Recent experiments morphed familiar context into another while observing responses of CA3 cell ensembles. Average activity in CA was reported to transition gradually rather than abruptly from one context to the next, suggesting lack of attractors associated with stored representations. Individual CA cells showed mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along sequence and displayed hysteresis, a signature of attract dynamics.

**Findings:** A neural network model of CA with attractors for both position and context was developed. Memories stored in overlapping ensembles within single map position-dependent attractors transitioned at different points along sequence. Smooth curves arose from averaging population while heterogeneous responses observed on single level. Orthogonal memories led abrupt transitions on both population and single levels as experimentally observed remapping between independent maps. Strong feedback entailed hysteretic effect network diminished overlap memories.

**Implications:** Context-dependent memory supported by overlapping attractors within spatial map CA cells. Similar mechanisms may be found in other cerebral regions.

**Conclusion:** Contrary to prediction, attract dynamics not manifest as abrupt shift in representation one context morphed into next. Instead, gradual transition observed in population CA cells as familiar arena morphed into circular. Recurrent network model of CA with attractors for position and context developed. Memories in overlapping ensembles within single map position-dependent attract transitioned different points sequence. Smooth curves arose averaging population while heterogeneous responses observed single level. Orthogonal memories abrupt transitions both population single levels as experiment remapping independent maps. Strong feedback entailed hysteretic network diminished overlap memories.

**Title:** Unveiling the Metabolic Adaptations of Entamoeba histoly to Oxidative Stress: A Novel Insights into the Role of Glycolytic Biosynthesis as an Anti-oxidative Defense Mechanism

**Research Question:** How does Entamoeba histoly, a microaerobic enteric protozoan parasite, respond to oxidative stress at the metabolic level, and what alternative anti-oxidative strategies does it employ to cope with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species?

**Methods:** We investigated the metabolic responses of E. histolytica to H2O2 and paraquat-mediated oxidative stress using capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify changes in metabolites involved in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino metabolism.

**Findings:** Oxidative stress caused drastic modulation of metabolites involved in glycol, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide amino metabolism, leading to inhibition of glycolysis and redirection of metabolic flux towards glycer production, chitin biosynthesis, and nonoxidative branch of the pentose pathway. Accumulation of glycol intermediates upstream pyruate and reduced levels of nucleos triosphates were observed. We also demonstrated the presence of functional glycol biosynthetic pathway in E.olytica, evidenced by increased glyol 3-phosphate and glyol production upon oxidative stress.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the significance of glycol biosynthetic pathway as an anti-oxidative defense in Eolytica, providing novel insights into the metabolic adaptations employed by this protozoan to cope with oxidative stress.

**Conclusions:** E. histoly, lacking key components of eukaryotic anti-oxid defense systems, employs alternative anti-oxid strategies, including glycol biosynthesis, to counteract oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that glycol biosynthetic pathway plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis under oxidative conditions, warranting further investigation into its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

**Title:** IKAR: A Critical Regulator of Hematopoietic Fate and Dynamic Expression Pattern Required for Hematopoiesis

**Research Question:** How does IKAR regulate hematopoietic cell fate, and what is the role of its dynamic expression in hematopoies in collaboration with the Nuosome Remodeling Deetylase (Nu) complex?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between IKAR and the Nu-PTEb complex, a multifunctional chromatin complex containing chromatin remodeling (Nu) and transcription elongation (TEb) activities. We examined whether IKAR is a licensing factor for Nu-PTEb recruitment to chromatin and whether IKAR levels influence NuTEb association with IKAR and regulate transcription elongation.

**Findings:** Our data reveal that IKAR binds to the NuTEb complex and recruits it to specific gene promoters, facilitating transcription elongation by transferring Phosphatase 1 (PPα), an IKAR-binding and TE activator. An IKAR mutant unable to bind PPα cannot sustain gene expression and impede normal hematiet differentiation. Knockdown of Nu subunit Mi2 shows that Nu occupancy at transcribed regions relieves promoter pausing and promotes elongation.

**Implications:** IKAR is a critical regulator of hematopoiet fate, and its dynamic expression is required for proper hematopoies. IK interacts with the NuTE complex, promoting repression and activation. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of IKAR as transcriptional activator during hematopoiet lineage differentiation and interaction with the niche.

**Conclusions:** IKAR is a DNA-binding subunit of the newly characterized NuTE multifunctional complex, containing chromatin remodeling (Nu) and transcription elongation (TE) activities. IKAR is essential for CD9 and Mi interaction and recruitment to actively transcribed genes in hematopoiet cells. IK interacts with PP and is dephosphorylated by this phosphatase. Our results suggest Nu can assist II elong complex throughout OR of IK target genes, providing cues to the central role of IK as transcriptional activator during hematiet lineage differentiation and interaction with the niche.

**Title:** Investigating the Origins of Rabies Virus Outbreaks in Trinidad: A Phylogeographic Analysis and Molecular Characterization of Trinidadian Rabies Virus

**Research Question:** This study aimed to determine whether rabies outbreaks in Trinidad are the result of in situ evolution or importation of the virus from the nearby South American mainland using molecular characterization of Trinidadian rabies virus (RV) and a Bayesian phyloge approach.

**Methods:** We analyzed Trinidadian RV sequences from rabid livestock sampled between 1997-2010, which fell into three temporally defined lineages: Trinidad I, IIa, and IIb, with evidence of co-circulation of lineages I and IIa in 200. Phyloge analyses supported separate RV introductions from the mainland for each lineage, with estimated dates of introductions and subsequent expansions suggesting in situ evolution within Trinidad.

**Findings:** Trinidadian RV sequences clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) related sequences and were most closely related to RV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela, indicating separate introductions from the mainland for each lineage. Lineage I included sequences from 1997-200 were most closely related to RV from Ecuador (2005, 200) and Frenchiana (199), while lineage II comprised sequences from southwest Trinidad clustered into two groups: IIa and IIb, most closely related to Brazil (199,200) and Uruguay (200,200).

**Implications:** These findings suggest three separate RV introductions from the mainland for each Trinidadian lineage, with subsequent in situ evolution within the island. Coirculation of lineages I and IIa in 200 indicates the potential for ongoing transmission between lineages. Given the vampire bat origin of Trinidadian RV, further studies should investigate the relationship between RV spatiemporal dynamics and bat ecology, particularly movement between the mainland and Trinidad.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of phyloge analysis in understanding the origins of rabies outbreaks and the need for further investigation into the relationship between RV and vampire bat ecology. The findings also suggest the possibility of RV introductions via infected bats from undersampled or unsampled countries, such as Venezuela or Guyana, and the need to monitor non-vampire bat species with migratory habits to determine if different RV variants are introduced into Trinidad.

**Title:** Elucidating the Regulatory Principles of Cortical Area Development: A Computational Modeling of Gene Interactions between Fgf, Em2, Pax, Coupfi, and Sp

**Research Question:** How do the interactions between the genes Fgf, Em2, Pax, Coupfi, and Sp regulate the emergence of functionally distinct areas in the cerebral cortex during development?

**Methods:** We employed a Boolean model to simulate the interactions between these five genes to determine which combinations of interactions and networks reproduce the experimentally observed anterior-posterior expression patterns. The model treated expression levels as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of the data available. We examined all possible networks containing the five genes of interest and found that only those lacking certain interactions and combinations, including auto-regulation and inductive loops, were able to reproduce the observed patterns.

**Findings:** Our analysis of the probability of each interaction indicated that repressive interactions are more likely than inductive ones, but mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct functioning. We found remarkable diversity in the structure of networks that performed well, but certain interactions were more likely to be present in the gene regulating cortical development network.

**Implications:** Our model illuminates the design of the gene network regulating cortical development and makes novel predictions that can be tested experimentally. The results suggest that F8 expression at the anterior pole, a putative patterning centre, may be sufficient to drive correct patterning of transcription factors Em2, Pax, Coupfi, and Sp, if simple interactions between these factors exist. This is an example of how a transient signal, in this F8 initiated by regulators, can be converted into a durable change in the brain.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the power of a Boolean model in revealing logical principles underlying genetic regulation of corticalisation and guiding future experiments. Experimental evidence indicates the network regulating cortical development has multiple pathways, making it difficult to intuitively understand. Our systematic screen of possible networks identified structural requirements for good performance and differing roles of genes in the network. The model provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions between F, Em, Pax, Coup, and Sp and their proteins in anterior-posterior patterning of cortical areas.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Localization of Bmi-Dependent H2 Ubiquitylation in MEF Cells Reveals Novel Mechanisms of Transcriptional Regulation

**Research Question:** How does B1-dependent H2 ubiquity regulate gene expression in MEF cells, and what is the relationship between H2 ubiquity and DNA methylation?

**Methods:** We used ChIP-Seq technology to map the genome-wide localization of B1-dependent H2 ubiquity in MEF cells and analyzed the correlation with gene expression and DNA methylation patterns.

**Findings:** We found that B1-dependent H ubiquity is enriched at the transcription start site (TSS) of annotated genes, particularly those with the H3K27me3 mark, and is associated with lower expression in WT MEF cells. Additionally, we identified regions of H2 enrichment throughout the genome, including 700 promoters, and showed that genes with peaks of H2 have lower expression compared to those without. Furthermore, we demonstrated that genes with H2 peaks have increased expression upon B1 knockout. Notably, H2 enrichment is not limited to regions with H3K27me3, but also found at high-density CpG promoters, suggesting a link between DNA methylation and H2.

**Implications:** Our study reveals B1-dependent H ubiquity and suggests that H2 targeting in differentiated cells employs a different mechanism than in ES cells. We propose that DNA methylation may be upstream of B1-dependent H ubiquity, and future studies will investigate how methylation contributes to H2 ubiquity.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first genome-wide map of B-dependent H ubiquity in MEF and highlights its role in transcriptional regulation. Our findings suggest that B-dependent H ubiqu is a general indicator of transcriptional activity and is linked to DNA methylation at high CpG promoters, providing new insights into the complex epigenetic architecture of mammalian chromatin.

**Title:** Pregnancy-induced non-coding RNA (PINC) and retinoblast-associated protein 46 (Rap46) regulate alve cell fate in the mammary gland during pregnancy and involution

**Research Question:** Do Pregnancy-induced noncoding RNA (PINC) and retoblast-associated protein 46 (Rap) play a role in maintaining the alveolar progenitor population in the mammary gland during pregnancy and involution?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of INC and RAp in the mammary gland during pregnancy and involution using in situ hybridization and quantitative PCR. We also induced HC11 mammary epithelial cells to differentiate into milk-producing cells and examined the effect of INC overexpression and knockdown on lactogenic differentiation.

**Findings:** INC is highly expressed in alve cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and declines in early lactation when alve cells undergo terminal differentiation. Overexpression of INC in HC11 cells blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of INC enhances differentiation. INC interacts with RAp and other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and modulates the expression of target genes.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that INC inhibits terminal differentiation of alve cells during pregnancy to prevent milk production until parturition. The PR2 complex including INC and RAp may confer epigenetic modifications maintaining a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to alve fate in the involuted gland.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates a functional role for INC in regulating alve development. INC is enriched in alve cells of the luminal compartment during pregnancy, suggesting a potential role in maintaining mammary epithelial in undifferentiated state. Our findings suggest that INC and RAp play a specialized role in alveenesis and may be involved in maintaining a progenitor population that differentiates into milk-producing cells in subsequent pregnancies.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Antiviral Function of PML/TRIM19 in Restricting Retroviral Infection through Stabilization of Dax

**Research Question:** How does PML/TR19, a member of the tripartite motif (TR) protein family, contribute to antiviral defense against HIV-1 infection and other retroviruses?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of P/TR19 in HIV-1 and retroviral infection using a combination of biochemical, cellular, and molecular biology approaches, including immunofluorescence microscopy, western blotting, and transduction assays.

**Findings:** Our results show that HIV-1 and other retrovir trigger the formation of P cytoplasmic bodies as early as 30 minutes post-infection, with a peak at 2 hours post-infection. P localization is blocked by reverse-transcription inhibitors and not observed following infection with unrelated viruses, suggesting it is specifically triggered by retroiral reversecription. We demonstrate that P interferes with an early step of retroiral infection, as P knockdown dramatically increases reversecription efficiency. Furthermore, we show that P does not directly inhibit retroiral but acts through stabilization of its well-characterized partner, Dax. In the presence of P, cytoplasm Dax is found in vicinity of incoming HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reversecription. Interestingly, Dax not only interferes exogenous retroiral but also inhibits retroposition of endogenous retroviruses, identifying Dax as broad inhibitor of reversecription.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel antiral function of P/TR19 and its nuclear-associated protein Dax in restricting retroiral infection, highlighting a new mechanism of antiral defense against HIV-1 and other retrovir.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insight into the role of P/TR in antiral defense against retroviruses and identifies Dax as a broad inhibitor of reversecription. These findings have implications for the development of novel antiv strategies targeting P/TR and Dax to combat HIV-1 and other retrovir infections.

**Title:** Improving Multiple Protein Structure Alignment with Flexibility: Introducing MATT, a Novel Fragment Chaining Algorithm

**Research Question:** Despite the agreement on the importance of optimizing protein structure alignment, finding the optimal alignment is computationally prohibitive. Previous methods, such as fragment chaining, have been used to align short fragments of proteins against each other optimally and then assemble them geometrically. However, recent studies suggest that incorporating flexibility may better model protein structures in various contexts.

**Methods:** We introduce MATT (Multiple Alignments with Translations and Twists), a fragment chaining algorithm that allows local flexibility between fragments through small translations and rotations to bring aligned fragments closer, even under rigid transformations. Dynamic programming guides these alignments, and geometric consistency is restored in the final output.

**Findings:** MATT is tested on the popular Homstr and Smark datasets, outperforming other programs on Smark, a benchmark of multiple alignments with distant homology. It demonstrates better aligning α-helices and β-strands, crucial for structural library construction. On Smark, M distinguishes homologous from non-homologous pairs using a p-score based on common RMSD.

**Implications:** M's strong performance stems from modeling conformation states and backbone distortions in distantly related proteins.

**Conclusions:** This study introduces MATT, a novel fragment chaining algorithm that incorporates flexibility, improving multiple structure alignment. Its ability to capture local bends in protein structure captures biological and mathematical significance. Two problems protein alignment programs address: the alignment, where proteins have a conserved core, and the inverse folding problem. M is tested on Homstr, a curated dataset of 1,028 alignments of homologous proteins, and Smark, a benchmark of multiple alignments with distant homology.

**Title:** Unraveling the Phosphorylation Dynamics of Greatwall, En/AR19, and Cdk during Mitotic Exit: A Mathematical Modeling and Experimental Approach

**Research Question:** How are the phosphatases that regulate Greatwall, En/AR19, and Cdk dephosphorylation coordinated during mitotic exit?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental approaches using phospho-specific antibodies to monitor the phosphorylation of Great, En/AR19, and Cdk during mitotic entry and exit.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that PP2/B is required for G dephosphorylation at the essential Cdk site Thr194, while En/19 deosphorylation is mediated by the RNA polymerase II C-terminal phosphatase F1. Surprisingly, inhibition or depletion of F1 or PP2 does not block deosphory of the bulk mitotic Cdk substrates during mitotic exit.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest a hierarchy of phosphases coordinating Great, En/19, and Cdk deosphory during mitotic exit. The reactivation of these phosphases is crucial for mitotic exit. The identity of the major Cdk counterphosphatase in mammalian cells is still debated, with current models proposing PP/B as both required for Cdk activation and direct deosphory of mitotic substrates during exit.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the phosphory dynamics of Great, En/19, and C during mitotic exit. Mathematical modeling and experimental approaches reveal a complex network of phosphases regulating their deory, with PP2 primarily responsible for G inactivating G, while other phosphatases regulate additional phosphorylation sites contributing to G inactivation. Our results highlight the importance of understanding this network for mitotic progression and exit.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of HIV-1 Escape from Autologous Neutralizing Antibodies in Early Subtype C Infection

**Research Question:** What are the mechanisms of HIV-1 escape from autologous neutralizing antibodies (Nab) in early subtype C infection, and how do they impact the establishment of a new infection?

**Methods:** We conducted a temporal analysis of two subjects with acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection who developed high-titer autologous Nabs. We created a series of envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants within the background of a newly transmitted Env to identify resistant variants at multiple points.

**Findings:** Despite the development of high-t autolog Nabs, viral escape occurred in both subjects. In subject 1, escape was driven by changes in the region of gp120 extending from the beginning of V3 to the end of V5 (V5). In subject 2, escape was driven by changes in V2. The V2-dependent pathway was retained over time and reflected the virus's ability to escape two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) from the same patient via a single N-linked glycosylation site in V. Spatial representation of sequence changes in gp120 suggested selective pressure acted on same regions in both subjects, though Env domains driving escape differed.

**Implications:** Our findings argue that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in subtype C HIV-1 infection and support a model where multiple strategies, including glycan shifts, alteration of epitope sequence, and Env conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.

**Conclusions:** Temporal studies have shown HIV-1 undergoes recurrent escape from autolog Nabs and also during chimeric SIV-HIV-1 (SH) infection in response to vaccine-induced Nabs. However, knowledge of specific events leading to escape remains incomplete. To derive a complete picture of autolog Nabs and escape, it is necessary to recover and characterize Mabs with specificities, as done here and by others to dissect B response in subjects with neutral breadth. These studies demonstrate subtype C Env uniquely responds to immune of each host by adjusting pathways of escape.

**Title:** Quantifying the Extent of Positive and Negative Selection across the Genome of Capsella grandiflora: Implications for Genome Function and Evolution**

**Research Question:** How does the extent of positive and negative selection vary across different regions of the genome in Capsella grandl, a plant species within the Brassicaceae family?

**Methods:** We sequenced the genomes of 13 Capsella grandl individuals and estimated the strength of selection across the genome using the distribution of fitness effects. We identified conserved non-coding sequences (CNS) across the Brassicaceae family and quantified selection on these regions. Additionally, we analyzed expression data from leaf tissue to determine the relationship between gene expression and selection.

**Findings:** Our results show that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs. Estimates of selection on noncoding conserved regions across Brassicaceae show strong signals of selection. We also observed reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Furthermore, we found that highly expressed genes experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that positive and negative selection are widespread in coding and regulatory regions, but also indicate that positive and negative selection on noncoding are rarer in plant genomes compared to animals. This has implications for understanding genome function and maintenance of genetic variation.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first genome-wide quantification of positive and negative selection in a plant species. Our results demonstrate that positive and negative selection are pervasive in coding, 5 and 3' untranslated regions, and noncoding regions of the Capsella genome, but a large proportion of noncoding may evolve neutrally. We also found stronger negative selection in highly expressed genes compared to low genes, suggesting differences in selection drive rates molecular evolution. These findings have implications for understanding genome evolution and function, particularly in plants, where regulatory evolution may occur more often through gene duplication than cis-regulatory change, leading to lower levels of constraint and selection on noncoding DNA.

**Title:** Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Transcriptional Regulator EB2 Reprograms B-cell Fate by Inducing Cooperative Binding of Master Regulators RBPκ and EBF

**Research Question:** How does Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transcriptional regulator EB2 (EB2) influence the binding of master regulators RBPκ and EBF to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival?

**Methods:** We employed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and biochemical assays to investigate the interaction between EB2 and RBPκ EBF in EB-positive B-lymphoblast cells.

**Findings:** We found that EB2 induces the formation of new binding sites for RBPκ and E1, many of which are in close proximity to the viral genome. These co-occupied sites by EB2-RBPκ E1 correlate with transcriptional activation of genes important for Blymphob function. Conditional expression or repression of EB2 leads to rapid alteration in RBPκ E1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at cooccupied sites.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that EB-encoded transcriptional coactivator EB2 reprograms the binding patterns of host regulatory factors RBPκ and E1, driving B-lyoblast growth and survival.

**Conclusions:** EBV type III promotes a B-cell zone developmental program, with increased RBPκ binding sites. EB2 colocalizes with E1 and RBPκ at enhancer and super-enhancer regions in EB-positive lymphoboid cell lines. EBF and Rκ are master transcription factors determining lymphoid development, but their cooperativity has not been established. EB2 does not alter chromosome site selection of specific DNA binding factors. EB genomes adopt gene programs depending on host or tumor type and epigenetic factors. EB encodes cofactors, including EB2, remodel and host gene to confer proliferation and immortalization to resting B-cells. EB2 binds sequence transcription factors like Rκ and PU. EB2 is potent coactivator expressed early EB-induced proliferation naïve Bells, but extinguished later B development.2 interacts with sequence transcription RBPκ (also R, CBF, CSL) promoters and enhancers EB-regulated genes.

**Title:** Investigating the Genetic Structure and Vector Competence of Aedes aegypt Populations in Mexico: Implications for Dengue Virus Transmission**

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the genetic structure and vector competence of Aedes aegypt populations in Mexico, specifically focusing on the intersection of the Neovolcan axis (N) with the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz, and its impact on deng virus transmission.

**Methods:** Aedes aegpt populations were collected from 10 sites between Tpan in the north and Minatlan in the south (Figure 1) and phenotyped for vector competence for deng serotype 2 (DENV2). Genetic analysis revealed significant differences in vector competence between populations north and south of N, with average rates of 0.55 and 0.20, respectively. Midg infection and escape barriers were major contributors to this variation, with 21.5% and 45.2% of mosquitoes failing to develop midg infections, and 30.3% and 62.8% of infected mosquitoes failing to develop disseminated infections, respectively.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the N acts as a discrete barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegi populations, with significant differences in vector competence for DENV between north and south of N. This barrier may impact the frequency of epidemiologically relevant traits, such as vector competence. Further studies are warranted to determine why N is a barrier to gene flow and whether differences in competence are epidemiologically significant.

**Implications:** Understanding the genetic structure and vector of Ae. aeg populations is crucial for deng research in Mexico, as it may correlate with deng incidence. Identification of biomarkers of vector competence could permit targeted control efforts in areas at risk for deng epidemics. The low vector competence of Ae.egi south of N is intriguing, particularly in cities like Molo, where seroprevalence was zero. Human trafficking and commerce may be a principal barrier, but further investigation is required. Unexpectedly, N is associated with different VC phenotypes.

**Conclusions:** This study defines the geographic barrier to gene flow between northern and southern Gulf Mexico Coastal Plain and characterizes vector competence of Ae.eg in southern Verruz. DNA from phenotyped mosquitoes has been archived for DENV VC, enabling rapid testing of candidate genes for VC. Future studies should confirm results with additional deng serotypes and genotypes circulating in Mexico and Latin America.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Dna Protein in the Bacterial Replication Cycle: Unveiling the Timing Mechanisms of Initiation**

**Background:** The bacterial replication cycle is driven by the Dna protein, which cycles between its active ATP-bound (ATP-Dna) and inactive ADP-bound (AD-Dna) forms. It has been proposed that Dna is the main controller of initiation frequency, with initiation occurring when sufficient ATP-Dna accumulates. However, the exact mechanisms governing the timing of initiation remain unclear.

**Research Question:** Do cells with a surplus of ATP-Dna initiate replication earlier than wild-type cells?

**Methods:** We performed cell cycle analysis on cells with increased ATP-Dna concentrations to investigate the timing of initiation.

**Findings:** Cells with more than 50% increase in ATP-Dna showed no changes in timing of replication, indicating that ATP-D is not the primary controller of initiation timing.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that ATP-D is the motor driving force behind initiation, but other factors are required for precise timing in response to the cell's environment.

**Conclusions:** We propose that E. coli has a robust replication cycle driven by cycling levels of ATP-Dna and AD-Dna, initiation occurs when sufficient ATP-D is present at the origin, and timing is governed by the cell's environment.

**Role of Dna-dependent Dna inactivation (DA) and Dna-binding protein Dia:** Loss of DA affected the cycle during slow growth, making cells sensitive to Dia protein concentration, indicating compromised machinery performs less robustly.

**Key Findings:**

1. E. coli has a robust replication cycle driven by cycling levels of ATP-Dna and AD-Dna.
2. Initiation occurs when sufficient ATP-D is present at the origin.
3. Timing is governed by the cell's environment.
4. Dna, although key to the cycle, is not the limiting factor for precise timing initiation.

**Discussion:** Several mechanisms ensure initiation does not occur (origin sequestration, inactivation of Dna, inhibition of dna transcription), but little is known about timing initiation. The frequency must match growth, otherwise DNA concentration altered. Our results indicate cells with surplus ATPna, timing controlled same as wild-type, not amount-Dna.

**Title:** Unveiling Causal Interactions in Multivariate Data with Exogenous and Latent Variables in the Frequency Domain using Partial Grangerality

**Research Question:** How can we reliably identify causal relationships in multivariate data with exogenous and latent variables in the frequency domain?

**Methods:** We introduce a novel approach called partial Granger to reveal patterns in multivariate data with exogenous and latent variables in the frequency. This method is extensively tested with toy models and applied to experimental datasets, including (1) microarray data of HeLa cell cycle, (2) in-vivo-electrode array (MEA) local potentials (LFPs) recorded from inferotemporal cortex of sheep, and (3) inivo LFP recorded from distributed sites in right hemisphere of macaque.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that ad hoc definition of causality such as PDC in frequency can be misleading, yielding contradicting results between time domain Granger and frequency Granger. Due to limitation of He microarray data sampling rate (1 hour), we cannot assess dynamical activity at minute scale. Briefly, LFP were collected when monkey performed GO-NOO visual discrimination task. Presence oscillatory potential in beta (14-30 Hz) range reported sensorotor cortex prestim period. Pairwise Granger connectivity depicted in Figure 5, whereas partialanger in time domain Figure 4, and complete relationship Figure 4. Partialanger frequency domain Figure 4.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of considering exogenous and latent variables in causal analysis, as neglecting them can lead to incorrect conclusions. This is particularly relevant in neuroscience, where exogenous inputs and latent variables are common.

**Conclusions:** We introduce partialanger, a novel approach to reveal causal interactions in multivariate data with exogenous and latent in frequency. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness in toy models and experimental datasets, highlighting its potential for applications in neuroscience and other fields where exogenous and latent variables are present.

**Title:** Leveraging Continent-Specific Variants for Accurate Local Ancestry Inference in Admixed Genomes

**Research Question:** Can continent-specific variants (CSVs) be used to improve local ancestry inference in admixed genomes, particularly in the context of disease-risk loci, recombination rates, and missing contigs in the human genome?

**Methods:** We present a novel approach for local ancestry inference that leverages continent-specific variants (CSV) to attain improved performance over existing methods in sequenced admixed genomes. Our approach incorporates admixed genomes jointly with public datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes, to enhance the accuracy of CSV calling. We use simulations to demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to computationally intensive haplotype-based methods with decreased runtime. Furthermore, we show that our method recovers local ancestries comparable to the 100 Genomes consensus ancestry calls in admixed individuals from the 100 Genomes Project. We extend our approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and demonstrate accurate ancestry can be attained at sequencing.

**Findings:** Our results show that the density of CSV is sufficient across the genome to enable fast and accurate local ancestry inference. For example, a study of 15,000 African Americans [50] and another of 30,000 African Americans for recombination [12]. We present improved methods for local inference fully sequenced admixed genomes. Sequencing, unlike genotyping, catalogues larger sets of variants with many being continent-specific (i.e., CSV). We extend the concept of CSV to sub-continental-specific (sCSV) and demonstrate can be used for ancestry assignment admixed from same continent.

**Implications:** The trade between computational runtime and accuracy becomes critical for ancestry inference as sequencing costs decrease and samples increase. Our approach iteratively re-estimates CSV incorporating information from inferred regions in admixed samples. First, we estimate CSV using reference haplotype panels (e.g., 100 Gen), then call ancestry iteratively, re-CSV using confidently called segments sample (see Methods). We term these variants continent-specific (CSV) and model within hidden Markov models local to achieve accurate efficient ancestry (Lanc-CSV). Our accounts errors low-sequencing and finite reference panels used ancestry.

**Conclusions:** Our approach for local ancestry leverages continent-specific variants (CSV) to improve existing methods sequenced admixed genomes. We demonstrate comparable accuracy to computationally intensive haplotype methods with decreased runtime. Our method recovers local ancestries 100 Gen consensus calls admixed  Gen Project. We extend to low-sequencing and show accurate ancestry can attained sequencing. We generalize to sub-continental-specific (CSV and show possible determine sub-ancestry short chromosomal basis CSV.

**Title:** Enhanced Detection of Circadian Oscillations in Gene Expression: A Novel Approach Using Digital Signal Processing and Statistical Analysis

**Research Question:** How can we improve the detection of circadian oscillations in gene expression in biological systems, considering the limitations of small datasets and high noise levels of stochasticity?

**Methods:** We propose a novel approach combining digital signal processing algorithms with statistical tests for periodicity to identify circadian oscillations in almost 100% of expressed genes. This method applies to each group of genes oscillating in the same phase, reducing noise and enhancing the signal by converting single profiles into continuous streams.

**Findings:** Our approach identifies circadian oscillations in almost all genes, suggesting it is a natural feature of nearly all biological pathways. Genes displaying daily variation in expression may not be linked to the circadian molecular clock, but their oscillations affect the system as a whole. However, previous methods only consider one gene profile at a time, lacking power to identify circadian component in more than a small percentage of genes.

**Implications:** Circadian oscillations in gene expression should be evaluated in any study related biological pathways. Changes in expression caused by mutations or environmental factors (e.g., photic stimuli, feeding) should be considered in context of changes in amplitude and phase of oscillations.

**Conclusions:** Our novel approach enhances detection of circadian oscillations in gene expression, overcoming limitations of previous methods. The commonality of oscillation suggests it is an important feature of all biological pathways, affecting elements of the system as a whole. Each perturbation in oscillating system depends on circadian time and wave properties of biological pathways.

**Title:** High-Resolution Mapping of Recombination Events in the Collared Flycatch Reveals Insights into the Avian Recombination Landscape and its Impact on Evolution

**Research Question:** Despite the crucial role of recombination in generating genetic diversity, pinpointing the precise location of crossover and non-crossover events has been challenging, hindering our understanding of the recombination landscape and its impact on evolution.

**Methods:** We employed whole-genome resequencing at high coverage of a three-generation collared flycatch pedigree to localize recombination events with high resolution.

**Findings:** We identified 325 crossovers at a median of 1.4 kb, with 86% localized to <10 kb intervals. Observed rates agreed with linkage data, with 52% higher in males (3.56 cM/M) than females (2.28M), increasing towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossovers were non-randomly distributed, with distinct hotspots and concentration in genic regions, highest in promoters and CpG islands. We found 267 non-crosso, associated with crossover locations, and a significant bias (0.18) favoring GC over AT alleles, indicating GC-bi gene conversion in avian.

**Implications:** Our approach can be applied to any species, providing a comprehensive recombination landscape across groups.

**Conclusions:** High-resolution mapping of recombination in the collared flycatch reveals insights into the avian recombination landscape and its impact on evolution. Recombination is non-random, with hotspots and concentration in genic regions, highest in promoters and CpG. Non-crosso are associated with crosso, with a bias favoring GC over AT alleles, indicating GC-b gene conversion. Our approach can be applied to any species, providing a comprehensive recombination landscape across groups.

**Title:** Unveiling the Folding Landscape of Repeat Proteins: A Quasi-One-Dimensional Description of Elementary Energetics and Foldons

**Research Question:** How can the inherent symmetries in primary and three-dimensional structure of repeat-proteins be used to derive their folding properties, stability, and cooperativity, and denaturation behavior?

**Methods:** We present a formal treatment of the interaction energetics between foldons, collective treated as spin variables, to describe the folding landscape of repeat-prote. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies simple relations for experimental observables: folding-energy (ΔG) and cooperativity of denaturation (m-value), which do not apply to globular proteins. Parameters for the coarse-grained description in terms of foldon variables are extracted from detailed simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes.

**Findings:** We illustrate the ideas with a case-study of tetratic peptide (PR) repeat proteins and quantitatively relate results to experimentally observed transitions. Single point mutations dramatically affect folding behavior, suggesting natural proteins are poised at particular ratios inter- and intra-element energetics, allowing transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, related to biological functions.

**Implications:** The symmetries of repeat-prote suggest overall properties can be derived from microscopic description of energy within each element and interactions with neighbors. Minimal principle implies average interactions can be inferred from topology. Transforming detailed model, an Ising fold-spin description emerges for low energy states, predicting global properties repeatte. Parameters in Is description of TPR energy landscape are extracted from elementary residue interactions.

**Conclusions:** The periodicity of proteins allows general energy description, appreciating biological function. Coarse-graining architecture to linear units interacting locally can be interpreted as global effect on protein, drastic when units are of order correlation length. Comparing results one-dimensional Ising to molecular dynamics on funneled landscapes and experimentally determined mechanisms, parameters follow approximation protein topology.

**Title:** The Role of CHOP in Hepatocellular Carcinogenesis: A Novel Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Liver Cancer Development

**Background:** Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism being major risk factors. However, the extent to which integrated stress response (ISR) and unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways contribute to HCC pathogenesis remains unclear.

**Research Question:** We investigated the role of ISR-regulated transcription factor CHOP in liver cancer development.

**Methods:** We analyzed CH expression in human HCC tumors and mouse models, and generated CH-null mice to assess its impact on carcinogenesis.

**Findings:** CH is upregulated in HCC tumors and mouse models. CH-null mice are resistant to hepatocarcinogenesis, exhibiting reduced apoptosis and cellular proliferation. CH-null mice are also resistant to fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. Global expression profiling revealed reduced basal inflammatory signaling in CH-null livers.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest CH contributes to HCC by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation, implicating CH as a common factor in H development in chronic liver diseases.

**Key Findings:**

* CH expression is associated with tumors and agents causing hepatocyte injury, placing CH upstream of fibrosis activation.
* CH-null mice show suppressed pro-inflammatory expression in the absence of hepatotoxic challenge, consistent with inflammation promoting fib and HCC.
* CH-null mice are partially protected from fib and tumorigenesis, placing CH upstream of both processes.
* A stepwise progression from CH expression to tumors is favored, consistent with H etiology.

**Implications:** Understanding direct and indirect mechanisms by which CH promotes oncogenesis will have implications beyond HCC. Our results reveal an unexpected link between hepatocarcinogenesis and predisposing stimuli, suggesting points for therapeutic intervention. CH expression characterizes H tumors and impacts inflammatory expression and fib relevant to H.

**Future Directions:**

* Investigate how CH is induced by stimuli and promotes oncogenesis
* Identify direct and indirect targets of CH
* Develop therapeutic strategies targeting CH for H

**Title:** Systematic Review of Treatment Outcomes for Cutaneous Leishmanias Caused by Leishmania aethopica in Ethiopia: Identifying Potentially Efficacious Medications for Clinical Trials

**Research Question:** Despite the substantial burden of cutaneous leishmanias (CL) caused by Leishmaniaethopica in Ethiopia, evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking. This systematic review aimed to identify potentially efficacious medications for clinical trials to treat CL due to Lethopica.

**Methods:** We conducted a systematic review of clinical studies reporting treatment outcomes of CL due to Lethica, identifying 24 records on 506 episodes of CL. The most used drugs were antimonials (n=201), pentam (n=150), and cryotherapy (n=103). We evaluated study quality and identified two small, poor-quality randomized trials and two non-randomized studies on cryotherapy, antimonials, and pentam.

**Findings:** Cryotherapy cure rates were 60-80% and 69-85 with antimonials. Pentam appeared effective against complicated CL, non-responsive to antimonials. However, all studies suffered methodological limitations. Data on milfosine, paromycin, and liposomal amphotin B are scarce. Only few studies on DCL. Potentially effective options for D seem antimonials with paromycin or pentam, but none evaluated.

**Implications:** The evidence for treatment of CL due Lethop is extremely limited. Antimonials remain the most available treatment in Ethiopia, but efficacy and safety in CL should be defined. Alternative first-line treatments, such as miline or parycin, should be explored. High-quality trials on Leth are urgently needed to evaluate options in parallel.

**Conclusion:** The evidence for treatment of CL due Leth is extremely limited, warranting prospective studies. While antimonials remain the cornerstone, their efficacy and safety in CL should be defined. Most importantly, alternative treatments should be explored, preferably topically or orally.

**Title:** Reconstitution of a Biochemical Oscillator with Purified Proteins Displays Circadian Rhythms and Temperature Compensation

**Research Question:** Can a biochemical oscillator be reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins that displays salient properties of circadian rhythms, including self-sustained 24-hour periodicity and temperature compensation?

**Methods:** We analyzed the biochemical basis of the oscillator by quantifying time-dependent interactions of three proteins (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC) using electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis to elucidate the timing of formation of complexes among the proteins. Data were used to derive a dynamic model for in vitro that accurately reproduces rhythms of KaiABC and KaiC phosphorylation and is consistent with biophysical observations of individual protein interactions. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to confirm monomer exchange among Kai hexers.

**Findings:** Our results show that a mixture of macromolecular assemblies formed by three proteins are present at each phase of in vitro oscillation, with rhythmic patterns of Kai phosphorylation accompanied by association among KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. EM and BN-PAGE analyses indicate not a single species of complex present each phase. We conclude that Kai, Kai, and Kai form complexes whose composition oscillates over circadian cycle. Gel filtration of aliquots from in vitro oscillator indicate that function of monomer exchange may maintain synchrony among Kai hexers, sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. FRET confirms monomer exchange among hexers.

**Implications:** This study provides unprecedented molecular-level analysis of circadian clock, demonstrating that biochemical oscillator can be reconstit in vitro with purified proteins displaying circadian rhythms and temperature compensation. Our model accurately reproduces rhythms of Kai complexes and phosphorylation and is consistent with biophysical observations individual protein interactions. Monomer exchange among hexers may maintain synchrony, sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. Perturbation of in vitro oscillator by temperature pulses resets phase, demonstrating unique circadian can be reset by stimuli known entrain circadian clocks.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates biochemical oscillator can be reconst in vitro with purified proteins displaying circadian rhythms and temperature compensation. Our model accurately reproduces rhythms and is consistent with biophysical observations. Monomer exchange among hexers may maintain synchrony, sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. Circadian can be reset by stimuli known entrain circadian, providing new insights into circadian mechanisms.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Trial-to-Trial Variability in Brain Activity and Behavioral Performance: An Electrocorticography Evidence for an Inverted-U Relationship

**Research Question:** Does trial-to-trial variability in brain activity correlate with behavioral performance, and if so, what is the nature of this relationship?

**Methods:** We employed electrocorticography (EG) in patients undergoing neurosurgical monitoring to investigate the relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in broadband EG activity and behavioral performance in a visual detection task.

**Findings:** We found an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial EG activity and performance, where higher variability in EG activity was associated with faster reaction times and higher hit rates. This relationship was observed not only in post-stimulus-evoked activity but also in pre-stimulus spontaneous activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics. Our results are consistent with the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and support attractor network theories, which propose that brain settles into a confined state under performance, proximity to which is associated with better performance.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that variability can be decoupled from trial-aver activity, both in stimulus modulation and correlation with behavior, predicting a U or inverted relationship between trial-trial brain activity and performance. Theoretically, the existence of both monotonic and inverted relationships between trial-trial activity and performance accords with consideration of two sources of brain variability: deterministic and stochastic. Deterministic variability arises from spontaneous activity related to brain functioning that varies from trial to trial, while stochastic noise imposes an inverted relationship between trial-trial activity and performance.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for an inverted relationship between trial-trial brain activity and performance using EG, supporting the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and attractor network theories. Our findings have implications for understanding brain function and performance, suggesting that variability can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the context.

**Title:** Evolutionary Analysis of Mating Type Loci in Trichporales: Implications for the Origin of Fused MAT Regions in Basidiomycetes

**Research Question:** This study investigates the mating type (MAT) loci in 24 species of Trichporales, a sister order to Tremales, to understand the evolution of fused MAT regions in basidiomycetes.

**Methods:** We analyzed the MAT loci from 24 species of Trichporales and compared them to those of pathogenic Cryptocci and other basidiyc lineages.

**Findings:** The MAT loci in Trichporales are fused, with a single homeodomain transcription gene (HD) and pherone pher gene (P) present in each mating type, similar to pathogenic Cryptoc. However, HD and P allele combinations differ between Trichporales and pathogenic Cryptoc. The existence of tetrap species in Tremales suggests fusion of HD and P loci occurred independently in Trichporales and pathogenicoc, supporting convergent evolution towards fused regions.

**Implications:** Our results support the hypothesis of convergent evolution of fused MAT regions in basidiyc, similar to previous findings in other groups. Unlike fused loc in other basyc lineages, gene content and order within MAT loc are conserved in Trichporales, with no suppression of recombination extending to adjacent chromosomal regions. This suggests different mechanisms for evolution linked loc in these groups.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the evolution of MAT loc in Trichporales and implications for the origin of fused regions in basyc. Our findings support convergent evolution of fused regions in basyc and highlight unique mechanisms underlying evolution linked loc in Trichpor. Further research is needed to understand the evolution of MAT in basyc and its implications for mating compatibility.

**Title:** Mathematical Modeling and Experimental Evaluation of Control Strategies for Non-Domic Vectors of Chagas Disease in the Yuc Peninsula, Mexico

**Research Question:** Can a mathematical model predict the temporal variations in abundance of nonomic vectors of Chagas disease in the Yuc peninsula, Mexico, and evaluate the efficacy of control strategies such as insecticide spraying, screens, and bed nets?

**Methods:** A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of nonomic vectors in the absence of control. Demographic parameters were estimated by fitting the model to two years of field data from the Yuc peninsula, Mexico. The predictive value of the model was tested on independent data. Simulations examined the efficacy of control strategies based on insecticide, screens, and bed nets.

**Findings:** The model accurately predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide. Pyrethroid spraying was effective when 50 mg/m were applied yearly within a two-month matching the immigration season. >80% reduction in abundance was achieved by larger doses or more frequent interventions, but drastically decreased for different timing and lower frequencies. Insect screens reduced abundance proportionally to the reduction of immigration.

**Implications:** Control of nonomic vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide, requiring yearly application and understanding of temporal pattern. Insect screens offer an effective and sustainable alternative, part of multi-disease interventions for integrated control of vector-borne diseases.

**Conclusion:** Insect spraying has short-lived effect on infestation in recurring immigrating peridestic and sylvatic bugs, observed in previous field study on T dimata control in Yuc peninsula. Our modeling shows control nonomic can hardly be achieved by insect, but screens offer effective alternative. Insect as low 10/m sprayed beginning infestation reduced population by 50% year. Single spraying did not achieve sustainable control, evaluated repeated and optimal frequency application. It is key to improve efficacy current strategies cope re infestation nonomic and investigate alternative screens or bednets. This can be achieved empirical trials, but costly limited number strategies and follow-up time.

**Title:** Deciphering the Mechanisms of Avian Feather Patterning: A Reaction-Diffusionaxis System and Mechanical Integration

**Research Question:** How do avian feathers develop their precise patterning during embryonic development, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms driving this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the patterning of feathers in avian skin, focusing on the role of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and boneogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, mesenchymal cell movement, and reaction-diffaxis system. We analyzed the expression of key genes, including FGF20, Ectodysasin (E), and EDAR, in chicken, duck, ostrich, and emu embryos.

**Findings:** Our results show that the patterning of feathers relies on a reaction-diffaxis system, integrating mechanical and chemical processes. FGF20 induces cell aggregation, compressing the epidermis to intensify F20 expression, creating a positive feedback loop. Ectysasin (E) initiates F20 expression, spreading across a mesenchym cell gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold for mesym cells to form a feather bud. In flighted birds, the EDAR pathway imposes a quasi-1 dimensional, highly ordered pattern. In contrast, the flightless emu and ostrich have different developmental routes, with the ostr laying down primordia without a wave, akin to mammalian hair follicle formation.

**Implications:** This work demonstrates that a reaction-diffaxis system, integrated with mechanical processes, generates the feather array in flighted birds. The high-density dependence of feather development likely rests on rapid mesym cell condensation and stabilizing F20 expression rather than distinct cell phenotypes. The skin of chicken, duck, ostr, and em embryos exhibit pronounced differences in feather arrangements, with F20 elevated in contracted tissue, supporting aggregation's role in activating F20 production.

**Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the operation of an integrated reaction-diff system in feather patterning, alongside molecular regulators of development, including BMP, WNT, and FGF. The initiation of feather formation begins with dermal mesym cell condensation beneath epidermal placode, forming a primord, which grows into a filament, branches, and produces a feather. This study provides insights into avian pattering mechanisms, essential for understanding developmental biology and potential applications in biotechnology.

**Title:** Systematic Review of Filovirus Presence in Body Fluids of Infected Individuals and Survivors: Implications for Transmission Risk Assessment

**Research Question:** What is the likelihood of filovirus presence in human body fluids of infected individuals and survivors, and what are the implications for transmission risk assessment?

**Methods:** A systematic review of published evidence on filirus presence in body fluids of infected individuals and survivors was conducted. Scientific articles were screened for information on filirus in human fluids. Eligible infections were Marburg (MARV or RAV) and Zaire, Sudan, Ta Forest, and Bundibyo species of Ebola, confirmed by laboratory (tissue culture or RT-PCR) or clinical history with subsequent filirus antibodies or inflammatory factors. Data were extracted and summarized narratively.

**Findings:** 683 unique articles were found, and 33 were eligible. Most fluid types had insufficient patients to draw conclusions, and positivity prevalence was highly variable. Body fluids >16 days after onset were usually negative. Six studies using RT-PCR gave positive results 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filirus was reported in most fluid types, but not every sample from confirmed patient. Apart from semen, non-blood RT-PCR samples likely negative and possibly low risk.

**Implications:** Contact with blood and blood-stained fluids remains major transmission risk due to high viral loads in blood.

**Conclusion:** This systematic review provides evidence on filirus presence in body fluids of infected individuals and survivors, highlighting variability in positivity and implications for transmission risk assessment. Filirus was detected in most fluid types, but not every sample from confirmed patient. Non-blood RTPCR samples likely negative and possibly low risk. Contact with blood and blood-stained fluids remains major transmission risk due to high viral loads in blood.

**Title:** Fractional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model: Capturing Power-Law Dynamics and Long-Range Correlations in Neuronal Activity

**Research Question:** Can a fractional derivative-based model capture the power-law behavior and long-range correlations in neuronal activity that arise from membrane conductance processes, which cannot be characterized by a single time constant?

**Methods:** We developed a fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model, where the exponent of the derivative varies from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the normal derivative. We analyzed the model's ability to reproduce experimentally observed spike adaptations in neocortical pyramidal and tectal neurons in vitro.

**Findings:** Our model reproduces upward and downward spike adaptations with varying the fractional exponent, and produces spikes with longer first-spike latency and interpike variability with power-law distribution. We also analyzed the model's response to noisy and oscillatory input, generating reliable spike patterns in response to noisy input. The spiking activity of the fractional model deviates from the Markov model, reflecting temporal intrinsic membrane dynamics affecting response to external stimulation.

**Implications:** The fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model provides a unified framework for describing power-law dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity, capturing relationships between conductance distributions complicated by explicit techniques. The model's voltage trace represents spike-triggered mechanisms causing adaptation. The emergent non-Markian process can be modeled with a fractional derivative, a non-local process where the variable's value is determined by integrating a weighted temporal trace, or memory.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest that the order of the fractional should be low to reproduce spike adaptation observed experimentally. The model's continuous dependence on power dynamics causes non-linear effects. The fractional model simplifies complicated details shown in other models, exhibiting adaptation with power-law by integrating past values without additional currents. Power functions generalize exponential processes, better describing scale-invariant adaptation. The model provides a general framework for understanding power-law dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity.

**Title:** Antioxidant Defense Mechanisms in Paracidioides: Unveiling the Role of Superoxide Dismutases in Host-Pathogen Interaction

**Research Question:** How does Paracoides defend against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host effector cells, and what is the role of superoxide dismutases (SODs) in this process?

**Methods:** We identified six SOD isoforms encoded in the Paroid genome and analyzed gene expression levels of representative isolates from three phylogenetic lineages (PS, PS, PS, and Pb01) using quantitative RT-PCR. We examined SOD expression in yeast, mycelia, mycel-to-yeast transition, and yeast-to-myc germination, as well as under oxidative stress and phagocytic cell interaction.

**Findings:** PbOD1 and Pb3 expression increased during transition, oxidative stress, and phagoc cell interaction, suggesting these proteins combat superoxide radicals during host-pathogen interaction. Pb1 and Pb3 knockdown strains showed involvement in oxidative stress response and mouse infection model. Protein analysis and knockdown suggested Pb3 linked to extracellular activity, Pb1 to intracellular.

**Implications:** Paroid responds to endogenously generated radicals and counteracts oxidative burst by inducing S isoforms.

**Conclusions:** Our data suggest Paroid actively responds to radicals and counter oxidative burst by inducing S isoforms, highlighting the importance of antioxidant defense mechanisms in host-pathogen interaction.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mystery of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins: Exploring the Relationship between Disorder and Chaper Binding

**Research Question:** How do intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) interact with chaper proteins in the cell, and what is the functional significance of this interaction?

**Methods:** We analyzed high-throughput interaction data from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazo species to investigate the correlation between predicted disorder and chaper binding.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, predicted disorder by the IUP algorithm showed a negative correlation with chaper binding, indicating that IDPs tend to avoid chaper in the cell. This effect was observed in all three taxonomic groups, including prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and metazoa. The presence of ordered domains, such as Pfam, may contribute to this phenomenon. Furthermore, chaper binding to IDPs is often accompanied by binding to other proteins, suggesting that ID use chaper for assembly with partners rather than folding.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that chaper binding is primarily required for globular protein folding, as evidenced by the preference for chones with at least one Pf domain. Moreover, ID that bind chaper tend to bind other proteins, indicating that chaper assistance is not for folding but for association.

**Conclusions:**

1. IDPs tend to avoid chaper in the cell, contrary to expectations of enhanced protection against proteolysis.
2. Chaper binding is primarily for globular protein folding, not ID.
3. ID that bind chaper tend to bind other proteins, indicating assembly assistance rather than folding.
4. The presence of ordered domains, such as Pf, may contribute to chaper avoidance.
5. Chaper binding to ID is often accompanied by binding to other proteins.

**Future Directions:**

* Investigate the role of ordered domains in chaper binding
* Examine the functional consequences of chaper binding on ID assembly
* Elucidate the mechanisms of ID-chaper interaction

**Key Takeaways:**

* ID and chaper interaction is complex and multifaceted
* Chaper binding is not a protective mechanism for ID
* ID use chaper for assembly, not folding
* Ordered domains influence ch binding

**Title:** Decapentaplegic (Dpp) Signaling Pathway Regulates Zn-finger Transcription Factors Salm and Salr in the Drosophila Wing Imaginal Disc: Implications for Cell Survival, Proliferation, and Vein Patterning

**Research Question:** How do the Zninger transcription factors Salm and Salr, regulated by the Decapaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway, contribute to cell survival, proliferation, and patterning in the Drosila wing imaginal disc?

**Methods:** We used microarray experiments to compare the expression profiles of sal/sr knockdown wing discs with control discs, and in situ hybridization to study the expression of genes whose mRNA levels varied significantly, uncovering a complex transcription landscape regulated by Sp proteins in the disc.

**Findings:** We identified candidate Salm/Sr target genes, including those whose expression is turned off and on by Salm/Sr, and loss-of-function analysis indicates a fraction of them are required for wing growth and patterning. Our results reveal an unsuspected transcriptional complexity downstream of Sp, involving both activation and repression of gene expression.

**Implications:** The identification of Salm/Sr target genes is crucial to understanding the genetic hierarchy of Dpp signaling in the wing disc. Our findings open a new avenue to reconstruct the genetic structure of the wing, linking Dpp activity to epithelial tissue development.

**Conclusions:** The Dpp signaling pathway regulates Salm and Sal transcription factors in the wing imaginal disc, crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and patterning. Our study reveals a complex transcriptional landscape regulated by Sp, involving both activation and repression of gene expression. This work reconstructs the genetic cascade initiated by D signaling through Sp, controlling growth and patterning of the central wing disc.

**Title:** Regulation of Centri Duplication in C. elegans: Identification of PP1 as a Key Regulator of ZYG-1 Levels and Implications for Tumorigenesis and Microcephaly

**Research Question:** How is centri duplication regulated in C. elegans, and what are the implications for tumorigenesis and microcephaly?

**Methods:** We investigated the regulation of centri duplication in C. elegans using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We identified two PP orthologs, G-1 and G-2, and their regulators I-2 and SDS-22, as key regulators of Z-1 levels. We found that downregulation of PP activity either directly or mutation of- or SDS-22 rescues loss of centri duplication associated with a- hypomorphic allele.

**Findings:** Our data indicate that PP inhibits centri duplication by restraining accumulation of Z- in the embryo either directly or indirectly. We show that PP regulates Z- through post-translational mechanism. Moderate inhibition of PP activity restores centri duplication in- mutant, but strong inhibition in wild-type leads to centri amplification via production of more than one centri.

**Implications:** Our results define a new pathway limiting number of daughter centri produced each cycle. PP is a critical regulator of centri in C. elegans, and its dysregulation may contribute to tumenesis and microaly in humans. Our data suggest that PP may be a target for therapeutic intervention in these diseases.

**Conclusions:** We have identified PP as a key regulator of Z- levels in C. elegans and centri duplication. Our results indicate that PP inhibits centri by restraining accumulation of Z either directly or indirectly. We show that PP regulates Z through postl mechanism. Our findings have implications for tumenesis and microaly in humans and suggest PP as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

**Title:** Sylvatic Leishmaniasis Transmission in an Urban Setting: A Study of Leishmania spp. Infection in Domestic Dogs, Wild Mammals, and Sand Flies in the Municipality of Campinas, Brazil

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the role of wildlife in the transmission of visceral leishmanias (VL) in an urban setting, specifically in the municipality of Campinas, Brazil, where the disease was first reported in 2009 in a dog living in an upscale condominium within an environmentally protected area (EPA).

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted using molecular and serological techniques to investigate Leish spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies.

**Findings:** Canine seroprevalence of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six species, confirmed or suspected vectors or transmitters of Leish, were identified, including the main L. (L) infant vector in Brazil, Lutzia longipal, captured in the EPA. Natural infection by L. (L) infant was recorded in Expill firm and Pintia montola. Infection by L. (L) infant and Leish subgenus Viia was detected in white-eared opossum (Didel albivent), a known reservoir of VL.

**Implications:** Geographical coordinates of each infected animals were plotted on a map of EPA, demonstrating proximity between animals, human residences, including dogs positive VL, and forest areas. The EPA, inhabited by humans, has an active focus of disease. The risk of establishing and maintaining transmission foci in similar scenarios, i.e., wild areas undergoing modifications, is evident. Different epidemiological profiles of VL must be included in prevention and control measures considering particularities of each area.

**Conclusion:** This study provides evidence of sylvatic Leish transmission in an urban setting, highlighting the importance of considering wildlife in VL prevention and control measures, particularly in areas with environmental modifications.

**Title:** Epstein-Barr Virus-Encoded MicroRNA miR-B9 Promotes Migration and Invasion of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells by Targeting E-cadherin

**Research Question:** What is the role of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded microRNA miR9 (miR-B9) in the migration and invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells?

**Methods:** We employed gain- and loss-of-function approaches to investigate the effect of mi-B9 in EB-negative and EB-positive NPC cells. We used computational analysis to identify potential targets of mi-B9 and biochemical assays to confirm the interaction between mi9 and its target.

**Findings:** mi-B9 promotes the migration and invasion of NPC cells in vitro and enhances metastatic ability in vivo. Computational analysis revealed that mi9 targets E-cadher, a protein crucial for cell-cell junctions and epithelial phenotype. Biochemical assays and functional analysis confirmed that mi9 inhibits Eadher to induce mesenchymal phenotype and promote migration of NPC cells.

**Implications:** High levels of mi9 in EB-positive NPC may contribute to the aggressiveness of tumor. The abundance of mi9, coupled with down-regulation of cellular mi-200 members, drives epithelial cells to adopt mesenchymal phenotype with enhanced motility and contributes to highly metastatic behavior of NPC.

**Conclusions:** mi9 is a promastatic viral miRNA that targets Ead to induce mesenchal phenotype and promote migration of NPC cells. High levels of mi in EB-positive NPC may contribute to the aggressiveness of tumor.

**Title:** gashimi: A Novel Command-Line Tool for Visualizing Splicing Events Across Multiple Samples

**Research Question:** How can a novel command-line tool, gimi, improve the visualization of splicing events across multiple samples, addressing limitations of existing programs generating sash plots?

**Methods:** We developed gimi, a command-line tool that generates sash plots for individual RNA-seq experiments and aggregated plots for groups of experiments. Unlike existing tools, gimi uses bioinformatics file formats, is annotation-independent, and visualizes splicing events for large genomic regions by scaling down genomic segments between splice sites. gimi is implemented in Python and generates R code for plotting.

**Findings:** We compared gimi with sash-plot built-in within Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) for visualizing a genomic region containing a splicing event. gimi's aggregation of samples from the same group and shrinkage of intron lengths enhanced visualization of the event. gimi eliminated the need for specialized formats and supported views for hundreds of samples.

**Implications:** gimi addresses limitations of current sash plot implementations, including annotation dependence and visualization of distant splicing events. gimi's flexibility and scalability make it a valuable tool for exploratory analysis of RNA-seq data.

**Conclusions:** gimi offers a novel approach to splicing visualization, addressing current challenges of existing tools. gimi is freely available at https://github.com/gig/gimi.

**Title:** Evolutionary Modeling of Cis-Regulatory Modules: A Probabilistic Framework for Cross-Species Alignment and Prediction

**Research Question:** How can we develop a comprehensive model of cis-regulatory module (CRM) evolution that captures the complexities of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and background sequences, addressing the limitations of existing sequence evolution models and alignment methods?

**Methods:** We propose a novel probabilistic model of CRM evolution, incorporating TFBS gains and losses, a crucial aspect of regulatory sequence evolution, and develop a computational framework to solve CRM alignment and prediction problems. Our method leverages conserved binding sites to improve alignment, unlike existing statistical methods, and treats uncertainties of binding annotations and alignment in a probabilistic framework.

**Findings:** We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated and real data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in alignment and CRM prediction. Furthermore, we apply our alignments to study genome-wide binding data of transcription factors in Drosophila blastod, revealing intriguing insights: (i) factor-bound sequences are under evolutionary constraints despite neighboring gene expression, and (ii) distal binding sites tend to be more conserved than proximal regions.

**Implications:** Our approach, implemented as software EM (Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module) Analysis, offers a powerful tool for broad biological applications. Unlike existing models, our method integrates TFBS evolution with insertions/deletions, essential for simultaneous alignment and regulatory inference, and extends statistical alignment to cis-regulatory analysis.

**Conclusions:** Our probabilistic model of CRM evolution addresses limitations of sequence evolution and alignment, providing a comprehensive framework for bioinformatic tasks. By treating TFBS and alignment as random variables, our method minimizes uncertain annotations' impact. This integrative approach enables cross-species analysis of cis-reg sequences, shedding light on regulatory mechanisms and evolution.

**Title:** Deciphering the Functions of the Drosophila piRNA Pathway in Genome Integrity and Development

**Research Question:** How does the Drosoph piRNA pathway contribute to genome integrity during embryonic development, particularly in the context of transposon mobilization and telomere protection?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of the Doph piRNA pathway in embryonic development. We generated mutations in the piRNA genes armi, aub, ago3, and rhi and analyzed their effects on genome integrity during cleavage stage embryonic divisions. Additionally, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to examine telomere binding of HOAP, a component of the telomere protection complex, and expression of telom-specific piRNAs.

**Findings:** Our results show that mutations in aub and arm lead to extensive fragmentation of the zyg genome during cleavage stage embryonic divisions and defects in telere resolution during meiosis and cle divisions. In contrast, lig-IV mutations, which disrupt non-homous end joining, suppress fusions, whereas lig-IV mutations enhance fragmentation. Chromatinoprecipitation studies reveal that a and arm mutations disrupt telom binding of HOAP and reduce expression of a subpopulation 19-22 telom-specific piRN. In contrast, mutations rhi and ago do not block HO binding or production of these piRN.

**Implications:** Our findings uncover genetically separable functions for the Doph pi pathway. The a, arm, r, and ago genes silence transons and maintain chromosome integrity during cle-stage embryonic divisions, while a and arm have an additional function in assembly of the telere protection complex. We propose that a and arm are required for telere recruitment, consistent with ligation of chromosome in mutant embryos. Moreover, our studies reveal a novel function for a subset of pi genes in assembly of the telere complex, mediated by a subpopulation 19-22 piRN.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the role of the Doph pi pathway in genome integrity and development. Our findings suggest that a and arm have a function in telere protection not shared by ago or r, and that this process is directed by a class of short RNAs that bind Piwi. Additionally, we show that assembly of the telere complex is independent of telere transon copy number. These results highlight the complexity of the pi pathway and its multiple functions in genome integrity and development.

**Title:** Discovery of a Novel Ebolavirus Species, Bundibyoebolavirus, Associated with a Large Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in Uganda: Implications for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Strategies

**Research Question:** What is the identity of the causative agent responsible for a recent hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Bundibyo District, Western Uganda, and what are the implications for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies?

**Methods:** Laboratory investigation of 29 suspect blood specimens using classic antigen capture, IgM and IgG ELISA, and a newly developed random-primed pyrosequencing approach identified an Ebola virus associated with a newly discovered species, Bundibyoebolavirus, distantly related to Côte'Ivoebolavirus in Western Africa.

**Findings:** The newly isolated virus, Bundibyoebolavirus, is most closely related to Côtevoebolavirus, despite a large geographic distance between the two countries of origin. Evidence of Ebola infection was detected in eight specimens using a broadly reactive Ebola antigen capture assay and IgM assay. The outbreak was reported to the Ugandan Ministry of Health on November 28, 2007. The extent of divergence suggests significant antigenic and pathogenic differences among viruses. Current prototype Ebola vaccines include Zaire and Sudan viruses. Cross-protection studies are needed to assess whether vaccine designs need to incorporate Bundibyoebavirus.

**Implications:** The unique nature of this virus has implications for screening of antivirals and pathogenic studies. Retrospective analysis of case, epidemiologic, and laboratory data from the Bundyo outbreak indicates a lower fatality rate (∼36%) compared to Zaire (∼80-90%) and Sudan (∼50-55%). Studies in non-human primates are needed to compare pathogenicity. Antigen-capture, Ig, IgG, and real-time PCR assays were transferred to the Uganda Research Institute during the outbreak for rapid identification of cases and efficient control. The outbreak continued through December, 2007, resulting in 149 cases and 37 deaths.

**Conclusion:** The discovery of Bundyoebavirus highlights the need for ongoing surveillance and development of diagnostic assays to monitor Ebola disease in humans and animals, as well as efforts to develop effective antivir and vaccines. The divergence of this virus from previously recognized ebaviruses underscores the importance of cross-protection studies to assess vaccine efficacy.

**Title:** Quantifying Heterogeneity in the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease: A Longitudinal Analysis of Global Deteration Scale and Functional Staging Stages

**Research Question:** What is the extent of heterogeneity in the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) among patients, and how do the durations of Global Deter Scale (GDS) and Functional Staging (FAST) stages vary among patients at each stage of AD?

**Methods:** We analyzed a cohort of 648 AD patients with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years, reconstructing DS/FAST stages 4-6 using statistical analysis. Calculations revealed that standard deviations for DS/FAST stages 4-6 durations were comparable to their mean values, indicating large variations in AD progression among patients.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate significant heterogeneity in the course of AD progression, consistent with the existence of subgroups of patients differing in patterns of decline. Calculated standard deviations for DSFAST stages 4-6 were similar to their mean durations, indicating variability in cognitive and functional decline among patients.

**Implications:** This study provides a quantitative measure of AD progression rates and variances among patients, essential for evaluating clinical study results. Our findings support the notion that AD is a heterogeneous disease, with multiple factors contributing to variability in progression.

**Conclusions:** Our analysis of a large longitudinal dataset reveals significant variation in DS/FAST 4-6 durations, with standard deviations comparable to mean values. This indicates variability in cognitive and functional decline among patients, supporting the existence of subgroups with distinct patterns of AD progression. This study contributes to understanding the complex nature of AD, highlighting the need for personalized approaches to diagnosis and treatment.

**Title:** Enhancing Hippocampal Memory through Additive Neurogenesis: A Comparative Analysis of Adaptation Strategies in Spatially Structured Input Patterns

**Research Question:** How does additive neurogenesis compare to conventional synaptic plasticity and neuronal turnover in encoding and decoding memory patterns with realistic spatially structured input in the entorinal cortex?

**Methods:** We extended our earlier model of hippocampal memory network to include realistic spatially driven firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorinal cortex. We compared network performance across three adaptation strategies: synaptic plasticity (fixed network size, plastic connectivity), neuronal (fixed size, units may die and be replaced), and additivegenesis (starts with fewer units, grows over time).

**Findings:** Additive neurogenesis outperformed conventional plasticity and turnover in encoding and decoding spatially structured patterns. A biologically plausible neurogenesis incorporating cell death and plasticity of granule cells outperformed individual strategies. This rule can be tailored for short or long-term memory. We examined adult neurogenesis over lifetime under different rearing conditions, revealing distinct profiles that can be tested experimentally.

**Implications:** Our model provides a starting point for comparative analysis of neurogenesis across species. Theoretical arguments support additive neurogenesis in dentate gyrus, enabling adaptation not possible with plasticity or turnover. Multidimensional input distributions modeled EC input patterns. Sophisticated neurogenesis incorporating death and plasticity outperformed individual strategies.

**Conclusions:** Additive neurogenesis is a superior adaptation strategy for encoding and decoding spatially structured patterns in the entor cortex. A biologically plausible neurogenesis incorporating cell death and plasticity outperforms individual strategies. This rule can be tailored for short or long-term memory. Our model provides a starting point for comparative analysis of neurogenesis across species. Theoretical arguments support neurogenesis in dentate gyrus, enabling adaptation not possible with plasticity or turnover. Multidimensional input modeled EC patterns. Sophistic neuro incorporating death and plastic outperforms individual.

**Title:** Lysosomes, not Mitochondria, are the Primary Site of Oxidative Damage in African Trypanosomes: A Role of Cytosolic Peroxidases in Protecting the Lysosome from Iron-Induced Peroxidation

**Research Question:** What is the primary site of oxidative damage in African trypanosomes and the role of cytosolic peroxidases in protecting the lysosome from iron-induced peroxidation?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of lysosomes and mitochondria in oxidative damage in African trypanosomes using a combination of biochemical, microscopic, and immunofluorescence techniques. We generated trypanosomes lacking the cytosolic peroxidase II (Px II) and fed them with Alexa-conjugated dextran or LysoTracker in the presence of Trolox, an α-tocopher derivative. We observed discrete lysosomal staining, which disappeared upon withdrawal of Trolox. We also supplemented the medium with iron or transferrin, an iron chelator, and apo-transferrin to assess the role of iron acquisition. Immunofluorescence microscopy with MitoTracker and antibodies against lysosomal protein p67 revealed disintegration of lysosomes precedes mitochondrial damage.

**Findings:** Our data demonstrate that lysosomes, not mitochondria, are the primary site of oxidative damage in African trypanosomes. Cytosolic peroxidases protect the lysosome from iron-induced peroxidation, a process linked to high endocytic and iron acquisition mechanisms of the infective stage T. brucei. Knockout of cytos Px II in procyclic form resulted in viable cells in Tro-free medium.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel function of cytos peroxidases in protecting the lysosome from oxidative damage, the first reported in any organism. Our data suggest that mitochondrial peroxid may contribute to parasite defense against exogenous oxidative stress. Lysosomes are oxidizing rather than reducing compartments, requiring effective antioxidant systems, which enter the parasite via endytic pathway.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of lysosomes in oxidative damage in African trypan and the role of cytos peroxidases in protecting the lysosome from iron-induced peroxidation. Understanding this mechanism is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies against trypanosomiasis.

**Title:** Essential Role of PMEL in Melanosome Morphology and Melanin Deposition in Mice

**Research Question:** What is the role of PMEL in melanosome morphology and melanin deposition in mice?

**Methods:** We generated a mouse line with the Pmel gene inactivated (Pmel−/−) to investigate the function of PM in melanocytes.

**Findings:** Pmel−/− mice are viable, fertile, and display no developmental defects. Melanosomes in P−/− melanocytes are spherical, in contrast to the elongated shape in wild-type. Inactivation of Pmel has a mild effect on coat color in four genetic backgrounds, with the clearest effect in mice carrying the brown/Tp1 mutation. This phenotype is similar to that observed with the silver mutation in mice, suggesting that previously described alleles in vertebrates with striking effects on pigmentation are dominant-negative. Despite mild effect on pigmentation, inactivation of P led to substantial reduction in melanin in hair, demonstrating PMEL's critical role in maintaining epidermal pigmentation.

**Implications:** PM is essential for normal melanosome development in melanin-producing melanocytes in skin, eye, but not for survival of pigment cells in several tissues. Amyloid fibrils formed by proteolytic fragments PM play a role in generating characteristic melanosome shape, while P knockout has mild effect on pigmentation.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates PM's role in melanosome morphology and melanin deposition in mice. The phenotype of P knockout mice is similar to the silver phenotype described in mice, caused by premature stop codon truncating last 25 amino acid of PM. Surprisingly, graying decreased with age in out mice, opposed to progressive graying in black. Mutations in P homologs causing pigmentation phenotypes in species have been identified, yet only one P mutation in mice. This suggests either PM has unknown functions and inactivating are embryonically lethal, or loss-function at P locus has mild effects on pigmentation not detected in mutagenesis.

**Title:** Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Environmental Methods for Dengue Vector Control: Effectiveness and Implications

**Research Question:** What is the effectiveness of environmental methods for dengue control in reducing larval and pupal populations of Aedes sp mosquitoes?

**Methods:** A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed, EASE, LACS, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases. Quality assessment was done using CONSORT 2010 checklist. Nineteen studies were eligible, with sixteen contributing to meta-analysis. Methods evaluated: (a) container covers with insecticides, (b) waste management, and (c) elimination of breeding sites.

**Findings:** Quality was highest for container with insecticides, followed by waste management and elimination. Systematic and meta-analysis showed weak effect on larval populations with no differences between results. Meta-analysis showed container without insecticides (BI: -7.9, DOE-5) and waste with garbage (BI: -8.83, DOE-6.2) achieved strongest reductions for BI, whereas P results were opposite with covers (P: -0.83, 0.09) and elimination (P: -0.95, -0.83).

**Implications:** Each environmental method showed effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities Aedes mosquitoes. However, high-quality studies are needed to strengthen evidence.

**Conclusions:** Systematic review and meta-analysis of environmental deng vector control methods showed effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal populations Aedes mosquitoes. Container with insecticides, waste management, and elimination of breeding sites were effective. However, high-quality studies are needed to strengthen evidence.

**Title:** Identifying Small Molecules that Inhibit Protein Synthesis by Stalling the Ribosome: A New Strategy for Therapeutic Development

**Research Question:** How do small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by stalling the ribosome affect cell physiology and ribosome control pathways?

**Methods:** We used a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of a PCSK9 translational inhibitor, PF-06303 (PF3).

**Findings:** The most potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF3 were the ubiquitin-binding protein ASC2 and helicase ASC3, which bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. Surprisingly, translation control proteins Pelota (PELO) and H1 sensitize cells to PF3 treatment. Genetic experiments showed that ASC3 acts together with ASC2 and functions downstream of H1.

**Implications:** These results identify new connections between ribosome control pathways and provide insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall translation, aiding the development of next-generation stalling compounds to treat disease.

**Conclusions:** Small molecules that inhibit PCS9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been identified to reduce LDL in clinical models and affect translation of a few off-target proteins. However, it is not known how they impact the physiology of cells or ribosome control pathways. We used a genome-wide CRPR screen to identify proteins and pathways that modulate growth in the presence of high doses of a PCS9 translational inhibitor, PF-063 (3). The most potent modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF were the ubiquitin-binding protein ASC2 and helase ASC, which bind the ribosome and protect from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. Surprisingly, translation control proteins Pelota (PE) and H1 sensitize cells to PF treatment. Genetic experiments showed that ASC acts together with ASC and functions downstream of H.

**Title:** Mechanism of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) SO-Induced mRNA Turnover via Aberrant Polyadenylation

**Research Question:** How does Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSH) induce mRNA turnover in host cells, and what is the underlying mechanism of its viral protein SO in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of KSH SO in regulating mRNA stability and turnover in host cells, focusing on its aberrant polyadenylation as a potential mechanism.

**Findings:** We found that SH SO-expressing cells exhibit extended poly(A) polymerase II-generated poly(A) tails and polyaden-linked mRNA turnover, correlating with RNA function. Inhibition of poly(A) tail formation blocks SO activity. Nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins are critical cofactors for SO function, with the latter undergoing striking nuclear localization by SO. SO-induced mRNA turnover represents a novel mechanism of host shutoff and a new system to probe poly(A)-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of host shutoff by KSH via aberrant polyadenylation, the first example of enhanced turnover coupled to hyperadenylation in metazoans. We propose that SO-induced alterations in mRNA processing may render nascent RNAs targets of cellular quality control machinery.

**Conclusions:**

1. Kapos's sarcoma herpesvirus (SH) induces mRNA turnover in host cells via its protein SO, a mechanism previously unknown.
2. SO engages aberrant polyadenylation in mRNA turnover, a novel mechanism of host shutoff.
3. Nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) proteins are critical for SO function, with the latter undergoing nuclear localization.
4. SO-induced mRNA turnover correlates with RNA function, and inhibition of poly(A) formation blocks SO activity.
5. This study provides a new system to probe regulation of poly(A)-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells.

**Significance:** Control of mRNA stability is crucial for gene expression and cellular response to environmental cues. Unregulated turnover can dampen responses to signals. Herpesviruses, like KSH, instigate widespread mRNA destruction to evade detection and block host expression. This study reveals a novel mechanism of host shutoff and a system to probe regulation of poly(A)-stimulated mRNA in mammalian cells.

**Title:** The Role of Type III Interferon (IFλ) Receptor IL-28 in the Innate Immune Response to Bacterial Pathogens

**Research Question:** This study investigates the role of the Type III interferon (IF) receptor IL-28 in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the respiratory tract.

**Methods:** Mice lacking the IL-28 receptor (IL-28) were compared to wild-type mice in terms of IFλ production, bacterial clearance, lung pathology, and cytokine production after infection with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.

**Findings:** IL-28 null mice showed significantly increased IFλ production, improved bacterial clearance, reduced lung pathology, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in the airway compared to wild-type mice. In human epithelial cells, IFλ inhibited miR-21 via STAT, resulting in upregulation of PDC, a protein promoting inflammatory signaling. In vivo, 18 hours post-infection with either pathogen, mi-21 was reduced and PDC increased in lungs of wild-type compared to IL-28 null mice. Infection of PDC null mice with USA resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced cytokine production.

**Implications:** These data suggest that IFλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting mi-21 regulation of PDC in the context of bacterial pneumonia.

**Conclusions:** IFλ and PDC are conserved elements in the response to airway pathogens with differential effects on innate immunity. Selective expression of IL-28, more abundant on epithelial cells than immune cells, may be important in specific cytokine responses to pathogens. Overall, inhibiting IL-28 signaling reduces lung inflammation and improves bacterial clearance.

**Title:** Retrospective Study on Mortality Trends and Risk Factors in Naïve Cases of Advanced Stage-2 Sleeping Sickness at the National Center for African Trypanosomiasis, Democratic Republic of Congo

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the mortality trends and risk factors in naïve cases of advanced stage-2 sleeping sickness (HAT) admitted between 1989 and 2012 at the National Center for African Trypaniasis (CNRTH), Department of Neurology, Kinasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

**Methods:** A retrospective study was conducted on 781 naïve cases of stage-2 HAT, with death as the outcome variable. Predictors included age, gender, duration of disease, location of trypanosomes in body fluids, cyach, protach, clinical status (assessed on syndic and functional basis) on admission, and treatment regimen. Logistic regression models were run at 0.05 significance level.

**Findings:** Death proportions were 17.2% in standard melop schedule (3 series of intravenous melop on 3 days 3.6/kg, with one-week interval between series), 12.1 in short melop schedule (10 days intravenous mel 2.2/kg), 5.4 in first eornine (14 days eornine 400/kg in infusions), 9.1 in NECT regimen (eine 7 days 400/kg in infusions combined with nifim 10 days 15/kg doses), and 36 in group with severely affected given eine because clinical on admission. After adjusting for treatment, odds ratios were: 10.40 (95 CI 6.55-16.51; p.000) for clinical dysfunction on admission, 2.14 (95 CI 1.35-3.39; p.001) for protach, 1.99 (95 1-3.37; p.010 for presence in CSF and 1.70 (95 1-2.81; p.038 for cyach.

**Implications:** The study highlights the importance of clinical manifestations in disease assessment and the need for an objective test to assess H severity. Clinical status on admission and protach were significant predictors of death in multivar analysis. The algorithm used in this study may serve as basis for further development of standardized tools for H management and epidemiological reports.

**Conclusion:** The findings suggest that clinical status on admission and protach are significant predictors of death in naïve cases of stage-2 H. The study emphasizes the need for an objective test to assess H severity and highlights the importance of clinical manifestations in disease process.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Isolation on Social Behavior and Physiology in Drosophila melanogaster: A Novel Tracking and Analytical Pipeline

**Research Question:** How does isolation affect social behavior and physiology in Dophila melanogaster, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms driving these changes?

**Methods:** We developed a novel imaging arena and improved tracking algorithm to follow large groups of flies simultaneously, enabling reliable analysis of social dynamics. We used automatic classification and graph-based network analysis to quantify changes in social networks in response to isolation. Additionally, we performed genome-wide molecular analysis to correlate behavioral changes with gene expression.

**Findings:** Isolation significantly enhanced individual and local network parameters, depicting near-neighbor relationships. Behavioral changes occurred within six days, with gene expression alterations largely on day 1. Changes were mostly in metabolic genes, verified by increased lipid content in isolated flies.

**Implications:** Our pipeline unravels the behavioral, molecular, and physiological impact of isolation on social dynamics in Dophila. We show strong effects on social dynamics, gene expression, and physiology.

**Conclusions:** Isolation profoundly influences social behavior in animals, including humans. Doph melanogaster is a powerful model for studying small-scale, temporally transient behavior. However, long-term analysis of large groups is hampered by lack of effective tools. Our pipeline addresses this gap, providing a framework for tracking, classification, and analysis of social dynamics. We demonstrate effects of isolation on social dynamics, gene expression, and physiology. Behavioral changes initiated early, lasting, while gene expression transient. Our data suggest single day isolation alters physiology, behavior, promoting interactions with neighboring flies.

**Title:** Leveraging Mobile Technology to Enhance Clinical Adherence in Resource-Limited Settings: A Pilot Study on Smartphone-Based Diarrhea Management Guidelines in Rural Bangladesh

**Research Question:** Can a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization's diarrheal management guidelines improve clinical adherence in resource-limited settings?

**Methods:** We conducted a 12-week pilot study in two rural hospitals in Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone-based diarral management tool, including a weight-for-age estimation modality. The tool was developed with end-user input and evaluated in a resource-limited district and sub-district hospital during the 2015 cholera season. Both hospitals lacked scales, necessitating weight estimation. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period with 10-day post-discharge follow-up. Standard care was maintained, with clinicians using the tool during intervention. Inclusion criteria were patients 2 months old with uncomplicated diarral disease. Primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc.

**Findings:** A total 841 patients were enrolled (325 pre-intervention, 516 intervention). During intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at district and subistrict hospitals (p < 0.001) with risk ratios (RRs) 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. However, when fluids were prescribed, volume adhered to recommendations. Proportion for recommended azithromycin increased (p < 0.001; district p 0.035 subistrict) with RR 6.9 and 1.6, while other antibiotics decreased; zinc adherence increased.

**Implications:** Despite limitations (absence of control group and independent dehydration assessment), opportunities to improve care were identified, including better weight estimation and fluid/antibiotic selection. These findings demonstrate a smartphone tool can improve adherence. This study serves as a catalyst for randomized trial to expand and address limitations.

**Conclusion:** This pilot study demonstrates the potential of technology-enabled decision-support to promote evidence-based practice in resourceimited settings, addressing challenges in guideline adherence and improving care for patients with diarral disease, especially during outbreaks. Weight-based dosing is fundamental, but equations are rarely accurate and accessible. High post-discharge rates suggest in-hospital efforts may decrease morbidity and mortality. This study aims to address these challenges by adapting WHO guidelines onto a platform and evaluating in remote hospitals.

**Title:** Predicting Host-Parasite Dynamics under Climate Change: A Mechanistic Modeling of Within-Host Population Dynamics using Metabolic Theory Ecology

**Research Question:** How do host-parasite systems respond to climate change, particularly when host and parasite traits such as survival and virulence have distinct temperature dependencies that must be integrated into models of disease dynamics?

**Methods:** We used experimental data from Daphnia magna and microsporidian parasite to fit a mechanistic model of within-host population dynamics. Parameters, including host mortality, parasite growth, virulence, and equilibrium, were specified by relationships from metabolic theory of ecology. We analyzed data on host survival and parasite across a temperature gradient using an M-based model to capture thermal dependencies of aging and virulence, growth, and abundance.

**Findings:** Our model effectively predicts survival, parasite growth, and cost of infection across temperatures using less than half the parameters compared to modeling discretely. Results demonstrate the power of linking metabolic models with mechanistic host-paras framework to predict temperature responses of population at within level.

**Implications:** Accurate predictions of climate change will alter host-paras dynamics and disease require models that integrate thermal dependencies of host and parasite traits. Development, survival, movement could be described by formulae from first principles in metabolic ecology. These inform classical host-paras dynamics to estimate effect of temperature on prevalence and severity.

**Conclusions:** Our study empirically demonstrates the predictive power of M-based thermal for host-paras in mechanistic models to understand impacts of temperature on disease. Due to its simplicity and generality, this framework provides a valuable approach for predicting outcomes and consequences of infections for hosts and parasites under climate change.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Inhibitory Interneurons in Neuronal Processing: A Novel Network Motif of PV, SOM, and VIP Interneurons

**Research Question:** How do inhibitory interneurons, specifically parvalbumin (PV), somostatin (SOM), and vaso intestinal (VIP)-expressing interneurons, contribute to the processing of information in excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs)?

**Methods:** We propose a functional role for a widespread network motif consisting of PV, SOM, and VIP-expressing interneurons, suggesting that PV interneurons control the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, while mutual inhibition between SOM and VIP interneurons translates inputs into changes in somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. Using a computational model, we demonstrate that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis.

**Findings:** Our results show that the observed microcircuit comprising excitatory PCs and inhibitory PV, SOM, and VIP interneurons can act as an amplifier, translating weak inputs onto VIP cells into large changes in somatoendritic inhibition of PCs. A cornerstone of this amplification is mutual inhibition between SOM and VIPneurons, which, if strong, allows switch-like shifts in somatoend inhibition. We also demonstrate that the SOM-VIP motif allows inputs to persistently switch the circuit between processing modes, where top inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of control of different streams and information modes of processing. We hypothesize that a subnetwork of SOM and VIP interneurons is optimized to control PV-mediated redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition. Mathematical and simulations of a microcircuit of these interne types and excit PCs support our hypothesis.

**Conclusions:** The roles of interne classes and how they are supported by their characteristics are largely unknown. One difference interne type is the location of synapses onto postsynaptic targets: PVneurons inhibit peromatic and basal dendrites of PCs, as well as other PVneurons. Our study reveals a novel network motif of PV, SOM, and VIP interneurons that amplifies weak inputs into large changes in somatoend inhibition of PCs. This amplification is supported by mutual inhibition between SOM and VIPneurons, which, if strong, enables switch-like shifts in somend inhibition. The SOM-VIP motif allows inputs to persistently switch the circuit between processing modes, where inputs onto PCs are either integrated or cancelled.

**Title:** Unraveling the Complexity of Microbiome-Host Interactions: A Novel Method to Distinguish Direct from Indirect Associations in Microbiome-Wide Association Studies

**Research Question:** How do microbial interactions contribute to host phenotypes, including disease, and can we accurately identify direct associations between specific microbes and phenotypes in the microbiome-wide association studies?

**Methods:** We employed a statistical approach from physics to develop a method, called Direct Association Analysis (DAA), to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. We compared microbial abundances between two groups of samples and found that interactions generated a large number of spurious associations providing no mechanistic insight.

**Findings:** Our corrected inflation of p-values in standard tests showed that only a small subset of associations were directly linked to disease. Direct associations had higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate, and brain-gut axis as factors in inflammatory disease.

**Implications:** Microbial interactions produce many spurious associations between members of the microbiome and phenotypes, which can be removed by a simple procedure based on maximum entropy models. Our results suggest that non-trivial cause relationship gives rise to spurious associations in synthetic and real microbiome data. We obtained model parameters from a large case-control study and found that traditional microbi-wide association studies lost power to identify link between phenotype and microbiota. Unbounded detections were observed, suggesting many reported associations between microbi and IBD could be indirect.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of accounting for microbial interactions in microbi-wide association studies to avoid spurious associations. Direct associations were more accurate in separating cases and controls, pointing to immunomodulation, butyrate, and brainut axis as factors in inflammatory disease. Our method, DAA, can be applied to other microbiome-wide studies to identify direct associations and improve understanding of host-microbe interactions.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Wolbachia Infection on the Replication and Transmission of Flaviviruses in Mosquitoes: A Comparative Study of Stable and Transient Infection Models

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the effect of Wolbach infection on the replication and transmission of two flaviviruses, DENV and WNV (Kun strain), in mosquitoes, using two infection models: stable and transient infection.

**Methods:** We compared the replication and transmission rates of DENV and WNV (Kun strain) in mosquitoes infected with stable and transiently infected with Wolbach. Mosquitoes were either stably infected with Wolbach (stable line) or transiently infected with Wolbach (transient line). Wolbach density was measured in both stable and transiently infected mosquitoes.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that Wolbach had a blocking effect on both stable and transient models of infection, however, the magnitude of the effect was lower in mosquitoes transiently infected with Wolbach. No evidence was found for enhancement of either DENV or WNV (Kun strain infection in Ae. aegypt infected with Wolbach.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that Wolbach can be used as a safe and effective means to restrict transmission of flaviviruses in mosquitoes. The lower Wolbach density in transiently infected mosquitoes provides a plausible explanation for the reduced D blocking phenotype observed in transiently infected compared to stably infected mosquitoes.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to the understanding of Wolbach-host-pathogen interactions and provides evidence for the use of Wolbach as a tool to restrict transmission of flaviruses in mosquitoes.

**Title:** Distinct Ciliary Compartments in Caenorhabditis elegans: Unveiling the Mechanisms of Inversin Compartment Establishment and Regulation

**Research Question:** How are the ciliary compartments, specifically the Invers compartment (Inv), established and regulated in Caenorhabditis elegans?

**Methods:** We investigated the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the C. elegans ciliary double region and Inv using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and imaging approaches.

**Findings:** We show that the Inv is conserved and distinct from the double region, and that the genes n-2, ar-13, and unc-119 are redundantly required for Inv and double region formation. The Inv and double region can be sorted into two modules, n-2p-kl-11 and ar-13-unc-119, which are antagonized by the hd-6 deacetylase. Glutamylation, a post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting of Inv and double region components, rather, glutamylation is modulated by n-2, ar-13, and unc-119. The ciliary and restricted localization of N-2, A-13, and UNC does not require TZ, double region and Inv-associated genes N-2 requires its calcium EF hand domain for targeting to Inv.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that C. elegans Inv is distinct from the double region, and that components in these regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via c placement, ciliary microtub ultrastructure, and protein localization.

**Conclusions:** We propose that the underlying establishment of the N-Inv compartment may be similar in C elegans and mammals, in a manner of microtub ultrastructure. C elegans Inv is likely established early in c development, as N- is proxally restricted phid cilia as the first larval stage, and is not motile, unlike lar stage-dependent localization A-13. We eliminated several mechanisms for establishment the Inv. Ciliary structure does not play a role, as both regions have not well-characterized; we present evidence that Inv and double region are distinct, overlapping ciliary regions. C eleg genome encodes orthologs for mammalian Inv-associated proteins, including itself, UNC, UNC, ARL, and possibly uncharacterized paralog NEKL and NEKL, but not N3 or An6.

**Title:** Essential Role of Scribble in Myelination and Remyelination in the Central Nervous System

**Research Question:** What is the role of the polarity protein Scribble in myelination and remyination in the central nervous system?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression and function of Scribble in oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Scribble was expressed throughout oligodrocy development and upregulated in mature oligodrocy, localizing to both developing and mature myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scri expression in cultured oligodrocy resulted in disrupted morphology and myelination, while conditional elimination of Scri in myinating glia of transgenic mice led to disrupted myelination during development and remyelination.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that Scri is essential for myelination and remyination in the central nervous system. Scri regulates myelin thickness by suppressing the extracellular signal-related kinase (ER)/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and localizes to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier, where it is required for axo-glial adhesion.

**Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of evolutionarily conserved regulators of intracellular polarity in myination and remyination. Scri function may be "compartmentalized" through interactions with different protein complexes at radial or longitudinal growth sites.

**Conclusions:** Scri plays a critical role in oligodrocy morphological differentiation, myelination, myelin regulation, and remyination. Its localization to noncompact myelin membranes is consistent with a role in regulating axo-gl adhesion. Our data suggest that Scri regulates signaling pathways involved in myelination and remyination, including ER/MAPK pathway and axo-gl adhesion at the node of Ranvier.

**Title:** Unveiling the Extended Family of Streptolysin-Like Virulence Peptides: A New Insights into the Pathogenesis of Gram-Positive Pathogens

**Research Question:** Do Streptolys (S)-like virulence peptides, previously thought to be exclusive to Streptococcus species, are also produced by other Gram-positive pathogens, including Listeria monocytogen, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium botulin, and contribute to their virulence?

**Methods:** In silico analysis and experimental studies were conducted to investigate the presence and function of Streolys-like virulence peptides in various Gram-positive pathogens.

**Findings:** This study reveals the existence of Streol-like virulence peptides in Listeria monocytogen, Staphlococcus aureus, and Clostrid botulin, in addition to Streptoccus species. Specifically, the L monocytogen cluster encodes an inducible cytotoxic and hemolytic peptide, Listerin S, which contributes to the pathogen's survival in polymorphonuclear neutrophils and virulence in a mouse model. Notably, the Listerin-associated cluster is variable, present in a subset of isolates from lineage I, associated with the majority of epidemics of this fatal pathogen.

**Implications:** The discovery of Streol-like virulence peptides in Gram-positive pathogens expands our understanding of their pathogenesis and highlights the importance of these factors in virulence. Lister monocogen, Staphloc aureus, and Cloid botulin are notorious pathogens responsible for severe diseases, including listeriosis, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptoc shock syndrome. The presence of Stre-like virulence peptides in these pathogens may contribute to their enhanced virulence and disease severity.

**Conclusions:** This study establishes the existence of an extended family of Streol-like virulence peptides (MVPs) and reveals the genetic basis for enhanced virulence in a proportion of lineage L monocogen. The findings have significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of Gram-positive pathogens and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting these virulence factors.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Interleukin-17 (IL-17) and Matrix Metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in Mycetoma Granuloma Formation

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the expression of IL-17 and MMP-9 in mycetoma granuloma and their correlation with the severity of the disease, independent of the causative agent responsible for the granuloma.

**Methods:** A total of 100 patients with confirmed myetoma underwent surgical biopsies, and IL-17 and MMP-9 expression in myet granuloma were evaluated immunohistochemically.

**Findings:** IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MMP-9 was mainly detected in Zones II and III. MMP-9 was highly expressed in Actinadura pelletii and Streptomyces somensis biopsies compared to Madura myetatis biops. MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to IL-17 (p = 0.001). The only association between MMP9 and patients' characteristics was disease duration (p < 0.001). There was no correlation between IL-17 levels and patients' demographic characteristics.

**Implications:** The results indicate that IL-17 and MMP-9 are present in myet granuloma, with IL-17 more extensively expressed in larger lesions and longer disease duration. A positive correlation between IL-17 expression and MMP-9 levels was observed. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of IL-17 and MMP-9, but not their function in myet granuloma formation.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that IL-17 and MMP-9 are expressed in myet granuloma of different causative agents, with IL-17 more in larger and longer lesions. A positive correlation between IL-17 and MMP-9 levels was found. Future studies are needed to determine roles IL-17 and MMP-9 in granuloma formation and provide insights myet immunogenesis.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Molecular Recognition by Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) through Cation-π Interactions: A Case Study on the Transcription Activation Domain of Ewing Sarcoma Oncoprotein (E)

**Research Question:** How do intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) recognize and interact with globular targets, and what is the role of cation-π interactions in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the transcription activation domain of Ewing Sarcoma oncoprotein (E), a polyvalent IDP, through functional and theoretical interrogation of E variants with varying sequence, aromaticity, density, and charge perturbations. We employed a coarse-grained E chain model and analytical model to capture the interaction between E aromatics and cations of a generic glob target.

**Findings:** Our results support the cationπ hypothesis, demonstrating that E-target binding is driven by a balance between E conformational entropy and favorable E-target cationπ contacts. This versatile mode of recognition offers a general framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyval IDPs.

**Implications:** Our study provides insight into the "fuzzy" interactions, a phenomenon characterized by ID polyency, sequence-insensitivity, and dynamic ensemble disordered-state conformations. Theoretical modeling of IDPs, especially fuzzy complexes, is in its infancy, but offers tools for understanding conformer ensembles. Our integrated approach culminated a distinctive model for fuzzy interactions.

**Conclusions:** E-target binding, in the context of pathological Ewing Sarcoma oncoprote, is driven by a balance between E conformational entropy and favorable E-target cationπ contacts. This highly versatile mode of molecular recognition offers a conceptual framework for promuous target recognition by polyval IDPs. Our study highlights the significance of c-π interactions in protein-protein interfaces and provides a basis for understanding the physical basis of polyomatic E function.

**Title:** Functional Divergence of ATP-Dependent Proteases in Borrelia burgdferi: Implications for Virulence and Host Adaptation**

**Research Question:** What are the functional roles of the two putative ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in Boria burgdferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, and how do they contribute to its virulence and host adaptation?

**Methods:** Phylogenetic analysis, biochemical, and genetic approaches were employed to investigate the functional divergence of Lon-1 and Lon-2 in B. burgdferi.

**Findings:** Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in the NH2-terminal binding domains, suggesting distinct substrate specificity. Recombinant Lon-1 exhibited ATP-dependent chaperone-protease activity in vitro but did not complement E. coli mutant, while Lon-2 corrected characteristic Lon-mut phenotypes.

**Implications:** B. burgferi Lon-1 and-2 have distinct functional roles. Lon-2 functions in a manner consistent with canonical Lon, engaged in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, by virtue of its blood induction, as a unique feature of Boriae, may be important in host adaptation from arthrop to warm-blood host.

**Conclusions:** B. burgferi Lon-1 and-2 have distinct functional roles. Lon-2 functions in a manner consistent with canonical, engaged in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, by virtue its induction, as a feature of Boriae, may be important in host adaptation from arthrop to warm host.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Antibody-Dependent Phagocytosis in HIV-1 Infection: A Novel Insights into Fc Receptor-Mediated Functions

**Research Question:** Does antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) play a role in controlling HIV-1 infection, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms involved?

**Methods:** We investigated the ability of HIV-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes. We used a green-fluorescent protein-express molecular of HIV-1JR, an R5 clinical isolate, in combination with polyclonal HIV or mAbs to capture and neutralize HIV-1 TH-1 and 937 cells, as well as freshly isolated monocytes from healthy individuals as phagytic effector cells. Uptake of vir was measured by cytometry.

**Findings:** Surprisingly, minimal AD of vir with any of the antibodies was observed. However, after coating vir with gp41 or gp-derived peptides, gp41 (not gp120) m efficiently mediated phagytosis. We estimated a minimum of a hundred gp molecules needed for phagytosis, similar to the number of envelope on viruses that are phytosed (e.g., influenza). Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy revealed a clear association between virus aggregation and AD. In contrast, vir-decor cells were targets for AD orgocyt in presence HIV-antibodies.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate AD of vir may not play a role in preventing infection due to paucity of trimers and consequent inability vir-bound to cross F on phocytes. However, AD orocyt could play in clearing HIV-infected cells verge infection.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the role of F receptor-mediated functions in HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest that paucity of spikes on HIV virions results in inadequate antibody orientation for Fc crosslinking. In contrast, CD lymphocytes adsorbed HIV vir are targets for phocyt orocyt. While we found no vir AD using phocytic lines or monocytes, other effector cells may mediate AD or in vivo conditions. Our findings highlight the importance of F-dependent functions other than AD free vir for maximal control of HIV-1 by antibody.

**Title:** Estimating the Global Economic and Health Burden of Hookworm Infection: A Computational Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** What is the economic and health burden of hookworm infection worldwide, and how does it vary by country, region, and globally?

**Methods:** We developed a computational model to estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm infection in every country, region, and globally, in 2016 from a societal perspective. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and productivity losses to quantify the burden.

**Findings:** Globally, hookworm infection resulted in 2,126,280 DALs using 200 disability estimates and 4,087,803 DALs using 201 estimates (excluding cognitive impairment). Including impairment did not significantly increase DALs worldwide. Productivity losses varied with probability of anemia and calculation used, ranging from $7.5 billion to $138.9 annually using gross national income per capita as proxy and from $2.5 to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as proxy.

**Implications:** Despite being classified as a neglected disease, hookworm's economic and health burden exceeded estimates of diseases receiving more attention, such as rotavirus. Large countries transitioning to higher income, like Brazil and China, still face significant hook burden.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the need for better understanding hook's global burden to inform decision-makers, funders, policymakers, and control officials on resource allocation. Our model provides a framework for estimating hook's economic and health impact, enabling data-driven decision-making.

**Title:** Evolutionarily Conserved Mechanisms of Hypoxic Injury to the Developing Brain: Disrupted Axon Pathfinding in Zebraf (Danio rerio)

**Research Question:** Despite being a major cause of chronic neurodevelopmental impairments, the mechanisms of hypoxic injury to the human brain are poorly understood. Recent studies in in invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that hypox causes discrete axon pathfinding errors in certain interneurons and motorneurons. However, it is unknown whether developmental hypox would have similar effects in a vertebrate nervous system.

**Methods:** We developed a zebraf (Danio) model for investigating hypox at different stages of CNS development and generated transgenic lines to test the genetic pathways involved. We found that developmental hypoxic disrupts pathfinding of forebrain neurons in zraf, leading to errors in commissural axons failing to cross the midline. Pathfinding defects result from activation of the hypox-inducible transcription (HIF) pathway, mimicked by chemical inducers of HIF or expression of constitutively active Hα. Blocking transcriptional activation by Hα prevented the defects.

**Findings:** We identified EphB2 as a target of H pathway activation, showed knockdown of Eph2 rescued guidance errors, and that EphA receptor is expressed in a complementary pattern to misrouting axons. Targeting a constitutively form of Eph2 to neurons, we found Eph2 mediates pathfinding via reverse-signaling. Magnesium sulfate, used to improve neurodevelopment outcomes in prebirths, protects against path errors by preventing upregulation Eph2.

**Implications:** These results demonstrate evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate changes in CNS response to hypox, supporting a neuroprotective role for magnesium. Notably, hypox specifically disrupts vertebrate axon pathfinding, and Eph2, the zraf homolog to V-1, is a primary mediator of H activation. In Caenorhabitis, hyp leads increased expression Eph receptor V-1 and aberrant crossing mid by PV interneurons and motorne, a phenotype rescued by knockdown ligand e-2.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals conserved mechanisms of hyp injury to the developing brain, disrupted axon pathfinding in zraf, mediated by H pathway and Eph2. These findings have implications for understanding neurodevelopmental impairments caused by hypox and suggest potential therapeutic targets for prevention.

**Title:** Investigating Pulmonary Lesions in Experimental Paracoccidiomycosis: A Comparative Analysis of High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) and Histopathological Parameters

**Research Question:** This study aimed to define the topography and intensity of lung lesions in experimentally infected mice with Paracocidiomycosis (PCM) by comparing High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HR) and histopathological parameters.

**Methods:** Male BAL/c mice (n=50) were intranasally inoculated with 3×10^6 Paracidi brasiliensis conidia (n=50) or PBS (n=50). HRCT was performed every four weeks to determine pulmonary lesions, lung density, and air structure. Lungs were analyzed by histology and histometry.

**Findings:** Three patterns of lesions were evidenced by HR and histology: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-oral. Lesions were mainly located around the hilus and affected the left lung. At 4 weeks post-challenge, 80% of Pb-infected mice showed peri-bronial consolidations with significant increase in lung density compared to controls (-263±25 vs -422HU, p<0.001). After 8 and 12 weeks, consolidation progressed to middle regions. Histology revealed consolidation as HR equivalent to confl granulomatous reaction, nodules to compact granomas. At 16 weeks, confl granomas formed pseudooral masses obstructing bronchi. Discrete fibrosis was visible around granomas, evident only by histology.

**Implications:** This study demonstrated HR as a useful tool for evaluation and quantification of pulmonary damage in experimental PCM. Experimental design reduced need to sacrifice large animals and monitor treatment efficacy by rational approach to lung disease.

**Conclusions:** This is the first study to evaluate radiological follow-up of pulmonary lesions in experimental PCM model. Conventional HR is a precise non-invasive technique to evaluate and quantify pulmonary damage in mouse PCM. This model allows histologically and immunologically evaluate tissue responses during active and residual stages.

**Title:** Evaluation of Interferon-gamma Release Assay (IFN-γRA) as a Novel Marker for Latent Leishmaniasis donovani Infection: A Pilot Study

**Research Question:** Can an interferon-gamma release assay (IF-γ) be used as a novel marker for latent Leishmaniasis donani infection, particularly in individuals who mount a cellular immune response and remain asymptomatic?

**Methods:** We modified a commercial kit, QuFERON, evaluating five Leishmania-specific antigens: H2, H2-PS2, H-Le12, crude antigen CSA, and soluble Leish antigen (SL) from L. donani to detect cell-mediated response in VL. We evaluated the assay on venous blood samples of active patients (n=13), cured patients (n=15), non-endemic controls (n=11), and endemic controls (n=19).

**Findings:** The assay based on SL had a sensitivity of 80% (95% CI=54.81-92.95) and specificity of 100% (95 CI=74.12-100). Our findings suggest that whole-blood SL-based QuFER assay can measure cell-mediated response in L. don infection. Positive IF-γ response to Leish antigen in patients with VL was contradictory to conventional non-proliferative antigen response of peripheral mononuclear cells, requiring further research.

**Implications:** This study highlights the potential of IF-γ as a novel marker for latent L. donani infection, particularly in asymptomatic carriers. The high sensitivity and specificity of the SL-based QuFER assay suggest its utility in detecting cell-mediated response in L. don infection. The unexpected finding of IF-γ production in VL upon Leish antigen stimulation warrants further investigation, as it contradicts previous reports of immunosuppression in VL patients.

**Conclusion:** This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using IF-γ as a marker for latent L. donani infection, particularly in asymptomatic carriers. The high sensitivity and specificity of the SL-based QuFER assay indicate its potential for detecting cell-mediated response in L. infection. Further research is needed to elucidate the contradictory finding of IFγ production in VL upon Leish antigen stimulation, which challenges current understanding of immunosuppression in VL patients.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Yersinia Persistence: The Role of CNFY Toxin in Modulating Host Immune Responses and Establishing a Commensal Lifestyle**

**Research Question:** How do enteric Yersiae establish persistent infections and evade host immune responses, leading to complications such as relapsing enteritis and autoimmune disorders?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of CNFY toxin, a virulence factor of Yersiae, in modulating host immune responses and facilitating persistence.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that CNFY enhances the translocation of antiphocytic effectors, inducing inflammatory responses, tissue destruction, and alteration of intestinal microbiota, and bacterial clearance. Suppression of CNFY function, however, increases interferon-γ-mediated, non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities and tolerogenesis. This process is accompanied by preprogramming the pathogen's transcriptional response towards persistence, conferring a fitness advantage against host responses and establishment of commensal lifestyle.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that removal of a single virulence factor, CNFY, is sufficient to dampen inflammation and evade host defense, favoring Yers persistence. The CN-triggered process represents a double-edged sword, dampening inflammation while facilitating establishment. The mechanisms underlying this process are unclear, but impact suggests a set of immune responses (e.g., IL-6, modulators, bacteridal activities, anti-inflammatory factors) contributing to this process.

**Conclusions:** Suppression of CNFY shifts the balance of bacteria-triggered inflammation and clearance towards immune suppression, promoting establishment of asymptomatic, persistent infection. Evaluation of enteric pathogens, including Yers, can persist in intestinal and lymphatic tissues, promoting chronic arthritis and ileitis. The basis for this process is formed during acute infection, determined by complex path-triggered reactions, yet molecular players largely unknown. Our study highlights the critical role of CNFY in modulating host responses, establishing Yers persistence, and commal lifestyle.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel Pathogenic Gene, DES1, in Magnaporthea oryza that Regulates Defense Against Host Resistance in Plants

**Research Question:** How do pathogens overcome the innate defenses of plants to successfully colonize and reproduce?

**Methods:** We employed a T-DNA insertional mutant library to screen for pathogenic-defective mutants and identified a novel gene, DES1, in Magnapor oryza. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that DES encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties, conserved in filamentous Ascomyc. Targeted gene deletion of DES had no effect on developmental processes, including vegetative growth, conial germination, appressium formation, and appressium penetration. However, conidial size of mutant was smaller than wild-type, with no defects in cell wall integrity.

**Findings:** The Δdes mutant was hypersensitive to exogenous stress, with decreased activity and transcription of extracellular enzymes, including peroxides and lases. Ferrous ion leakage was observed in Δdes mutant. In interaction with susceptible rice cultivar, cells inoculated with Δdes exhibited strong defense responses, including brown granules in infected cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, autofluorescent materials, and PR induction in neighboring tissues. Δdes displayed significant reduction in infectious hyph extension, causing decrease in pathogenicity. Notably, suppression of ROS by dipheniodium (DPI), an inhibitor of NAD oxidases, resulted in significant reduction defense in plant tissues challenged with Δdes. Furthermore, Δdes recovered normal growth in DPI-treated tissues.

**Implications:** Our results suggest DES functions as a pathogenic gene regulating fungal activity, compromising ROS-mediated plant defense. Loss of DES in fungus leads to colonization failure and strong plant defense. DES is responsible for scavenging extracellular ROS within cells, countering plant innate responses.

**Conclusions:** We identified and characterized a novel pathogenic gene required for host colonization using independent mutants. DES is responsible for scavenging extracellular ROS within cells, countering plant defense. Loss of DES in fungus leads to colonization failure and strong defense. Our results suggest DES serves as pathogenic factor countering oxidative component PT.

**Title:** Evaluating the Accuracy of Model-Based Predictions for Schistosoma Haematium Infection in Ghana: A Comparative Study of Empirical and Predictive Approaches

**Research Question:** Can model-based geostatistics (MB) accurately predict schistosoma haematium infection prevalence in Ghana, and can it be used as a reliable tool for guiding schistosomiasis control programs?

**Methods:** A comparative study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of MB predictions for schos haematium infection in Ghana by comparing empirically determined prevalence values from surveys at 79 sites with values derived from published MB predictions. Schools were categorized according to WHO guidelines to assess practical implications of any differences.

**Findings:** Using predicted values alone, 21 of 25 empirically determined 'high-risk' schools would have been undertreated, and almost 20% of the remaining schools would have been treated despite empirically determined absence of infection, translating to 28% of children being undertreated and 12% receiving treatment in absence of demonstrated need. Aggregating prevalence to district level was not adequate for guiding national program, but assessing each school in potentially endemic areas is not feasible; modelling must be complementary to empiric assessments.

**Implications:** Predictive mapping should not be a one-time exercise but an iterative process incorporating empiric testing and refining to create updated versions meeting operational needs of disease control managers.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of understanding appropriate use of predictive maps to guide treatment decisions, techniques, and approaches to schosomiasis control in Ghana. The use of rigorously described predictive model aggregating estimates to district level did not give the degree of accuracy hoped for establishing schosiasis control program. Certain areas predicted endemic required treatment had no infection empirically found, emphasizing the need for complementary empiric assessments.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Sperm Guidance through the Female Reproductive Tract: A Novel Insights from Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How do motile sperm navigate through the female reproductive tract to reach oocytes, and what are the underlying biochemical mechanisms that facilitate this process?

**Methods:** We employed a multidisciplinary approach combining genetics, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, and biochemical assays to investigate the synthesis and function of F-series prostagland in Caenorhabitis elegans. We delineated the pathways of F-seriesagland metabolism and identified key enzymes involved in their production.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that Caenorhabdis oocytes synthesize F-series prostland from polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUA) precursors provided in yolkoprotein complexes. We show that omega-6 and omega-3 PAs, including arachidonic and eicosentaenoic acids, are converted into more than 10 structurally related F-series prostland, which collectively and redundantly promote sperm guidance. Disruption of omega-3 PU synthesis triggers compensatory upregulation of prostland derived from omega-6 PAs. C elegans-series prostland synthesis involves biochemical mechanisms distinct from mammalian cyclooxygen-dependent pathways, yet PG2 stereoisomers are still synthesized. A conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Biet's Crystine dystrophy, negatively regulates prostland synthesis.

**Implications:** Our findings support the model that multiple cyclooxygen-independent prostland function together promote sperm motility for fertilization. This cycxygen-independent pathway F-series synthesis may be conserved across species. We identify a conserved cychrome P enzyme that functions to inhibit prostland metabolism, possibly diverting precursors into alternative pathways. Our results support the model that Caenor oocytes secrete a blend of F prostland for guiding sperm to fertilization.

**Conclusion:** This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of sperm guidance through the female reproductive tract, highlighting the role of F prostland in this process. Our findings have implications for understanding fertilization and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for reproductive disorders.

**Title:** Overcoming the Immunogenic Bottleneck in Biotherapeutic Development: A Novel Algorithmic Approach to Optimize Protein Deimmunization

**Research Question:** How can we balance the immunogenicity and functionality of biotherapeutics to overcome the bottleneck in their clinical application?

**Methods:** We developed an algorithm that simultaneously optimizes protein design for reduced T-cell epitope content and high-level functionality. In silico analysis of this dual objective space revealed a Pareto frontier, where no single design is optimal for both immunogenicity and function. We constructed and experimentally evaluated 18 Pareto-optimal variants, correlating computational predictions with experimental measures of performance.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate the first systematic assessment of the functional penalty paid for pursuing more immunized biotherapeutic candidates. The algorithm enables rapid assessment of trade-offs between immunogenicity and functionality, potentially accelerating and de-risking experimental immunization efforts.

**Implications:** This work outlines a design-based approach to functional immunization of biotherapeutic candidates, integrating immunoinform epitope prediction and in silico analysis of functional consequences. The algorithm correlates well with experimental analyses of protein function, revealing incremental T-epitope deletion leads to concomitant loss of function, validating predicted trade-offs in protein immunization.

**Conclusions:**

1.  **Novel Algorithmic Approach:** Our algorithm seamlessly integrates immunoinform epitope prediction and in silico analysis of functional consequences, enabling global design and immunization on a compressed scale.
2. **Trade-offs in Immunogenicity and Functionality:** Incremental deletion of T-epitopes escalates concom loss of function, borne out in real analyses.
3. **Practical Implications:** Sequential tools fail to consider combined effects on immunogenicity and function, precluding global approach protein immunization.
4. **Pareto Optimal Designs:** Reveal inverse relationship between deimmization and reduced function (Fig. 8).
5. **Experimental Validation:** Recombinantly produced 18 enzymes, rigorously characterized stability, activity, and immunactivity with MHC proteins.

This research addresses the immunogenic bottleneck in biotherapeutic development by introducing a novel algorithm that optimizes protein design for reduced T-cell epitope content and high-functionality. In silico analysis reveals a Pareto frontier, where no single design is optimal for both immunogenic and function. Experimental evaluation of 18 Pareto-optimal variants correlates with computational predictions, demonstrating the first systematic assessment of the penalty for pursuing more immunized biotherapeutic. The algorithm enables rapid assessment of trade-offs between immunogenic and functionality, potentially accelerating and de-risking experimental immunization efforts.

**Title:** Temperature-Induced Meiotic Hyperrecombination in Arabidopsis thalian: Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Environmental Modulation of Meiotic Recombination

**Research Question:** How does temperature influence meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis thalian, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern this process?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and molecular approaches to investigate the effects of temperature on meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis thalian. We used a pollen-based assay to visualize recombination in Arabidopsis thalian and analyzed mutants in different recombination pathways to determine the origin of temperature-induced crossovers (COs). We also examined the role of DNA double-strand breaks in temperature-induced hyperrecombination and tested whether this response is specific to thermal stress or a generalized stress response.

**Findings:** Our results show that elevated temperature induces meiotic hyperrecombination in Arabidopsis thalian, which is mediated by the Type I meiotic recombination pathway, sensitive to interference, rather than the insensitive Type II pathway. We demonstrate that heat-induced COs are not the result of an increase in DNA-strand breaks and that the hyperre phenotype is specific to thermal stress rather than a generalized response. Furthermore, we show that temperature modulation of meiotic frequency mimics the hyperphenotypes of Type II-C mutants, such as fanc, suggesting that temperature-dependent COs are derived from the Type pathway or both pathways.

**Implications:** These findings provide initial mechanistic insight into how environmental cues modulate meiotic recombination and offer practical applications for plant breeding. Temperature-dependent modulation of meiotic frequency provides a means for plant breeding without genome editing or working in mutant backgrounds. Our reduction in pollen viability at high temperatures suggests that modest increases in temperature may be utilized.

**Conclusions:** Temperature-induced meiotic hyperre in Arabid thalian is mediated by the Type I pathway, sensitive to interference, and acts additively with Type II perturbations resulting in enhanced hyperphenotype. Temperature modulation of meiotic frequency is not a universal response to stress, but rather specific to thermal stress. Our results highlight the importance of understanding molecular mechanisms governing environmental modulation of meiotic recombination in plants.

**Title:** Harnessing the Power of High-Throughput Data in Biomedicine: A Novel Computational Approach to Knowledge Integration and Analysis

**Research Question:** How can we effectively navigate the vast and rapidly evolving landscape of high-throughput data in biomed, particularly in molecular medicine, to extract meaningful insights and generate novel hypotheses?

**Methods:** We present a novel computational approach, knowledge-based system that combines reading, reasoning, and reporting to facilitate analysis of experimental data. Our system extracts information from external resources, parsing structured or unstructured data using natural language processing, and tracks provenance. Reasoning enriches knowledge by identifying relationships between genes annotated to the same ontology or database entry. We integrate sources into a network representing all relationships between pairs of genes and calculate a combined score. Reporting combines network with congruent constructed from data and visualizes in a tool facilitating knowledge-based analysis.

**Findings:** Implementation of our approach, called Hanalyzer, on a large-scale gene array dataset relevant craniofacial development revealed critical roles of four previously uncharacterized genes. Each hypothesis was validated by further experimental work.

**Implications:** Our approach addresses the curse of dimensionality in high-throughput data, enabling researchers to navigate vast terrain. By integrating knowledge with data, we highlight linkages supported by existing knowledge and generate novel hypotheses.

**Conclusions:** High-through data in biomed is a double-edged sword, both blessing and curse. Our approach provides a solution to this challenge, enabling researchers to extract insights and generate hypotheses. By combining knowledge and data, we can identify relationships and patterns not apparent in individual sources. This is demonstrated in our application to craniofacial development, where four genes were previously uncharacterized. Our tool, Hanalyzer, facilitates knowledge-based analysis and hypothesis generation, critical in biomed research.

**Title:** Unveiling the Surface Molecules of Helminth Parasite Extracellular Vesicles: Implications for Host-Parasite Interaction and Immunity Modulation

**Research Question:** What are the surface-exposed molecules on helminth parasite extracellular vesicles (EVs) that participate in ligand-receptor interactions with host cells to initiate vesicle docking and internalisation, and how do they modulate host immunity?

**Methods:** We used membrane-imperable biotin reagent to capture proteins on the outer surface of two subpopulations of EVs (15 and 120 EV) released by adult Fasciola hepatica, and identified 380 proteins, including virulence factors, membrane proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis/trafficking. Proteomics and immunistochemical analysis revealed that 120 EV have endosomal origin and are released via the protonephial excretory system, while 15 EV are released from gastrodermal epithelial cells lining the fluke gut. Lectin microarray strategy profiled the topology of surface oligosaccharides on intact fluorically labelled EVs displayed to the host.

**Findings:** The lectin profiles of 15 and 120 EV subpopulations are identical but distinct from the parasite tegument, predominated by high mannose sugars. EVs were resistant to exo and end-glycosases, but glycosidase F remodelled surface oligosacides and blocked uptake by host macrophages. Pre-treatment with antibodies from infected hosts or purified against EV surface proteins (DM-containing, CD63 and myferlin) significantly enhanced internalisation.

**Implications:** This study highlights the diversity of EV biogenesis and trafficking pathways by F. hepatica and sheds light on molecular interactions between EVs and host cells. Understanding EV-packaged molecules transfer to host cells is critical for therapeutic design. The cohort of proteins exposed on EV surface and displayed glycosylation is crucial for host-paras interaction.

**Conclusions:** This study characterises the surface proteins and oligoscharides on 15 and 120 F. hepatica EVs, revealing how they are formed and trafficked and interact with host cells. Glycosylation plays a key role in host-paras relationship. EVs are resistant to exo and end-glyases, but glycosidase remodels surface and blocks uptake. Pre-treatment with antibodies enhances internalisation. These findings have implications for blocking parasite-host interaction and immunity modulation.

**Title:** Regulation of microRNA (mi) Transcription and Processing by the DOF Transcription Factor C2 (CDF2) in Plant Development

**Research Question:** How does the DOF transcription factor C2 (CDF) regulate microRNA (mi) transcription and processing in plant development?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of CDF2 in microRNA biogenesis at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified CDF as a transcription factor that interacts with Dicer-like 1 (DCL) and regulates the accumulation of a population of microRNAs. C2 binds directly to the promoters of microRNAs and acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor of these microRNA genes. C2 preferentially binds to primary microRNAs (pri-miRN) regulated by itself and affects CL-mediated processing of these pri-miRN.

**Findings:** Our results show that C2 regulates a group of pri-mRNAs at both transcriptional and post-transcription levels to maintain proper levels of mature microRN to control plant development. We found that C2 regulates expressions of components involved in microRNA biogenesis, suggesting it may affect microRNA biogenesis by regulating these levels. Furthermore, C2-regulated microRNAs are involved in flowering, including mi156, mi160, mi167, mi172, mi165/mi166, and mi319. We investigated the contribution of these microRN to the early flowering phenotype of c2 mutant and focused on mi156 and mi172, widely studied microRN.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that C2 regulates microRNA biogenesis indirectly by regulating expressions of micro processing proteins in addition to direct transcriptional and postcription regulations of pri-mRN. This is supported by increased D1 level in hyl-2 and se-1 mutants and increased SE in h1-2 mutant. Consistent with this, mi156 mutant flowers earlier and mi172 flowers, in accordance with early flowering of c2 with decreased mi156 and increased SPL proteins whereas mi172 and decreased AP2 in c supporting role of C2 in micro regulation.

**Conclusions:** We conclude that C2 regulates a group of pri-mRN at transcriptional and postcription levels to maintain proper levels of microRN to control plant development through coordination of transcription and processing of pri-mRN. Our study highlights the importance of C2 in micro biogenesis and its potential regulatory network in plant development. Further investigation of feedback among components in micro biogenesis is warranted.

**Title:** Geranylgeranyl Diphosphate (GG) Mediates Oocyte-Granulosa Cell Communication and Regulates Primary Follicular Transition in Follicogenesis

**Research Question:** What is the role of geranyl diphosphate (GG) in oocyte-granosa cell communication and primary follicular transition during follicogenesis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of GG, a metabolic intermediate in protein geranylation, in oocyte-gran cell communication and primary follicular transition using mouse models.

**Findings:** GG levels increased in oocytes during early follicular development. Depletion of GG in oocytes impaired granosa cell proliferation, primary follicular transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GG inhibited Rho GTPase geranylation and GTPase activity, leading to accumulation of junction proteins in oocyte cytoplasm and disrupted oocyte-granosa contact. GG also blocked Rab27 geranylation, affecting o material secretion, such as GDF9. GG administration restored defects in o-granosa contact, granosa proliferation, and primary follicular transition in GG-depleted mice.

**Implications:** Our study provides evidence that GG-mediated geranylation contributes to o-gran cell communication and regulates primary follicular transition, a critical phase of follicogenesis for reproductive function.

**Conclusions:** GG, a metabolic intermediate in geranylation, plays a crucial role in oocyte-gran cell communication and follicular transition. GG depletion impairs granosa proliferation, follicular transition, and female fertility, while GG administration restores defects in GG-depleted mice. Our findings highlight the importance GG-mediated geranylation in oocyte-gran cell communication and follicular transition, essential for female reproductive function.

**Title:** Elucidating the Pathways of Nucleotide Triphosphate (NTP) Entry into the Active Site of RNA Polymerase II through Structural Modeling and Molecular Dynamics Simulations

**Research Question:** Despite extensive biochemical and biophysical studies, the exact route of nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) entry into the active site of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) remains unclear, with both the secondary and main channels proposed as potential pathways. Crystallographic structures of Pol II have shed light on the structural basis of transcription, but the conformation of the unpaired non-template DNA part of the transcription bubble (TB) is unknown.

**Methods:** We built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble using multiple sources of existing structural data and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to shed light on NTP pathways.

**Findings:** Although both channels have enough space to allow N loading, the percentage of conformations with space for NTP through the secondary channel is twice that of the main. Energetic simulations with N loaded in channels revealed diffusion through the main is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between N and negatively charged backbone nucleotides in non-template DNA.

**Implications:** Our results suggest the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription. The role of the main channel remains controversial due to the non-template part of the bubble overlapping with the channel, crucial for studying N diffusion, but absent in available structures.

**Conclusions:** A structural model of Pol elong complex with complete bubble is crucial for investigating NTP routes. We built a model with transcription extending DNA/template strands and nascent mRNA to 47 and 18 nucleotides, respectively, equilating after 15ns in simulations. The mean deviation of C atoms 3 in the first 10, afterwards slightly increasing to 3. The downstream of the bubble overlaps the proposed to accommodate incoming N, while the bubble is not in crystallographic or conformation too flexible to be resolved in available structures.

**Title:** Estimating the True Burden of Dengue Disease in Thailand and Cambodia: A Prospective Cohort Study to Inform Public Health Interventions

**Research Question:** Despite being a reportable disease in Thailand and Cambodia, the reported incidence of deng significantly underestimates the true burden of the disease. This study aimed to estimate the magnitude of deng underrecognition and establish accurate disease burden estimates for these countries using laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases from prospective cohort studies.

**Methods:** Cohort studies were conducted among children <15 years of age members of a deng field site consortium over at least 2 deng seasons. Age-specific multiplication factors (MF) were computed by comparing data from cohort to national surveillance in the same province and year. In Thailand, 14,627 person-years of cohort data were obtained in two provinces and 14,493-years from one in Cambodia. Average incidence of laboratory-confirmed deng was 23/1,000 and 25/1,000 in Thailand, and 41/1,000 in Cambodia.

**Findings:** Calculated MF in provinces varied by age and year (range 0.4-29). Average age-specific MF were applied to country-level data indicating in Thailand 229,886 (210,612-331,236) deng cases annually 2003-2007 and 111,178 (80,452-357,135) in Cambodia. Underrecognition total inpatient deng cases 8.7 and 2.6 in Thailand, and 9.1 and 1.4 in Cambodia. During high-incidence 2007, >95,000 in Thailand and >58,000 in Cambodia estimated hospitalized due to deng.

**Implications:** Calculating MF by prospective study to surveillance is an approach to accurately assess burden. Data indicate although deng reported many countries, surveillance significantly underestimates true of disease.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the high burden deng poses to age in Southeast Asia and similar magnitude disease earlier cohort in region. Disease burden, distribution, cases, or between mild and severe deng might be different in d-endemic regions like Americas. Country-specific factors from studies or capture useful application national data assess true burden and economic assessments.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Natural Killer (NK) Cells in Orchestrating Antiviral Defense: Accelerating CD8 T Cell Responses and Modulating Innate Immunity

**Research Question:** How do natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the orchestration of antiral defense against viral infections, beyond their direct antiv effects?

**Methods:** We employed a well-defined molecular interactions between mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and NK cells using congenic or mutant mice and genetically engineered viruses to examine the consequences of defects in NK control of CMV on antiv CD8 cell responses.

**Findings:** Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that NK cells accelerate CD8 cell responses against viral infection in vivo. We identified the underlying mechanism as the ability of NK cells to limit IFNα/β production, which is immunosuppressive to the host. This is achieved through early control of cytomegalovirus, reducing activation of plasmacyoid dendritic cells (pDC) cytokine production, preserving conventional dendritic cell (DC) compartment, and accelerating antiv CD8 cell responses. Conversely, exogenous IFα administration in animals ablates DCs and delays CD8 cell activation in the face of NK control viral replication.

**Implications:** Our data show that NK cell responses to cytgalovirus infection critically contribute to the balance of innate responses, dampening immunopathology and promoting initiation of antiv CD8 cell. The extent to which NK responses benefit the host goes beyond direct effects and extends to prevention of cytokine shock and promotion of adaptive immunity.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals that NK cells serve not only as effector lymphocytes but also as regulators of immune defenses against viral infections by controlling pDC functions, modulating cytokine milieu early after challenge, and accelerating generation of effector antiv CD8 cells. These findings bring original advances to understanding of NK contributions to immunity against infectious disease, demonstrating their control of pDC, modulation of cytokine production, and acceleration of antiv CD8 cell responses.

**Key Takeaways:**

* NK cells promote accelerated generation of effector antiv CD8 cells during infection by preventing high immunosup cytokine levels
* NK cells dampen cytok production by pDC and promote conditions for initiation of antiv CD and CD8 cell responses
* Efficient NK responses to cytovirus accelerate development of eff antiv CD8 cell
* NK cells orchestrate antiral defense beyond direct effects, preventing cytok shock and promoting adaptive immunity

**Title:** Regulation of rRNA Gene Expression in Arabidopsis thaliana: A Novel Role of Nucleolin Protein in Controlling Active and Repressed rRNA Variants

**Research Question:** How does the nucleolin protein (NUC1) regulate the expression of rRNA genes in Arabidopsis thalian, and what is the molecular basis of this regulation?

**Methods:** We employed a systematic cloning and sequencing strategy to characterize 3'ETS rRNA and pre-rRNA transcribed sequences from wild-type (WT) and AtNU-L mutant Arabidopsis thalian plants. We also analyzed chromatin condensation, preRNA accumulation, and histone epigenetic marks in WT and At-L mutant plants.

**Findings:** We identified four major rRNA variants in Arabid thalian, with one induced, repressed, or unaltered in WT plants. Notably, the most represented rRNA variant, inactive in WT, is reactivated in At-L mutants. We show that pre-rRNAs originate from Pol I transcription and are accurately processed. Moreover, disruption of AtNU-L induces loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without affecting histone epigen marks at r genes.

**Implications:** Our results reveal a novel mechanism of r gene regulation, where nucleolin plays a major role in controlling active and repressed r variants in Arabid thalian. We propose that At-L associates with potentially transcriptionally active r genes at one of the two NORs, and binds to r promoter sequences directing transcription from T.

**Conclusions:**

1. Nucleolin protein (NU1) regulates r gene expression in Arabid thalian by controlling active and repressed r variants.
2. Disruption ofNU-L induces loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without affecting histone epigen marks r genes.
3. preRNAs originate from Pol I transcription and are accurately processed.
4. At-L associates with transcriptionally active r genes at one of two NORs.
5. At-L binds r promoter directing transcription from T.

This study provides new insights into the molecular basis of r gene regulation in Arab thalian, highlighting the role of nucleolin in controlling active and repressed r variants. Our findings have implications for understanding gene regulation in eukaryotic cells, where nucleolin is one of the most abundant non-ribosomal proteins in the nucleus.

**Title:** Histone Deacetylation Regulates Human Cytomegalovirus Gene Expression through Interaction with the NuRD Complex

**Research Question:** How does histone deacetylation influence human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gene expression, and what proteins interact with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) in the context of infection?

**Methods:** We employed a rapid immunoprecipitation of epit-tagged protein coupled with mass spectrometry to identify candidate HD1-interacting proteins during CMV infection. Putative interactors included multiple CMV-coded proteins, particularly p38 and p29. The interaction of p38 and p29 with HD1 was confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitations. HD1 is present in numerous complexes, including the HD1-containing nucleosome remodeling deetylase complex, Nu. p38 and p29 associated with the TA component of Nu, and RNA-mediated knockdown of RBP and CH4 constituents of Nu inhibited CMV immediateearly and viral DNA accumulation.

**Findings:** Multiple components of the Nu complex are needed for efficient CM replication. Consistent with a positive role for Nu elements during replication, growth of p29- or p38-deficient viruses could not be rescued by treating cells with deetyl inhibitor trichostatin. Transient expression of p29 enhanced CM majorearly activity in a reporter assay, regardless of p expression. Importantly, induction of majorearly activity by p29 required Nu components, consistent with inhibition of RNA accumulation after knock of RBP and CH4.

**Implications:** We propose that p29 modifies the Nu complex to stimulate accumulation of early RNAs.

**Conclusion:** Histone deetylation plays a pivotal role in regulating CMV gene expression through interaction with the Nu complex. HD1 associates with multiple viral proteins, including p38 and p29, which are required for efficient CM replication. The Nu complex is necessary for CM replication, as knockdown of RBP and CH4 constituents inhibited viral DNA and RNA accumulation. Deetyl inhibitor trichatin could not rescue p29 or p-deficient viruses, suggesting a positive role for Nu elements during replication. Transient expression of p29 enhanced major activity in a reporter, and induction required Nu components, consistent with inhibition after knock of RBP and CH4.

**Title:** Elucidating the Antibody Repertoire Following Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Infection and Its Evolution Through Adolescence and Adulthood

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the antibody repertoire following Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection and its evolution through adolescence and adulthood, focusing on the epitopes of the RSV fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins.

**Methods:** Whole-genome fragment display libraries (GFPDL) expressing linear and conformational epitopes of the RSV F and G proteins were used for unbiased epitope profiling of sera from infants prior and post-RSV infection. FFP analyses demonstrated modest changes in anti-epitope repertoire post-R infection, while GDL revealed a 100-fold increase in number of bound epitopes. Panels of F and G antigen sites were synthesized to evaluate sera from children (<2yr), adolescents (14-18yr), and adults (30-45) in real-time kinetics assays.

**Findings:** A steady increase in RSV epit repertoire from children to adults was observed using peptides and proteins. Importantly, novel epitopes were identified in pre-fusion and immunodominant epitope in F27. In all groups, antibody to pre-fusion was 2-3 folds higher than post-fusion. RSV antibody responses were high following early R infection in children but declined in adults using G proteins or peptides.

**Implications:** This study unraveled the evolution of anti-F and anti-G responses, supporting immune-driven evolution of RSV. These findings can aid in the development of effective countermeasures, including vaccines.

**Conclusion:** This study elucidated the antibody repertoire following RSV infection and its evolution through adolescence and adulthood, providing insights into the epitopes of RSV F and G proteins. The findings support the development of effective countermeasures against RSV disease.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of Emodeide, a Promising Macrofilaricidal Agent against Filarial Parasites

**Research Question:** What is the mode of action of emodeide, a veterinary anthelmint, against adult filarial nematodes, specifically Brugia malayi, and how does alternative splicing of the Slo-1 channel affect its potency?

**Methods:** We employed whole-parasite motility assays, patch-clamp recordings of muscle cells, and RNAi knockdown of Slo-1 channels in Xenopus lavis oocytes to investigate the mechanism of action of emide against Brug malayi. Additionally, in silico modeling was used to identify the binding pocket of emide in the RCK region of Slo-1.

**Findings:** Emide potently inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. RNAi knockdown suggests emide targets Slo-1 channels, specifically the Slo-1 isoforms with alternatively spliced exons at the RCK (Regulator of Conductance Potassium) domain. The Slo-1 isoform found in muscles of males is more sensitive to emide than the Slo-1 iso found in females. Selective RNAi of Slo-1 iso in females increased emide potency. In Onchercavolus, causing river blindness, has two isoforms in females with homology to Slo-1A and Slo-1 at RCK domain. In silico modeling identified an emide binding pocket in the RCK region of different species of filaria affected by splice variations.

**Implications:** Emide has potent macrofilaridal effects, and alternative splicing in the R1 binding pocket affects potency. Evaluation of sex-dependent effects of anthelmint compounds is crucial to prevent underdosing of one gender of nematodes given to patients.

**Conclusions:** Emide, a veterinary anthint, is a promising macrofilar agent against adult filarial nematodes, specifically Brug mal. Alternative splicing of the Slo-1 channel affects its potency, highlighting the importance of evaluating sex-dependent effects of anthelmint compounds to prevent underosing one gender of nematodes given to patients.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Loa loa Cross-reactivity with Wuchereria bancrofti Rapid Diagnostic Tests: Implications for Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination

**Background:** The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) relies on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to determine where mass administration of annual drug for LF is required and when it can be stopped. These tests detect Wuchereria bancrofti glycoprotein in the blood of infected persons via a carbohydrate moiety recognized by monoclonal antibodies AD12 and DH.5. Loa cross-reactivity with RDTs has been recognized as a serious obstacle to LF elimination in loa-endemic areas.

**Research Question:** To understand the nature of this cross-reactivity, we used DH.5 to immunoaffinity purify Loa antigens from sera of individuals with positive RDT to loa.

**Methods:** Immunoblot analysis revealed circulating AD/DH.5-reactive antigens, and proteomic analysis identified multiple Lo proteins in RDT-positive loa sera, including secreted and somatic proteins, suggesting they may be released by Loa adult and/or microfilar.

**Findings:** Unlike the high molecular weight bancft circulating filarial antigen present in blood of bancft-infected persons, Loa antigens appeared transiently present in blood subset persons loa.

**Implications:** Differences between circulating antigens bancft and Lo can be used to differentiate results generated by species and lead to improved tests LF and loa.

**Conclusion:** Loa antigens occur by process different from bancft CFA. We believe mechanism loa cross-react with bancft RDT is death Loa and adult associated release multiple AD glycoprote into circulation and imbalance release and clearance antigens accounts detection circulation some loa patients. Serum from R-negative loa, including individuals previously bancft R positive, were negative AD antig by western blot. We analyzed immunoaff-purified antig from sample and pooled by protease digestion LC/MS/MS, matching spectra available Loa genomes.

**Title:** Identification of Novel Ciliary Genes and Characterization of RAB-28, a GTPase Associated with Bardet-Bied Syndrome, in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** What are the novel ciliary genes involved in cilium formation and function, and how do they interact with the Bardet-Bied syndrome (BBS) protein complex in Caenorhabditis elegans?

**Methods:** We employed whole-organ RNA-Seq libraries to identify a signature profile of ciliary transcripts in C. elegans, which revealed a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, including orthologues of human MAPK, YAP, CC149, and R28. Further analysis of C. elegans R-28, associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, showed that this GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons and associates with intraflagellar transport (IFT) in a BBS-dependent manner.

**Findings:** R-28 is a novel IFT and Bome-associated protein with autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base, maintaining cilium structure and sensory function. Overexpression of predicted or inactive forms of R-28 perturbed cilium and sensory morphogenesis.

**Implications:** This study presents a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins and unveils R-28, a GTPase closely related to B protein R4/IFT, as an IFT cargo with Bome-dependent cell and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base. Our findings contribute to understanding cilium biology and disease mechanisms.

**Conclusions:** C elegans is a powerful model for discovering new ciliary genes and uncovering IFT function and disease mechanisms. We identified a unique expression profile ciliary using RNA-Seq and confirmed known and novel ciliary proteins. R-28 is a novel IFT and B-associated protein with autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base. Overexpression of predicted or inactive forms of R-28 leads to cilium and sensory morphogenesis defects. This study contributes to understanding cilium biology and disease mechanisms.

**Title:** Decoding the External World through Neural Activity: Unveiling the Brain's Representation of Space using Hippocampal Place Cells

**Research Question:** How does the brain represent the external world without direct access to external stimuli, relying solely on neural responses to decode meaning?

**Methods:** We investigated the representation of space using action potentials (spikes) of stereotyped but unknown receptive fields of hippocampal cells as a model system.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals surprising structure in the underlying stimulus space, enabling the brain to construct its internal representations. Specifically, we show that:

1. Global features of the environment can be extracted
2. An accurate representation of space, up to an overall scale, can be constructed to track the animal's position

**Implications:** Unlike previous approaches reconstructing position from place activity, this information is derived without knowing place fields or other neural responses relating to position. Our findings suggest that simple knowledge of which groups of hippocamp cells fire is sufficient to infer global topological features and geometric reconstruction of physical space, including the animal's position.

**Conclusions:** Hippocamp place cell activity alone can be used to infer topological features of two-dimensional environment and geometric reconstruction of physical space, including the animal's position. No prior knowledge of place fields or independent measurements of position is required. This challenges the notion that place fields are necessary for reconstructing position from cell activity. Our results show that coarse features of population spiking activity yield significant information for constructing an accurate representation of space.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of the ROS/NLR3/IL-β Axis in the Pathogenesis of Viral Fulminant Hepatitis

**Background:** Viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a severe disease characterized by excessive inflammation in the liver, resulting in high mortality. Current clinical interventions are inefficient due to the lack of understanding of inflammatory pathogenesis in virus-infected liver.

**Research Question:** What is the role of the ROS/NLR/IL-β axis in the pathogenesis of viral fulmin hepatitis?

**Methods:** Wild-type mice infected with murine hepatitis virus-3 (MH-3), a model for viral FH, exhibited severe disease and mortality associated with significant elevation of IL-β in serum and liver. In contrast, viral infection in IL-1 receptor deficient (IL-1-) or IL-1 antagonist (IL-Ra) mice showed reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality. IL-1 deficiency debilitated virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (F2) production in macrophages and CD+Gr1 neutrophil infiltration in liver. Release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by infected macrophages suggested plausible initiation of NLR inflamome activation.

**Findings:** Mice deficient in p47, nicotin adenine dinucleotide (NAD) oxidase subunit controlling ROS production, showed reductions in NLR inflamome activation and IL-β secretion during viral infection, responsible for resilience to viral FH. Infected animals of NLR and Casp-1, components of inflamome complex, also reduced IL-β induction with ameliorated hepatitis. Our results demonstrate the ROS/NLR/IL- axis essential pathway, activated causing severe liver disease during viral infection, shedding light on efficient treatments for human FH and other inflammatory diseases.

**Implications:** The ROS/NLR/IL- axis plays a double-edged role in host immunity, hepatotropic virus like MH-3 infection inducing inflammation and life-threatening FH. In response to MH-3 infection, IL-1- mice showed limited fibrin formation, modulating liver coagulation necrosis. IL-Ra-treated mice reduced F2 fibrin deposition, followed by decreased liver damage and enhanced survival. Administration of IL-β in MH- infected pphox- mice reinstated disease aspects of severity in FH.

**Conclusion:** Our study elucidates NLR inflome-dependent ILβ production, primary signaling pathway for host immunity against pathogen invasions, playing a critical role in pathogenesis viral FH.

**Title:** Hookworm Infections as a Cause of Severe Anemia and Iron Deficiency in Children in the Tropics: A Multiplex Real-Time PCR Evaluation of Species-Specific Prevalence and Load in Pre-School Children in Malawi

**Research Question:** What is the prevalence and load of hookworm species (Ancylostoma duoden and Necator american) infections and their association with severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children in Malawi?

**Methods:** A case-control study of 830 fecal samples from pre-school children in Malawi was conducted using multiplex real-time PCR to evaluate hook species-specific prevalence, load, and their contribution to severe anemia and iron deficiency.

**Findings:** Hook infections were found in 34.1% of severely anemic cases and 27.0% of non-severely anemic controls (p<0.05), while 5.6% hookworm prevalence was detected by microscopy. Prevalence of A. duale and N. american was 26.1% and 4.9% respectively. Moderate and high A. duale infections were associated with severe anemia (adjusted odds ratio: 2.49 (95%CI 1.16-5.33) and 9.04 (95%CI 2.52-32.47) respectively). Iron deficiency assessed through bone examination was associated with intensity of A. duale infection (adjusted ratio: 3.63 (95% 1.18-11.20); 16.98 (95% 3.88.74.35) and 44.91 (95%5.23.385.77) for low, moderate, and high respectively.

**Implications:** This is the first report assessing association of hook load and species with severe anemia and bone iron deficiency. Revealing higher than expected prevalence of A. duale and significant load association with anemia and iron in pre-school in Malawi demonstrates the need for quantitative species-specific screening of hook infections. Multiplex real PCR is a powerful tool for public health to combat severe anemia and iron in children in resource settings.

**Conclusion:** Using multiplex real PCR for hook identification revealed hidden burden in pre-school in Malawi, hookworm was higher than expected. We shown hook infections, mainly A. duale, significantly associated with anemia and iron deficiency in pre in Malawi. Strengths of this study is sample size and comprehensive data. Need for quantitative screening species-specific hook infections demonstrated higher than expected A. duale and its contribution to anemia bone iron in pre in Malawi.

**Title:** Regulation of Double-Strand Break Repair Pathway Choice in Caenorhabditis elegans Meiosis: A Critical Role of COM-1 in Preventing Non-Homologous End Joining and Ensuring Interhomolog Crossovers

**Research Question:** How does the double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway influence meiotic chromosome segregation in Caenorhabditis elegans, and what is the role of COM-1 in regulating this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of COM-1, a homolog of Ct/Sae2tp, in regulating DS repair choice during C. elegans gametogenesis. We generated COM-1-deficient germ cells and observed meiotic DSB repair via error-prone non-holog end joining (NHE), resulting in lack of interolog crosso (CO) and extensive chromosomal abnormalities.

**Findings:** COM-deficient cells repair meiotic DSB via NHE, leading to lack of CO, chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality. Unlike its yeast counterparts, COM1 is not required for Spo11 initiation of meiotic D repair but promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting NHE complex. In fact, defective both COM1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation. Genetic dissection revealed COM acts parallel nuclease EX-1 to promote interolog HR early pachytene stage meiotic prophase, safeguarding CO formation. Both nucleases are dispensable RAD51 recruitment late pachene stage when hom-independent pathways predominate.

**Implications:** Our results uncover potentially lethal properties NHE during meiosis and identify critical role COM1 in NHE inhibition and CO assurance in germ cells.

**Conclusions:**

1. COM1 is crucial to prevent NHE activity in meiotic cells.
2. Ku can efficiently act on meiotic Ds at least when COM activity is perturbed.
3. COM-independent mechanism exists to convert SPO-induced Ds into proper chiasm.
4. Unlike Sae/C1 in yeast, COM is not required SPO removal in C elegans.

**Key findings:**

* COM- is not required for initiation meiotic D repair but needed to channel Ds into HR.
* COM is dispensable for meiotic recombination but crucial for meiosis.
* COM blocks Ku activity at meiotic Ds, preventing aggregation and CO failure.
* COM-independent mechanism converts SPO-induced Ds into chiasm.
* Unlike Sae/C1 in yeast, COM is not required S removal in C.

**Title:** Characterization of the Humoral Immune Response to Burkholderia pseudomallei Infection in a Caprine Model of Melioidosis

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the humoral immune response to Burkholderia pseudallei infection in a caprine model of meloidosis, with the goal of identifying immunogenic proteins for diagnostics and vaccine candidates.

**Methods:** Eight goats were infected with B. pseudallei via intratracheal aerosol, and antigen profiling was generated from the infecting strain MSH511. Humoral responses were analyzed by ELISA and western blot, and antigens were identified by mass spectrometry. Throughout the course of infection, results demonstrated a greater humoral response with IgG antibodies in both breadth and quantity compared to IgM.

**Findings:** Pre-infection sera showed multiple immunogenic proteins reactive for IgG (7-20) and IgM (0-12) in most goats despite no previous exposure to B.alle. After infection, the number of Ig reactive proteins showed a marked increase as disease progressed. Early infection (day 7) showed reaction to chaper proteins (Gro, EF-T, and DK). These proteins were detected in all serum samples after infection with Gro immunodominant. Seven reactive antigens were selected for further analysis ELISA. Heat shock protein Gro1 elicited the strongest antibody response compared to other antigens. Most antigens showed peak IgM reactivity at day 14, while Ig reactivity increased as disease progressed. An MSH511 proteomic comparison between goat and human sera showed many reactive proteins common between humans and meloid.

**Implications:** B. pseudalle aerosol induced increasing and diverse antibody response over disease in goats. Characterized Ig and IgM responses in individual serum samples using 2D electrophores and western blots.

**Conclusions:** This study characterized the humoral response to B pseudalle in a caprine model of meloid, identifying immunogenic proteins for diagnostics and vaccine candidates. Outbred goats more accurately mimic human infection compared to inbred models. Balle was delivered intratracheal, antigen protein profiling generated from infecting strain MSH511. Humoral responses analyzed by ELISA and western, antigens identified by spectrometry. Results demonstrated greater humoral response IgG in breadth and quantity compared to IgM. Pre-infection showed multiple proteins reactive IgG (7-20) and IgM (0-12) in goats despite no previous exposure. After infection, Ig reactive proteins increased as disease progressed. Early infection showed reaction chaper proteins Gro, EF, and DK. These proteins detected all serum after infection with Gro immunodominant. Seven antigens selected ELISA, Gro1 elicited strongest response compared other antigens. Most antigens showed IgM reactivity day 14, Ig reactivity increased disease. MSH511 comparison goat human sera showed reactive proteins common humans meloid.

**Title:** Unveiling the Temporal Dynamics of Cyclin B-Cdk Activation in Human Cells: A Novel Insights into Mitotic Progression and Exit

**Research Question:** How does cyclin B-Cdk activation proceed in human cells during mitosis, and what are the implications for mitotic progression and exit?

**Methods:** We employed a novel approach to quantify dephosphorylation of Cdk and phosphorylation of Cdk target anaphase-promoting/cycome 3 in single cells to determine the temporal development of cyclin B-Cdk activity.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that cyclin B-Cdk continues to be activated after centros separation, and cytoplasmic cyclin-Cdk activity can be maintained even when cyclin B translocates to the nucleus in prophase. Importantly, we discovered that cyclin-Cdk levels required to enter mitosis are lower than the amount cycl-Cdk needed for mitotic progression. We propose that gradually increasing cycl-Cdk activity after centros separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that mitotic cyclin-Cdk activity needs to increase after mit entry and pass a threshold before metaphase to allow efficient mitotic progression and exit. We propose that distinct thresholds for cycl-Cdk activity control successive mitotic events.

**Conclusion:** This study provides novel insights into the temporal dynamics of cyclin-C activation in human cells, revealing a striking resemblance to bistable circuit. Our data suggest that gradually increasing cycl-C activity after centros separation is crucial for mitotic coordination.

**Title:** HIV-1 Superinfection Promotes the Development of Broad and Potent Neutralizing Antibody Responses in Women Exposed to Diverse HIV-1 Subtypes

**Research Question:** Does HIV-1 superinfection (SI) lead to the development of a broad and potent neutralizing antibody (Nab) response in women exposed to diverse HIV-1 subtypes, and if so, do the epitopes targeted after SI differ from those targeted after single infection?

**Methods:** We analyzed plasma samples from 21 Kenyan women exposed to HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D, and superinfected after a median of 1.07 years following initial infection. Plasma samples were collected at a median 2.72 years post-SI. We focused on the 4 main epitopes on HIV-1 Envelope: CD-binding site, V1/V glycan, N332 site V3, and membrane proximal external gp41.

**Findings:** Using epitope mapping and computational analyses, we found that SI did not induce a dominant response to any of these epitopes in 21 women. Computational delineation suggested that 20/21 superinfected women's responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These data support a model where SI with diverse subtypes promotes a polyclonal Nab response.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that HIV-1 superfection may drive the development of a broad and potent Nab response, mediated by polycl antibodies targeting multiple epitopes. This supports vaccine designs using multivalent immunogens to elicit a diverse Nab repertoire.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to examine epit specificities in a cohort superinf individuals. Our data indicate that exposure to diverse HIV-1 antigens following SI may drive a broad and potent response. This has implications for developing a Nab-based vaccine against diverse HIV-1 subtypes.

**Title:** Congenital Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Infection Downregulates Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes) Protein in Neural Progenitor Cells through Immediate-Early 1 (IE1) Mediated Ubiquitination

**Research Question:** How does congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection affect the expression of Hairy enhancer of split (Hes) protein in neural progenitor cells, and what is the underlying mechanism of this regulation?

**Methods:** Human neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were infected with the Towne strain of CMV at a multiplicity of infection (MO) of 3. Protein levels of Hes were examined by immunoblotting (IB) from 4h to 96h post-infection.

**Findings:** CMV infection downregulates Hes protein in NPCs through the immediate-early 1 (IE) protein, which assembles a ubiquitination complex and promotes Hes ubiquitination as a E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes. The C-terminal region of IE, spanning amino acids 451-475, is required for IE/Hes physical interaction and IE-mediated Hes ubiquination, but is dispensable for IE/SpA interaction and ubiquination.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism linking downregulation of Hes protein to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by CM infection. Our findings complement current knowledge of herpesviruses by identifying IE as the first CM-encoded E ubiquitin ligase.

**Conclusions:** As a downstream effector of Notch signaling, Hes regulates the fate of NPCs by repressing transcription of pro-neural genes and plays an essential role in maintaining stem status of NPCs, governing differentiation towards neurons or glia, and fetal development. Congital CM infection is one of the common causes of disabilities in children. We previously reported CM dysregulates Notch by targeting Not1, including intracellular domain (NIC) and ligand Jag. Moreover, an important effector in Notch, regulation Hes expression in NPCs is disrupted by CM infection. Our results indicate IE-mediated Hes downregulation is linked to interaction between two proteins which requires AA-475 region within C-terminal of IE.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Transcription Factor Binding and Gene Expression Divergence in the Drosophila Genus

**Research Question:** How does transcription factor binding divergence contribute to gene expression variation in the Drosila genus, and what are the underlying mechanisms driving this divergence?

**Methods:** We conducted a systematic study of transcription factor binding and expression in blastoderm embryos of four Drosila species (D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis) using mRNA-seq for gene expression and ChIP-seq for genome-wide binding of four transcription factors involved in anterior-posterior patterning.

**Findings:** Our results show that mRNA levels are more conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and changes in gene expression are poorly explained by changes in transcription factor binding. However, highly bound sites in regions bound by multiple factors and near genes are conserved more frequently than other binding, suggesting a considerable amount of transcription binding is weak or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection. We found that the extent of conservation for each factor decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between species, and few regions were bound by any factor in all four species.

**Implications:** Our study reveals that transcription factor binding has diverged considerably within the Dila genus, with little effect on downstream gene expression. We identified two potential sources of binding divergence: alterations of B, HB, GT, and KR motifs drive a portion of binding, and phylogenetic inertia contributes to divergence. We also found that mRNA levels are highly correlated between species, with correlation decaying with phylogenetic distance, and divergence of mRNA is lower than TF binding.

**Conclusions:** This study addresses the genomic and consequences of transcription factor binding divergence on gene expression. Our findings suggest that genomic binding of A factors has changed extensively along theila tree with little effect on downstream expression. We propose two sources of binding divergence: motif alterations and phylogen inertia. These results highlight the complex relationship between transcription factor binding and gene expression divergence, and have implications for understanding the evolution of gene regulation in theila genus.

**Title:** Monitoring and Evaluation of Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programmes: A Large-Scale Study in Two Primary Health Centres in Thanjav District, India

**Research Question:** To assess the effectiveness of the lymphatic filariasis elimination programme in two primary health centres in Thanjav district, India, where eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) had been completed, and identify potential "hotspots" of transmission.

**Methods:** A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centres in Thanjav district, India, where eight rounds of MDA had been completed. A total of 50,363 individuals were screened for microfilaria (M) and antigenemia (Ag) levels. Prevalence and intensity of M per 60µl blood were 0.2% and 0.004, respectively. Corresponding values for Ag were 2.3% and 17.3 Ag-units. Prevalence ranged from 0.7 to 0.9% in children (2-10 years) and 2.7 to 3.0 in adults.

**Findings:** Although M-levels in sentinel spot sites were <1% and Ag-level was <2 in children, we identified 7 "residual" M-preval ≥1, irrespective of Ag-status in children and 17 "transmission" at least Ag-positive born during M period hotspots. Antigenemic persons clustered at household and site levels. We identified Ag-preval of 1% in children equivalent 0.4 M-preval as possible threshold for stopping M.

**Implications:** The study highlights the need for developing surveillance strategies to detect "hot"spots and adopting evidence-based sampling and evaluation size for Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS). The existence of "hot" and clustering of infections in the area indicate the need for effective interventions to prevent emergence and eliminate them. Filarial infections are known to be clustered at household level in endemic areas for filariasis.

**Conclusions:** The study suggests that despite eight rounds of M, transmission in the area has been reduced to <1 Ag-preval in children, supporting the decision to stop M in the area. However, identified sites with potential for resurgence and provided evidence for clustering of filarial infections. This study addresses the issues of sampling and threshold for decision-making in TAS. The findings have implications for the development of strategies to prevent emergence of "hot" and specific interventions to eliminate them when they persist or appear.

**Title:** Evaluating the Effectiveness of Temeph in Controlling Dengue Vectors and Transmission: A Systematic Review

**Research Question:** This systematic review aims to assess the community-effectiveness of temeph in controlling deng vectors and deng transmission when delivered as a single intervention or in combination with other interventions.

**Methods:** A comprehensive literature search of six databases (PubMed, WHO, WHOL, GIFT, CDS, EMBASE, Wiley) and grey literature was performed. Data were extracted and methodological quality of studies assessed independently by two reviewers. 27 studies were included in this review (11 single intervention and 16 combined studies).

**Findings:** All 11 single intervention studies showed that temeph led to reduction in entom indices. However, 11 of 16 combined studies showed tem application with other chemical control methods reduced entom indices, but not sustained over time or in five failed to reduce immature stages. Community-effect of tem was dependent on factors such as delivery quality, water rate, type, environmental (debris, temperature, sunlight) and timing of deployment, reapplication, behavioural (reluctance to drinking) and operational (cost, supplies, time, labour).

**Implications:** When applied as single, tem was effective in suppressing entom indices, but not when combined with other interventions. No evidence suggests tem use associated with reductions deng transmission.

**Conclusion:** This review highlights questions community-effectiveness of tem for deng control. While effectiveness in controlling breeding sites clear, level not clear when combined with interventions. No conclusive evidence regarding impact on d transmission. Although widely used worldwide, effectiveness varies greatly. Lack of data relating reductions entom to d transmission significant gap in deng epidemiology and vector efficacy.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Pericentric Cohesion: Distinct Roles of the Ctf Complex and C3 in Ensuring Sister Chromatid Cohesion

**Research Question:** How do the Ctf complex and C3 mediate perentric cohesion, a crucial for holding sister chromatids together from duplication to mitosis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the Ctf complex and C3 in perentric cohesion using budding yeast as a model organism.

**Findings:** We show that the Ctf complex and C3 are both important for perentric cohesion, but through distinct mechanisms. The Ctf directs increased cohes association with the perentric region, while C3 ensures its functionality in holding sister chromatids together. Cells lacking C3 show additive defects with mutants in the Ctf complex. Delaying replication rescues the defect in Ctf components, but not C3.

**Implications:** The Ctf complex ensures loading cohes at the centrom prior to replication fork passage, ensuring incorporation through a process requiring C3. C3 is essential for replisome integrity and association with cohesion factors traversing the protein-DNA barrier surrounding the centrom.

**Conclusions:**

1. The Ctf complex and C3 mediate perentric cohesion through distinct mechanisms, with Ctf directing cohes association and C3 ensuring functionality.
2. Ctf is essential for cohes loading at the centrom prior to replication, ensuring incorporation through C3.
3. C3 is crucial for replis integrity and association with cohesion factors, safeguarding chromosome segregation fidelity.
4. Ctf and C3 are conserved, with implications for other organisms with perentric heterochromatin.

**Key Findings:**

* Ctf is required for cohes enhancement in perentric [19], but function shared with other members unknown.
* C3 and Swi implicated in perentric cohesion screens meiosis and mitosis [9-11, 32].
* Iml and Chl direct cohes association perentric during mitosis and meiosis.
* Absence Iml and Chl reduces cohes perentric, affecting sisterid cohesion and segregation.
* Dedicated cohes loading ensures cohes prior replication fork passage in S.
* C3 ensures replis integrity and association cohesion establishment.
* Iml andl localized centrom, influencing cohes perentric.
* Ctf plays roles in perentric cohesion mitosis and meiosis.
* Ctf and C conserved, mechanism in organisms with perentric heterochatin.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of Dengue Virus Pathogenesis: A Systems Characterization of Serum Metabolome and Lipidome in Dengue Fever/Deng Hemorrhagic Fever Patients

**Research Question:** What are the temporal changes in serum metabolome and lipidome in adult patients with deng fever/deng hemorrhagic fever (DFHF) at early febrile, defesc, and convalescent stages of infection, and how do these changes relate to the underlying molecular mechanisms of deng pathogenesis?

**Methods:** Liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to characterize the serum metabolome and lipidome of 44 adult patients with DF at three stages of infection, compared to 50 healthy controls.

**Findings:** Sixty differential metabolites were identified, primarily in fatty acids, acylcarnines, phospholids, and amino acids. Major perturbed pathways included fatty acid biosynthesis, β-oxidation, phospholip catabism, and steroid pathway, indicating a multifactorial host response. Analysis of phospholids and sphingolids revealed temporal trends associated with lymphocytes and platelets, which normalized at convalescent stage, suggesting potential prognostic markers.

**Implications:** DENV causes distinct serumome and lipidome changes, with many metabolites involved in inflammatory responses. Global analysis revealed anti-inflammatory responses modulating early pro-inflammatory processes, preventing excessive or prolonged inflammation.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first example of omic approach divulging concurrent, dynamic host responses to DENV, offering physiological insights into why DF is self-limiting. Findings provide a detailed description of metabol changes in acute deng infection, a molecular view of homeostatic outcome. Identified metabolites may monitor disease progression and evaluate therapeutic efficacy.

**Title:** Mapping Neglected Tropical Diseases Research in Germany: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Partnerships and Expertise

**Research Question:** What is the current state of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) research in Germany, and what are the partnerships and expertise involved in this field?

**Methods:** A systematic search of the SCOPUS database was conducted for articles with German affiliations published between 2002-2012 on kinetoplast and helmin diseases. Bibliometric tools (OpenRefine, OpenMaps, and TableNet) were used to clean and analyze co-author networks (Gephi). From 26,833 publications, 1,187 (4.4%) had at least one German affiliation, and 972 were processed for the five most published diseases. 4,007 authors and 863 institutions were extracted to construct co-author networks.

**Findings:** The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries, Brazil. Collaborations with African partners on the continent were scattered. NTD research in Germany was distributed among 220 institutions. Strong performers were identified on an individual level using parameters (number of publications, h-index) and social analysis (between centrality). Network characteristics varied between diseases. The share of NTD publications with affiliations is half of its share in other medical fields.

**Implications:** This underlines the need to identify and expand Germany's strong research activities towards NTD. Spatial analysis of collaborations abroad can support decisions to strengthen capacity, particularly in low and middle-income countries less involved than high-income. Identifying knowledge within researcher networks complements traditional indicators to opportunities for collaboration.

**Conclusions:** Our findings contribute to prioritization efforts in German NTD at a time of local and global decisions. Using tools to analyze processes and output can facilitate data-driven policies.
Here is a 300-400 word abstract for the research article on Lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in Haiti:

**Research Question:** Can a mass drug administration (MDA) program led by the Ministry of Health and its international partners effectively control and eliminate Lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in Haiti, and what are the key factors contributing to its success?

**Methods:** A mass drug administration (MDA) program targeting LF and STH was implemented in Haiti since 2000, with a strong focus on community engagement, education, and direct observed treatment strategy. The program ensured community awareness through multi-channel communication campaigns, trained and respected community members as distributors, provided easy access to treatment, and quality data collection to inform strategies.

**Findings:** The program achieved 100% geographical coverage in 2012, exceeding epidemiological targets of 65% for LF and 75 for STH, and reduced infection burden in 45 communes below the threshold for stopping LF treatment. International support enabled sustained progress toward LF elimination and strong foundation for ST control.

**Implications:** The program established a global portfolio of best practices for NTD control and addresses two future challenges: maintaining ST control after LF treatment cessation and morbidity management for patients with lymphatic disease.

**Conclusions:** A successful MD campaign was launched in 200 with high coverage, resulting in steady progress toward LF elimination with more rounds in areas of high prevalence and fewer in low. Strong foundation for ongoing ST control was established. Key factors determining treatment uptake were knowledge of MD, ease of access, and direct observed treatment. As MD reaches stopping point, Haiti focuses on morbidity efforts, building on hydrocele and lymphedema support.

**Title:** Regulation of the Cell Cycle in Sinorhizobium meli: Unveiling the Role of Ctr in Cellular Differentiation and Symbiosis

**Research Question:** How does the cell cycle regulator Ctr contribute to cellular differentiation and symbiosis in Sinorizium meli, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with legume hosts?

**Methods:** We investigated the regulation and function of Ctr in S. meli using a combination of ChIP-Seq and gene microarray analysis, and demonstrated that depletion of Ctr causes cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to that observed in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. We also showed that cell cycle regulated proteolytic degradation of Ctr is essential in S. meli, suggesting a possible mechanism of Ctr depletion in differentiated bacteroids.

**Findings:** Our data suggest that S. mel Ctr regulates similar processes as C cresus Ctr, but through different genes. For example, our data indicate that Ctr does not control the expression of the F complex to control the timing of division during the cycle, but instead negatively regulates the septum-inhibiting Min system.

**Implications:** Our findings provide insight into how conserved genetic networks can evolve to fit diverse lifestyles of bacteria. The model of C cycle regulation in S mel developed in this work will be pivotal in elucidation how bacterial cycle is modulated by plant during symbiosis.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to investigate the regulation of C in an alphrote bacterium other than C cresus. Our results show that Ctr plays a key role in cellular differentiation and symbiosis in S mel, and highlight the importance of proteolytic degradation of C in regulating C levels. Furthermore, our data suggest that conserved genetic networks can be rewired to fit distinct lifestyles of bacteria, and provide a framework for understanding symbiotic interactions with legume hosts.

**Title:** Essential Role of γ-Glutamyl Transpeptase in Francisella tularens Intracellular Multiplication and Virulence

**Research Question:** How does Francisella tularens, a highly infectious bacterium causing zoonotic disease tularemia, utilize glutathione (GSH) and γ-glutyl-cystyl-glycine and γ-glutyl-cystine dipeptide as cystine sources to ensure intracellular growth and virulence?

**Methods:** A HimarFTposon mutants of the F. tularens live strain L were screened to isolate intracellular growth-deficient mutants, leading to the identification of a gene encoding a putative γ-glutyl transpeptase (GT), FTL_6, designated ggt. The ggt mutant showed impaired intracellular multiplication and attenuated virulence in mice.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that FTL_6 of F. tulns encodes a genuine GT involved in the metabolism of γ-glutyl-containing peptides, allowing the utilization of γ-glutyl peptides as a source of cystine during intracellular multiplication of the pathogen and is critical for virulence. F. tulareis serum resistance. The activity of GT provides a means for Francisella to utilize γutyl peptides as a source of amino acids and cystine, an essential for Francis. We show that G and γ-glutyl-cystine can functionally replace cystine to support growth of Francis in broth and that GT activity is required for cleaving the γutyl-cystine linkage. Furthermore, F. tulis GT functionally complements an E. coli GT-deficient strain by cleaving the-G bond of diptide-G-Leu, similar to genuine GT.

**Implications:** The capacity of intracellular pathogen to utilize available GSH as a source cystine in host cytos constitutes a paradigm of bacteria-host adaptation. This study highlights the essential role of nutrient acquisition system in intracellular multiplication of F. tularens, underscoring the importance of GT in virulence.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the first evidence of essential role of nutrient system in intracellular multiplication of F. tularens. Our results show that G and γ-glutyl-cystine can replace cystine to support growth of Francis in broth, and GT activity is required for cleaving γut-cystine linkage. The g mutant unable to cleave γut-cystine bond does not obtain sufficient cystine or cyst from surroundings to support growth, only addition of free cystine compensates enzymatic deficiency.

**Title:** Species-Specific Interactions between Parasitophorous Vacuoles of Leishmania Parasites: Implications for Parasite Fusion and Differentiation**

**Research Question:** Can parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) of Leishmania species fuse with each other, and what are the implications for parasite survival, multiplication, and differentiation?

**Methods:** Macrophages were infected with non-fluorescent L. amazonensis amastotes and 48 hours later superinfected with fluorescent L. major amastotes or promastigotes. Fusion was investigated by time-lapse acquisition of living cells and inferred from colocalization of parasites in the same PV. Survival, multiplication, and differentiation of parasites that did not share the same vacuoles were also investigated.

**Findings:** PVs of L. amazon and L. major did not fuse. However, PVs containing L. promastigotes fused with established L. amazon PVs. In chimeric vacoles, L. promastotes remained motile and multiplied, but did not differentiate into amastotes. In contrast, in doubly infected cells, unfused PV contained L. major promigotes, but log promastigotes were destroyed and differentiated into proliferating amastotes.

**Implications:** PVs, presumably by L. amast or promig, differ in ability to fuse L. amazon PV. Species-specific PV required L. major differentiation, a mechanism unknown. Observations in this paper useful for studies interactions PV different Leish species and mechanisms recognition fusion PV.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates species-specific interactions between PV Leish parasites, with implications for parasite survival, multiplication, and differentiation. Our findings suggest that PV of different Leish species can fuse, but species-specific requirements for fusion and differentiation exist. This has implications for understanding Leish speciation, genetic exchange, and mixed populations promig in insectectors. Live recordings of intracellular parasitism useful for further studies.

**Title:** Eliciting Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies against HIV-1 through Native Membrane-Expressed Env Trimers

**Research Question:** Can native membrane-expressed Env trimers elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against HIV-1?

**Methods:** We investigated the ability of native, membrane-expressed JRFL Env trimers to elicit nAbs in rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing trimers (trVLP sera) and DNA expressing Env trimer followed by protein boost (DNA sera).

**Findings:** Unusually potent nAb titers developed in 2/8 rabbits immunized with VLP sera and 1/20 immunized with DNA sera. All sera neutralized quaternary epitopes and exploited gaps in the glycan defenses of the conserved region of JRFL gp120. Specifically, VLP sera took advantage of the absence of glycan residue 197 (present in 98.7% Envs). Intriguingly, removing N197 glycan with loss of tier 2 phenotype rendered 50/16.7% (n=18) clade 2 isolates sensitive to VLP sera, showing neutralization via surface masked by N glycan. Neutral sera targeted epitopes overlapped with CD binding site, consistent with role of N gly in "gly fence" limiting access.

**Implications:** Our data show for the first time that strain-specific holes in glycan allow development of tier 2 neutral antibodies native spikes. Moreover, cross-neutralization can occur in absence glycan.

**Conclusions:** Our observations provide new insights that inform future development of neutral antibody vaccine. Specifically, native trimers presented in situ induce tier 2Abs, recognize quatern epitopes, target gaps gly shield, and neutralize tier viruses with appropriate gaps introduced gly shell. Advances made with V immunogens address limiting factors in preceding studies. Despite exposed patch C region, native trimer remains poorly immunogenic. Approaches may combine DNA-V boost regimens or engineer holes gly shield to encourage Ab development.

**Title:** Identification of Immunohistochemical Markers for Monitoring Wound Healing in Buruli Ulcer Lesions Treated with Combination Chemotherapy

**Research Question:** Despite the introduction of combination chemotherapy with rifampicin and intramus streptomycin, the management of extensive Buruli ulcer (BU) lesions remains a challenge, particularly in rural areas with high disease burden. The reasons for delayed wound healing in a proportion of treated patients are not fully understood. This study aimed to identify immunohistochemical markers for monitoring wound progression in BU lesions.

**Methods:** Tissue specimens from eight patients with BU lesions before and after chemotherapy were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for a set of markers associated with connective tissue neoformation, remodeling, and epidermal activation.

**Findings:** Several proteins turned out to be suitable for monitoring wound healing. α-smooth muscle actin positive myofiblasts were not present in untreated lesions but emerged during healing, producing extracellular matrix proteins such as pro-collagen 1 and tenascin in fibronect rich areas. After treatment, cells, including myoflasts, revealed activated phenotype with ribosomal S phosphorylation, a marker for initiation. Additionally, wounds showed dermal remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 expression in epider.

**Implications:** This study identified a set of markers for monitoring wound healing in treated BU lesions by immunohistochemistry. This panel may help understand disturbances responsible for wound delays in some patients.

**Conclusions:** Activated myoflasts are involved in wound contraction and produce ECM proteins fibron, tenasc, and proollagens. Together with newly formed vessels and inflammatory cells, they build granulation, a prerequisite for successful dermal healing. Enhanced CK expression in lesions after treatment is a consequence of dermal response to antibiotic and mycolone clearing. Each wound phase is characterized by specific cells producing specific proteins and tasks. Tissue remodeling by apoptosis is as important as proliferation.

**Title:** Mitochondrial Trafficking in Response to Electrical Activity in Adult Mammalian Axons: Implications for Bioenergetic Homeostasis

**Research Question:** How do mitochondria traffic in response to electrical activity in adult mammalian axons, and what are the implications for biogetic homeostasis?

**Methods:** Confocal imaging of saphous nerve axons in anaestised mice was combined with electrical and pharmacological stimulation of myinated and unmyinated axons to study mitochondrial trafficking in resting and electrically active axons in vivo.

**Findings:**

* Low frequency electrical stimulation increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic in comparison with silent axons
* Higher frequency conduction (50 Hz) dramatically increased anterog, but not retro, mitochondrial traffic by increasing the number of mobile mitochondria and their velocity
* Topical application of capsaic to innervated the saphous nerve increased mitochondrial traffic in myinated and uninated axons
* Mitochondria in axons conducting higher frequency became shorter, supplying additional mitochondria to trafficking, presumably through fission
* Mitochondria recruited to mobile population did not accumulate at Nodes of Ranvier, but continued anterograde

**Implications:**

* Mitochondrial redistribution suggests peripheral terminals of sensory axons are sites of high metabolic demand during high frequency conduction
* Increased antog traffic may ensure uniform mitochondrial density along ax length during high load, supporting metabolic demand by sustained conduction
* Findings demonstrate physiological relationship between impulse and mitochondrial trafficking in adult, myinated and uninated mammalian ax in vivo

**Conclusions:**

* Mitochondrial trafficking in response to electrical activity in adult mammalian axons is essential for biogetic homeostasis
* Increased antog traffic may ensure mitochondrial density along ax length during high load, supporting metabolic demand by sustained conduction
* Findings have implications for understanding energy supply and demand in biogetic homeostasis, particularly in neurons with high energy expenditure, such as axons

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Spondylocarpal Synostosis: A Novel Insights into the Role of Filamin B in Vertebral Degeneration

**Background:** Spondlocarpal synostosis (SCT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions, resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the Filamin B (FLNB) gene. FLNB acts as a scaffold linking the actin cytoskeleton to signal transduction systems, yet the disease mechanisms remain unclear.

**Research Question:** What is the role of FLNB in vertebral degeneration, particularly in the intervertebral discs (IVD) and annulus fibros (AF)?

**Methods:** Employing a Fln knockout mouse model, we investigated morphologic and molecular changes in IVDs of Fln–/–ice during postnatal development, focusing on cell fate changes in the AF.

**Findings:** In Fln–ice, AF cells lose fibroblast characteristics and acquire hypertrophic chondrocy phenotype, marked by endochond-like ossification, including collagen expression, apoptosis, and ossification. Conversion to chrocy coincides with upregulated TGF signaling via Smad/3 and BMP p38, as well as sustained canonical and non-canonical genes p21 and Ctg.

**Implications:** FL is involved in attenuation of TGF/BMP signaling, influencing AF fate. IVD disruptions in Fln–ice resemble degenerative discs, providing insights into vertebral fusions and degeneration.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates loss of FL in mouse models an alteration of AF from fibrous to cartilaginous fate, disrupting the nucleus pulpos, leading to degeneration, collapse, and subsequent fusion of flanking vertebral bodies. This results from inappropriate upregulation of T canonical and non-canonical pathways. FL interacts with Sm2 and 3, mediators of TGF and BMP signaling. FL is expressed in cartilage and cartilagous vertebrae. We show AF cells adopt hypertrophic chro gene patterns in Fln–IVDs, suggesting transformation, not invasion.

**Key Findings:**

* Loss of FL leads to increased TGF and BMP signaling in vitro and vivo
* AF undergoes ectopic differentiation toward chrogenic lineage in IVD, leading to abnormalochond ossification
* Phenotyp findings resemble aging degeneration, providing developmental model for degenerative disease
* Previous studies interpreted increased TGF/B signaling in deg as repair effort extracellular matrix; our model suggests loss FL initiates cascade cell changes, degeneration, and fusions

**Future Directions:**

* Investigate FL interaction with Sm and 5, central TGF and BMP mediators
* Explore FL expression in cartilage and cartilous vertebra
* Determine if AF transformation or invasion chrocy in FlnIVDs

This abstract provides a clear and concise summary of the research question, methods, findings, implications, and conclusions of the study on Spondlocarpal synosis, highlighting the role of Filamin in vertebral degeneration, particularly in the intervertebral discs and annulus fibros.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Mechanism of Immune Regulation by Orthomyxovirus Thog Virus (TH) through Targeting General Transcription Factor TFI

**Research Question:** How does the Orthomyxovirus Thog virus (TH) regulate the host immune response by targeting the general transcription factor TFI, and what are the implications of this mechanism for antiviral infection and inflammation?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between TH and TFI, a general transcription factor essential for de novo recruitment of RNA polymerase II to promoters, and found that TH engages TFI, leading to its cytoplasmic localization and depletion. This results in altered expression of a limited number of genes, primarily those dependent on de novo recruitment of polymerase II.

**Findings:** Our data indicate that TFI is critical for de novo recruitment of polymerase II to promoters, while not required for regulated expression from paused promoters. TH targeting TFI by TH represents a mechanism to modulate immune responses while maintaining other transcriptional activities intact. Interference with TFI activity may be a favorable site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation.

**Implications:** The innate immune system comprises a network of cytokines and antiviral effector molecules, essential for antiral defense. We identified a mechanism involving viral targeting of single transcription factor TFI, perturbing the immune at broad scale with minimal influence on other transcriptional processes. Mimicking TH using its inhibitory domain to target TFI modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector molecules requiring de novo recruitment of polymerase without affecting general expression genes for cellular homeostasis, growth, stability, metabolism, and signaling.

**Conclusion:** Targeting TFI by viruses is beneficial for successful infection: pro-inflammatory cytokines required for antiral response are inhibited, while negative regulators mediate tolerogenic environment and tissue repair are expressed. If TFI is dissociated, depleted, or sequestered, genes loaded with polymerase can still be transcribed, but those dependent on novo recruitment require TFI activity, including inflammatory cytokines and antiral effector molecules.

**Title:** Understanding the Mechanism of Parvovirus B19-Induced G2 Phase Arrest in Human Erythroid Progenitor Cells

**Research Question:** How does Parvirus B19 (B19) infection induce G2 phase arrest in human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs), and what is the role of the putative transactivation domain (TAD) within the NS1 protein in this process?

**Methods:** We established doxycine-inducible B19-permissive UT/E-S cell lines that express NS or NSmT2 and examined the function of the T2 domain during G2 arrest. We also investigated the role of the ATR-CHK-CDC25-CD1 pathway in B19 infection-induced G2 arrest.

**Findings:** Our results confirm that the NS T2 domain plays a pivotal role in NS-induced G2 arrest. Mechanistically, NS activated cellular expression through the T2, which was responsible for ATR activation. Activated A phosphorylated CDC25 at serine 216, inactivating the cyclin B/CD1 complex without affecting nuclear import of the complex. Importantly, we found the A-CHK-CDC-CD1 pathway activated during B19 infection of PCs, and A played a role in B19-induced G arrest.

**Implications:** B19 infection induces a DNA damage response (DDR) essential for viral replication, although DDR has no effect on cell arrest at G-phase. Understanding the underlying mechanism of B19 NS-induced G arrest is crucial, particularly the role of NS T2 in dysregulation of the cycle. We previously showed B19 NS protein disrupts cell cycle via T, and viral replication-induced DDR not necessary for arrest cells containing 4 DNA. B-infected cells arrest late S and G-phase 4 DNA.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that A activation plays a role in G arrest of EPCs expressing B19 NS, mediated by the T domain of NS protein, and the A-CHK-C-CD pathway activated in cells arrested G. During B infection of EPCs at MO 1,000 genomic copies/cell, viral replication contributes minimally to BrU incorporation. Expression B19 NS alone induces G arrest characterized 4 DNA without BrU. Mechanisms underlying B infection and NS-induced G arrest have been reported, including block of import activated cyclin B/CD complex. However, our results demonstrate this not the case. We did not observe G arrest in NS or NS-expressing cells or B-infected PCs, suggesting neither NS nor B induces G arrest.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Dengue Virus Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) in Endothelial Dysfunction and Vascular Leakage

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage caused by Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) in vivo and in vitro, focusing on the contributions of inflammatory mediators and endothelial-intrinsic pathways.

**Methods:** We employed a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches using wild-type C57/BL/6 mice and human dermal endothelial cells to investigate the effects of DENV NS1. In vivo, we assessed vascular leakage in the dorsal dermis of mice, while in vitro, examined cytokine production and endothelial permeability in response to DENV NS.

**Findings:** Our results showed that DENV NS, but not closely-related West Nile virus NS, triggers vascular leakage in the dermis of wild-type C57/6 mice. In vitro, human dermal endothelial cells exposed to D NS did not produce inflammatory cytokines (TN-α, IL-6, IL-8), and blocking these cytokines did not affect D NS-induced endothelial permeability. Furthermore, D NS-induced vascular leakage was observed in TLR- or TN- receptor-deficient mice similar to wild-type animals. We also demonstrated that D NS-induced vascular leakage was blocked using inhibitors targeting glycocal disruption.

**Implications:** These findings indicate that D NS-induced endothelial-intrinsic vascular leakage is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on endothelial glycocal components. This suggests potential targets for novel therapeutics inhibiting enzymes contributing to glycocal degradation for the treatment of severe deng disease.

**Conclusions:** Our results contribute to the growing literature highlighting the critical role of NS in deng pathogenesis, specifically its direct effects on the endothelium. We propose a critical role for glycocal components in deng disease, though further in vivo validation is necessary. We speculate that D NS induces endothelial permeability following internalization by endothelial cells. Overall, these findings illustrate the role of NS in severe deng disease and highlight the importance glycocal in vascular, suggesting novel therapeutic targets for DH and D treatment.

**Title:** Septin Dynamics and the Spindle Positioning Checkpoint (SPO) are Intimately Linked in Budding Yeast: A Role of the Ubiquitin-Ligases Dma and D2

**Research Question:** How do the ubiquitin-lases Dma and D2 regulate septin dynamics and the spindle positioning checkpoint (SPO) in budding yeast?

**Methods:** We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of Dma and D2 in septin ring assembly, spindle positioning, and SPO in budding yeast.

**Findings:** Our results show that Dma and D2 control septin dynamics and SPO by promoting the efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud, a kinase that stabilizes the septin ring and activates Kin4. We found that Dma D2 mutant cells have reduced Elm levels at the bud and impaired Kin4 activation. Artificial recruitment of Elm to the bud rescues normal septin ring, spindle positioning, and SPO in Dma D2 cells.

**Implications:** Our data indicate that septin dynamics and SPO are intimately linked, supporting the idea that the integrity of the neck is crucial for SPO signalling. We propose a model for SPO signalling where Dma and D regulate septin dynamics and SPO by promoting Elm recruitment to the bud. Elm stabilizes the septin ring, while PPAR1 counteracts this process and activates Kin through phosphorylation.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides mechanistic insight into the role of D ubiquitinases in septin dynamics and SPO, revealing a tight link between disrupted septin ring dynamics and SPO defects. We propose that the septin ring at the neck serves as a platform for signalling that inhibits mitotic exit in response to spindle misposition. Our findings have implications for understanding the regulation of cytokinesis, spindle positioning, and mitotic exit in eukaryotes.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Scan Reveals Adaptations to Climate in Human Populations Across the Globe

**Research Question:** This study investigates the role of natural selection in shaping human adaptation to diverse environments through a genome-wide scan of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) correlated with climate variables across 61 worldwide populations.

**Methods:** We employed a genome-wide association study to identify SNPs with the strongest correlations between allele frequencies and climate variables, contrasting genic and non-genic SNPs, and gene sets related to UV radiation, infection, immunity, and cancer.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed a striking enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SN among those strongly correlated with climate variables. Notably, several signals overlapped with those from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. We also found enrichment of strong signals in gene sets related to UV, infection, immunity, and cancer.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that adaptations to climate have shaped the spatial distribution of variation in humans. Climate influences the distribution of pathogens, and many of our signals coincide with SNPs associated with immune response in GW studies, implying that our analysis detects selective pressures due to climate or mediated by climate. We identified a subset of SNPs with large effect sizes for climate variables also associated with traits from GWAS, including pigmentation and autoimmune diseases.

**Conclusion:** This genome-wide scan provides evidence of positive selection response to climatic variation. Our findings highlight the importance of climate in shaping human adaptation, particularly in genes related to pigmentation, UV response, immune, autoimmune, and cancer. This study contributes to our understanding of human adaptation to diverse environments and the role of climate in shaping genetic variation.

**Title:** Investigating the Arrhythmogenic Mechanisms of the SQT1 N588K Mutation: A Computational Modeling Study

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the arrhythmogenic mechanisms underlying the SQT syndrome, a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death, focusing on the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK)-linked SQT1 variant.

**Methods:** Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Hux (HH) models in reproducing experimental data effects of the N588 mutation on KCNH-encoded hERG. Ionic models were incorporated into ventricular action potential (AP) models and 1D and 2 idealized and realistic transmural ventricular simulations into 3D anatomical models. Single-cell models showed the N588 mutation abbreviated ventricular AP duration at 90% repolarization (AP90) and maximal transm voltage heterogeneity (δ) during AP, resulting in decreased transm heterogeneity of AP90 and effective refractory period (ERP), anticipated to be anti-arrhythmic rather than pro-arrhythmic.

**Findings:** However, considering transm heterogeneity of IK density in intact tissue based on the Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Pfil ventricular model, the N588 mutation led to QT shortening and increased T-wave amplitude, but augmented δ in local regions of ventricular tissue, increasing vulnerability to uni-directional conduction and predisposing to reentrant excitation. In 2D and 3 models, the N mutation facilitated reentrant waves due to reduced substrate for sustaining re-entry.

**Implications:** This study substantiates the causal link between N588 mutation QT shortening and increased susceptibility to re-entry and perpetuation of re-arrhythmia in S1. The findings provide a comprehensive explanation for the pro-arrhythmic effects of the S1 N588-ERG mutation.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that the S1 N588-ERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing lifespan of reentrant waves and stability in 3D tissue. The results highlight the importance of considering transm heterogeneity IK density in tissue models to accurately predict arrhythmogenic effects of S1 mutations.

**Title:** Predictive and Insightful Modeling of Collective Animal Behavior using Deep Networks

**Research Question:** How can we develop a model that simultaneously predicts and provides insight into the behavior of individual animals in a collective, while accounting for the complexity of interactions between them?

**Methods:** We propose a novel approach using deep networks to model collective behavior, consisting of two modules: pair-interaction subnetwork and aggregation subnetwork. The pair-interaction subnetwork describes the interaction between a focal fish and its closest neighbors, while the aggregation subnetwork aggregates the outputs of pair-inter subnetworks. We trained the model on simulated trajectories of 60-100 zebraf, Danio rer, and validated on artificial trajectories generated by well-studied behavioral rules.

**Findings:** Our model recovers the ground-truth rule used to generate the trajectories, as well as the number of interacting neighbors. Interactions between pairs can be described as repulsive, attractive, or alignment, but only when moving slowly. At high velocities, interactions correspond to alignment or mixed repulsion at close distances. Each fish decides to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average of neighbors, with higher weights for those close, in collision, or moving in frontal and lateral locations. The network extracts the number of interacting individuals dynamically in the range 8-22, with 1-10 more important ones.

**Implications:** Our results suggest each animal decides by dynamically selecting information from the collective. This is consistent with the collective rules used to generate simulated data, where presence of neighbors in repulsion causes fish to ignore neighbors in orientation areas. We validated our ability to reconstruct rules of behavior by applying the method to artificial trajectories.

**Conclusions:** Our deep network provides a predictive and insightful model of collective behavior, accounting for the complexity of interactions. The pair-interaction subnetwork takes 6 variables as inputs and outputs 128 values, while the aggregation subnetwork sums 128 vectors to a single output. We divided the interaction into two functions, pair-wise and aggregation, and used a deep network, specifically attention. After training, we extracted attraction, repulsion, and alignment notions from the trained interaction. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep networks in modeling collective behavior, providing both predictability and insight.

**Title:** Quantifying the Fitness of Drug Resistance Mutations in HIV-1: A Phylogenetic Approach in the Swiss Cohort Study

**Research Question:** What is the fitness cost of major drug-resistant mutations in HIV-1 in the Swiss cohort, and how do they impact the transmission dynamics of the virus?

**Methods:** We employed a phylogenetic approach to quantify the fitness of major resistance mutations in HIV-1 using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the drug resistance database. Our approach is based on stochastic birth-death processes, which have been shown to be suitable for modeling epidemic processes. We considered each major mutation separately, assuming two types: sensitive and resistant, with a simple migration process of resistance and reversion. The aim was to demonstrate that our phylogen approach can shed light on the dynamics of HIV evolution and quantify the cost of resistance.

**Findings:** Among the considered mutations, the 90 mutation in the protease gene was found to have a significantly higher fitness than sensitive strains. The mutations associated with reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than sensitive: 67, 70, 184, 219. The posterior intervals of transmission for the remaining mutations included 1, suggesting no significant effect on transmissibility within the HIV cohort. These patterns are consistent with alternative measures of fitness of resistance.

**Implications:** Our phylogen approach provides a novel method to estimate the transmission cost of drug mutations. This may be useful in assessing the risk of drug resistance in resource-limited settings where testing is possible but epidemiological and clinical data are missing. Understanding the type of fitness related replication within the host is essential. We are interested in transmission fitness, which describes the success of a lineage between hosts. As sequences are collected to test for resistance, HIV data is increasingly available.

**Conclusions:** We have developed and validated a phylogen approach to estimate the transmission cost of resistance. This is one of the first studies presenting a phylogen approach that quantifies population-level costs of resistance from sequence data annotated with sampling and resistance alone. This may become useful in assessing the risk of drug resistance in resource-limited settings. Our approach can shed light on the dynamics of HIV evolution and quantify the cost of resistance.

**Title:** Elong Complex and Histone Acetylase Sin/El3p Regulate Oxidative Stress Tolerance through tRNA Modification and Translation Efficiency

**Research Question:** How does the Elong complex, including histone acetylase Sin/Elp, contribute to oxidative stress tolerance in fission yeast?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Elong complex and histone acetylase SinElp in oxidative stress tolerance in fission yeast using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and molecular biology approaches.

**Findings:** Our results show that Elong mediates the modification of certain tRNAs, modulating translation efficiency, and is essential for oxidative stress tolerance. We found that fission Sin/Elp is important for the transcriptional program governed by the Sty-Atf-Pcr pathway, but not severely affected in mutant cells lacking Sin/Elp. However, cells lacking SinElp cannot modify the uridine wobble nucleotide of certain tRNAs, and other tRNA activities such as Ctu-Ctu are essential for normal tolerance to H2O. Overexpression of tRNALUU complements the stress-related phenotypes of SinElp mutant cells.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that lack of functional Elong complex results in stress phenotypes due to its contribution to tRNA modification and subsequent translation inefficiency of stress-induced mRNAs. These results suggest that transcription defects in these backgrounds may be a consequence of deficient expression of transcription factor Atf-Pcr and other components of transcription machinery.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that SinElp mutant does not display alterations in transcription events to explain sensitivity to peroxides. Instead, levels of acetylated H (or associated to stress) are not affected in SinElp cells. Absence of m5U modification could be cause sensitivity of cells lacking Sinp. This hypothesis is supported by similar tolerance to perox of strains lacking Sinp, Ctu or Ctu. We conclude that stress-dependent histone acetylation and nucleosome eviction at stress does not rely on SinElp. Our study highlights the importance of Elong complex in regulating oxidative stress tolerance through tRNA modification and translation efficiency.

**Key findings:**

* Elong mediates modification of certain tRN, modulating translation efficiency
* Sinp is important for transcription program governed by Sty-At-Pcr pathway
* Cells lacking Sinp cannot modify uridine wobble nucleotide certain tRN
* tRNA activities Ctu essential for normal tolerance H2
* Overexpression tALUU complements stress-related phenotypes Sinp cells
* Lack of functional Elong results in stress phenotypes due to tRNA modification and translation inefficiency stress mRN
* Transcription defects may be consequence of deficient expression At-Pcr and components machinery

**Title:** Nef Protein of Lentivirus Enhances HIV-1 Resistance to Broadly Acting Neutralizing Antibodies

**Research Question:** How does the Nef protein of lentivirus modulate the infectivity of HIV-1 virions and contribute to the progression of AIDS?

**Methods:** We investigated the functional link between Nef and Env by examining the effect of Nef on the quantity and quality of virion-associated Env. Since Nef did not alter the quantity of virion Env, we searched for qualitative changes in the sensitivity of HIV-1 to neutralizing agents targeting distinct features of Env. We found that Nef conferred up to 50-fold resistance to 2F and 4, two potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) targeting the membrane proximal external (MP) region of gp41. In contrast, N had no effect on HIV-1 neutralization by MP-specific Ab Z13, peptide T, or a panel of Abs and reagents targeting gp120.

**Findings:** Resistance to neutralization by 2 and 4 was observed with Nef from diverse HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as HIV-1 virions bearing Env from CCR- and CX4-tropic viruses, clade and viruses or primary isolates. Functional analysis of a panel of N mutants revealed that this activity requires N myristoylation but is genetically separable from other N functions such as the ability to enhance infectivity and downregulate CD4. Glycosyl-G substituted Nef for in conferring resistance to 2 and 4, indicating this activity is conserved in a retroirus that does not encode N. The membrane-dependence of MP-recognition by 2 and 4, in contrast to the membrane-independence of Z, is consistent with a model where N alters MP in the context of the virion membrane.

**Implications:** These studies demonstrate that N protects lentivuses from one of the most broadly-acting classes of neutralizing antibodies. This newly discovered activity has important implications for HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.

**Conclusion:** We describe a novel function for lentiviral N: renders the HIV-1 virion refractory to broadly-neutralizing antibodies 2 and 4. This effect is specific and not a result of global decrease in sensitivity, as N had no effect on other well-characterized Env-neutral agents. It is plausible that cell-type variabilities of the lipid modulate responsiveness of progeny to the effect of N on neutralization.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Interactions between Opisthorchis vivini and its Intermediate Host, Bithia siamensis gomphos: A Comparative Gene Expression Profiling Analysis

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between Opisthoris vivini, the causative agent of cholangiocarcinoma, and its intermediate host, Bithia siensisomphos, in the Greater Mekong subregion of Thailand?

**Methods:** We employed high-throughput Illumina sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to characterize the transcriptomes of uninfected and O. vivini-infected B. siensisphos. Comparative gene expression profiling identified 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 43 biological pathways, including immune mechanisms against parasites.

**Findings:** Among DEGs with immune functions, transcripts encoding proteases were downregulated in B. siensis infected by O. vivini, while genes encoding heat shock proteins and actins were upregulated in parasite-infected snails compared to uninf counterparts.

**Implications:** This study lays the foundation for functional studies of genes and gene products involved in immune mechanisms of parasite colonization of snail host. The annotated dataset represents a resource for discovery of pathways and mechanisms of susceptibility and resistance of B. siensis to O. viv and comparative analyses with other snail intermediate hosts of platyhelmin, including schistosomes.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of interaction between O. vivini and B. siensis, shedding light on potential targets for control and prevention of cholangarcinoma in the Greater Mekong region.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Complement Receptor 1 (CR1) Polymorphisms and Expression in Leprosy Susceptibility: A Case-Control Study in Brazilian Leprosy Patients

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the role of Complement receptor 1 (CR) polymorphisms and expression in the susceptibility to lepro, a public health issue in Brazil, by examining the association between CR polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR levels in a case-control study with lepro patients.

**Methods:** A case-control study was conducted with 213 lepro patients (47% multibillary) and 297 controls. Polymorphisms were hapyped by multiplex PCR-SS, and mRNA levels were measured by qPCR and CR by ELISA in up to 80 samples.

**Findings:** Individuals with the most common recombinant haplotype harboring rs926*T in intron 21 and rs700*T in exon 26 (encoding p.140Met of Yorkka antigen) presented higher susceptibility to lepro (OR=2.43, p=0.017). Paibacillary patients with these variants presented lower CR levels, reducing anti-inflammatory response (p=0.040 and p=0.046). The most haplotype increased susceptibility to multib clinical form (OR=3.04, p=0.01) and presented intronic rs343*G allele, associated higher gene expression (p=0.043), probably increasing internalization of parasite. An inverse correlation was found between CR and mannose-binding lectin (initiator of lectin pathway complement, recognized by CR) (R=-0.52, p=0.007).

**Implications:** The results suggest a regulatory role for CR polymorph on mRNA and CR levels, with haplotype effects increasing susceptibility to lepro, probably enhancing phagocytosis and inflammation.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to specifically analyze CR haplotype, mRNA, and CR levels in susceptibility to lepro. The association of recombin haplotype sharing rs926 and rs700 with two-fold higher susceptibility lepro was found. The rs926 SNP is located in regulatory region bound CTCF (CC binding) and other regulatory proteins. Complement receptor 1 was identified as mediator Mycobacterium leprae entry into phocytes, but only one study on missense mutations has been conducted.

**Title:** Metabolomic Profiling and Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Sex-Specific Differences in Serum Metabolite Concentrations and Genetic Determination**

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their genetic determination in a large cohort of over 3,300 individuals from the KORA3 and K4 studies, focusing on amino acids, phosphatidylchines, sphingomyins, acylcarnines, and C-sugars.

**Methods:** Metabolomic profiling was performed on 131 metabolites, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted to identify sex-specific genetic variants associated with metabolite concentrations. Linear regression analysis revealed significant differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites (p-value < 3.8×10-4, Bonferr-corrected threshold). GWAS showed genome-wide significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus (carbamyl-phosphate synthase 1, significance: p < 3.8×10-10, Bonerr-correct threshold) for glycine.

**Findings:** Metabolite profiles of males and females are significantly different, and specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism. Our study provides new insights into sex-specific regulatory processes and underscores the importance of considering sex-specific effects in study design and interpretation.

**Implications:** Our findings shed light on sex-specific architecture of the human metabolome and provide clues on biochemical mechanisms explaining differences in susceptibility and disease development in males and females. Data provide new insights into sex metabotype differences. A meta-analysis of K4 and K3 revealed 113 metabolites with significant sex effect (Bonerr-correct meta-analysis level: <3.8×10-4, Table 3). We investigated groups of metabolite pairwise correlations, similar effects, and sex-specific propagation through metabolic network. Calculated partial correlation between metabolites against age, sex, and BMI.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of considering sex-specific effects in study design and interpretation, providing new insights into biochemical mechanisms explaining differences in disease susceptibility and development in males and females.

**Title:** Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a structural framework for genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations: Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiBl) decouples stoichiometry from objective formulation

**Research Question:** How can we accurately model the metabolic state of a cell under specific environmental conditions, given the large solution space of possible flux states and the sensitivity of optimization algorithms to stoichiometric representation?

**Methods:** We propose a new method, Minimization Metabolites Balance (MiBl), which decouples stoichi representation from objective formulation by using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. We simulated perturbed metabolic networks to demonstrate the importance of stoichi representation independence for unambiguous modeling.

**Findings:** Current methods lead to incoherent predictions due to sensitivity to stoichi representation, making biological interpretation subjective. MiBl expands the scope of metabolic modeling by elucidating mechanistic genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

**Implications:** Our results highlight the need for rethinking problem formulation of metabolic modeling. MiBl accounts for stoichi in objective by mapping flux into metabolite space, providing mathematically robust and biologically meaningful results.

**Conclusions:** Minimization of Metabolites Balance (Mi) is a new method for metabolic modeling, formulated as a linear combination of metabolite turnovers. The turnover of a metabolite is the sum of fluxes producing or consuming it, multiplied by stoichi coefficients. We demonstrate the importance of accurate reference flux distribution for biologically meaningful results, using iFF S cerevisiae genome reconstruction and experimentally determined exchange constraints. MiBl provides a framework for genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations, decoupling stoichi representation from objective.

**Key findings:**

* Current methods lead to inco predictions due to sensitivity to stoichi representation
* MiBl decouples stoichi from objective using metabolite turnovers
* Mi expands scope of metabolic modeling by elucidating mechanistic genetic interactions
* Importance of accurate reference flux for biologically meaningful results
* Mi provides framework for genotype-phen relationships through flux simulations

**Future directions:**

* Apply Mi to other organisms and conditions
* Investigate robustness of Mi to different stoichi representations
* Integrate Mi with other modeling approaches

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Landscape on the Distribution of Plague (Yersinia pestis) Infection in Madagascar: A Comparative Study of Seroprevalence and Genetic Structure in Rattus rattus Populations

**Research Question:** Does the distribution of plague seroprevalence in rat populations differ between plateau and mountain areas, and is the fine-scale genetic structure of rat populations higher in mountain areas than plateaus, suggesting an effect of landscape on rat dispersal?

**Methods:** We conducted a comparative study of seroprevalence and genetic (15 microsatellite markers) in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology, covering 150-200 km² within the Madagas plague focus.

**Findings:** Seropreval levels in rat populations mimicked those reported for humans, with marked genetic structure increasing with relief. However, the relationship between serrevalence and genetic differed between areas, suggesting plague distribution not solely related to rat dispersal. Genetic estimates suggested epizootics had a weak impact on rat sizes. In highlands, plague cannot be accounted for solely by dispersal of reservoir.

**Implications:** Human activities may be involved in spreading disease in rat and human populations.

**Conclusions:** Plague spread in rat and human populations partly related to population structure of reservoir, but also human activities. Topographic relief influences gene flow in many species, including rodents. Rat dispersal plays a role in plague spread, but not solely responsible for distribution.

**Key Findings:**

* Seropreval levels in rat populations mimicked those reported for humans
* Genetic structure increased with relief
* Relationship between serreval and genetic differed between areas
* Epizootics had weak impact on rat sizes
* Human activities involved in spreading disease in rat and human populations
* Topographic relief influences gene flow in species, including rodents
* Rat dispersal plays role in plague spread, but not solely responsible distribution

**Limitations:** Sampling before and after epootic control for large variables affecting parameters.

**Title:** Investigating the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 (Sm6) Family: A Novel Proteins on the Surface of the Parasite's Tegument and Their Immunogenic Potential

**Research Question:** What are the characteristics of the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 (Sm6) family of proteins, and do they elicit an immune response in human populations infected with the parasite?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Sm6 family using PSI-BLAST search and identified 11 members, including three novel proteins. We examined the presence of cysteine residues, signal peptides, and GPI-anchor sites, suggesting all Sm6 proteins are surface-bound. We measured IgG, IgA, and IgE responses against two surface representatives, Sm6A and Sm6B, in a cohort of S. mansoni-infected Ugandan males before and after prazantel treatment.

**Findings:** Pre-treatment IgG prevalence for Sm6 and SmB were 7.4% and 25.3% respectively, higher than IgG prevalence for sub-surface antigen SmAL. Post-treatment IgG levels against surface SmA and SmB dropped significantly (p=0.020 and <0.001) compared to rising Ig levels against sub-s SmAL.

**Implications:** Our study expands the number of Sm6 proteins found in S. mansoni and demonstrates surface-associated SmA and SmB elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities.

**Conclusions:** The Schosoma mans Ly6 (Sm) family proteins are surface-bound and immunogenic, eliciting IgG, IgA, and IgE responses in human populations infected with the parasite. The presence of cystine residues, signal peptides, and GPI sites suggest all Sm6 proteins are cell-bound. Our study expands the number of Sm6 found in S. mansoni and demonstrates surface-associated SmA and SmB elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities.

**Title:** Computational Modeling of Epithelial Tissue Morphogenesis in the Drosila Retina: The Role of N-cadherin in Cell Adhesion and Morphogenesis

**Research Question:** How does the adhesion protein N-cadher contribute to the morphogenesis of epithelial tissue in the Drosila retina, and what are the underlying mechanisms of its regulation?

**Methods:** We developed a computational model of epithelial tissue that minimizes interfacial energy between cells, incorporating key features of morphogenesis, including the timing of N-cadher expression and cell-cell contact remodeling. We simulated both normal and mutant cells lacking or misexpressing Nadher and compared our results to experimental data.

**Findings:** Our simulations reproduced the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells, distinguished cadher dynamics, and emphasized the importance of adhesion proteinogenesis and its timing in cell remodeling. We found that Nher protein is recycled from inactive to active interfaces, modulating adhesion strengths between cells.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that Nher plays a crucial role beyond cell sorting in morphogenesis, determining details of cell shapes. The model, conceived as an equilibrium tool, incorporates dynamical features of morphogenesis, such as temporal Nher expression and cell contact remodeling. We established these features without additional parameters.

**Conclusions:** To understand Nher control of cell geometry, consider distribution and dynamics. We applied these considerations to our model, testing various distributions and dynamics with mutant data producing altered Nher levels. In the retina, cells express two adhesion molecules: Eadher and Nher. All contain Eher, but only cone cells contain Nher, localized in adherens junctions (≈50 nm wide), major adhesion site between cells.

**Key findings:**

1. Our model describes characteristic changes in mutants.
2. Simulations distinguish mechanisms controlling Nher levels.
3. Model incorporates dynamical features morph, temporal Nher expression and cell contact.
4. Nher is recycled from inactive to active interfaces, modulating adhesion.
5. Model reproduces wild-type and mutant geometries, cadher dynamics.
6. Emphasizes adhesion proteinogenesis and timing in cell remodeling.

**Significance:** This work demonstrates the role of Nher in epithelial morphogenesis, beyond cell sorting, determining cell shapes. Our model, as an equilibrium tool, incorporates dynamical features, such as temporal Nher and cell contact, without additional parameters.

**Title:** Rapid Turnover of MT-MT-M Promotes ECM Degradation at Invadodia: A Novel Insights from FRAP Experiments and Computational Modeling

**Research Question:** How does the turnover of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT-MT-M) contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadodia, specialized membrane protrusions involved in cancer cell invasion?

**Methods:** We employed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments with fluorescence-tagged MT-MT on single invadodia and constructed a computational model to simulate the observed kinetics. We also inhibited vesicle transport experimentally and simulated the effect on ECM degradation.

**Findings:** FRAP signals showed rapid recovery approximated by double-exponential plots with time constants 26 s and 259 s, primarily dependent on vesicle transport and negligible on lateral diffusion. Computational simulations reproduced the FR experiments. Inhibiting ves transport blocked ECM degradation and simulations showed no appreciable degradation under inhibiting ves transport. The degree of reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of reduction in MT-M turnover.

**Implications:** Our experiments and simulations established the role of rapid MT turnover in ECM degradation at invodia. Simulations suggested synergistic contributions of proteolytic activity and MT turnover to ECM degradation, with a nonlinear reduction in degradation if both factors reduced. Our model provides an in-silico tool to design intervention strategies for cancer invasion.

**Conclusions:** Continuous supply of active MT-M to the surface is critical for maintaining invodia's ECM-degrading activity. Rapid turnover of MT is essential for ECM degradation at invodia. Our study highlights the importance of MT in cancer cell invasion and provides a new tool for evaluating intervention strategies.

**Title:** Investigating the Spatial Dynamics of Drug-Resistant HIV-1 Emergence within an Infected Individuals: A Study of RT-SIV in Macaques

**Research Question:** How does drug-resistant HIV-1 emerge and spread within an infected individuals, and how does spatial compartmentalization impact its emergence?

**Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal study on four macaques infected with RT-SIVm027, a simian immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), treated with RT inhibitors. Viral DNA and RNA were isolated from blood (plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells), lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at four median time points, and characterized via single-genome sequencing.

**Findings:** Our results reveal a dynamic system where vRNA rapidly acquires drug resistance concurrently across compartments through multiple mutations, with fast migration of viral genotypes across compartments, but not immediate equilibration of frequencies. Blood and lymph nodes were found to be compartmentalized, while blood and lymph were more different from mucosal tissues. This suggests that oft-sampled blood does not fully capture viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially gut, where vRNA turnover was faster than plasma and vDNA retained fewer wild-type viruses.

**Implications:** Our findings of transient compartmentalization across tissues may explain varied results of previous compartmentalization studies HIV-1. This study highlights the importance of sampling multiple compartments, especially the gut, to understand viral dynamics and transmission of drug resistance.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that drug-resistant HIV-1 emergence is a complex process, influenced by spatial compartmentalization and dynamics. Our results suggest that oft-sampled blood may not capture viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially the gut, where vRNA turnover is faster and vDNA retains fewer wild-type viruses. This has implications for understanding reservoirs and potential eradication of HIV-1. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of compartmentalization in drug resistance and transmission.

**Title:** Feedback Regulation of Lineage Progression and Morphogenesis: Unveiling the Role of Bistability, Ultrasensitivity, and Self-Organization in Tissue Development

**Research Question:** Does feedback regulation of lineage progression play a crucial role in tissue morphogenesis, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms and implications?

**Methods:** We employed mathematical modeling to investigate the effects of positive and negative diffusible signals on stem and progenitor cells, leading to the emergence of bistable, bi-modal growth behaviors, ultrasensitivity to external cues, growth-driven budding, self-sustaining elongation, and self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers.

**Findings:** Our results show that feedback regulation of stem progenitor self-renew leads to bistability and ultras, with ultras switching between high and low or zero growth states. A necessary condition for this behavior is the simultaneous presence of saturable positive and negative feedback. This is supported by in vivo reports of analogous phenomena, including growth bistability, ultrasensitivity, and feedback-regulated morphogenesis.

**Implications:** We demonstrate that simultaneous positive and negative regulation of renewal by diffus signals naturally leads to the emergence of spatial dynamic behaviors, manifesting as localized differences in growth. We mathematically define conditions for bistability, ultras, and spatial self-organization to arise in such systems, driving the formation of induced or spontaneous bulges, buds, and fingers, the building blocks of many morphogenesis. Notably, these patterns arise from opposing interactions of diffible factors, not Turing instabilities.

**Conclusions:** Tissue morphogenesis often occurs rapidly relative to cell lifespan, suggesting that final models may better represent lineage dynamics during morph, even in self-renew tissues. We explored the effects of feedback in final-state systems, highlighting the importance of bistability, ultras, and self-organization in tissue development.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Multiple Genetic Factors Contributing to the Development of Myopia in Europeans

**Research Question:** What are the genetic factors contributing to the development of myopia (nearsightedness) in Europeans?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study on 45,771 participants from the 23andMe database, analyzing the age of onset of myopia, and identified 22 significant associations, 10 of which were novel. We replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 participants who developed myopia before age 10.

**Findings:** The 22 associations explain 2.9% of the variance in myopia age onset and point to multiple mechanisms behind the development of myopia, including extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina. Novel associations were found in genes PRSS, LAMA2, RGR, RDH, ZIC, SP, and SFRP.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest complex interactions between extracellular remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina underlie the development of myopia in humans. Segregation analyses indicate multiple genes are involved in the development of myopia.

**Conclusion:** This study is the largest genome-wide association study on myopia in Europeans, identifying 22 significant associations, 10 of which are novel, and replicating earlier associations with refractive error. Our findings suggest genetic factors may affect age of onset independent of eventual severity, and strength of genetic associations may depend on specific phenotype. We note our phenotype was based on participants' reports, not clinical assessments. Adult myopia tends to be less severe than my developed in childhood or adolescence, and age is correlated with refractive, but not strongly. Our associations with my age onset are stronger than previously detected with refractive, and some failed to replicate in meta-analysis.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Body-Based Sensory Feedback in Locomotion in Lampreys: A Computational Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** How do different forms of body-based sensory feedback influence steady-state swimming kinematics and energetics in lampreys, and what are the implications for locomotor performance?

**Methods:** We developed a computational model of the lamprey's central pattern generator (CPG) circuit, consisting of coupled oscillators representing left and right body segments, simulating muscle activation and fluid dynamics using a Navier-Stokes model. Two forms of feedback were considered: directional, which excites or inhibits oscillators on the same side depending on gain, and magnitude, providing symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effect on both sides.

**Findings:** Directional feedback did not affect frequency but changed duration of muscle activity, while magnitude feedback increased frequency and reduced energetic cost when gain was high. Both types resulted in similar body curvature magnitude.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that different forms of curvature-based feedback on the CP can cause distinct swimming performance differences, highlighting the importance of understanding sensory integration in locomotion. This study contributes to the multiscale modeling of the lamprey closed-loop neuromech system, integrating sensory information from proprioceptors and adapting the pattern of muscle activation.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that body-based feedback plays a crucial role in shaping the swimming pattern, not only responding to perturbations but also influencing steady-state activity. The model provides a starting point for exploring the complex interactions between sensory and motor systems in locomotion, shedding light on the lamprey's ability to entrain to mechanical resonance, contributing to efficient swimming. Future studies can build on this framework to investigate other forms of feedback and their effects on swimming performance.

**Title:** The First-Mover Advantage in HIV Epidemics: A Stochastic Modeling of Competition between Strains

**Research Question:** We investigated the hypothesis that the first strain to colonize a population has an advantage in viral competition, slowing down the invasion of new strains and diversification of the epidemic.

**Methods:** Developed a stochastic framework to simulate HIV epidemics over contact networks, introducing a second strain into a population where the first strain had established a steady-state. Simulations were parameterized based on empirical data, testing scenarios with varying overall prevalence.

**Findings:** The second strain spread on a slower scale compared to the initial strain's expansion. With equal transmission efficiency, the second was unable to invade on a relevant time scale for the HIV pandemic's history. To become dominant over decades, the second needed >25% advantage in transmission over the resident. The effect was weaker if the second introduced while the first was in growth phase. Interference mechanisms (inhibition, superinfection, depletion of hubs, one-time peak infectious) contributed to the effect.

**Implications:** The first-comer advantage explains the global phylogeography of HIV and influences the pandemic's evolution. Variants with higher transmission potential spread at the expense of less efficient strains, epidemics expanding as original strains are replaced by "fitter" lineages. The pace of these processes needs characterization.

**Conclusions:** A simple model of sexually transmitted HIV epidemics allowed monitoring competition of strains with varying transmission rates. Without specific conditions, the highest potential strain drives others extinct: competitive exclusion principle holds from abstract to complex simulations. Parameterized based on heterosexual epidemics in Africa, adaptable to other routes and concentrated epidemics. Mechanisms can slow invasion, but the pandemic shifts between lineages have occurred, e.g. HIV-1 expansion at expense of D in Eastern Africa.

**Title:** Multiscale Organization of the Contractile Cytoskeleton in Cardiac Myocytes: The Role of Extracellular Cues in Myofibrar Patterning

**Research Question:** How do extracellular cues influence the organization of the contractile cytoskeleton in cardiac myocytes, and what mechanisms regulate the self-organization of myofils in striated muscle cells?

**Methods:** We developed a quantitative model of the cytoskeleton of neonatal ventricular myocytes in response to geometric cues in the extracellular matrix, using numerical simulations and in vitro assays to control myocyte shape. We hypothesized that boundary conditions in the extracellular space potentiate the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for sarcomgenesis.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from temporally-ordered processes: interaction between actin fibers, myofibrils, and focal adhesions, as well as cooperative and parallel bundling of nascent myofils. A hierarchy of mechanisms regulate the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton, and a positive feedback loop is responsible for initiating break symmetry, potentiated by extracellular conditions, to polarize the contractile cytoskeleton.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that extracellular cues play a crucial role in the organization of myofils in striated muscle, and that a hierarchy of mechanisms is responsible for myofillar patterning. The model recapitulates the protein choreography of sarcom assembly, where ensemble proteins assemble repetitively along the length of actin template. Myofils mature in force-dependent manner, suggesting contractility may play a role in polarizing myillar network.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of extracellular cues in the organization of contract cytoskeleton in cardiac myocytes, and provides insights into the mechanisms regulating self-organization of myils in striated muscle. Our results have implications for understanding the development and function of muscle, and may inform strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model developed can be used to investigate the sensitivity of intracellular architecture to extracellular space, and guide experiments to understand critical events in assembly and organization of contract apparatus in myocytes.

**Title:** Evaluating the Invasive Potential of Wolbachia, a Symbiotic Bacterium, as a Biocontrol Agent for Dengue Transmission in Urban Environments

**Research Question:** Can Wolia, a symbiotic bacterium, effectively invade and spread through wild mosquito populations in urban environments, and what are the key factors influencing its success?

**Methods:** We investigated the phenotypic effects of the Wolia strain in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes with a Brazilian background, characterizing its invasive potential. We performed mark-release experiments using Wolia-infected mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro, where Wolia will be deployed, and characterized mosquito populations in relation to socio-demographic conditions. We constructed mathematical models using laboratory and field data to describe the influence of urban conditions on the likelihood of Wolia infection reaching 100% following release.

**Findings:** We show that the Wol strain Wolia possesses strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, high maternal transmission rate, and no detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Mark-release experiments indicate differences in daily survival probability for mosquitoes at sites, with better-developed sites being less hospitable. Mathematical models predict successful invasion at five field sites, with conditions varying greatly between sites and influenced by local mosquito population size.

**Implications:** Our results suggest Wolia will successfully invade distinct sites in Rio Janeiro, Brazil, with strong cytoplasmic incompatibility and decreased fecundity promoting invasion. Survival data indicate differences in daily probability for mosquitoes at sites, with bettered sites being less hospitable. Despite this, characterizing field sites prior to release will determine optimal strategy. Our results provide framework for ongoing releases of Wol-infected Ae. aegi in Brazil, holding utility for future releases in heterogeneous landscapes.

**Conclusions:** Field sites in Rio Janeiro are complex, supporting populations of different sizes, affecting Wolia dynamics. However, inter-site differences do not impede overall success. We characterized five sites, mosquito populations, and used models to predict differences affecting invasion Wolia. Collections over two years estimated population sizes, varying greatly amongst sites. Most influencing Wolia spread was local abundance, reinforcing release in higher numbers at sites with larger populations.

**Title:** Identification of JMJ703 as a Histone Lysine Demethylase Regulating Chromatin Structure and Gene Expression in Rice

**Research Question:** What is the role of histone lysine methylation in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression, and how is this epigenetic modification reset in plants?

**Background:** Histone lysine methylation, specifically histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), has been shown to play a crucial role in gene expression involved in plant development and stress adaptation. However, the mechanism of resetting this epigenetic modification is not fully understood.

**Methods:** We identified JMJ, a JC-containing protein, as a histone lys demethylase that specifically reverses all forms of H3K in rice. Loss-of-function of the gene affected stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in mutant.

**Findings:** Analysis of the catalytic core domain of JMJ revealed a structural similarity with mammalian and yeast JM2 proteins that H3 and H36 demethylases. However, specific features were observed in the structure of J. Residues that interact with cofactor Fe II and Nalglycine and methylated H3 substrate were identified and shown to be essential for demethyl activity in vivo. Several residues are conserved in H demethylases, suggesting they may be involved in specificity.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that J is essential for plant division and elongation and demethylates mono-, di-, and trimethyl H in vivo and vitro. Demylation of forms implies J is important for gene expression. Phenotype caused by TNA insertion and RNAi increased CK genes suggest J may regulate hormone metabolism, distinct from J14 that functions in floral, DNA methylation, and silencing.

**Conclusions:** We have identified J as an H demethyl that is important for rice development. Although displays an overall structure to JM2 H and demethylases, exhibits important features conserved within AR and demethylases.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanistic Basis of HIV-1 Capsid-Ligand Interactions: A Multisubunit Interface in Hexamers Mediates Binding to Cellular Cofactors and Antiviral Compounds

**Research Question:** How does the HIV-1 capsid interact with cellular cofactors and antiviral compounds, and what is the mechanistic basis of these interactions?

**Methods:** We used X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of HIV-1 hexamers bound to peptides of cellular cofactors N153 and CPS6 and antiviral compounds PF74 and BI-2.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that a multisubunit interface formed within hexamers mediates binding to linear epitopes within cofactors N153 and CPS6 and is competed by antiviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand is anchored via a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif to a pocket within the N-terminal domain of monomer, and BI-2 also makes interactions across N-terminal C-terminal (NTD) interface to second monomer. Dissociation of hexamer into monomers prevents high affinity with CPS6 and abolishes binding N153. The interface is conformationally dynamic, but binding N153 or CPS6 is accommodated only one conformation. N153 and CPS6 have overlapping sites, but make unique interactions, when selectively mutated, perturb cof dependency.

**Implications:** These findings reveal that multiple ligands share an interface in HIV-1 caps that is lost upon viral disassembly. Understanding the effect of ligand on intact caps is crucial as there are conflicting reports on effect of PF and BI on caps stability. Our results provide molecular basis for associations with caps and effects on HIV-1 infection.

**Conclusions:** We identify a multisub interface in HIV-1 hexers that mediates binding to cofactors and antiral compounds. This interface is conformationally dynamic, but binding cofactors accommodate only one conformation. Cofactors have overlapping sites, but make unique interactions, when mutated, perturb cof dependency. Our results provide molecular basis for associations with caps and effects on HIV-1 infection. Mutations may have direct effect on caps stability but also disrupt cof binding allosterically or interactions with unidentified cofactors.

**Title:** Improved Genome Assembly of the Aedes aegypti Genome Reveals Insights into Disease Transmission and Vector Competence

**Research Question:** The Aedes aegypt is a primary vector of several human arboviruses, including dengue yellow fever and chikunya viruses, but its genome has been poorly assembled due to its large size and repetitive sequences, resulting in 4,758 scaffolds, few of which have been assigned to chromosomes. We aimed to improve the genome assembly by scoring large number of SNPs in recombinant progeny from cross between two strains Ae. aegi and generate a genetic map.

**Methods:** We generated a genetic map using SNPs from a cross between two Ae.egi strains and corrected misassemblies in the current genome, assigning 60% of the sequence to chromosomes and ordering scaffolds along chromosomes. We found large regions of suppressed recombination around centromeres, extending up to 47% of chromosome.

**Findings:** Our improved assembly revealed high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, with sequences from different chromosomes on same scaffold. Once corrected, we were able to assign 60% of genome to chromosomes and order scaffolds along chromosomes. We found large regions of suppressed recombination around centromes, extending up to 47% of chromosome.

**Implications:** This new assembly will facilitate mapping genes affecting disease transmission. We mapped a gene making Ae.eg resistant to human parasite Brug mal and identified candidate genes affecting trait.

**Conclusions:** Our improved assembly of Aeegi genome onto chromosomal scaffolds will facilitate mapping genes affecting disease transmission. We demonstrate utility of this assembly by mapping Aeeg resistance to filarial nematode B. Our study highlights importance of genome organization for understanding vector competence.

**Title:** Comparative Evaluation of Entomological Indices from Larval Surveys and Adult Traps for Surveillance of Aedes aegypti, Vector of Dengue and Yellow Fever in Tropical Regions

**Research Question:** What is the sensitivity of different entomological indices generated by larval surveys and adult traps in detecting mosquito density variation, and how do they compare in terms of seasonal patterns of infestation in tropical regions?

**Methods:** A multicentric entomological survey was conducted in five mid-sized cities representing tropical climate variations, using four types of traps (BG-Sent, Adultrap, MosTRAP, and ovitrap) and larval surveys. Positivity and density indices were calculated and regressed against meteorological variables to characterize seasonal patterns of mosquito infestation.

**Findings:** Traps produced higher positivity indices than larval surveys, indicating greater sensitivity in detecting Ae. aegpti presence. Indices plateaued at high mosquito densities, but agreed on seasonality of abundance in all cities. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature, not precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variation. All traps outperformed larval in measuring seasonal variation in abundance and should be considered complements or alternatives.

**Implications:** Traps are valuable tools for surveillance in deng endemic countries and should be combined with control strategies to improve response to deng and other diseases transmitted by Ae. aegti. Larval and trap surveillance are not interchangeable approaches. Traps' statistical properties (sensitivity, specificity) should be invariant and consistent under low and high abundances.

**Conclusions:** This study supports the development of trap-based surveillance programs in deng countries. Traps are useful for monitoring adult infestation and control impact, while larval surveys identify breeding sites for control strategies. Together, they optimize surveillance and prevention. Future studies should assess the cost-benefit of integrated strategies.

**Research Question:** How does the cytidine deaminase APOEC3 (AG) oligomerize and inhibit retroviruses and transposable elements, and what is the role of RNA in this process?

**Methods:** We used yeast two-hybrid assays, coimmunprecipitation, and chemical crosslinking to identify residues in A3 that mediate oligomerization and packaging into HIV-1 virions. Homology modeling of A3 onto the A2 structure revealed a positively charged pocket at the putative dimer interface. Substitution of arginine residues at positions 24, 30, and 136 in this pocket reduced virus inhibition, virion packaging, and oligomer.

**Findings:** Tyrosine-124 and tryptan-127 in the enzymatically inactive N-terminal CDA domain of A3 mediate oligomer, and this coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. Oligomerization is also shown to be RNA-dependent. Homology modeling A3 onto A2 indicates accumulation of positive charge in a pocket formed by putative dimer interface. Substitution of arginine at 24, 30, and 136 in this pocket resulted in reduced virus inhibition, virion, and oligomer.

**Implications:** The positively charged pocket in A3 is essential for oligomerization, packaging into virions, and antiral function. Occupation of this pocket by RNA promotes A3 oligomer, packaging into virions, and inhibition of HIV-1.

**Conclusions:** We propose that occupation of the positively charged pocket by RNA promotes A3 oligomer, packaging into virions, and antiral function. Oligomer-deficient A3 proteins associated less efficiently with cellular RNA, suggesting that RNA plays a central role in these activities. The structure of A3 is of interest for understanding the interaction with HIV-1 V protein and manipulating this interaction therapeutically.

**Title:** Dissecting the Molecular Mechanisms of a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) at the bric-br Locus in Drosophila melanogaster

**Research Question:** What are the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the large-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) at the bric-br locus in Drosila melanogaster, a model organism with high levels of sequence variation and linkage disequilibrium?

**Methods:** We sequenced the 148 kb bric br (bab) genomic region from 94 inbred lines of D. melanogaster to identify polymorphisms contributing to QTL effects on cuticular pigmentation. We analyzed allele-specific expression at the br-br locus to confirm polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level.

**Findings:** Our results show that br-br alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation result from a cumulative impact of polymorphisms in three functional regions: a promoter, tissue-specific enhancer, and Polycomb response element. These polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level, indicating that a single QTL can act through a confluence of molecular mechanisms. Variation in flanking experimentally validated elements can have significant effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype.

**Implications:** Our findings have important design and conceptual implications for basic and medical genomics. Understanding the identity, distribution, and nature of nucleotide polymorphs comprising Q alleles is critical in molecular and evolutionary genetics. This study takes a QTL to its logical conclusion by describing the fine structure of functional variation underlying large-effect alleles segregating in a population. Our results suggest that accumulation of multiple mutations at a locus may be a common mechanism of micro- and macroevolutionary change.

**Conclusion:** The br locus is composed of ancient duplicated paralogs, bab1 and bab, involved in patterning adult, legs, and ovaries. Bab expression in pupal epidermis is responsible for sex-specific cuticle pigmentation, and changes in regulation have played a role in macroevolution diversification of D melanaster color patterns. This is in contrast to cases where Qs are due single or regulatory mutations with major effects. Detailed analysis of a gene responsible for 100% phenotypic difference between Dila species revealed contributions from independent regions.

**Title:** Regulation of Bacteriocin Production and Competence in Streptoccus pneumococcus: Implications for Adaptation and Competition on the Mucosal Surface

**Research Question:** How does the quorum sensing system controlled by extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide (CSP) regulate bacterioc production and competence in Streptoccus pneumoccus, and what are the implications for adaptation and competition on the mucosal surface?

**Methods:** We investigated the regulation of bacterioc production and competence in Streoccus pneumoccus using biofilm-grown organisms as a model for competition and genetic exchange on the mucosal surface. We demonstrated that CSP stimulates the production of a diverse array of bacteriocins through increased secretion of the bacteriophage BlC (BlC) and requires a functional competence system. We identified a conserved motif in the promoter of the operon encoding BlC and its transporter that mediates upregulation by CSP. Accumulation of BlC following CSP stimulation results in activation of the Bl locus.

**Findings:** Our results show that bacterioc secretion enhances DNA exchange in biofilms, suggesting co-stimulation of bacterioc with competence provides an adaptive advantage. The Bl and regulatory pathways are believed to have diverged and specialized in a remote ancestor pneumoccus, yet maintained a regulatory connection promoting competition and adaptation by targeting a wide range of competitors while providing means for incorporation of DNA.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of bacterioc production and competence in pneumoccus adaptation and competition on mucosal surface. The quorum system controlled by CSP regulates bacterioc production and competence, and bacterioc secretion enhances DNA exchange in biofilms. The conserved motif in promoter BlC and its transporter mediates upregulation by CSP, and accumulation BlC results in activation of Bl locus. Bacterin production increases transformation efficiency in dual biofilms, suggesting liberation of DNA through pneumin contributes to remarkable adaptability of pathogen.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that pneumoc strains sharing CSP type likely communicate through induction of competence resulting in fratric immunity. Unlike competence-mediated fratric system, Bl bacterin locus characterized by diversity in signaling and effector proteins, limiting cross-immunity between co-colonizing strains. Pneumoc bacterin production controlled by Bl locus, stimulated by accumulation BlC pherone, and biofilm-grown pneumoccus induce bacterin and competence without exogenous inducer phones, indicating local density importance. Regulatory mechanism controlling competence may function differently in bio-grown organisms.

**Title:** Mechanism of Ribosome Recruitment to Poliovirus IRES Translation: Role of PCBP and SR20 Interaction

**Research Question:** How do canonical and non-canonical factors contribute to the recruitment of ribosomes to poliovirus RNA for translation?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between cellular proteins PCBP and SR20 in poliovirus-infected neuroblastoma cells to elucidate the mechanism of ribosome recruitment for poliov IRES translation.

**Findings:**

* SR20 relocalizes from the nucleus to cytoplasm during poliovirus infection and co-localizes with PC2 in the cytoplasm, corroborating in vitro data.
* SR20 is associated with PC2 bound to polirus RNA in infected cells, indicating interaction on viral RNA.
* Mutated SR20 lacking RNA recognition motif (SR20ΔM) localizes similarly to full-length SR20 and co-localizes with PC2, but expression results in ∼100-fold decrease in polivirus yield.
* Co-sedation of SR20 and PC2 with 40S ribosomal subunits from poliov-infected cells suggests functioning in translation complex formation.

**Implications:**

* PC2-SR20 interaction is crucial for poliovirus translation, with SR20 interacting with PC2 on viral RNA to recruit ribosomes in direct or indirect manner.
* Localization of SR20 in cytoplasm allows continued availability for polivirus translation.
* Studies suggest role of SR in linking splicing and translation in eukaryotic cells and cap-dependent translation of certain RNAs.

**Conclusions:**

* PC2-SR20 interaction is essential for polivirus, with SR20 interacting PC2 on viral RNA to recruit ribosomes for IRES translation initiation.
* Mutated SR20 results in decreased polivirus yield, underscoring significance SR20 for polivirus.
* This work provides insights into mechanisms of ribosome recruitment for polivirus IRES translation and non-canonical factors bridging translation machinery to RNA.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel Allele of the Receptor Tyrosine Kinase ERBB3 (Erbb3) in the Regulation of Neural Crest Development

**Research Question:** What genetic pathways regulate the development of the neural crest (NC), a population of embryonic stem cells that gives rise to various cell types, including glia and neurons of the peripheral and enteric nervous systems, and melanocytes of the skin and hair, and how do alterations in these processes lead to disease?

**Methods:** We conducted an N-ethyl-nitrosurea (ENU) mutagenesis screen utilizing a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, Sox10ac/+, to identify molecular pathways regulating NC development. Out of 71 pedigrees analyzed, we identified four heritable loci, modifier of Sox expression 1-4 (m1-4), which altered NC patterning.

**Findings:** In homozygous m1 embryos, Sox10ac expression was absent in cranial ganglia, cranial nerves, and sympathetic chain; however, development of Sox-expressing cells was unaffected by mutation. Linkage analysis, sequencing, and complement testing confirmed m1 as a new allele of receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB3, Erb3m1, carrying a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region of protein. The ENU-induced mutation did not alter protein expression, however, it was sufficient to impair ER3 signaling such that embryonic defects in m1 resembled those of ER3 null alleles. Biochemical analysis of mutant showed ER3 was expressed on surface, but ligand-induced phosphorylation was dramatically reduced by m mutation.

**Implications:** These findings highlight the importance of mutated residue for ER3 receptor function and activation. This study underscores the utility of ENU mutagenesis in identifying genetic pathways regulating NC and dissecting roles of discrete domains contributing to better understanding gene function in cellular and developmental setting.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the utility of ENU mutagenesis in identifying genetic pathways regulating NC development and dissecting roles of protein domains contributing to better understanding gene function in cellular and developmental setting. We identified a novel allele of receptor tyrosine kinase ER3, Erb3m1, which plays a crucial role in NC patterning. This study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms regulating NC development and potential therapeutic targets for neurocopathies.

**Title:** Investigating Factors Influencing Schistosoma Infection in a Rural Ugandan Fishing Community: A Multidisciplinary Approach

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing Schistosoma mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan fishing community, focusing on the impact of age, sex, and ethnic background on susceptibility to reinfection after anthelmintic treatment, while accounting for environmental and behavioral heterogeneities.

**Methods:** We analyzed data from a multidisciplinary reinfection study in a Ugandan fishing community highly endemic for Schistosomiasis. To account for the complex, ethnically-influenced patterns of exposure, we utilized individual-level cercarial exposure scores to adjust for variations in exposure. This approach was supported by epidemiological studies investigating patterns of exposure and reinfection in Schistomias-endemic communities.

**Findings:** Our results suggest that ethnic and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to variations in cercarial exposure, rather than biological differences in susceptibility. Age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure, but linked to IgE and IgG to tegument antigen SmAL (formerly Sm22.6), which was significantly related to resistance to rein.

**Implications:** This study highlights the benefit of a multidisciplinary approach in field settings, allowing the ecology of a population to be understood and more robust conclusions to be made. Our findings suggest that cercarial exposure is a key factor in S. mansoni reinfection in this community, while Ig responses may play a role in age-related differences.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of accounting for environmental and behavioral heterogene in field studies, and the value of a multidisciplinary approach in understanding complex settings. Our results suggest that cercarial exposure is a key factor in S. mansoni rein in this community, while Ig responses may play a role in age-related differences.

**Title:** Correlation between Egg Count per Gram of Feces (EPG) and Worm Burden of Clonorchis sinensis in Humans

**Research Question:** Does the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) accurately estimate the worm burden of Clonchis sin in humans?

**Methods:** A total of 60 residents, 50 egg-positive and 10-negative, in Sanche-gun, Korea, participated in this study from 2006-2009. Egg positivity in feces was diagnosed using Kato-K method. After administration of prazantel, they were purged with cathartics the next day, and adult worms collected from fec. EP ranged from 0 to 65,544. Adult C. sin were collected from 17-positive cases, and number ranged from 1 to 114 each.

**Findings:** A significant correlation between EP and number of worms demonstrated (r= 0.681, P<0.001). Recovery rates were 9.7% in EP 1-1,000 and 73.7% in EP over 1,000. No worms detected from egg-negative subjects. Maximum count per worm per day estimated 3,770 in subject EP 2,664,106 collected. Numbers of worms correlated with egg in Cloniasis.

**Implications:** The number of eggs per gram of feces (EP) is a reliable method to estimate worm burden of Clonch sin in humans. This study demonstrated a positive correlation between EP and number of worms, suggesting that EP can be used as an indicator of infection intensity.

**Conclusions:** At least 110 worms are infected in human with EP around 3,000, and productivity per day around 4,000. This study supports the use of EP as a diagnostic tool for Clchiasis infection.

**Title:** Uncovering Novel Therapeutic Targets for Antimicrobial Resistance through Unbiased Genome-Wide Screens: A Proof of Concept in Candida glabrata

**Research Question:** Can unbiased genome-wide screens identify novel genetic components within interaction networks as potential targets for combination therapies in the context of antimicrobial resistance?

**Methods:** We implemented an unbiased genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing Candida glata P1 gain-of-function allele, a principal mediator of fluconazole resistance in this fungal pathogen. Eighteen synthetically lethal S cerevisiae genetic mutants were identified in cells expressing glata P1. One mutant lacking histone acetylase G5 was further investigated.

**Findings:** Deletion or drug inhibition of G5 caused lethal phenotype in glata cells expressing P1 alleles, and inhibited emergence of fluazole-resistant glata isolates in evolution experiments.

**Implications:** This study provides proof of concept that synthetically lethal screens can identify candidate proteins therapeutically targeted, allowing effective treatment of drug-resistant infections.

**Conclusions:** Targeting synthetically lethal interactions offers a new paradigm for treatment of drug-resistant infections. We demonstrated that G5, a synthetically interacting partner of P1 identified in S cerevis, renders both species orthologous glata mutant inviable, supporting the proposition that targeting lethal interactions is a valuable approach to prevent emergence of drug resistance. C glata strains harbouring P mutations exhibit increased virulence, implying adaptation to antifungals enhances ability to cause disease. Our unbiased screen identified mutants synthetically lethal with P1 fluazole C glata cells, adopting combination of genome-wide screens and mutant construction. Notably, addition of 2M γ-butyrolone, G5 inhibitor, prevented growth of S cerevis P1 expressing glata P1, clinical C glata DYS expressing P1, and engineered glata lab strain with wild-type P replaced P1.

**Key Findings:**

* Eighteen synthetically lethal S cerevis mutants were identified in expressing glata P1
* Deletion or drug inhibition of G5 caused lethal phenotype in glata expressing P alleles
* Deletion or inhibition of G5 inhibited emergence of fluazole glata isolates in evolution
* G5 synthetically interacting with P identified in Svis is conserved in glata
* G5 inhibition prevented growth of Svis P expressing glata P, clinical glata D expressing P, and engineered glata strain with wild-type P replaced P

**Implications:**

* Targeting synthetically lethal interactions offers new paradigm for treatment of drug-resistant infections
* Unbiased screens can identify novel components within interaction networks as targets for combination therapies
* G5 synthetically interacting with P identified in Svis renders glata inviable, supporting proposition that targeting lethal is valuable to prevent emergence of resistance
* glata harbouring P mutations exhibit increased virulence, implying adaptation to antifung enhances ability to cause disease

**Title:** Temporal Dynamics of Phosphatidylinositol-4-Phosphate (PI4) Remodeling and Its Role in Poliovirus (PV) Replication and Assembly

**Research Question:** What is the temporal dynamics of phosphatidyositol-4-phosphate (PI) remodeling during poliovirus (PV) infection and its role in replication and assembly?

**Methods:** We used two PV mutants, EG and GG, which exhibit aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor, substantially delaying the onset of genome replication and assembly, to illuminate the pathway of PV-induced membranous structure formation. Immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI during PV infection.

**Findings:** PI remodeling occurred as early as 30 minutes post-infection, even in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor, and was accompanied by formation of tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters appeared in the perinuclear region of the cell at 3 hours post-infection, too slow for these structures to be responsible for replication delays. The onset of genome replication for EG and GG PVs was similar to delays in PI remodeling, consistent with PI serving as a marker of genome-replication organel. GG was unable to convert virus-induced tubules into vesicular, explaining nearly 5-log reduction in infectious produced.

**Implications:** Our results suggest PV induces temporally distinct membrous structures (organel) for replication (tubules) and assembly (ves clusters). The pace of formation, spatiemporal dynamics, and efficiency of replication-to-assembly conversion may be set by the rate P poly processing and capacity to yield 3 and/or 3 proteins.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first evidence of PI remodeling during PV infection and its role in replication and assembly. Our results are consistent with PV inducing distinct membrous structures for genome replication and assembly. We propose that the spatiemporal dynamics and efficiency of replication-to-assembly conversion may be set by the rate of P poly processing and capacity to yield 3 and 3 proteins.

**Title:** Identification of Novel Non-Peptid, Non-Covalent Cruzain Inhibitors with Trypanocidal Activity through Integrated Ligand and Target-Based Virtual Screening and Structure-Activity Relationship Studies

**Research Question:** Can a multi-step strategy using ligand and target-based virtual screening methods identify non-peptide, nonvalent cruzain inhibitors with trypanidal activity from the ZINC database, and establish structure-activity relationships for optimization?

**Methods:** We employed ligand and target virtual screening of the ZINC database, followed by enzymatic assays, X-ray crystallography, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of promising hits to identify non-peptide nonval cruzain inhibitors with tryidal activity.

**Findings:** 23 compounds were selected from the ZINC database, 12 nonvalent cruzain inhibitors with Ki values in the low micromolar range (3-60µM) acting through competitive inhibition were identified. The binding mode of cruzain inhibitor Neimed was confirmed through X-ray crystallography. Cruzain, a validated target for Chagas disease, shares similarity with mammalian homolog cathepsin L. Increased catheps L activity is linked to invasive properties and metastatic cancer cells; cruz inhibitors were assayed against cathe L, yielding affinities in a range (4-80µM, poor selectivity towards cruz, raising possibility investigating effect on cell proliferation. SAR studies of most potent cruz inhibitors against T. cruz-infected cells revealed two with tryidal activity. Using Neimed as precursor, SAR established the 2-acetamthiophene-3-carbox group essential for enzyme and parasite inhibition. The IC50 for Neimed against T. trypastig form was 10.6±0.1µM, tenfold lower than benidazole, positive control.

**Implications:** This study identifies new classes of cruzain inhibitors focusing on non-peptide nonval ligands through virtual screening, enzymatic assays, and X-raylography. A hit 2-acetamthophene-carbox, nonvalently inhibits cruz, has tryidal and structureactivity relationships. This compound advances lead optimization for Chagas chemotherapy. Cruzain EC 3.4.22.51 (cruzain) information can be found at http://www.brendenzymes.org/php_flat.php?ec=3.4.22.

**Conclusions:** Five cruz inhibitors show tryidal against T. trypastive form. A newly identified fragment of 2-acamthene-carbox class advances search for nonval cruzain. Chagas is a neglected tryosomias with social and economic impact in Latin America. New drugs with fewer side effects than current chemotherapy are needed. Efforts have focused on cruzain as target, K77 a cruz inhibitor in clinical studies. This study integrates in silico and in vitro, X-raylog to discover new-peptide hits tryidal against cruz.

**Title:** Development of Novel Non-Viral DNA-Based Formulations for Yellow Fever Vaccine: Characterization of Immunological Properties and Protective Efficacy

**Research Question:** Can non-viral DNA-based formulations encoding the full-length envelope protein of the yellow fever virus (YF) or its fusion with lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 (L) induce strong T-cell and humoral immune responses and provide protection against YF infection?

**Methods:** Two DNA constructs, p/Y and p/Y, encoding the full-length envelope protein and its fusion with L, respectively, were evaluated in C57/6 and BAL/c mice. Immune responses were compared to the standard YF 17 vaccine. T-cell responses were assessed by IFN-gamma ELISP assay, and neutralizing antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization.

**Findings:** Both formulations induced strong T-cell responses against all epitopes generated by YF 17, with p/Y performing best. Additionally, p/Y elicited high titers of anti-Y neutralizing antibodies comparable to the 17 vaccine. Importantly, p/Y provided 100% protection against lethal Y challenge in mice.

**Implications:** These results indicate p/Y is an excellent vaccine candidate for further development, offering a safer alternative to attenuated YF vaccine with potential to reduce morbidity and mortality in tropical regions.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of noniral DNA-based formulations for YF vaccine development, providing strong T-cell and humoral responses and protection against lethal challenge. p/Y merits further investigation as a promising vaccine candidate for tropical regions where Y remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality.
Here is a 300-400 word abstract for the research article on "Chitin utilization by the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholera is required for persistence and evolution via horizontal gene transfer in the marine environment":

**Research Question:** How does the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholera utilize chitin for persistence and evolution in the marine environment, and what are the regulatory mechanisms involved in this process?

**Methods:** An unbiased transposon mutant screen was used to identify the nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA as a regulator of the ch operon, which encodes genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of the chitin dischar chitobio. The interaction between SlmA and the ch oper promoter was investigated in vitro and in vivo.

**Findings:** SlmA, a member of the TetR family of transcriptional repressors, binds directly to the ch promoter and is required for transcriptional activation of this locus and chitio utilization. DNA-binding, not nucle occlusion, is critical for transcription activation. This study identifies a novel role for SlmA as a transcription regulator in Vibrio cholera, in addition to its established role as a cell licensing factor.

**Implications:** Chitin utilization by Vibrio cholera is required for persistence and evolution in the marine environment, and SlmA is a key regulator of this process. The discovery of SlmA as a transcription activator of the ch oper expands our understanding of the regulation of chitin degradation and utilization in this pathogen.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of chitin-Vibrio interactions for the persistence, transmission, and evolution of Vibrio cholera in its environmental reservoir. The expression of genes for ch degradation, uptake, and utilization are regulated by the orphan kinase ChiS, which is repressed by chitin binding protein (CB), a periplasm substrate for the chobse ABC transporter. The discovery of SlmA as a transcriptional activator of the oper provides new insights into the regulation of ch degradation and utilization in Vibrio cholera.

**Title:** Scalable Nonlinear Programming Framework for Parameter Estimation in Dynamic Biological Systems: A Novel Approach for Efficient and Robust Solution

**Research Question:** How can we develop a computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use framework for solving parameter estimation problems in dynamic modeling of biological systems, which often involve highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations and numerous experimental data sets?

**Methods:** We propose a novel nonlinear programming (NLP) framework that leverages cutting-edge modeling and solution tools to tackle these computationally challenging problems. Our framework employs a time-discretization approach that (i) avoids repetitive simulations of the model, (ii) enables algebraic implementation of derivatives, and (iii) utilizes computationally efficient nonlinear point solvers that exploit sparse and structured algebra techniques.

**Findings:** We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework by solving synthetic gut microbiome models with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 data points in under 3 minutes, outperforming off-the-shelf simulation-based solutions requiring 7 hours. Additionally, we show scalability by solving instances with 2,352 parameters, 2,304 equations, and 20,352 points in 15 minutes.

**Implications:** Our framework is flexible, easy-to-use, and can be applied to dynamic biological systems, enabling implementation of sophisticated techniques for parameter uncertainty quantification, observability analysis, model selection, and outlier handling.

**Conclusions:** Dynamic modeling is crucial for understanding biological systems, including microbial communities, gene networks, and pathways. Parameter estimation against experimental data is computationally challenging due to optimization of differential equations. Our framework combines modern tools to create scalable, robust, easy-to-use, and flexible solutions. We demonstrate benefits by solving challenging problems in microbial models, enabling higher-level tasks such as observability and uncertainty quantification. The achieved efficiency enables kinetic modeling complex systems from biomolecular to high-dimensional communities. Our framework can construct and analyze high-fidelity whole-cell or microbiomes.

**Title:** High-Throughput Gene Expression Analysis Reveals Dynamic Changes in Inflammatory Response to West Nile Virus Infection in a Mouse Model

**Research Question:** Understanding the changes in gene expression following viral infection is crucial for elucidating viral pathogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the use of a high-throughput digital expression system, nCounter, to investigate West Nile virus (WNV) dissemination and inflammatory response in the outbred Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model over the course of infection.

**Methods:** The nCounter Inflammation gene kit, containing 179 inflammation-related genes, was used to analyze expression changes in multiple tissues over nine days of infection in SW mice following intraperitoneal injection with NV. Protein levels of a subset cytokine/chemokine genes were determined using multiplex detection system (Biolex) and comparisons of protein/RNA levels made.

**Findings:** Expression of spleen, lung, liver, and brain of mice with NV revealed Ccl and Ilb were differentially expressed in all tested tissues except kidney. Stratification of infected (NV+) versus non-infected (−) tissues allowed differentiation of systemic gene response from tissue-specific arising NV infection. Significant (p<0.05) decrease C1 was found in NV− sple, while Il was upregulated, Il was downregulated in NV− lung, and M2 were downregulated in NV− liver. NV+ livers, Stat, T2, chemines C, C, C, C, C, C, cytokine, Il, cytokine, and agonist were upregulated. NV− tissues, C and C were upregulated.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the utility of nCounter for rapid identification of gene changes in mice associated with NV infection. The dynamic expression profiles of inflammatory response NV-infected SW mice were analyzed using nCounter, a next-generation digital system allowing multiplex expression in one reaction without enzymatic RNA amplification. Stratification of infected versus non-inf tissues from NV SW allowed differentiation gene responses considered general response NV infection versus tissue-specific due NV. Complementary high-throughput analysis gene and protein kinetics validated expression.

**Conclusions:** The nCounter enabled rapid profiling of large inflammatory response genes multiple tissues over NV infection in outbred model and differentiate general versus specific changes NV+ versus NV− tissues. High-through digital analysis investigated response throughout infection course NV Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model. Data demonstrate use complementary gene and protein reliable methods determine responses elicited viral and changes relate kinetics replication.

**Title:** Epidemiological and Clinical Features of Human Rabies and Animal Bites in Maputo and Matola Cities, Mozambique: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Research Question:** What are the epidemiological and clinical features of human rabies and animal bites in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique, and what are the risk factors associated with developing rabies after an animal bite?

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique from April to August 2014. Cases of human rabies and animal bites were reviewed, and a community investigation was carried out in the neighborhoods where cases resided. Clinical, demographic, and epidemiological information was collected, and a case-control study was conducted to investigate risk factors associated with rabies.

**Findings:** Fourteen cases of human rabies were detected in Maputo (n=10) and Matola (n=3) and Boane (n=1) between April and August 2014, all with a history of recent dog bite. Of 14 rabid dogs, only 1 was immunized. 819 animal bites were registered, 64.6% (529) from Maputo. Dogs were responsible for 97.8% (801) bites, but 27.0% (126) were immunized. Factors associated with rabies: age <15 (p=0.05), bite by stray (p=0.002), deep wound (p=0.02), bite head (p=0.001), by unimmun dog (p=0.01), no soap and water (p=0.001), and post-exposure prophyl (p=0.01).

**Implications:** Implementation of control measures for rab is poor in Maputo and Matola, where cases of rab are strongly associated with stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular post-exposure measures.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to formulating recommendations for rab control in Mozambique. It is the first attempt to investigate rab outbreak and epidemi profile animal bites in Mozambique. In Mozambique, like sub-Saharan countries, procedures are irregular, resulting in frequent rab outbreaks. Maputo, national health authorities alerted a possible outbreak in July 2014. Reliable data on burden and factors with rab is a challenge for policies and strategies control and a major cause underinvestment in measures. Mozambique has high burden of rab in sub-Saharan Africa.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel SCN9 Gene Mutation Associated with Febrile Seizure (FS) and Its Role in Epilepsy

**Research Question:** We investigated the genetic basis of febr seizure (FS) in a large Utah family with significant linkage to chromosome 2q and identified a novel mutation in the SCN9 gene, encoding the Nav1.7 sodium channel subunit.

**Methods:** We analyzed 21 affected family members and found a highly conserved amino acid mutation, p.N641, in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II, absent in ethnically matched control chromosomes. We introduced the orthologous mutation into the murine Sc9 ortholog using targeted homologous recombination to establish a functional role in seizure susceptibility.

**Findings:** Homozygous Sc9N641/N641 knock mice exhibited significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures and increased kindling acquisition rates, supporting SCN9 as a disease-causing gene in this family. We analyzed 92 unrelated FS patients and identified highly conserved Nav.7 missense variants in 5% of patients, including a child with Dravet syndrome (myoclonic epilepsy of infancy) who harbored a heterozygous frameshift SCN1 mutation. Subsequent analysis of 109 Drav syndrome patients yielded 9 Nav.7 missense variants 8 of patients, all highly conserved amino acids.

**Implications:** This study provides evidence for a role of SCN9 in human epilepsies, both as a cause and partner with SCN1 mutations. The SCN9-NY segregating mutation in our K5 family and reduced seizure and kindling phenotypes conferred by the same mutation in Sc9 knockin mice suggest SCN has a role in central excitability and disease-causing in this family.

**Conclusions:** A mutation in a conserved amino residue of SCN sodium channel subunit is associated with a wide spectrum of seizure phenotypes in a single family, including FS, self-limited afeile seizures, and temporal lobe epilepsy. Homozygous Sc9N641/N641 mice are more susceptible to seizures than wild-type mice that activate either forebrain or hind, both clonic and tonic-cl generalized seizures characteristic of FS induced by lower currents in mice with p.NY mutation Sc9. This study highlights the importance of SCN in human epileies, both as a cause and partner SCN mutations.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Polarity-Based Systems in Tissue Morphogenesis: A Novel Insights from the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) Framework

**Research Question:** How do complex tissue shapes arise through growth, particularly when growth occurs preferentially along specific orientations, and how are these orientations specified?

**Methods:** We developed the Polarised Tissue (PT) framework, a polarity-based system, where tissue is treated as a continuous material with regionally expressed factors interacting under genetic control. Polarity is established by signals propagating through the tissue, anchored in regions termed polarity organisers, also under genetic control. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to polarity are specified through a regulatory network. Growth depends on specified patterns interacting within mechanically constrained tissue, leading to emergence of features not directly specified by regulatory networks.

**Findings:** The PT framework illustrates the value in understanding morphogenesis by applying to a growing Snapdragon, indicating hypotheses testable by simulation. Combinatorial interactions between orientations and growth rates, a feature of polarity-based systems, have been exploited to generate observed shapes.

**Implications:** The PT framework offers flexibility to account for shape changes, growth patterns, and clones without invoking large polarity organisers, demonstrating the validity of polarity for growth control orientations. Unlike stress-based systems, orientations can be specified independently and combined in various ways, a combinatorial aspect. Shapes reflect interactions between orientations, growth, and mechanical constraints. Depending on spatial organisers and polarity dynamics, tissue can reinforce or antagonise curvatures or generate curvature in uniform growth.

**Conclusions:** The PT framework provides theoretical foundations for modelling polarity-based systems and highlights the importance of combinatorial interactions between orientations and growth in morphogenesis. Polarity-based systems have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of biological shapes, offering a new perspective on tissue morphogenesis.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Interference in the Emergence of Escape Mutations in HIV Infection: A Computational Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** How does interference between concurrent mutations affect the emergence of escape mutations in HIV infection, and can it be a source of the observed decrease in escape rate (ER) pattern?

**Methods:** We developed a multi-locus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination as a null model for interference, and derived an interference-free model assuming neutral evolution before immune response elicitation. We analyzed the effects of interference on escape rates in multiple epitopes and whether it could be a source of ER pattern.

**Findings:** Interference between equally advantageous mutations can generate the ER pattern. The number of loci and recombination rates affect ER, which can be explained by exponential decline of escape rates over time. The observed ER pattern in HIV individuals is consistent with both interference-free and interference effects.

**Implications:** Our results confirm that interference should be considered when analyzing escape mutations. The challenge in estimating escape rates and selective coefficients posed by interference cannot be overcome by improved sampling sizes due to fundamental shortcomings of current techniques under interference regimes. Accounting for stochastic competition between mutations demands novel methodologies based on analysis of strains rather than frequencies.

**Conclusions:** Interference can be a source of ER in HIV infection. The observed ER pattern contains information about the presence of interference during early infection. A system transition from sequential to multiple regime where interference is expected if interference causes ER. We utilized a Wrightisher model of HIV that incorporates epitopes, loci, selection, mutation, and recombination to track ER. The large population size and high mutation rate of HIV lead to simultaneous emergence of beneficial mutations at distinct sites. Theoretical genetics suggests abundant mutations generate concurrent lineages given low recombination rates and selective pressures. Interference in HIV is corroborated by recent studies.

**Title:** Predictive Modeling of Chemotherapy Efficacy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Mechanistic Approach for Personalized Treatment Planning

**Research Question:** Can a mechanistic modeling of cancer response to treatment be used to estimate the in vivo cell killing ability of chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) patients, enabling personalized treatment planning?

**Methods:** A mechanistic model of cancer response to treatment was applied to estimate the plausible range of cell efficacy of cisplatin-based doublet regimens in NSCL patients. The model incorporates cancer mechanisms of uncontrolled proliferation, heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. Tumor volumetric data at two points before and during treatment were used, accounting for tumor microenvironment and repulation effects. Sensitivity analysis using one-factor-at-a-time and Latin hypercube/partial correlation established growth rate and fraction as key features for accurate estimates.

**Findings:** The model was applied to retrospective data of 13 NSCL patients receiving cisplatin with gemcitab, vinlbine, or docetax in neoadjuvant context. Input values were guided by literature on cancer-specific kinetics. Latincube sampling compensated for patient uncertainties. Estimates of cell killing efficacy were correlated with molecular profiles, serving as basis for personalized predictions.

**Implications:** This work provides a framework for estimating in-vivo cell killing of chemotherapies. Correlation with molecular profiles enables reliable predictions.

**Conclusions:** Mechanistic models can estimate in vivo drug efficacy. This study estimated range of cell efficacy for NSCL treated with cisatin-based regimens using a mechan model of response treatment. Cell efficacy is expressed as sum kill rates of two drugs. The model was adapted to 13 clinical cases of NSCL to determine set of input parameters corresponding to type cancer, patient, treatment. Estimation viewed as two-step process. A methodology for estimating in vivo killing based on clinical data has been developed. Discrete-discrete, clinically-oriented model of response to chemotherapy translates shrinkage to cytotoxicity, accounting tumor kinetics on outcome. Histology and response of 13 lung cases were analyzed to evaluate efficacy of three regimens: cisatin gemab, cipl docax, cipl vinlb. Proliferation features used for OFAT analysis were ADC, SCC. LHS samples used for estimation of killing of various regimens. Kill of cisatin, CKcisP, adapted to observed or assumed in sensitivity, tumor reduction.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Transient Antibiotic Tolerance in Bacterial Biofilms: A Role of SOS Response and Nutrient Starvation

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying transient antibiotic tolerance in bacterial biofilms, and how do they differ from well-characterized antibiotic resistance mechanisms?

**Methods:** We employed random transposon mutagenesis to identify biofilm-specific mutants in Escherichia coli that exhibited tolerance toloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. We demonstrated that biofilms formed by amino auxotrophic mutants displayed greater tolerance toloxacin than their planktonic counterparts. We further investigated the role of SOS response and stringent response in biofilm tolerance tolox.

**Findings:** Biofilm tolerance tolox was dependent on SOS response to both amino acid and carbon starvation, and partially on stringent response to leucine starvation. However, bio-specificlox tolerance did not involve SOS-induced toxin-antitoxin systems associated with highly tolerant persister formation. Notably, biolox tolerance increased with bio age, dependent on SOS response.

**Implications:** Our results reveal that SOS response in nutrient-deprived bio microenvironments is a key mechanism for bio-specific tolerance tolox. Bio heterogeneity creates specialized niches that respond to local cues, leading to genetically and metabolically distinct subpopulations exhibiting tolerance to extracellular stresses like antibiotics.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies SOS response and nutrient starvation as critical for bio-specific tolerance tolox, distinct from well-characterized antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Our findings highlight the importance of bio heterogeneity in biofilm physiology, where subpopulations adapt to local cues, leading to transiently expressed states of tolerance. We propose that SOS response in nutrient-deprived bio is a key mechanism for bio-specific tolerance tolox.

**Title:** Identification of cAMP as a Key Regulator of Microneme Secretion in Plasium falcumeroites Invasion of Erythrocytes

**Research Question:** How do Plasium falcumeroites regulate micron secretion during invasion of erythrocytes, and what are the molecular mechanisms involved in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in regulating micron secretion in Plas fumeroites during invasion of erythrocytes using a combination of biochemical and pharmacological approaches. We exposed meroites to a low K+ environment, typical of blood plasma, and measured changes in cytosolic cAMP levels, protein kinase activity, and micron secretion. Additionally, we used pharmacological inhibitors to explore the role of adenyly cyclase β (AC) and other signaling pathways involved in micron secretion.

**Findings:** We found that exposure of meroites to low K+ environment activates bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasm adly cyclase, leading to a rise in cytos c levels and activation of protein kinase, which regulates micron secretion. Moreover, we demonstrated that c regulates meroite cytos Ca+ levels via induction of Ep pathway and that both c and Ca+ are essential for micron secretion. Our results suggest that c plays a key role in regulating micron secretion during invasion.

**Implications:** Identification of c-dependent pathways regulating micron secretion provides novel targets to inhibit blood parasite growth and prevent malaria. Our findings highlight the importance of c signaling in Plas fero invasion and suggest potential for therapeutic interventions targeting this pathway.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals c as a key regulator of micron secretion in Pl feroites invasion erythrocy, highlighting the importance of c-dependent pathways in this process. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Pl fero invasion and suggest potential targets for malaria prevention and treatment.

**Title:** Global Prevalence of Strongyloides stercis Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 20 Years of Research

**Research Question:** What is the global prevalence of Strongyloides stercis infection in different populations and risk groups, and what are the associations with socio-economic and ecological factors?

**Methods:** A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed for articles published between January 1989 and October 2011 using the terms "Strongloides" or "Strongloides stercis" or "Strongloiasis". 354 studies from 78 countries were included, with 194 (62.4%) community-based, 121 (34.2%) hospital-based, and 39 (11.0%) refugee/immigrant studies. A Bayesian meta-analysis was performed to obtain country-specific estimates and compare odds ratios in risk groups, accounting for diagnostic sensitivities.

**Findings:** The meta-analysis showed a significant association between HIV/AIDS and alcoholism and Stronglois infection (OR: 2.17, CI 1.18-4.01; OR:6.69, CI 1.47-3.38). High prevalence rates were found in selected countries and regions. Strongis is prominent in several risk groups. Adequate information is lacking from many countries.

**Implications:** Our findings underscore that Strongis should not be neglected. Further assessments in socio-economic and ecological settings and integration into global health control are warranted.

**Conclusion:** Stronglo stercis, a soil-transmitted nematode, is one of the most neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Despite its world-wide distribution, prevalence estimates are often educated guesses. Data is required for all countries and socio-cultural settings. Large-scale surveys of the general population and sensitive methods would help narrow the gap. Comprehensive collection of global Strongis rates may have been missed due to language and database restrictions.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Stochastic Noise in Circadian Rhythms: A Novel Approach to Quantifying and Modulating Cellular Autonomy

**Research Question:** How does stochastic noise at the cellular level influence circadian oscillations, and how can it be modulated by small molecule perturbations?

**Methods:** We employed a novel approach to quantify stochastic noise in circadian rhythms by analyzing the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings in cultured cells. Using fibroblast data, we demonstrated that higher stochastic noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level. We further showed that the rate of damping can be changed in a dose-dependent manner by small molecule modulators and explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that stochastic noise is altered independently from period and amplitude, and phase, and that the unperturbed clock is optimized for robust rhythms, with few perturbations capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering noise.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic, particularly in the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics. Our method can be applied to existing high-throughput circadian screens, enabling the quantification of stochastic noise and its modulation by small molecules.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the significance of stochastic noise in circadian rhythms and its modulation by small molecule perturbations. Our approach provides a novel method for quantifying stochastic from population-level circadian biolumines recordings, applicable to high-throughput circadian screens. The findings suggest that the unpurbed clock is optimized for robust rhythms, with few perturbations capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering noise. This has implications for the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics and understanding of circadian regulation.

**Key contributions:**

* Developed a novel method to quantify stochastic noise from population-level circadian biolumines recordings
* Demonstrated that damping rate is proportional to single-cell noise
* Showed dose-dependent modulation of damping by small molecule perturbations
* Revealed independence of stochastic from period and phase
* Hypothesized the unpert clock is optimized for robust rhythms

**Future directions:**

* Apply method to genome-wide siRNA screens to investigate stochastic modulation
* Investigate the role of extrinsic noise in circadian oscillations
* Develop small-molecule circadian therapeutics targeting stochastic

**Title:** Elucidating the Species-Specific Binding Mechanisms of the Allosteric Inhibitor PC723 to Bacterial FZ Protein: Implications for Targeted Antibiotic Development

**Research Question:** How does the allosteric inhibitor PC723 interact with the essential cytoskeletal protein FZ in different bacterial species, and what are the implications for targeted antibiotic development?

**Methods:** We employed the PocketFEATURE algorithm, a statistical method that scores similarity between small-molecule binding sites based on 3D structural information and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to examine the binding environment of PC723 to FZ in various bacterial species.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed that nucleotide state and species have significant impacts on the structural properties of the binding site, with disparate microenvironments for bacterial species outside the Staphlococcus genus. MD simulations of S aureus FZ bound to GTP with mutations known to confer PC723 resistance showed that PC723 strongly prefers Staphlocus FZ in the nucleotide state. Additionally, simulations of FZ dimerization indicated that polymerization may enhance PC723 binding.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that the drug-binding pocket can vary across species, genetic perturbations, and polymer states, providing crucial information for the development of FZ inhibitors. Specifically, our prediction that PC723 has high affinity for binding in FZ structures from Staphloc species but not in FZ from other species has significant implications for its development as a therapeutic.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of evaluating the 3D environment of a drug-binding pocket to illuminate molecular mechanisms governing drug-protein interactions. The species-specific features of the PC723-binding pocket's microenvironment affect its affinity for FZ, suggesting that PC723 may be effective against Staphloc species but not others. Our findings have implications for the design of alternative mutants with equivalent structural and chemical features.

**Title:** Structural Insights into the Lentiviral IN-LEDGF Interaction: Implications for HIV-1 Replication and Therapeutic Targeting**

**Research Question:** How does the lentiviral integrase (IN) protein interact with its cellular partner, lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF), and what are the implications for HIV-1 replication and therapeutic targeting?

**Methods:** We solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains (NTD and CCD) of HIV-2 IN in complex with the binding domain (IBD) of LEDGF, elucidating charge-charge interactions between the NT of IN and IB.

**Findings:** The structure reveals a constellation of acidic residues on the NT characteristic of lentiviral INs and mutations of positively charged residues on IB severely affect interaction with lentiral INs. We show that novel NT-IB contacts are critical for stimulation of lentiral DNA integration by LED in vitro and during early steps of HIV-1 replication.

**Implications:** The structural details enabled engineering of a mutant HIV-1 IN that functions only with a complementary LEDGF mutant, providing a basis for high lentiral IN-LED interaction and paving the way for LED-based therapeutic targeting.

**Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the importance of the NT-IB interface for lentiral replication and provide a structural basis for the development of LED-targeting technologies for gene therapy.

**Title:** Investigating the Evolutionary Trajectories of Cancer Cell-Intrinsic Kinetics: Unveiling the Dynamics of Tumor Progression and Heterogeneity**

**Research Question:** How do the intrinsic kinetics of cancer cells at different ages influence tumor progression, and how do genetic and epigenetic alterations modulate these kinetics to favor tumor growth?

**Methods:** We developed a cellular automaton model to track the temporal evolution of malignant subpopulations of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which exclusively initiate and sustain tumors. We explored orthogonal traits: cell migration, spontaneous death due to genetic drift, symmetric stem cell division, and telomere erosion as mitotic counter for non-stem cell proliferation.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that proliferation is the strongest modulator of tumor growth. Early increase in proliferation yields larger non-stem cancer cells (CC) competing with CSCs, inhibiting division, while reduction loosens inhibition, facilitating CSC division. The CSC subpopulation becomes heterogeneous, dictating population dynamics varying from dormancy to progression. Clonal diversity in single biopsies represents a small proportion of total phenotypes.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of understanding cell-intrinsic kinetics in tumor progression and heterogeneity. Proliferation is a key driver of tumor growth, while cell death counteracts CSC confinement and promotes self-matic expansion. Evolutionary phenotypic heterogeneity leads to unpredictable spatiotemporal distribution of aggressiveness, with some regions dominated by ancestral phenotypes and others by recently evolved clones. The interplay of these dynamics requires investigation of combinations yielding aggressive clones.

**Conclusions:** Our study suggests that proliferation is the strongest modulator of tumor growth, while cell death counteracts CSC confinement and promotes self-matic expansion. Evolutionary phenotypic heterogeneity leads to unpredictable spatiemporal distribution of aggressiveness, with some regions dominated by ancestral phenotypes and others by recently evolved clones. The interplay of these dynamics requires investigation of combinations yielding aggressive clones.

**Title:** The Role of Spatial Heterogeneity in the Emergence of Novel Infectious Diseases: A Mathematical Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** How does spatial heterogeneity in the human population structure influence the emergence and spread of novel infectious diseases, and what are the implications for surveillance and control?

**Methods:** We employ mathematical modeling to investigate the impact of spatial heterogeneity on the probability of emergence, waiting time to emergence, and outbreak size distribution of novel infectious diseases. We derive analytical expressions for the probability of introduction and waiting time to emergence, as well as the statistical properties of emergence, including outbreak size distribution. We compare our results with a stochastic model previously studied computationally.

**Findings:** Our results suggest that for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has a weak effect on outbreak distribution and risk of emergence. For example, a village connected to a city by 10 commuters a day is effectively part of the city considering emergence and outbreak distribution. Empirical data on commuting patterns show that most communities are at least well interconnected. For plausible ranges, effects of heterogeneity are dominated by evolutionary host biology.

**Implications:** Our findings have implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections. Spatial heterogeneity has limited impact on emergence and outbreak size. Only remote communities may be subject to epidemiological isolation. Other factors, such as human patterns and host heterogeneity, shape risk and speed of emergence. We focus on spatial structure of host population, which has received little attention in adapting pathogens. We model spatially separated communities with varying connections, e.g. village-city.

**Conclusions:** The biology of novel pathogen determines emergence and outbreak sizes according to average reproductive number. Deviation is due to absent commuters. We expect a threshold where heterogeneity does not matter. Previous research depends on interconnectivity with threshold allowing pathogen spread. Our approach allows insights without specifying infectious migrating hosts. We present analytical results for epidemiological parameters of disease adapting humans, exploring host structure and validating with stochastic simulations of village-city models.

**Title:** Unraveling the Dynamics of Avian Influenza Virus Spread in North America: Insights from 34 Years of Continuous Surveillance

**Research Question:** How do migratory birds contribute to the emergence and spread of avian influenza viruses in North America, and what are the patterns of viral movement between host populations?

**Methods:** We analyzed 287 newly sequenced avian influenza A virus (AIV) samples collected over a 34-year period of systematic surveillance in North American migratory birds using a Bayesian framework to test hypotheses of viral migration, population structure, and genetic reassortment patterns.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, our results show that Charadriiform-infected birds in Delaware do not significantly contribute to North American AIV diversity, while Anser-infected birds in Alberta are representative of the AIV circulating in North Anseres. Long-term analysis reveals that AIV persistence is independent of bird migration flyways between populations throughout North America.

**Implications:** Our study provides critical insights for predictive models of pandemic preparedness and livestock protection. Avian viruses were isolated annually in Alberta and Delaware, with 287 genomes sequenced to characterize reassment dynamics, spatial patterns, and evolutionary genomics of AIV in North America over 25 years from migratory birds. Methodological advances enable large-scale assessment of spatiotemporal viral movement between bird populations. We identified 20 regions in North America where viruses were collected from wild birds to determine population structure according to migratory fly and rates of gene flow between populations.

**Conclusions:** Our 30-year surveillance data reveal that Alberta, a convergence of four migratory flyways, captures the majority of North influenza genetic diversity. Breeding birds in this region facilitate spread and generation of virus diversity, highlighting Anseres' role in persistence. Delaware, a hotspot for avian A viruses, is not a significant contributor to North diversity. Long-term A persistence may be independent of migratory fly, supporting lateral diffusion of lineages between populations.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel Monoclonal Antibody with Heterotypic Cross-Reactive Neutralization Activity against Influenza A Viruses

**Research Question:** Can a monoclonal antibody (MAb) be generated that exhibits heterotypic cross-reactive neutralization against multiple subtypes of influenza A viruses?

**Methods:** A novel MA, MAb S/1, was generated and tested for its cross-reactivity against various subtypes of influenza A viruses using enzyme-linked immunosorb assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination inhibition assays.

**Findings:** MAb S/1 showed broad reactivity to multiple subtypes (H1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 13) and neutralized infectivity of particular strains of H, 2, 3, and 13 subtypes of influenza viruses. Mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb S1 were selected from Aichi/68 (H2), Adachi/57 (2), and WS/33 (1) strains, and sequence analysis revealed amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193 (H numbering). Molecular modeling showed these amino acids formed a novel conformational epitope adjacent to receptor-binding domain of HA.

**Implications:** MAb S1 binds a common antigenic site among various subtypes, neutralizing infectivity in vitro and in vivo by affecting viral attachment to cells. This study supports notion cross-reactive antibodies play roles in heterotyp immunity against influenza infection and underscores potential utility of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza.

**Conclusions:** MAb S1, a novel monoclonal antibody, exhibits heterotyp cross-reactive neutralization against multiple subtypes of influenza A viruses. Its mechanism likely involves blocking receptor binding of virus, as hemagglination also inhibited by this antibody. Neutralizing antibodies play critical role in protection against influenza infection, recognizing hemagglutinin (HA), major glycoprotein of influenza viruses. This study highlights potential therapeutic utility of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza.

**Title:** Evaluation of Ivermectin Treatment on the Prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis Infection in an Australian Aboriginal Population: A Three-Year Cohort Study

**Research Question:** This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment on the prevalence of Strongyloides stercis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population over a three-year period and evaluate the validity of using a lower ELISA cut-off for diagnosis.

**Methods:** A three-year cohort study of 259 adult Aboriginals living in a remote community in northern Australia was conducted. Strongloides sterc infection was diagnosed using commercial ELISA testing with a lower threshold for treatment than recommended. Follow-up was conducted at 6 and 3 years following iverectin treatment.

**Findings:** Treatment withiverect was highly effective, resulting in a sustained fall in prevalence of infection from 35.3% to 5.8% (McNem's chi2 = 56.5, p<0.001). Results suggested use of lower ELISA threshold for treatment was valid in this setting. Follow-up identified a small group with persistently positive EL serology despite treatment.

**Implications:** Control of Stronglo sterc infection in this cohort appears feasible using pharmacological treatment alone. Prevalence fell to 1.4% after 3 years, underscoring success of this strategy. This study provides evidence that control of chronic Stronglo st infection in adult Aboriginal population achieved through case-finding and treatment using current practice guidelines.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that control of Stronglo st infection in Aboriginal population can be achieved through case-finding and treatment using current guidelines. Communities in northern Australia have high prevalence, with 30-40% reported [8]. Iverect is accepted treatment choice, but disagreement persists over need for wide testing and elimination.

**Title:** Investigating Prion Strain Interference: A Paradigm Shift in Prion Dynamics and Implications for Interspecies Transmission

**Research Question:** Can long-incubation prion strains interfere with each other, and if so, what are the implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture?

**Methods:** We co-inoculated animals with combinations of long-incub pr strains and assessed for evidence of strain interference. To exclude the possibility that inability to interfere was due to failure to target same cells, we performed protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain (PMCA) assays, which indicated both strains amplified independently, suggesting lack of interference not due to cell targeting but inherent property of strains.

**Findings:** Co-infection with long-inc strains failed to show evidence of interference, consistent with PMCA results. Importantly, PM reactions seeded with long-inc strains contained higher levels of remaining Pr compared to seeded with short-inc strains. Mechanistically, we hypothesize abundance of Pr not limiting in vivo or in vitro in pr strains with low conversion efficiency to amplify independently.

**Implications:** This paradigm shift in prion strain interactions has significant implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of pr strains from mixture. Inters transmission can generate new pr strains, while intras transmission results in emergence of dominant strain. Interference between pr strains competing for Pr is thought to affect this process. Consistent with this, overexpression of Pr leads to emergence of strains not identified at physiological levels.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that not all pr strain combinations result in interference, indicating diversity in naturally infected animals may be greater than thought. Strain interference occurs when Pr abundance limiting, formation dependent on Pr, and strains compete for Pr. By definition, if available Pr for conversion limiting, interference will occur. This changes our understanding of prion dynamics and has significant implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of pr strains from mixture.

**Title:** Revisiting the Role of Intrinsic Disorder in Alloster Regulation: A Comprehensive Ensemble Model Reveals Order-Transition Dominance over Disorder-Transition

**Research Question:** How do intrinsic disordered protein regions (IDRs) contribute to allosteric regulation, and what is the relative importance of order-disorder and order transitions in this process?

**Methods:** We propose a comprehensive ensemble model combining the Monod-Wy-Wyman-Change (MWC) and Ensemble Allost Model (EAM) frameworks to investigate the roles of order-disorder and order transitions in alloster effects. Our model reveals that the MWC pathway (order transition) has a higher probability than the E pathway (disorder) in alloster, suggesting a complex role of IDRs in regulatory proteins.

**Findings:** Our comprehensive model shows that the order-disorder transition (E mechanism) is less competitive than the order transition (M) in affording alloster effects, especially strong alloster. This indicates that the prevalence of IDRs in alloster regulation is more complex than previously thought. We provide an analytic formula for maximal alloster coupling, demonstrating that stable or unstable states are unfavorable for alloster, aiding in alloster drug design.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering both order-disorder and order transitions in understanding alloster regulation. The prevalence of IDRs in alloster is not solely due to their capacity for alloster, but also their ability to implement alloster without ordered structures. A new view of alloster based on protein landscape theory, where ligand binding stabilizes specific states and shifts conformational ensemble, explains ID alloster. Combining experimental and bioinformatics data will help compare ordered and disordered proteins' importance in alloster regulation.

**Conclusions:** Our comprehensive model provides a new perspective on the role of IDRs in alloster, revealing order-transition dominance over disorder-transition. The prevalence of IDRs in alloster is not solely due to their capacity for alloster, but also their ability to implement alloster without ordered structures. This study contributes to emerging view of alloster based on protein landscape theory, where ligand binding stabilizes specific states and shifts conformation ensemble. Future work combining experimental and bioinformatics will help determine ordered and disordered proteins' importance in alloster regulation.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of β-Caten in Prostate Development and Cancer: Insights from Embryonic and Adult Studies

**Research Question:** What is the role of βaten in prostate development and progression, and how does it contribute to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer?

**Methods:** We employed in vivo genetic studies in embryonic and adult mice to investigate the function of βaten in normal and neoplastic prostate. Gene deletion analysis revealed that epithelial βaten is required for embryonic prostate growth and branching, but dispensable in adult development. βaten controls the number of progenitors in epithelial buds and regulates a network of genes, including c-Myc and Nk3.1. Deletion βaten in Pten model of castration-resistant prostate demonstrated dispensability for disease in this setting. Complementary overexpression, in vivo protein stabilization showed βaten promotes formation squamous epith during development in absence androgens. βaten overexpression with Pten drove progression to invasive carcinoma with squamous metlas.

**Findings:** Our studies demonstrate βaten essential for prostate development and inherent property high levels of this protein in epithelia drive squamous differentiation. Additionally, βaten overexpression promotes prostate cancer in clinically relevant model. Data provide novel insights into cancer pathways leading to lethal disease in humans.

**Implications:** βaten plays a crucial role in prostate development, and high levels of this protein in epithelia drive squamous differentiation. βaten overexpression can promote invasive cancer in clinically relevant model. These findings have implications for understanding prostate cancer progression and development.

**Conclusions:** βaten is essential for prostate development and high levels of this protein in epithelia drive squamous differentiation. βaten overexpression can promote prostate cancer in clinically relevant model. These studies provide novel insights into cancer pathways leading to lethal disease in humans.

**Title:** Exploring the Dynamics of Informed Consent in a Low-Resource Setting: A Qualitative Insights from a Genetic Study on Podoconiosis in Southern Ethiopia

**Research Question:** What are the key factors influencing informed consent in a low-resource settings, particularly in a genetic research context, and how can they be addressed to ensure genuine participation in biomedical research?

**Methods:** This qualitative study employed focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with podoiosis patients, non-patients, community workers, researchers, and staff of a local non-governmental organization (NGO) working on podoiosis prevention and treatment, and community leaders in southern Ethiopia. We adapted a validated rapid assessment methodology from The Gambia.

**Findings:** The study revealed that the use of everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and information presentation techniques significantly impacted comprehension of research information. Approaching podo patients via trusted individuals and preceding community sensitization were optimal communication strategies. Poverty, absence of treatment facilities, and trust in the NGO hindered genuine consent. Researchers should evaluate consent processes to provide comprehensible information and support decision-making on a study-by-study basis.

**Implications:** The findings highlight the need for researchers to understand the social and cultural context of the community and participants before seeking consent. Determinants and approaches to gaining informed consent in a predominantly Ethiopian population were assessed and practical ways used in a subsequent genetic study. The community believed podoiosis is genetic, using terms like 'passed from parents and grandparents' and 'blood' to express disease occurrence. Most participants did not favor written consent sheets and forms. Fieldworkers and researchers indicated monetary compensation might induce podo patients due to poverty, stressing 'kel yoneiminet' (voluntariness) should be part of the process. Participants advised researchers approach podo patients through local intermediaries like MPA fieldworkers, as they are respected. Local gatherings and group discussions are common modes of receiving information.

**Conclusions:** The study underscores the importance of understanding the social and cultural context of the community and participants before informed consent is sought. Researchers should evaluate the effectiveness of consent processes to provide comprehensible information and support decision-making on a study-by-study basis.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Genetics and Aging on Immune System Dynamics: A Single-Cell Analysis of T Lymphocyte Proliferation in Thymus and Spleen

**Research Question:** How does genetics and aging influence the immune system's ability to maintain body integrity through the continuous production of diversified lymphocytes in the thymus, involving processes of proliferation, differentiation, selection, death, and migration to peripheral tissues, where proliferation also occurs upon antigen recognition?

**Methods:** We employed single-cell multicolor flow cytometry to analyze the incorporation of thymidine analogue during pulse-chase-pulse experiments in vivo versus DNA content, and developed a mathematical model using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to simulate the evolution of single cell behavior through various durations of labeling. This allowed us to fit data, deduce proliferation rates and cell cycle durations in subpopulations.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous with a specific "signature" depending on genetic origins, specific cell stages in thym and sple, and altered with age. The model allows estimation of proliferation and cell phase durations from experimental 5-ethyl-2-deuridine (U) data, revealing cell heterogeneity and specific signatures.

**Implications:** This study provides a detailed assessment and quantification of subpopulations T cells along differentiation from thym to sple, and aging. For the first time, we show genetic and age drive a "signature of proliferation and phase, according cell stage and lineage. FVB mice have lower rates of T proliferation than C57/6 mice in thym and sple.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the impact of genetics and aging on immune system dynamics through single-cell analysis of T lymphocyte proliferation in thym and sple. Our model is simple, flexible, and validated with other pulse-chase experiments, allowing estimation of proliferation and intermitotic time with parameters and confidence intervals for G/G1 and G/M cycle durations. This work provides a new understanding of cell heterogeneity and signatures in immune system, highlighting the importance of genetic and age on cell behavior.

**Key Findings:**

* T cell proliferation is heterogeneous with specific signature depending on genetic origins, cell stages thym and sple, and age
* FVB mice have lower rates of T proliferation than C57/6 in thym and sple

**Title:** Generation and Characterization of a Pathogenic Mitochondrial tRNA Mutation in Mouse Model: Insights into the Mechanism of Disease and Evolution

**Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenicity of homoplasmic tRNA mutations in humans and how do they contribute to the evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs?

**Methods:** We generated and characterized the first pathological mutation in a mitochondrial tRNA gene in mouse, a G>A transition at position 9 within the mt-tI anticodon loop. We analyzed the phenotype induced by this mutation and established its deleterious and potentially pathogenic character.

**Findings:** The mutation recapitulated the molecular hallmarks of disease-causing mutations in humans, affecting the mtI gene. We determined that the pathogenic mechanism induced by both mouse and human mutations is high frequency abnormal folding of tRNA that cannot be charged with isoleucine. Cells harboring the mouse or human mutant tRNA showed exacerbated mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by increase in mitochondrial production as compensatory response.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the nature of pathogenic mechanism combined with existence of compensatory can explain penetrance pattern of mutation. This behavior allows scenario for evolution of tRNAs in which fixation of alleles are individually deleterious proceed in two steps not require simultaneous mutation both.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the first pathological mutation in mitochondrial tRNA in mouse and provides insights into the mechanism disease and evolution of tRNAs. Our results support the idea that pathogenic mechanism of homoplasm tRNA is different from protein-coding genes and highlight the importance of compensatory response in disease. We propose that ROS-mediated biogenesis is a key factor in expression of tRNA pathological mutations in patients. This study contributes to understanding of pathology and evolution of mitochondrial tRN and provides a model for future research.

**Title:** Dosage Compensation in Mammals: Unraveling the Mechanisms of X-Linked Gene Expression in Human Triploid Cells

**Research Question:** How do X-linked genes respond to ploidy in human triploid cells, and what mechanisms regulate their expression in relation to autosomal factors?

**Methods:** We employed expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in human triploid cells with one and two active X chromosomes.

**Findings:** The average X:autosome ratio was lower (0.81-0.84) in triploid cells with one active X and higher (1.32-1.4) in triploid with two X's, indicating unbalanced X-linked expression. Absolute autosomal levels per gene were similar in triploid versus diploid, suggesting no global effect on autosomal expression. In trip cells with two X's, X-linked expression was doubled, while in trip with one X, expression was upward adjusted by an epigenetic mechanism sensing the X/autosome ratio.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that X-linked expression in triploid cells does not strictly respond to autosomal factors, nor achieves perfect balance. Unbalanced ratios may contribute to abnormal phenotypes associated with triploidy. Epigenetic mechanisms adjust X-linked expression in response to X/autosome ratio, particularly in a subset of genes critical to autosomal expression.

**Conclusions:** X-linked expression in triploid cells with two X's supports doubling, while trip with one X shows upward adjustment, suggesting epigenetic response to X/aut ratio. Expression of genes on both sex chromosomes and those escaping X-inactivation in triploid showed similar levels per copy, indicating adjustment of X but not autosomes. Distributions of X-linked differed between triploid and diploid cultures, with no global autosomal change per copy. Adjustments mostly affect X-linked genes in triploid cultures.

**Title:** Reevaluating the dN/d Ratio as a Measure of Evolutionary Pressure in Single-Population Samples: Implications for Inference of Selection

**Research Question:** How does the dN/d ratio, a widely used measure of evolutionary pressure, perform when applied to single-population samples, where differences represent segregating polymorphisms rather than fixed substitutions along independent lineages?

**Methods:** We theoretically analyzed the relationship between selection pressure and d/d ratio in single-population samples using simulations and found that d/d is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Furthermore, the hallmark of positive selection, d/d>1, is violated within populations, and the relationship between selection and d/d does not follow a monotonic function, making it impossible to infer pressures from d/d.

**Findings:** Our results show that the relationship between selection and d/d is qualitatively different for single-population samples compared to divergent lineages. As a result, standard tests for selection based on d are sensitive to the assumption of divergent lineages. In single-population samples, differences represent polymorphisms, not fixation events along lineages. Therefore, understanding the relationship between selection and d/d for single-population is crucial.

**Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for interpretation of d measurements among population-genetic samples. Specifically, standard tests for selection based on d are sensitive to violation of assumption divergent line. Moreover, the power of d to detect positive selection is low when majority sites evolve under purifying selection.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the limitations of d as a measure of evolutionary pressure in single-population samples. The d ratio is relatively insensitive to selection and does not follow a monotonic relationship with selection, making it impossible to infer pressures from d. This has significant implications for inference of selection based on d among population-genetic samples.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Natural Selection in Shaping Neutral Genetic Variation Across Species: A Reconciling Empirical and Theoretical Perspectives

**Research Question:** How does natural selection influence patterns of genetic variation across genomes, particularly at neutral sites linked to direct selection, in closely and distantly related species?

**Methods:** We examined the relationship between neutral divergence and functional content, recombination, and background selection in human-primate and human-rod species, accounting for confounding factors such as hypermutable Cp sites, GC content, and gene conversion.

**Findings:** Our results show that neutral divergence between closely related species (human-primate) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with recombination, while divergence between distantly related species (humanrod) is negatively correlated with functional and positively with background selection. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors. Coalescent models indicate that background selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of variance in divergence across the genome.

**Implications:** Contrary to previous intuition, our findings suggest that natural selection can indirectly affect neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species. While direct purifying selection may contribute to some patterns, it is unlikely that more of the genome is under purifying than believed. Our work has implications for understanding evolution of genomes and interpreting genetic variation.

**Key Findings:**

* Neutral divergence between closely related species (human-primate) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively with recombination
* Divergence between distantly species (humanrod) is negatively with functional and positively with background selection
 Patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors
 Coales models indicate background selection in ancestral can explain large proportion of variance in divergence

**Conclusion:** Our study reveals that natural selection can indirectly affect neutral divergence between closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous thinking. While direct purifying selection may contribute, it is unlikely that more of genome is under purifying than believed. Our findings have implications for understanding evolution of genomes and interpreting genetic variation.

**Title:** CK2 Phosphorylation Regulates CLOCK Stability and Activity in the Drosoph Circadian Clock: A Counteracting Effects of CK1 and CK2 Kinases

**Research Question:** What is the role of CK2 kinase in the regulation of CLOCK (CLK) stability and activity in the Dros circadian clock, and how does it interact with CK1 kinase to modulate CLK transcriptional activity?

**Methods:** We investigated the phosphorylation of CLK by CK2 and its effects on CLK stability and transcriptional activity in Dros cells using biochemical assays and molecular biology techniques.

**Findings:** CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes CLK, reducing its activity, whereas CK1 promotes CLK degradation. Downregulation of CKα activity decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases PER and TIM transcription, indicating that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. Unexpectedly, the β subunit of the CK holoenzyme is not required for regulation of CLK stability.

**Implications:** Our study identifies CK2 as the first bona fide kinase of Drosila that regulates CLK stability and phosphorylation, joining the club of circadian transcription factors with similar properties such as the W complex in Neurospora. CK2 might be a key player in setting CLK transcription activity to proper phase in the circadian cycle by promoting stability and decreasing activity.

**Conclusions:** Temporally phosphorylation of clock proteins is a key feature of the transcription-translational negative loop underlying Dros circadian clock. Our findings suggest that CK2 and CK1 kinases have counteracting effects on CLK stability and transcriptional activity, with CK2 promoting stability and reducing activity, and CK promoting degradation. Further studies are needed to elucidate how CK and DB-dependent activities interact to set CLK transcription activity in the circadian cycle.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Cysteine Peptidases in the Interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi and its Insect Vector, Rhodnius prolixus

**Research Question:** What is the role of cruzain, a cyste peptase, in the interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, and its insect vector Rhodnius prolix?

**Methods:** We analyzed the effect of treatment of Trypanosoma cruz epastigotes with anti-cruzain antibodies and a panel of cystine peid inhibitors (cystatin, antain, E-64, leupept, iodetamide, and CA-074-OM) on adhesion to Rhnius proius midg ex vivo. We also investigated the effect of transgenic epastotes overexpressing an endogenous cruzain inhibitor, chag, on adhesion to the insect.

**Findings:** All treatments, except CA-074-OM, significantly decreased adhesion to R. proius midut. Cystatin presented a dose-dependent reduction in adhesion. Comparison of adhesion among T. cruz isolates revealed that the isolate with low levels of active cruzain adhered less than D28 and CL isolates. Transgenic epotes overexpressing chag, with reduced levels of active cruzain, adhered 73% less than wild-type. Adhesion of ch parasites was partially restored by addition of exogenous cruzain. In vivo experiments showed low levels of ch parasites compared to wild after passage in insect presented drastic enhancement of surface cruzain expression.

**Implications:** This study highlights, for the first time, that cruzain contributes to interaction T. cruz with insect. Cystine peid inhibitors may be potential targets for antiparas drugs, as cruzain has been investigated for Chagas disease chemotherapy.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest that cruzain plays a crucial role in the interaction between T cruz and its vector. Cystine peid inhibitors, such as cystatin and E-64, significantly reduced adhesion, while CA-074-OM had no effect. Transgenic epotes overing ch, with reduced levels of cruzain, adhered less than wild-type, and adhesion was restored by addition of exogenous cruzain. These findings have implications for the development of antiparas drugs targeting cruzain.

**Title:** Identification of Novel Regulators of Cytoplasm Dyne, a Microtubule Motor Essential for Mitotic Processes in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms that regulate the function of cytoplasm dyin, a microtubule motor essential for mitotic processes in Caenorhabdis elegans?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen using a conditional Caenorhabdis elegans cytoplasm dyin heavy chain mutant at semmissive temperature to identify genes that regulate dyin function. We isolated and characterized 20 dyin-specific suppressor genes, which, when reduced in function, suppressed dyin mutants but not other conditionally mutant loci.

**Findings:** Twelve of the 20 suppressors did not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function was reduced in wild-type worms. Many of the suppress proteins, including dyin light chains, localized to subcellular sites overlapping with those reported for the dyin heavy chain. Knocking down one of four putative dyin accessory chains suppressed the heavy mutants, suggesting some chains negatively regulate heavy function. We also identified 29 genes, when reduced function, suppressed not only dyin but also loci required for unrelated processes.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that conserved, non-essential genes contribute to dyin function during mitosis, a process essential for cell division.

**Conclusions:** We have identified 20 genes, many of which are not themselves essential, but when reduced in function can suppress Caenorhabis cytoplasm dyin heavy mutants. Our findings suggest that conserved, non-essential genes play a role in regulating dyin during mitotic processes, highlighting the complexity of dyin regulation.

**Supporting Text:** Reducing individual gene function has not provided insight into mechanisms mediating dyin requirements during mitosis. To identify regulators, we used a sensitized background to conduct a genome-wide screen for modifiers of dyin in Caenorhabdis. Given dyin's ubiquitous distribution in embryonic cells, biochemical tests are needed to address significance of colocalization detected by microscopy. We are interested in suppress proteins localizing to mitotic poles, association of DY-1 and DY-1 dyin light chains with centros and poles suggests they may be components dyin Caenor.

**Title:** The Role of Ku70/Ku80 Heterodimer in Programmed Genome Rearrangements during Somatic Differentiation in Paramecium teturelia

**Research Question:** How do programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) drive genome rearrangements (PGR) during somatic differentiation in Paramecium teture, and what is the role of the Ku70/Ku heterodimer in this process?

**Methods:** We used RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete Ku80, a component of the non-homolog end-joining (NHE) pathway, in Paramec teture and analyzed the effects on programmed genome rearrangements. We also examined the interaction between PigMac, a domesticated transposase, and Ku70/K80 heterodimer in a heterologous system.

**Findings:** Depletion of Ku80 resulted in the retention of Internal Eliminated Sequences (IES) in the somatic genome, indicating a failure of DSB repair. PigMac-dependent cleavage was abolished at IES boundaries in Ku80-depleted cells. The Ku70/K80 heterodimer is essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus, and co-purifies with PigMac in a heterolog system.

**Implications:** Our study provides the first evidence that Ku is required in vivo to introduce programmed DSB during PGR. The Ku70/K80 heterimer plays a crucial role in coupling DNA cleavage and D repair, enabling the assembly of functional somatic chromosomes.

**Conclusions:** Programmed genome rearrangements during somatic differentiation in Parc teture involve the introduction of DSB, which are repaired through the NHE pathway. The Ku70/K80 heterimer is essential for this process, interacting with PigMac to introduce DSB at IES boundaries. Our findings highlight the importance of Ku in the Parame DNA factory, ensuring genome integrity during development.

**Title:** Elucidating the Preclinical Response of Hippocampal Neurons to Prion Infection: A Transcriptomic Insights into Neuroprotection and Degeneration

**Research Question:** What are the molecular events that accompany neuronal damage and death in the preclinical phase of prion disease, and can we identify potential therapeutic targets to modulate the balance between degeneration and survival?

**Methods:** We employed laser microdissection to isolate hippocampal CA1 neurons from prion-infected mice and analyzed their preclinical transcriptional response using microarray analysis. We identified a cluster of genes altered during preclinical disease, which either returned to basal levels or underwent reversal during clinical phase. Notably, this cluster contained a signature reminiscent of N-methyl-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor signaling and activation of neuroprotective pathways. Additionally, genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were deregulated, leading to a decline in synaptic protein expression. Deregulated miRNAs, such as mi-132p, mi-124p, mi-16, mi-26, mi-29, and mi-140, followed concomitant expression patterns.

**Findings:** This is the first in-depth study describing the preclinical response of hippocampal neurons to prion replication. Our findings suggest that prion stimulates a persistent response mediated, at least in part, by NMD receptor activity promoting cell survival and neurite remodeling. However, this response terminates prior to clinical symptoms in the hippocampus, indicating a critical juncture in disease.

**Implications:** Manipulation of these neuroprotective pathways may redress the balance between degeneration and survival, providing a potential for treatment. Our results are consistent with reduced Ca2+ response and electrophysiol and morphologic abnormalities in pr-infected brains and cultured neurons. We validated genes involved in these processes dysregulated in microarray analysis at early infection. The alteration of 60% detectable genes, including critical AID, is suggestive of a neuroprotect program in CA during pr disease. We previously used whole brain tissue to identify miRNA alterations in prion, consistent with reduction dendrites as earliest detectable change in pr disease. Perturbations in transmission and synapse are implicated throughout progression, coinciding with 70 DPI-point.

**Conclusion:** Factors intrinsic to neurons are crucial for initiation degeneration in pr disease, as pr replication in cells other than neurons does not trigger death. Genome analysis is a powerful tool for understanding pathogenic mechanisms. Given ability to modulate survival, introduction of miRNA may be avenue for therapeutics. We identified genes and miRNAs, many novel to prion, with altered levels in microsected CA neurons.

**Title:** In Silico Modeling of Leishmanial Granuloma Formation and Function Reveals Novel Insights into Immune Regulation and Parasite Control

**Background:** Visceral Leishmaniasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, is characterized by the formation of inflammatory granulomas in the liver, where the parasite is eventually eliminated. To elucidate the mechanisms of granuloma formation and function, we developed an in silico model simulating hepatic granuloma development throughout infection.

**Research Question:** How do granulomas form and function during Leishial infection, and what is the role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in granuloma regulation?

**Methods:** We developed an in silico model of Leish granuloma, validated by comparison with experimental data from mice studies, and assessed its robustness through sensitivity analysis. The model recapitulated disease progression and predicted changes in granuloma composition over time. We conducted in sil experiments to identify granul diversity in anti-leishial activity and simulated IL-10 deficiency in lymphocyte and myeloid populations.

**Findings:** Our model revealed a previously unapprecited level of granul diversity in anti-leishial activity and a dominant regulatory role of IL-10 produced by Kupffer cells at the granuloma core.

**Implications:** Our model captures experimentally determined Leish granoma features and provides insights into granul function intractable in vivo. However, it only simulates events within the granul leading to parasite control and does not account for IL-10 effects outside this environment, such as T cell differentiation in other tissues.

**Conclusions:** Our in silico model of Leish granoma provides novel insights into immune regulation and parasite control, highlighting the importance of IL-10 produced by Kupffer cells at the granul core. Future studies should investigate IL-10 effects on T cell differentiation in other tissues and its impact on granul microenvironment.

**Key Findings:**

* In sil model recapitulated Leish disease progression and predicted changes in granul composition
* Identified unrec level of gran diversity in anti-leish activity
* Simulated IL-10 deficiency in lymphocyte and myoid populations revealed dominant regulatory role IL-10 by Kupffer cells
* Model only simulates events within gran leading to parasite control, not IL-10 effects outside environment

**Future Directions:**

* Investigate IL-10 effects on T cell differentiation in other tissues and its impact gran microenvironment
* Validate model with human Leishmaniasis studies

**Limitations:**

* Model only simulates events within gran leading parasite control, not IL-10 effects outside environment
* Does not capture IL- effects on T cell differentiation other tissues

**Title:** Analog Computation in Transcriptional Regulation: Approximating Arithmetic and Beyond Logical Operations

**Research Question:** Can transcriptional regulatory networks perform computations beyond simple logical operations, and if so, what kinds of computations are possible?

**Methods:** We developed a simple kinetic model of transcriptional regulation and parameterized it to approximate arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equality, and inequality. We analyzed the accuracy and precision of these approximations, showing they depend on parameter sets and are tunable.

**Findings:** Our models demonstrate that transcriptional networks can approximate arithmetic operations, contrasting with studies emphasizing digital notions of computation in biological networks. We show that networks of "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complex computations, such as detecting statistically significant elevations in time-vary signals. We also demonstrate approximating analytic functions by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter.

**Implications:** These findings are important for interpreting naturally occurring networks and designing synthetic networks. Notions of computation beyond simple operations, already documented experimentally, will play a role in understanding transcriptional regulation and biochemical systems. Our analysis of analog computation in transcriptional networks is a step in this direction.

**Conclusions:** Transcriptional regulatory networks can approximate arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equality, and inequality. These approximations depend on parameter sets and are independently tunable. Networks of "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complex computations, such as detecting statistically significant elevations in timeary signals. Approximating analytic functions is possible by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. These findings have implications for interpreting naturally occurring networks and designing synthetic networks.

**Future Directions:** Other functions, such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions, can be computed by combinations of arithmetic. However, this would be energetically wasteful and require many genes. A more efficient approach is approximating directly using complicated machinery. Our models demonstrate possibility of arithmetic at transcriptional regulation level.

**Title:** Co-circulation of Chikunya Virus (CHV) Genotypes in Northeast Brazil: Implications for Epidemiology and Public Health

**Background:** Chikunya virus (CHV), an RNA virus from the Togaviridae family, is transmitted by mosquitoes in both sylvatic and urban cycles, causing Chikunya fever (CHF) in humans, associated with severe and debilitating outcomes. CHV was introduced to Brazil in 2014 through two independent introductions: the Asian/ibbean genotype through the North and African ECS genotype through the Northeast. Following introduction, both genotypes established urban cycles among naive populations, causing outbreaks in the Americas.

**Research Question:** What is the coirculation status of CHV genotypes in Northeast Brazil, and what are the implications for epidemiology and public health?

**Methods:** We sequenced CHV genomes from a recent outbreak in Northeast Brazil using an in-house Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol capable of detecting multiple CHV genotypes from clinical samples.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that both Asian/ibbean and ECS genotypes expanded their ranges, coirculating in Northeast Brazil. Additionally, NG data supports simultaneous infection by these genotypes, suggesting coinfection might be more common than thought in endemic areas.

**Implications:** Future efforts to understand CHV epidemiology should consider coinfection by genotypes in human populations.

**Conclusion:** Our study provides first evidence of simultaneous infection ECS and Asian/ibbean CHV genotypes in clinical samples, highlighting the need to consider coinfection in CHV epidemiology. CHV has caused significant health and economic burden worldwide due to continuous flux, reaching Brazil in 2014, rapidly spreading in naive populations. Limited information exists on CHV evolution after entrance Brazil, with several outbreaks occurring due geographically restricted genotypes entering new areas with naive populations or previous circulation genotypes.

**Key Findings:**

* Coirculation of ECS and Asian/ibbean CHV genotypes in Northeast Brazil
* Simultaneous infection of ECS and Asian/ibbean CHV genotypes in clinical samples
* Evidence of coinfection ECS and Asian/ibbean CHV genotypes in naturally infected individuals
* Limited information on CHV epidemiology and evolution after entrance Brazil
* CHV outbreaks due geographically restricted genotypes entering new areas with naive populations or previous genotypes

**Title:** Differential Modulation of Horizontal Gene Transfer and Core Genomic DNA by the H-NS System in Enterobacteria: Implications for Bacterial Colonization and Adaptation**

**Research Question:** How does the H-NS system, a global modulator of gene expression, interact with horizontally transferred DNA (HGT) and core genomic DNA in enterobacteria, and what are the implications for bacterial colonization and adaptation?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of H-NS in modulating HGT and core DNA in enterobacteria, focusing on plid-encoded and chromosomally-encoded H-NS proteins, and their interactions with helper proteins Hha.

**Findings:** We found that plid-encoded HNS selectively silences HGT genes without interfering with core regulation, whereas chromosomally-encoded H targets both H and core DNA, differentially modulated by Hha proteins. H-H complexes silence HGT, while H homomers modulate core genes. Notably, H-like proteins are restricted to Enterobacteraceae, and conjugative plids encoding HNS variants are found only in this family.

**Implications:** The capacity to discriminate between HGT and core DNA may enable enterobacteria to maintain horizontally transferred DNA in a silent state, providing a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization. However, incorporation of foreign DNA may pose a perturbation to core regulation, resulting in fitness costs. Efficient control of foreign DNA expression is exemplified by the HNS protein.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that plid-encoded HNS has evolved to target HGT, not core DNA, and chromosomally-encoded H targets both, differentially modulated by Hha. The HNS system in enterobacteria presents unique features, enabling selective discrimination between H and core DNA. The presence of H-like proteins and conjugative plids encoding HNS is an evolutionary trait of Enterobacteraceae.

**Title:** Comparative Analysis of Amastote Gene Expression in Leishmania Species Reveals Conserved and Differentially Expressed Genes**

**Research Question:** What are the differences in amast gene expression between Leish species, and how do these variations contribute to virulence and pathogenicity in the host?

**Methods:** We used custom oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze amast gene expression in three Leish species (L. major, L. infant, and L. brazili) and identified differentially expressed genes between species. We also investigated host influence on parasite expression by comparing RNA profiles in L. amastotes from wild-type and immunocompromised mice.

**Findings:** ∼9% of analyzed genes were regulated in RNA during L. life cycle, consistent with other Leish species. Comparing amast gene profiles between species confirmed little regulation, but identified conserved genes differently regulated between species in host. Immune status did not affect parasite expression, suggesting Leish amotes are pre-adapt for intracellular survival.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that Leish virulence and pathogenicity may be limited to products of few differentially distributed or regulated conserved genes, subject to translational and postlational controls.

**Conclusion:** This study focused on amast gene expression, comparing RNA profiles between three Leish species to identify differences relevant to infective stages. Oligonucle arrays probed ∼10% of genome, targeting conserved genes between species and ∼250 differentially distributed. ∼9 of probed genes were regulated during L amast RNA, assuming correlates with protein levels, confirming Leish preadaptation to intracellular survival. These results are relevant to cross-species amast expression given amotes sourced from different backgrounds. Recent profiling identified 3-9 genes modulated at RNA between Leish life stages. Understanding these components may enhance pathogenic in Leish.

**Title:** Development of a Novel Loop-Med Isothermal Amplification Assay (LAMP) for the Detection of Amphimeris, a Fish-borne Disease Caused by the Liver Fluke Amphimerus spp.

**Background:** Amphimeris, a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimer spp, has been reported as endemic in the tropical side of Ecuador with high prevalence in humans and domestic animals. The diagnosis is based on stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but lacks sensitivity, and morphology of eggs may be confounded with other liver and intestinal flukes. No immunological or molecular methods have been developed to date for specific and sensitive detection of Amphimer spp. DNA in clinical samples.

**Research Question:** Can a novel looped isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) be developed for the specific and sensitive detection of Amphimer sp DNA in clinical samples?

**Methods:** A LAMP targeting sequence of the Amphimer sp internal transcribed 2 region was designed. Amphimer sp DNA was obtained from adult worms recovered animals to optimize molecular assays. Conventional PCR was performed using outer primers F-B3 to verify amplification of Amphimer sp DNA sequence. LAMP was optimized with different mixtures temperatures and set as LPhimer. Specificity and sensitivity of PCR and LAMP were evaluated. Detection limit was 1 pg genomic DNA. Field testing was done using 44 stool samples from localities where fluke is endemic.

**Findings:** Twenty-five samples were microscopy positive for Amphimer sp eggs. Molecular testing, PCR-B was ineffective when DNA fecal samples used. When all stool samples included study, diagnostic parameters sensitivity and specificity were calculated for LPhimer assay, 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively.

**Conclusion:** We have developed and evaluated, for the first, a specific and sensitive LAMP for detecting Amphimer sp in stool. The procedure has been named Limer and has potential adapted for diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphias-endemic areas. Large-scale studies will assess applicability this novel assay.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Syntaxin 6 (Y6) in Autophagosome-Lysosome Fusion: A Novel Insights into the Autophagy Machinery

**Research Question:** What is the role of Syntaxin 6 (Y6) in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila, and how does it interact with other components of the autagy machinery?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of Syntaxin 6 (Y) in autagosome-lysosome fusion in Dophila using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Y6 in Drosila fat cells and observed a large accumulation of autosomes unable to fuse with lysosomes. We also examined the localization of Y6 in lysosomes and autosomes and found it forms a SNARE complex with Sy17 and Snap. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Y6 can be competed from this complex by V7 and that overexpression of V7 rescues the fusion defect in Y6 loss-of-function cells.

**Findings:** Our results show that Y6 is essential for autosome-lys fusion in Dila and localizes to lysosomes and autosomes, forming a SNARE complex with Sy17 and Snap. However, this complex is less stable than the Sy17-Snap-V7 bundle. We also found that Y6 is not functionally redundant with V7, as loss of either protein perturbs autosome-lys fusion. Moreover, we demonstrated competition between Y6 and V7 for SN complex formation with Sy17 and Snap, and both lysosomal SNs interact with HOPS through their long domains.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that Y6 acts as a non-conventional SNARE in autosome-lys fusion, while V7 is directly involved in membrane fusion. We propose a model where Y6 stabilizes the Sy17-Snap complex bound to HOPS until V7 enters the fusion site. Overexpression of V7 rescues autosome-lys fusion in Y6 loss-function cells, supporting this idea. Furthermore, a mutant Y with an R amino acid change in the zeroionic layer retains normal autagy activity, while palmitoylation or farnesylation mutants do not.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel role for Y in autosome-lys fusion and highlights the complexity of the autagy machinery. We propose that Y and V are mutually exclusive subunits in the Sy17-Snap complex, with V directly involved in membrane fusion and Y acting as a regulatory SNARE. These findings provide new insights into the autagy process and highlight the importance of Y and V in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

**Title:** Mechanism of Antimicrobial Peptide Resistance in Nontable Haemophilus influenza (NTH) Revealed: SapA-Mediated Import of Antimicrobial Peptides into the Bacterial Cytoplasm

**Research Question:** How does Nontableem Haophilus influenza (NTH) resist the bactericidal effects of host-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of SapA, a periplasmic protein, in NTH virulence and its interaction with AMPs. We used antibody-mediated neutralization of Sap in vivo to demonstrate its function in counteracting AMP lethality during N infection. We hypothesized that Sap delivers AMP to the inner membrane for transport into the cytoplasm.

**Findings:** AMPs localized to the cytoplasm of parental NTH strain were susceptible to cytoplasmic peptase activity, whereas AMP accumulated in the peripl of bacteria lacking functional Sap complex. These data support a mechanism of Sap-mediated import of AMP, a novel strategy to reduce periplasm and inner accumulation of host defense peptides.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of AMP resistance in NTH, highlighting the importance of Sap in virulence. Understanding this process may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat NTH infections.

**Conclusions:** NTH, a commal of human nasophary mucosa, causes opportunistic infections of upper and lower respiratory tracts. Its ability to resist AMPs is critical for virulence. Sap, a periplic protein, binds and delivers AMP to the inner membrane for transport into the cytopl, where they are degraded by cytoplasmic peptase. This mechanism reduces peripl and inner accumulation of host defense peptides, contributing to NTH virulence. Our findings provide new insights into NTH pathogenesis and potential targets for intervention.

**Title:** The Role of Active Degradation in Shaping the Function of the Antibiotic Resistance Activator MarA in Escherichia coli

**Research Question:** How does the short half-life of the antibiotic resistance activator MarA impact its ability to coordinate downstream targets in Escheria coli, and what are the implications for multi-gene regulation?

**Methods:** We employed CRISPR to knockdown the protease that targets MarA and engineered Mar to protect it from degradation to modify its half-life. Analytical and experimental results indicate that active degradation affects both the rate and maximum coordination of downstream genes can achieve.

**Findings:** Our results show that Mar's short half-life affects not only its time-series behavior and population statistics, but also its ability to coordinate downstream genes. This coordination develops over time, with both rate and value. We found that increasing Mar's half-life increases the maximum diversity between downstream genes, but decreases the rate at which wild-type Mar generates coordination.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the utility of active degradation in shaping the function of MarA, a key regulator of antibiotic resistance in E. coli. The short half-life of Mar allows for a responsive and agile network, enabling rapid generation of phenotypic diversity. This may be beneficial for few cells to regenerate following antibiotic challenge. However, trade-offs between perfect fidelity and instantaneous coordination show that these properties cannot coexist.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that active degradation is a key feature of Mar's design, allowing it to rapidly respond to changing conditions. This is in contrast to other regulators, which often have longer half-lives. We propose that short-lived activators like Mar may be useful for generating diversity in response to stress, but at the cost of coordination. This trade-off has implications for multi-g regulation, where perfect fidelity and instantaneous cannot coexist.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of MAP Kinase Phosphatase 2 (MK-2) in Immune Response to Leishmania major Infection in C57/BL6 Mice

**Research Question:** We investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MK-2) in the immune response to Leishmania major infection in C57/BL mice, building on our previous findings that MK-2 deficient mice are more susceptible to Leish mexicana infection.

**Methods:** We infected MK-2 deficient (MK-/-) and wild-type (MK+/+) C57/BL mice with L. major and measured lesion size, parasite numbers, and immune responses.

**Findings:** Unlike our previous findings with L. mexicana, MK-/- mice showed no increased susceptibility to L. major, with similar lesion size and parasite numbers to MK+/ mice. Analysis of immune responses revealed a reduced TH1 response in MK- mice with lower specific IgG2 levels, frequency of IF-γ and TN-α producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, and lower stimulated spleen IF-γ production. However, MK- mice also had reduced IL-4 production in spleen and lymph node cells and parasite-specific IgG in serum, indicating a general T cell hyporespons. The TH1/TH balance was unaltered in MK- compared to wild-type mice.

**Implications:** Naive and activated MK- macrophages were more permissive to L. major than wild-type macrophages, but LPS/IF-γ was equally effective at controlling parasite growth in MK- and MK+ macrophages. The absence of a switch in TH/TH balance in MK- mice resulted in no change in disease phenotype.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that MK-2 plays a distinct role in immune response to different Leish parasites. While MK- mice are more susceptible to L. mex, they are not to L. major. The TH/TH balance was unaltered in MK- mice, indicating that MK- does not influence this balance. MK- macrophages were more permissive to L. major, but LPSIF-γ was equally effective in controlling parasite growth in MK and MK macrophages. These results highlight the complexity of immune response to different Leish parasites and the role of MK- in this response.

**Title:** Unveiling the Stereotypic Patterns of Pancreatic Ductal Network Development: A Quantitative Analysis and In Silico Modeling

**Research Question:** How does the pancreatic ductal network of the mammalian pancreas develop and remodel from an unconnected micumen to a treelike structure, and what are the underlying principles governing this process?

**Methods:** We conducted a quantitative analysis of the pancreatic ductal network at different developmental stages (E12.5 to 18.5) in mice and used in silico modeling to deconstruct the formation and maturation of the ductal network.

**Findings:** Our results show that the pancreatic duct network exhibits stereotyp traits at each stage, with properties changing towards the most economical delivery of exocrine products into the duodenum. The early stage is explained by noisy, redundant connection as micum formation, while the transition to a treelike structure is attributed to pruning based on fluid flux through the network into the duod.

**Implications:** Our study reveals that the pancreas is more stereic than previously believed, with systematic changes in network properties as it matures. We propose a set of simple rules governing the formation and remodeling of the duct network, applicable to other glands with micumen, such as the salivary gland and mammary gland.

**Conclusions:** This work provides new insights into the development of the pancreatic ductal network, a poorly understood process on both microscopic and macroscopic levels. Our findings have implications for understanding the development of other glands that secrete fluid, such as the saliv gland and mammary gland. The proposed rules for network formation and remodeling are distinct from other branching models, such as the lung and mammary gland.

**Title:** Elucidating the Conformational Dynamics of Kines Motor Proteins: A Comprehensive Analysis of Experimental and Computational Studies

**Research Question:** How do kines motor proteins drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformation changes that mediate directed movement along microtubules, and what are the distinct conformations and their interconversion mechanisms?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 114 experimental structures and results from accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to map the structural dynamics of the kines motor domain. Experimental structures were categorized into three conformation clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5-inhibitor-bound, differing in the orientation of key elements, notably microtub binding α-α5 loop, subdomain, and α2-β-4β-β-7 motor tip. Group membership did not correlate with nucleotide state, but coincided with necker orientations.

**Findings:** Accelerated molecular simulations of ATP, ADP, and nucleotide Eg5 showed that all states sample majorlogically observed conformations, with differences in dynamic coupling dist sites evident. In ATP-bound simulations, necker, loop, and α-5 sub displayed motions absent in AD-bound. Dissection of couplings revealed a network communication between active site, microtub interface, and necker via loop and loop. Simulations indicated mutations G325 and G326 in loop reduced flexibility and disrupted couplings.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that ATP and AD-like kines conformations are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide, supporting a model where necker docking leads to tighter coupling of microub and nucleotide regions. Simulations highlight critical conformation changes and alloster coupling between dist functional sites.

**Conclusions:** Characterizing motor domain conformations and interconversion is essential for an atomic-level model of kines action. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of kines dynamics, highlighting susceptibility to multiple conformation states in the absence of microtules, regardless of bound nucleotide. We propose a model where necker docking leads to tighter coupling of microub and nucleotide regions, and identify sites for large-scale conformation changes and alloster coupling between dist functional sites.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Kines motor drives intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformation changes mediating movement along microtules.
* Three distinct conformation clusters (ATP-like, AD-like, and Eg-inhibitor-bound) differ in orientation of key elements.
* Accelerated simulations show all states sample majorlog conformations, with differences in dynamic coupling sites.
* Neck docking leads to tighter coupling of microub and nucleotide regions.
* Large conformation changes and alloster coupling between dist sites are critical.

**Title:** Deciphering Bioluminescence: A Novel Computational Approach to Infer Gene Expression from Light Output in Lux Assays

**Research Question:** Can we develop a mathematical model that accurately relates gene expression to light output in Lux assays, addressing the limitations of current bioluminescent data interpretation?

**Methods:** We developed a novel computational approach to infer gene expression from light output in Lux assays, based on a new mathematical model of Lux activity that incorporates LuxAB, LuxC, and LuxE mechanisms, as well as protein synthesis and turnover. The model was calibrated with experimental data from Photorhabdus luminescens, the source of modern Lux reporters, and literature data for LuxC. Importantly, we discovered previously unreported inhibition of the LuxAB reaction by FM2.

**Findings:** Our model shows a nonlinear relationship between gene expression and light output, with transient peaks of light output similar to experimental data. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian scheme, we can reverse-engineer promoter activity from biolumcence. We demonstrate that a decrease in biolumcence can be interpreted as promoter switching off, while an increase in biolumcence indicates longer gene expression.

**Implications:** This approach benefits all users of Lux technology, enabling accurate interpretation of biolumcent data. Additionally, our model associates changes in biolumcence with promoter activity, not viability, ensuring minimal viability loss in experimental conditions for correct output interpretation.

**Conclusions:** The Lux system, originally developed for bacterial cells, has been adapted for eukaryotic cells and used in whole biosensors, live animals without euthanasia. However, biolumcent data interpretation is limited due to nonlinearity and molecular dynamics. Our model addresses these limitations, providing a method to infer gene expression from light output applicable to Lux assays. Furthermore, our discovery of LuxAB inhibition by FM2 expands our understanding of the Lux reaction.

**Key contributions:**

* Developed a novel mathematical model relating gene expression to light in Lux assays
* Discovered previously unreported inhibition of Lux reaction by FM2
* Showed nonlinear relationship between gene and light output
* Provided method to infer expression from light output applicable to Lux assays
* Demonstrated importance of minimal viability in experimental conditions for correct output interpretation

**Future directions:**

* Apply model to various Lux systems, including antimicrobial resistance genes
* Investigate effects of sub-lethal doses antimicrobials on Lux
* Further refine model with new data and mechanisms

**Title:** Structural Insights into the Inhibition of Enterovirus 71 and Coxsackievirus A16 Replication by Capsid Binders: Implications for Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease Treatment**

**Research Question:** Can capsid binders, specifically GPP and NLD, inhibit the replication of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coackievirus A16 (CVA), major causes of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in children?

**Methods:** We solved the crystal structure of CVA in complex with GPP, elucidating key residues involved in inhibitor interactions. In silico docking was performed to investigate interactions with next-generation capsid binders NLD and AL, showing potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis was conducted using structural information to gain insight into features required for capsid binders to interact and confer broad-spectrum anti-enterirus activity.

**Findings:** In silico docking demonstrated similar binding modes for recently designed capsid binders into CVA structure. Structural in silico results correlated with antiv activity against a range of enteriruses, showing broad-spectrum antiv activity of these molecules. We tested inhibitors against a panel of enteriruses (Table 2) and used structural comparisons (Fig 9) to correlate features with antiv activity, reinforcing NLD as a candidate for HFMD drug.

**Implications:** Canyon depressions encircle the 5-fold axes are receptor sites for attachment (Fig 1a). The uncoating process, where capsid opens to release viral genome into host cytos to initiate replication, is key to enterirus infection. Structural analysis revealed each VP in enterirus capsid contains a hydrophobic pocket. Expulsion of pocket is required for infection; a molecule replacing factor with higher affinity serves as antiral acting before virus replicates. We present crystal CVA with capsid binder 3-(4-pyridyl)-2-imazolidone (GPP) (Fig 1b) and calculate energy interaction using in silico method.

**Conclusions:** Anti-poliov activity observed for all caps binders, highest EC for PV with Leu at pocket bottom, reducing energy compared to PV and PV with Phe. The hydrophobic below canyon in VP remains target for novel inhibitors targeting early enterirus infection.

**Title:** Regulation of the Immune Response to Fungal and Gram-Positive Infections by the Serpin Necrot in Drosophila melanogaster

**Research Question:** How is the serpin Necrot, a serine proteinase inhibitor, regulated in Drosila melanogaster, and what is its role in the immune response to fungal and Gram-positive infections?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the regulation of Necrot in Drosila. We used a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation to "freeze" endocytosis and demonstrate that Nec is removed from the hemolymph in two groups of cells: glial and pericardial macrophages. We co-localized Nec with anti-AP, Rab5, and Rab7 antibodies to establish that the serpin is processed through multivesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localizes with ubiquitin-binding protein H. We also knocked down the Drosila ortholog of the mammalian LDL receptor with dsRNA and identified Lp1 as an enhancer of the immune response uptake of Nec from the hemolymph.

**Findings:** Our results show that Nec is rapidly taken up from the hemolymph in response to infection, peaking at 6-8 hours, and is degraded in the lysosome. Mutations that block endosome/lysosome fusion (dor and car) cause accumulation of Nec-positive endosomes, even in the absence of infection. Knockdown of the Dila ortholog of the mammalian LDL receptor with dsRNA blocked the uptake of Nec from the hemol.

**Implications:** Our study identifies the cells and receptor responsible for the uptake and degradation of Nec in Dila melanaster. The scavenging of ser/protein complexes may be critical in the regulation of proteolytic cascades.

**Conclusions:** Necrot, a serpin, regulates the Toll-mediated immune response in Dila, which is the best-studied example of ser-regulated proteolytic cascade in insects. The Dila genome encodes 15 putative inhibitory ser transcripts carrying secretion signal peptides. In addition, Sp27 ser controls Toll-mediated morphogenesis in the embryo and phenoxidase in adults. In mammals, ser turnover is rapid, so we were unable to detect immune serpins under normal conditions. However, "freezing" endocytic vesicles allowed us to detect ser uptake. Nec is sorted first to Rab-positive endosomes and then Rab-positive endosomes. The Nec gene encodes a proteinase inhibitor of the ser family, controlling proteolytic which activates the immune response to fungal and Gram infections. Disrupting these steps by expression dominant negative ASabS or ASQ leads to accumulation of Nec-positive vesicles.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of BMP Signaling in Establishing Left-Right Asymmetry in Sea Urchins: A Novel Insights into the Interplay between Nodal and BMP Signaling

**Research Question:** What is the role of BMP signaling in establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry in sea urchins, and how does it interact with the opposing Nodal pathway?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression and function of BMP signaling in the seaurch embryo, focusing on the left coelomic pouch (CP) and micromeres. We perturbed BMP activities and examined the effects on left-sided gene expression and structure formation. We also examined the relationship between Nodal and BMP signaling during LR axis establishment.

**Findings:** We found that BMP is asymmetrically activated in the left CP, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in miceres. Perturbing BMP activities demonstrated that BMP is required for left-sided gene expression and structure formation. Conversely, Nodal on the right inhibits BMP signaling, leading to asymmetric apoptosis of miceres. Our results show that BMP is a positive signal for left-sided development in seaurch, suggesting conserved opposing roles of Nodal and BMP in LR asymmetry.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of LR asymmetry in seaurch, where BMP signaling is required for left-sided patterning and expression of genes. Nodal, known to prevent rudiment formation on the right, inhibits BMP signaling, highlighting a complex interplay between the two pathways. The positive role of BMP on nodal expression has been observed in vertebrates, suggesting conserved mechanisms.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of LR asymmetry in seaurch, highlighting the importance of BMP signaling in left-sided development. The interplay between Nodal and BMP suggests a delicate balance between the two signals, with BMP required for left-sided expression and Nodal on the right. This study contributes to understanding LR asymmetry in seaurch and vertebrates, with implications for developmental biology and disease research.

**Title:** Cell Cycle-Dependent Regulation of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Lytic Gene Expression: Role of Checkpoint Signaling and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibition

**Research Question:** How does the host cell cycle regulate human cytomegalovirus (HCV) lytic gene expression, and what is the role of checkpoint signaling and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibition in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the relationship between host cell cycle and CMV lytic gene expression by infecting cells in different phases of the cell cycle (G0/G1, S, and G2) and analyzing viral immediate early (IE) gene expression. We used genotoxic stress (doxorubicin) and chemical inhibitors of DNA replication (aphidicol) to overcome the block to IE expression in S2 cells. Additionally, we examined the role of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (p21) in checkpoint-dependent rescue of IE expression.

**Findings:** Our results show that the block to IE expression in S2 cells can be overcome by genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of DNA replication, indicating involvement of checkpoint signaling pathways in IE repression. Checkpoint-dependent rescue of IE requires p53, and absence of checkpoint activation is mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in a p53-dependent manner. Requirement for CDK inhibitor p21 downstream of p53 suggests a pivotal role for CD in controlling IE repression in S2 and G cells. Treatment of S2 cells with CD inhibitor roscovine alleviates repression independently of p53. Importantly, CD inhibition also overcomes the block to IE during quiescent infection of NT2 (NT) cells.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that timely CD activity not only secures specificity of cell cycle-dependent CMV gene program but also plays a hitherto unrecognized role in preventing establishment of latent state. We suggest that DNA-dependent release of IE expression is major obstacle to CM replication in S cells and proceed with normal kinetics from infected G/G cells. p53 tumor suppressor governs long-term cellular response to genotoxic by inducing p-dependent cycle arrest or apoptosis.

**Conclusions:** Our data suggest that inhibitory function of CD on CM lytic gene is not restricted to cell cycle but likely has broader relevance for states of IE expression. Induction of IE by CD inhibition can occur in all cycle phases NT cells, though S2 reacted sensitive at low suboptimal concentrations. Rescue of CM expression in S2 relies on p-dependent signaling, both by genotoxic and replicative stress.

**Title:** Innate Immune Recognition of HIV-1 in Dendritic Cells Contributes to the Induction of Effective HIV-Specific CD8 T Cell Responses in Elite Controllers

**Research Question:** How do elite controllers (EC) restrict HIV-1 replication through functional HIV-1-specific T cell responses, and what mechanisms support the evolution of effective HIV-1-specific cell immunity in these patients?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of innate immune recognition of HIV-1 in dendritic cells (DC) from EC, a subgroup of patients controlling HIV-1 replication in the absence of treatment.

**Findings:** Exposure of DC from EC to HIV-1 led to rapid and sustained production of type I interferons (IFN) and upregulation of interferon-stimulated effector genes. Emergence of these cell-intrinsic responses was associated with reduced SAM1 and LED/p75, and accumulation of viral transcripts, but inhibited by pharmacological blockade of reverse transcription or siRNA silencing cytosolic sensor cAS. Importantly, cell-intrinsic recognition of HIV-1 in DC from EC translated into stronger stimulation and expansion of HIV-specific CD8 T responses.

**Implications:** Our data suggest an important role of cell-in type I interferon secretion in dendritic cells for induction of HIV-specific CD8 cells and may be helpful for eliciting functional cell immunity against HIV for preventative or therapeutic purposes.

**Conclusions:** Innate cell-intrinsic recognition of HIV-1 in dendritic cells contributes to the generation of antiviral T cell responses in elite controllers. Recognition of early viral products in controllers was facilitated by upregulation of cAS, leading to rapid and sustained IFN secretion, functionally supporting HIV-specific CD8 cell responses. These results reveal previously unrecognized mechanisms of HIV-1 immune recognition contributing to cell-mediated control of HIV. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for developing immunologic approaches for HIV treatment and prevention, as most vaccine candidates rely dendritic for inducing HIV-specific responses.

**Title:** Identification of Sir2 as a Negative Regulator of Fat Storage in Drosophila Larvae through a Simple Buoy-Based Screening Method

**Research Question:** What are the genetic factors that regulate fat storage in Drosila larvae, and how do they relate to human obesity?

**Methods:** We developed a buoy-based screening method to identify Doph larvae with increased levels of stored fat and identified 66 genes, including Sir2, a sirt family member, which regulates storage and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids by deacetylating key proteins.

**Findings:** Knockdown of Sir in larval fat results in increased fat, and genetic mosaic analysis shows Sir restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the body in a cell-autonomous manner. Changes in metabolic enzymes expression in Sir mutants point to a shift from catabolism. Surprisingly, although Sir is upregulated under starvation, Sir larvae survive better than wild-type under amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided.

**Implications:** Our findings implicate a Sir-mediated pathway that activates catabolic response to amino-acid starvation irrespective of sugar content of diet. Sir functions in Doph fat in a cell-autonomous to regulate storage, at least via regulation of RNA of key metabolic enzymes. Our studies suggest Sir as key regulator in switch from ingested to stored as energy source.

**Conclusions:** Multiple approaches, each with advantages and disadvantages, will complement in identifying genes that regulate fat in Doph. Our identified Sir as negative regulator of fat inoph larvae. At least inoph, effects of reduction in Sir on fat can be explained by cell-aut function in fat body. This mode of regulation by sirtins may be evolutionarily ancient. Organisms have evolved complex ways regulating fat in tissues or linked environmental cues to storage sophisticated. If correct, our interpretation suggests in larvae switch from dietary to stored energy in response amino starvation, irrespective sugar diet, and Sir mediates this switch.

**Title:** Evolutionary Robustness of Asymmetric Cell Division in Nematodes: Unveiling the Diversity of Spindle Parameters

**Research Question:** How has the process of asymmetric cell division evolved in nematodes, and what are the underlying mechanisms that govern spindle positioning in this process?

**Methods:** We recorded the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, an excellent model system to study biophysical properties of spindle positioning. Our collection of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabis and 15 non-Caenorhabis species (available at http://www.ensly.fr/LMC/NematCell/videos) constitutes a powerful dataset to study evolution of cellular processes across species.

**Findings:** Although all strains underwent asymmetric cell division, they exhibited intra- and inter-species variations in degree of asymmetry and spindle parameters, including oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these parameters changed during evolution with no direction in species phylogeny, except spindle transverse oscillations, which evolved at base of Caenorhabis genus. Changes were unrelated to embryo size variations. Importantly, elongation, displacement, and oscill each evolved independently.

**Implications:** These findings contrast with expectations based on C elegans studies, revealing unrecognized evolutionary changes in spindle mechanics. Collectively, data demonstrate that while essential process of cell division has been conserved over nemat evolution, spindle parameters combine in various ways. Like developmental processes, cell division is subject to drift.

**Conclusions:** Asymmetric cell division is essential to generate diversity in animal cells, with cleavage plane perpendicular to mitotic spindle. Spindle dictates size of daughter cells, although properties conserved between distantly related species and cell types, little is known of underlying mechanisms. Our study reveals evolutionary robustness of spindle positioning in nematodes, highlighting diversity of parameters. These findings have implications for understanding biophysical and molecular basis of cell division in animal.

**Title:** Evolution of Gene Networks as a Source of Genetic Innovation for Bacteria to Explore and Exploit New Niches, Including Pathogenic Interactions with Hosts

**Research Question:** This study investigates the evolution of gene networks as a primary source of genetic innovation that allows bacteria to explore and exploit new niches, including pathogenic interactions with hosts. Specifically, it focuses on the archetypal DNA protein Omp, identical in Salmonella Typhimurium serovar Tyimium and Escheria coli, but with regulatory specialization resulting in different environmental triggers of Omp expression and divergent Omp regulons.

**Methods:** The study used comparative genomics and transcriptomics approaches to analyze the Omp regulon in S. Tyimium and E coli. coli. The authors found that Omp mRNA and Omp protein levels are elevated by acid in S. Tyim but not in E. coli, due to differences in the promoter regions of the omp genes. The E coli omp orthologue can be acid-inducible by introduction of appropriate sequences from S. Tyim.

**Findings:** The Omp regulon in S. Tyim overlaps with E coli at 15 genes, including horizontally acquired virulence genes that E coli does not have. Omp binds to genomic targets in higher abundance when DNA is relaxed, which occurs in S. Tyim as a result of acid stress, a requirement for optimal expression of virulence genes. The targets of Omp do not share strong nucleotide consensus; the ability of O to recruit genes to regul arises from modest specificity in DNA with preference for relaxed allowing cooperation with topology-based allostery to modulate transcription response to stress.

**Implications:** The findings suggest that evolution of gene networks is a primary source of genetic innovation for bacteria to explore and exploit new niches, including pathogenic interactions with hosts. The study highlights the importance of regulatory specialization of Omp expression in S. Tyim and E coli in response to acid stress.

**Conclusions:** The study shows that Omp expression is regulated differently in S. Tyim and E coli. coli, with S. Tyim having an acid-indible promoter and E coli not. The authors propose that species-specific differences in the omp promoter region, Env protein structure, and function account for the distinct patterns of O expression. The findings have implications for understanding the evolution of gene regulation in bacteria and pathogenicity.

**Title:** Identification and Characterization of a Novel Histone Methyltransferase Effector, N, Secreted by Chlamydia trachomatis and Targeting Mammalian Histones

**Research Question:** How does the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachatis utilize a novel effector protein, N, containing a SET domain, to target and methylate mammalian histones?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemical approaches to identify and characterize the effector protein, N, secreted by Chydia tratis via a type III secretion mechanism, and translocated to the host nucleus, where it associates with chromatin. We expressed N in mammalian cells, reconstituted nuclear targeting and chromatin association, and performed in vitro methylation assays to confirm its histone methyltransfer activity.

**Findings:** N, containing a SET domain, was identified as a histone methyltransfer that targets histones H2, H3, and H4, and itself (automethylates). Mutants deficient in automethylation demonstrated diminished activity towards histones, suggesting automethylation enhances enzymatic activity. This is the first description of a bacterial effector directly targeting mammalian histones.

**Implications:** Bacterial effector proteins play crucial roles in pathogenicity, and this work identifies a novel chlamial effector, N, which contains a SET domain predictive of histone methyltransfer activity. N is secreted by Chy tratis, translocates to the host nucleus and has enzymatic activity towards eukaryotic substrates. This is the first bacterial SET protein to enter the host nucleus and target mammalian histones.

**Conclusions:** We propose CT and its homologs in other chlamdia genomes as N, as the first nuclear effector identified in chlamdia. Automethylation of N may enhance methyltransfer activity by increasing affinity for substrates. Future studies are needed to identify genes regulated by N translocation in nucleus during Chy infection. Using H2 as histone control, we demonstrated preference of N for mammalian histones over chydial H1 at equal concentrations. Automethylation of N decreased with increasing histone substrate, suggesting competition between substrates.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Recessive Genetic Effects on Human Height: A Genome-Wide Association Study of Inbreeding Depression in 35,000 Individuals from 21 Populations

**Research Question:** Do genome-wide recessive effects contribute to the heritability of human height, and if so, what is the magnitude of this effect?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study of inbreeding depression in 35,000 individuals from 21 populations to investigate the relationship between genome-wide homozygosity and height.

**Findings:** We found a significant inverse association between genome-wide homozyosity and height, equivalent to a 3 cm reduction in height in offspring of first cousins compared to unrelated individuals, after controlling for socio-economic status (χ² = 83.89, df = 1, p = 5.2 × 10-20). However, heterogeneity among populations was observed, with consistent direction but varying effect sizes.

**Implications:** Our results suggest multiple rare, recessive variants influence human height. This exploratory work on height paves the way for investigating inbreeding effects and genetic architecture on heritable traits of biomedical importance.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for genome-wide recessive effects on height, implying combined effects of many variants of small effect across the genome. Our methodology is applicable to heritable traits, enabling investigation of inbreeding and genetic architecture on a range of biomedical traits.

**Title:** Monocyte Subpopulations Display Distinct Phenotypes and Functions during Malaria Infection: Implications for Anti-parasitic Activity

**Research Question:** We investigated the hypothesis that discrete monocyte (MO) subpopulations are induced during malaria infection and associated with anti-parasitic activity.

**Methods:** We characterized the phenotype of blood MO from healthy-exposed individuals and patients with acute uncomplicated malaria by flow cytometry. Additionally, MO function was evaluated by in vitro antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADC) assay.

**Findings:** At admission, percentages and absolute numbers of CD16+ MO and CCR+CXCR1 MO were high in the majority of patients. Remarkably, expression of CCR and CXCR on the CDhi MO subset defined two subgroups of patients that differed significantly in their ability to limit parasite growth through ADC mechanism. In the group with highest percentages and absolute of CDhi CCR+CX1 MO and highest levels of ADC activity, parasitemias were lower (0.14±0.34%) than the second group (1.30±3.34%; p=0.005).

**Implications:** Our results suggest that during malaria, some patients' MO can exert strong ADC activity, bringing new insights into complex relationships between phenotype and function of MO from patients and healthy-exposed individuals. Discrete subpopulations induced during infection are associated with anti-paritic activity.

**Conclusions:** We have shown distinct differences in MO subsets between patients with malaria and healthy-exposed controls. Patients with high numbers of CDhi CCR+CX1 MO had lower parasitemias than those with low CDhi C+CX MO. Our results suggest a causal association as MO expressing CCR, CXCR, CD, TN-α, and IF-γ are associated with lower parasitem and strong ADC activity. This contrasts historical view of MO as phagocytic cells in malaria, clearing parasites with opson antibodies.

**Title:** Schistosoma mansoni Infection and HIV Susceptibility: A Study of Immune Alterations in Blood and Foreskin Tissue

**Background:** Schistosoma mansoni infection has been linked to increased HIV prevalence in humans and SHIV incidence in primate models. We hypothesized that immune activation from gastrointestinal mucosa infection would increase HIV-susceptible CD4 cell subsets in blood and foreskin through mucosal homing.

**Methods:** Foreskin and blood tissue were obtained from 34 HIV and malaria-uninfected Ugandan men who volunteered for elective circumcision, 12 of whom were definitively positive for S. mansoni eggs in stool and 12 definitively negative for S. mans eggs and antigen. T and blood cell subsets were characterized by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

**Findings:** S mans-infected men had higher frequency of systemic Th1 (22.9% vs 16.5% of CD4 cells, p<0.05), Th17 (2.3% vs 1.5, p<0.05), and Th22 (0.5 vs 0.3, p<0.01) than uninf men. Additionally, Th in blood S mans-inf men demonstrated enhanced function (28.1 vs 16.3 producing cytokines, p=0.046). However, these alterations were not observed in foreskin tissue.

**Implications:** S mans infection was associated with increased frequency of highly-suscept Th, Th, and Th cell subsets in blood, but T cell differences did not extend to foreskin. mans induced changes in cell immunology through mucosal system not likely increase susceptibility in fores.

**Conclusion:** We found S mans infection in HIV-unected Ugandan men associated with increase in highlyuscept cell subsets blood, but not fores. Whether these changes would alter susceptibility, given limited to blood, unclear. mans-inf men current being susceptible and Th may also more susceptible. However, frequency highly susceptible subsets observed blood mans men not in fores tissue. Since fores primary site HIV acquisition heterosexual men, potential impact these systemic mans infection not clear.

**Title:** Wolbachia Depletion Induces Non-Autonomous Apoptosis in Filarial Nematodes: Implications for Filarial Disease Treatment

**Research Question:** What are the cellular mechanisms underlying the mutualistic relationship between Wolbachia and filarial nematodes, and how does depletion of Wolia affect nemat development and fertility?

**Methods:** We used whole mount confocal microscopy to observe the effects of Wolia depletion on nemat cellular structure and function in B. malayi and O. volulus.

**Findings:** Depletion of Wolia induces apoptosis in adult germl cells, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilar and fourth-stage larvae (L4). Surprisingly, apoptosis occurs in majority of embryonic cells not infected prior to antibiotic treatment. No apoptosis occurs in hypodermis, populated with large numbers of Wolia, although disruption of hypod cytoskeleton follows depletion. Induction of apoptosis upon Wolia depletion is non-autonomous, suggesting involvement of factors from Wolia in hypodermis. Pattern of apoptosis correlates with nemat tissues and processes perturbed following Wolia depletion, embryogenesis and long-term sterilization, sustained several months until adult death.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a cellular mechanism for sustained reductions in microfilar loads and interruption of transmission prior to macrofilaridal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes.

**Conclusions:** Wolia depletion induces non-autonomous apoptosis in fial nematodes, affecting germl cells, embryos, and somatic cells of microilar and L4. Apoptosis occurs in majority of embryonic cells not infected prior to antibiotic treatment, while hypoderm cells with Wolia are spared. Disruption of hypod cytoskeleton follows Wolia depletion. Induction of apoptosis is non-autonomous, suggesting involvement of Wolia factors in hypod. Pattern of apoptosis correlates with nemat tissues and processes perturbed following Wolia depletion, embryogenesis and long-term sterilization. Our observations provide a cellular mechanism for sustained reductions in microilar loads and interruption of transmission following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of Anti-Malarial Pantoate Analogues: Whole-Genome Sequencing Reveals Distinct Mechanisms of Action and Essential Kinase Involvement

**Research Question:** How do anti-malar panto analogs, such as pantoate and CJ-15,801, exert their antimalarial activity, and what is the role of pantoate kinase (Pan) in their mechanism of action?

**Methods:** We employed continuous drug pressure with panto and CJ-15,801 to generate P. falciparum lines resistant to these analogs and performed whole-genome sequencing to identify mutations in putative Pan genes.

**Findings:** Mutations in one of two putative Pan genes, PfPan1, were found in all resistant lines, significantly altering Pan activity and conferring a fitness cost, consistent with Pf1 coding a functional Pan essential for growth. Mutants exhibited different sensitivity to recently described potent anti-malar panto analogs, with one being hypersensitive.

**Implications:** Our study reveals distinct mechanisms of action for anti-m panto analogs: some inhibit Co biosynthesis, while others inhibit Co-utilizing enzymes. Pf1 mutations influence both mechanisms, validating the importance of metabolic activation of panto analogs in antimal activity.

**Conclusions:** This study provides genetic evidence that anti-m p analogs have multiple mechanisms of action, targeting Co biosynthesis or utilization, and that Pf1 is essential for activation of these analogs during intraerythrocytic stage. Mutations in Pf1 confer resistance to some analogs while hypersensitizing to others, indicating different classes of analogs have distinct mechanisms of action. Our findings highlight the importance of metabolic activation of panto analogs in antimal activity and provide a framework for developing new antimal agents targeting Co biosynthesis or utilization.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Genetic Variants Associated with Prolongation of the Electrocardiogram Interval in African Americans

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the genetic determinants of the electrocardiogram (ECG) interval, specifically the atrioventricular (AV) conduction time, in African Americans, a population understudied in previous genome-wide association (GWA) studies.

**Methods:** We conducted a GWA study in four cohorts of African Americans (n=6,247) using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray and imputed 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the YRI and CEU Hap II phase panels. We identified a strong signal (rs3924) in the SCN5A gene, encoding the cardiac sodium channel, with genome-wide significance (p<2.5×10-8) in two cohorts and meta-analysis.

**Findings:** The rs3924 variant explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans (β=5.1 msec per allele, 95% CI=4.1-6.1, p=3×10-23) and was also associated with PR (β=2.4 per allele, 95 CI=1.8-3.0, p=3×10-16) in individuals of European ancestry (n=14,042), but with smaller effect size (p heterogeneity<0.001) and variability (0.5%). Meta-analysis of four cohorts identified genome-wide associations in SCN10 (rs801), ME1 (10855), and TB5 (725) that correlated with SNPs in European and Asian G studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR (13.3 msec, p=0.009) in one but not three cohorts.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants in African at loci previously associated with PR in European and Asian samples and identify an association at one locus more strongly associated with PR in African than Europeans. Identification of specific alleles underlying PR heritability may provide insights into electrophysiology, novel drug targets for arrhythm treatment, and genetic prediction of arrhythm risk and response to antiarrhythmics.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of GWA in understudied populations, such as African Americans, to identify genetic determinants of complex traits. Our results suggest that common variants unlikely explain large ancestry-related variation in atriovent nodal conduction. The strongest variant observed explained 2% PR variability, emphasizing the need for further exploration of genetic and environmental factors.

**Title:** Identification of ARL8, a Small GTP-Binding Protein, as a Novel Component of Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV) Replication Complex

**Research Question:** What is the role of ARL, a small GTP-binding protein, in the replication of Tomato mosaic virus (To) in plant cells?

**Methods:** We investigated the co-purification of ARL with To180K protein from solubilized membranes of To-infected Nicotiana tabum cells and found that ARL co-pur with To180K and TOM1, a seven-transmembrane protein, in infected cells but not uninfected cells. Simultaneous mutations in two ARL genes inhibited tobamovirus multiplication in Arabidopsis thalian. In vitro To RNA-replication system, lack of either TOM or ARL inhibited replicative RNA synthesis.

**Findings:**

1. ARL co-pur with To180K and TOM from solubized membranes of To-infected cells, but not uninf cells.
2. Simult mutations in two ARL genes inhibited tobamov multiplication in Arabid thalian.
3. Lack of TOM or ARL inhibited replicative RNA synthesis in vitro.
4. Coexpression of To130 with TOM and ARL in yeast showed 5-capping activity in membrane fraction.

**Implications:**

1. ARL is a novel component of To replication complex and plays crucial role in activation of RNA synthesizing and capping functions.
2. TOM and ARL are required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis.
3. Membrane-bound complex containing To replication proteins, TOM, and ARL is formed in infected cells.

**Conclusion:** This study identifies ARL, a small GTP-binding protein, as a novel component of To replication complex and highlights its crucial role in activation of RNA synthesizing and capping functions. Our findings suggest that TOM and ARL are required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis and that a membrane-bound complex containing To replication proteins, TOM, and ARL is formed in infected cells.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Inhibitory Neurons in Shaping Firing Patterns of Principal Neurons: A Comparative Analysis of Feed-Forward and Feedback Inhibition in the Locust Olfactory System

**Research Question:** How do feed-forward and feedback inhibition motifs shape the firing patterns of Kenyon cells (KC) in the locust olfactory system, and what are the implications for olfactory learning and memory?

**Methods:** We developed a computational model of the locust olfactory system to investigate the effects of feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibition on KC responses to odor stimuli. We compared two models: one with FF inhibition mediated by lateral interneurons (LHNs) and the other with FB mediated by the giant GABAergic neuron (GN).

**Findings:** Both FF and FB motifs maintained sparse KC responses and provided optimal odor discrimination, but only FB created a response consistent with in vivo data. Anatomical evidence suggests GN inhibits both KCs in the mushroom body and LNs in the lateral horn, yet KCs fire sparsely while LNs respond to odors with dense spiking.

**Implications:** Our results describe general rules for feed-forward versus feedback inhibition and suggest GN is potentially the primary source of inhibition to KCs. A better understanding of inhibitory motifs' impact on postsynaptic activity could reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks.

**Conclusions:** This study clarifies differences between FF and FB inhibition in the locust olfactory system, highlighting the role of GN in maintaining sparse KC responses and odor discrimination. Our findings have implications for understanding inhibitory mechanisms in brain areas, such as olfactory cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and LGN.

**Title:** Development of a Combined Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Assay for Pan-Lyavirus Detection: A Novel Tool for Rabies Diagnosis in Humans and Animals

**Research Question:** The diagnosis of lyssavirus infection, including rabies, in animals and humans relies heavily on laboratory confirmation techniques, with post-mortem diagnosis based on immunofluorescence and virus isolation. However, molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques are increasingly used for diagnosing rabies in humans and epidemiological analyses. The challenge lies in obtaining specificity and sensitivity while ensuring genetic diversity of lyssaviruses does not compromise detection.

**Methods:** We developed a dual real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (RT) combo-qPCR method for panlyavirus detection, combining two technologies: probe-based TaMan RT-qPCR for RAB species (panAB RT-q) and reaction using intercalating dye SY Green to detect other lyss species (panly-q).

**Findings:** The combined assay was evaluated with a large panel of animal samples covering all genetic variability at viral level and extended to all lyss species characterized to date. It was also evaluated for human rabies diagnosis on 211 biological samples (n=76 positive and n=135), including saliva and skin biops. It detected 41 human rabies cases with sensitivity of 91.5% and 54% for skin biopsy and saliva intra-vam diagnosis.

**Implications:** This combined RT-q method constitutes a relevant, validated tool for rab diagnosis in humans and animals, representing a promising tool for lyavirus surveillance.

**Conclusion:** This study presents a novel dual RT-q method for panly detection in samples, intraam diagnosis humans and post-mortem animals. The assay is based on two complementary techniques: probe-based TaMan RT-q for RAB species (panAB-q) and intercalating dye SY Green for other lyaviruses (pan-q). The combo-q was evaluated with a large panel of animal samples covering all genetic variability and extended to all lyss species. It was also evaluated for human rabies diagnosis on 211 biological samples, detecting 41 cases with sensitivity 91.5 and 54 for skin and saliva intraam diagnosis. This method was successfully implemented in two rab reference laboratories in endemic countries (Cambodia and Morocco).

**Title:** Efficacy of Insecticide-Treated Mosquito Fences in Controlling Tset-Transmitted Trypanosomias in Domestic Pigs in the Eastern Region of Ghana

**Research Question:** Can insecticide-treated mosquito fences be an effective in controlling tset-transmitted trypanosomias in domestic pigs in the Eastern Region of Ghana?

**Methods:** A randomized controlled trial was conducted from May 4th to October 2007 in two villages, one serving as a control with 14 pigs and the other with 24 pigs protected with insecticide-treated fences. The fences were 100 cm high, 150 denier polyester with 100 mg/m deltamethrin and UV protector attached to timber poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring of tset densities with geo-referenced biocal traps showed a reduction of more than 90% in the protected village within two months, exceeding 95% in subsequent months. Fifty pigs from each village were ear-tagged and given curative treatment with diminazene acate 3.5 mg/kg after blood samples taken.

**Findings:** Tset population in the control village was not affected, displaying seasonal variations. Initial trypan prevalence was 76% and 72% in protected and control, decreased to 16% in protected as opposed 84 in control three months after intervention. Six months later, 8% protected were infected contrasting 60 in control.

**Implications:** Insecticide-treated mosquito fences significantly reduced tset numbers and trypan prevalence. Pigs are essential for household income and consumption in rural areas, but persisting threat of African trypanosomias jeopardizes productive pig husbandry. Our intervention was based on hypothesis that surrounding pigs with ITN would reduce tset flies, thereby reducing trypan infections. Baseline data onset dynamics and trypan infections were recorded in intervention and control villages before and after IT installation.

**Conclusions:** Insecticide-treated mosquito fences are an effective in controlling tset-transmitted trypanomias in domestic pigs in the Eastern Region Ghana, reducing trypan prevalence by more than 90% within two months and exceeding 95 in subsequent months. This intervention is a viable option for maintaining livestock and income in areas deemed unsuitable due to tset trypaniasis risk.

**Title:** Assessing Reproducibility and Transparency in Biomedical Research: A Survey of 441 Journal Articles from 2000-2014

**Research Question:** What is the current status of reproducibility and transparency in biomedical research, specifically in terms of access to raw data, protocols, replication studies, systematic reviews, and documentation of funding and conflicts of interest, in a sample of 441 journal articles published between 2000-2014?

**Methods:** A random sample of 441 biomedical articles published between 2000-2014 was assessed for indicators of reproducibility and transparency, including availability of raw data, protocols, replication studies, systematic reviews, and documentation of funding and conflicts of interest.

**Findings:** Only one study provided a full protocol, and none made raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare (n=4), and only 16 studies were included in subsequent systematic reviews or meta-analyses. The majority of studies did not mention funding or conflicts of interest. The percentage of articles with no statement of conflict decreased from 94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 201, while the percentage reporting statements of conflicts (0 in 200, 15.4 in 201) or no conflicts (5.6 in 200,50 in 201) increased. Articles in clinical medicine journals were twice as likely to not include information on funding and have private funding.

**Implications:** This study provides baseline data to compare future progress in improving indicators of reproducibility and transparency in the scientific literature.

**Conclusions:** Our evaluation is limited to published research information. Sometimes, additional data and protocols and clarifications on conflicts or funding may be obtained by communicating with authors or sponsors, but this would be uncertain and should not replace lack transparency in the scientific record.

**Title:** Unveiling the Host-Pathogen Interactions during Primary Pneumonic Plague: Targeting of Alveolar Macrophages and Neutrophils by Yersinia pestis Type III Secretion System

**Research Question:** What are the primary host cells targeted by Yersinia pestis during primary pneumonic plague, and how do these interactions contribute to the progression of the disease?

**Methods:** We employed a FRET-based probe to quantify the injection of effector proteins by Y. pestis type III secretion system in a mouse model of primary pneumonic plague, and evaluated the role of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in limiting bacterial growth and inflammation in the lung.

**Findings:** Our results show that Y. pest targets alolar macroages early during infection, followed by a switch to neutrophils. Depletion of 92% of alolar macroages had little effect on bacterial burden in the lung, indicating that macrophages are not involved in limiting Yinia survival in the lung. In contrast, neutrophil influx was unable to limit bacterial growth and was responsible for severe inflammation during the pro-inflammatory phase.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that Y. pest creates a localized environment in the lungs early in pneumonic plague that deactivates host immune responses, and targets innate cell populations via type III secretion of Y effectors. Evaluating the fate of macrophages and neutils provides insight into downstream events leading to pro-inflammatory disease progression.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to identify host cells and population dynamics in lung during primary pneumonic plague, and highlights the role of Y. pest type III secretion in targeting alolar macroages and neutils during pre-inflammatory phase. Our results challenge previous literature highlighting interactions between Y. pest and macroages, and demonstrate that Y. pest TSS primarily targets macro and neutils early in disease.

**Title:** Evaluation of Serological Tests for Diagnosing Asymptomatic Visceral Leishmanias Infection: A Cohort Study in Southeast Brazil

**Research Question:** Can serological tests accurately diagnose asymptomatic visceral leishmanias (VL) infection in a cohort with a two-year follow-up period in an urban area of Southeast Brazil?

**Methods:** A cohort study was conducted in an urban area of Southeast Brazil with 136 participants (97 positive and 39 negative for PCR) with two-year follow-up. Blood samples were collected and clinically evaluated for disease progression from asymptomatic state. Controls and samples from 22 individuals and 8 patients with kala-azar were collected. Molecular techniques (PCR and hybridization) and ELISA with three antigens were performed.

**Findings:** Leishmania was confirmed by molecular techniques in all kalaazar patients and 117 (86%) of cohort. Kala patients showed high reactivity ELAs whereas asymptomatic presented low reactivity. Compared to molecular techniques, L. amazon and L. antigens showed higher sensitivity (49.6% and 41.0, respectively) than r39 (26.5); however, specificity of r39 was higher (73.7) L. amazon (52.6) and L. antigens (36.8). Low agreement among antigens used (kappa0.10). Ser tests were inaccurate diagnosing asymptomatic compared molecular; this could lead misclassification population studies.

**Implications:** Studies using ser assays estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention or identify Leish infection risk factors may have compromised results.

**Conclusion:** Serological tests are inaccurate diagnosing asymptomatic VL compared molecular methods. Misclassification in population studies may occur.

**Title:** Elucidating Retrotranson Silencing Mechanisms in Mammalian Cells: A Genome-Wide Analysis of Histone Deacetylase 1 and Polycomb Repressive Complexes

**Research Question:** Despite the prevalence of retrotransons in mammalian genomes, their silencing mechanisms in germ and pluripotent cells remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) and poly repressive complexes in retroon silencing in mouse embryonic stem cells.

**Methods:** We employed Illumina and Affymetrix gene expression microarray platforms to monitor retroon expression in mouse embryonic stem cells. Computational analysis of microarray data identified dac1 as a component of the retroon silencing machinery and retroon targets in these cells. Additionally, we analyzed retroons targeted by DNA methylation, histone modification, and polycomb repressive complexes in embryonic cells.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed a complex interplay between silencing mechanisms regulating retroons in embryonic cells, with different genomic copies of the same retroon exhibiting differential sensitivity to silencing. We identified dac1 as a regulator of retroons in embryonic cells and a component of the retro silencing machinery. Furthermore, we found retroons targeted by DNA methylation, histone modification, and poly repressive complexes in embryonic cells.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates that genome-wide silencing can be monitored using microarray expression data, revealing a complex interplay between mechanisms controlling retroon expression in embryonic and germ cells. Our findings highlight the importance of dac1 in retro silencing and provide new insights into the mechanisms protecting mammalian genome from retroposition.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to our understanding of retroon silencing in mammalian cells, identifying dac1 as a key regulator of retroons in embryonic cells. The approach used here can be applied to gene microarray data, generating new insights into retro regulation in mammals and identifying components of defence mechanisms protecting genome from retroposition.

**Title:** Arabidopsis thaliana Cryptochrome 2 (CRY) Mediates Light Control of Flowering: C1 (Cry-interacting bHL1) Interacts with CRY in Response to Blue Light to Activate Transcription of Flowering Locus T

**Research Question:** How does Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY) regulate flowering time, and what is the role of CRY-interacting bHL1 (C1) in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between CRY and C1 in response to blue light using in vitro and in vivo assays. We analyzed the binding affinity of C1 to canonical and non-canonical E-box DNA sequences in vitro and the chromatin region of the FT promoter in vivo.

**Findings:** We found that CRY interacts with at least C1 and C5 in response to blue light, but not in darkness or other wavelengths. C1 binds to canonical-box with higher affinity than non-canonical-box in vitro, but only binds non-canonical-box in vivo. Our genetic analysis demonstrates that C1, C2, C4, and C5 act redundantly activate FT transcription and are positive regulators of CRY-mediated flowering. C1 and other C form heterodimers, some with higher affinity to non-canonical-box in vitro.

**Implications:** Our study shows that C redundantly regulate CRY-dependent flowering, and different C form heterodimers interact non-canonical-box in vivo. Consistent with hypothesis that C play similar roles in CRY-mediated blue signaling, C expression is regulated by light.

**Conclusions:**

1. CRY interacts with at least C1 and C5 in response blue to light, but not darkness or other wavelengths.
2. C binds canonical-box higher than non-canonical vitro, but non-can-box vivo.
3. C, C, C, and C redundantly activate FT transcription and are positive regulators of CRY flowering.
4. C and C form heterodimers, some with higher affinity to non-can-box vitro.
5. C expression is regulated by light, consistent with hypothesis C play similar roles in CRY blue signaling.
6. C redundantly regulate C-dependent flowering, and form heterodimers interact non-can-box vivo.

**Supporting Text:**

* C1 acts as RY and light-dependent transcription regulator in Arabidopsis assay.
* transcription activity toward canonical and non-box.
* stimulates FT mRNA expression.
* interacts chromatin DNA FT lacks canonical-box but non-box.
* did not detect interaction C and C, but C exhibited C-dependent floral initiation.
* possibility C interact C or C to form heterimer regulate downstream C.
* interacts chromatin FT with non-box no-box.
* support hypothesis C interact non-box elements FT, RY interacts at C and C in blue affect transcription initiation.
* bHL can form homo- or heterodimer bind specific motifs, canonical or non-canonical

**Title:** Cost-Effectiveness of Overseas Presumptive Treatment vs. Domestic Screening and Treatment for Intestinal Parasitic Infections in US-Bound Refugees

**Research Question:** What is the cost-effectiveness of overseas presumptive treatment versus domestic screening and treatment for intestinal parasitic infections in US-bound refugees?

**Methods:** An economic decision tree model using Markov processes was developed to estimate the cost and health impacts of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 US-bound Asian refugees: 1) No Program, 2) US Domestic Screening and Treatment, 3) Overseas Albendazole and Ivermect presumptive treatment, and 4) Overseas Albazole and Screening for Strongloides.

**Findings:** The "No Program" option was the least expensive ($165,923 per cohort) and least effective (145 outpatient cases, 4.0 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths over a 60-year for one-year). The Overseas Albazole and Iverect option ($418,824) was less expensive than Domestic Screening ($3,832,572) or Overseas Albazole and Screening Stronglo ($2,182,483). According to the model, the most effective option was Overseas Albazole and Iverect, which reduced outpatient cases, deaths, and hospitalization by 80% at an estimated cost $458,718 per death averted or $2,21924,036 per QAL/year gained relative to No.

**Implications:** Overse presumptive treatment for US-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and least as effective as domestic treatment programs. The addition of iverect to albazole reduces the prevalence of Strongloides and the probability of rare, potentially fatal disseminated Stronglo.

**Conclusion:** Overseas presumptive treatment for intestinal parasitic infections in US-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment. The addition of iverect to albazole reduces the prevalence of Stronglo and the probability of rare, potentially fatal disseminated Strong.

**Title:** Unveiling the Tissue Tropism of a Novel Microsporidian Parasite of Caenorhabditis elegans: Nematida displere

**Research Question:** How do microbial pathogens establish specific niches for replication within their hosts, and what factors contribute to tissue tropism in host-microbe interactions?

**Methods:** We investigated the life cycle of a newly discovered microsporidian parasite, Nematida displere, infecting Caenorhabdis elegans, and characterized its unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host.

**Findings:** Nematida displere invades multiple tissues, including epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C. elegans, with most replication occurring in muscle and epidermis, distinguishing it from closely related microidian pathogens N. paris and N. sp.1, which exclusively invade and replicate in intestine. Comparative genomics revealed Nematida displere as the earliest diverging species of Nematida genus, with over 10% of its proteins belonging to a species-specific family of R-domain proteins potentially mediating host interactions.

**Implications:** This system provides a powerful animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different niches.

**Conclusion:** Our study describes a novel Nematida species microspor infecting C. elegans with distinct characteristics from other species in genus. Nematida displere exhibits broad tissue tropism, infecting and replicating in muscle, neurons, epider, intestine, coelocytes, and seam cells, unlike N. paris, which only infects and replicates in intestine. Whole-genome and phylogen analysis places Nemat displere in Nemat genus, and we name it Nematida displere based on vulva bursting spore mechanism. This discovery presents a unique system in C. elegans to study mechanistic and evolutionary bases of pathogen tropism, with Nemat displere being the first pathogen infecting neurons, muscle, or coelocytes of C. elegans.

**Title:** Chromatin Remodeling by the Cockayne Syndrome Protein B (CS) is Essential for Transcription-Coupled DNA Repair: A New Insights into the Mechanisms of Cockayne Syndrome

**Research Question:** The Cockayne Syndrome B (CS) protein is a crucial for transcription-coupled DNA repair, and mutations in CS are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a devastating disease characterized by premature aging, sensitivity, and neurological and developmental defects. However, the extent to which CS remodels chromatin and whether this activity is utilized in repair is unknown.

**Methods:** We used in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize CS's chromatin remodeling activity and dissect the functions of CS in transcription-cou DNA repair. We demonstrate that CS repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner and this activity is greatly enhanced by N1-like histone chaper, which we identify as new CS-binding partners. By mapping domains and analyzing CS derivatives, we show that chromatin remodeling by combined activities CS and N1-like chaper is required for efficient transcription-cou repair.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that histone chaper can cooperate with ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers to increase efficiency of nucleosome repositioning by remodelers. Moreover, we show that chromatin and repair mediated by CS are separable activities. The collaboration between CS and N1-like histone chaper adds new dimension to understanding of how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaper regulate chrom structure.

**Implications:** Our study provides new insights into functions of chrom remodeling CS in transcriptionou DNA as well as mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome. The enhancement of CS-mediated chromatin by N1-like histone chaper adds new dimension to understanding of how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaper collaborate. Histone chaper have been found to function with ATP-dependent chromatin remodel in exchange histone and histone variants as well as chrom assembly (ACF, CH1) and disassembly (SC) [8, 16, 17, 37].

**Conclusions:** CS has two separable functions in transcriptionou DNA: one is protein recruitment that is independent nucleosome remodeling. Diminished activity is not due to CSΔ1-nucleosome interaction, as ATP assays revealed CS1 and CS interacted nucleosome equally. Together, results indicate residues of CS are critical for N1 histone chaper interaction and ATP-dependent chromatin activity.

**Title:** Mapping Epigenetic Variation in the Human Genome: Unveiling the Complex Interplay between Genetic and Environmental Factors

**Research Question:** What is the nature of epigenetic variation in the human genome, and how do genetic and environmental factors contribute to this variation?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation patterns in five purified human cell types, identifying hundreds of genomic loci with high epigenetic polymorphism, termed Variably Methyl Regions (VMRs). We observed that VMRs preferentially occur at enhancers and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and are enriched for CpGs that influence gene expression.

**Findings:** The majority of VMRs have high heritability, but a subset of VMs within the genome show low heritability, forming co-regulated networks that differ between cell types and are enriched for transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. For example, in T cells, we defined a network of 95 co-regulated VMs enriched for genes in T-cell activation; in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-reg VM comprising four HO gene clusters for growth control; in neurons, a network of 18 VMs for synaptic signaling. Culturing genetically-identical fibroblasts under varying conditions, we experimentally demonstrated that some VM networks are responsive to environment, with methylation at loci changing in a coordinated fashion dependent on growth.

**Implications:** Our study provides a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome, showing both genetic and environmental underlie this variation. We show that VMs co-localize with functional features, are enriched for CpGs that influence expression, and provide evidence that epetic variability at some loci is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. We also show that VMs form cis and trans-regulated networks for transcription factor sites and cell-type functions. Unexpectedly, we found many VMs co-regulated both in cis and trans, with methylation levels varying in a coordinated fashion.

**Conclusions:** Our results provide novel insights into the biology of methylation across the genome, highlighting the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. Consistent with the notion that the epigen represents a link between genome and environment, we demonstrate environmental effects on methylation VM using cultured fibblasts, revealing signatures overlapping with population datasets. Our study contributes to understanding the dynamic nature of methylation and its role in regulating gene expression.

**Title:** Evaluation of the Performance of a Newly Developed Panbio Dengue Early Rapid Test for the Detection of Dengue Virus Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) in Combination with IgM/Ig Rapid Test for Enhanced Acute Dengue Diagnosis

**Research Question:** Can the newly developed Panbio Deng Early test improve the sensitivity of acute deng diagnosis when used in combination with a commercial Ig/Ig rapid test?

**Methods:** A retrospective study was conducted in Vietnam with 198 laboratory-confirmed positive and 100 negative samples, and in Malaysia with 263 laboratory-confirmed and 30 samples. The performance of the Deng Early test was evaluated alone and in combination with the Ig/Ig test.

**Findings:** In Vietnam, the sensitivity and specificity of the Deng Early test were 69.2% (95% CI: 62.8 to 75.6) and 96% (95 CI 92.2 to 98.8), respectively. In Malaysia, the performance was similar with 68.9 sensitivity (95 CI 61.8 to 76.1) and 96.7 specificity ( CI 82.8 to 99.9) compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, when the Deng test was used in combination with the Ig test, sensitivity increased to 93%.

**Implications:** Using deng NS antigen detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein Ig and Ig serology significantly increases the sensitivity of acuteeng diagnosis and extends the window of detection to include early samples.

**Conclusion:** The Panbio Deng Early is a sensitive and specific test for deng NS. When used with Ig rapid, a significant increase in sensitivity for acuteeng was observed, with the benefit of extended detection window. This analytical translated to good performance in a clinical setting with sensitivity and specificity comparable to other available NS rapid tests in the same region. Optimal sensitivity for acuteeng was achieved when NS testing was combined with Ig and Ig detection, with significant increase compared to individual markers.

**Title:** Predicting Functional RNA Structures in Vivo: A Comparative Approach with Trans

**Research Question:** How do evolutionarily related RNA molecules fold in vivo, and can we develop a computational method to predict their structural features in vivo?

**Methods:** We developed a novel computational method, Trans, which detects conserved helices of statistical significance, and evaluated its performance on a comprehensive dataset of reference structures, including pseudo-knotted and alternative configurations. Trans also identifies unstructured subsequences bound by molecules and provides evidence for new helices that may define folding pathways.

**Findings:** Trans accurately predicts structural features of reference structures, including pseudo-kotted ones, and alternative configurations, and identifies unstructured subsequences bound by molecules. The method highlights conserved features and does not require detailed knowledge of cellular environment. Unlike existing methods, Trans works in a comparative way, not predicting function over time, but highlighting conserved features.

**Implications:** Our results support the notion that homologous sequence not only assumes similar RNA structure but also folds similarly. The predicted features by Trans differ from thermodynamic equilibrium, unlike existing methods. This comparative approach has the advantage of highlighting conserved features and not requiring detailed knowledge of cellular environment.

**Conclusions:** We propose a conceptually new computational approach for studying RNA folding in vivo. Our method, Trans, detects conserved helices of statistical significance and predicts structural features of reference structures, including pseudo-kotted and alternative configurations. Unlike existing methods, Trans works in comparative, not predicting function over time, but highlighting conserved features. The predictions by Trans will enable systematic studies of RNA pathways and structural configurations and provide input to design and interpretation of future experiments.

**Title:** Elucidating the Regulatory Mechanisms of Plant Immunity: A Systems-Level Analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana Response to Flagellin-22 (flg22)

**Research Question:** How does the plant immune network mediate inducible immunity in the face of pathogenic perturbations, and what are the regulatory mechanisms underlying this resilience?

**Methods:** We employed a network reconstitution strategy, disassembling and reassembling the plant immune network that mediates Pattern-Triggered-Immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis thalian, to resolve systems-level mechanisms of the transcriptome response to the immune stimulant flagellin-22 (fl22).

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed widespread interactions among sub-networks (sectors) in the fl22-responsive transcriptome, many of which result in buffering. Regulatory mechanisms show unexpected patterns of control by jasmonate (JA), ethylene (ET), phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD), and salicylate (SA) signaling on transcriptional response to fl22. Notably, these mechanisms were not detectable by traditional single-gene null-mut analysis.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of a systems approach, network reconstitution, to elucidate dynamical functions of the plant immune network. High-order perturbation at scale signaling and transcriptional profiling decipher regulation of a complex network, the plant immune network. Network reconstitution is a powerful tool to reveal mechanisms underlying function of a biological network, especially resilient against perturbations.

**Conclusions:** The Arabidopsis thalian network mediating fl22-PT is controlled by four sub-networks: SA, JA, ET, ET, and PAD sectors. Despite lack of response in single and double mutant genotypes, these genes are key players in immunity, regulated by network, responding strongly to stimulus fl22, and buffered from pathogenic perturbations. Our work shows that network reconstitution can reveal dynamical functions of a complex network, highly resilient against perturbations. In plants lacking adaptive immunity, a buffered signaling network confers resilience against perturbations, as pathogen effectors target and disable immune proteins. Buffering conceals identity of components: when a component disabled, network compensates for loss.

**Title:** Genetic Regulation of Neuroepithelial Patterning in the Drosophila Optic Plac: A Model of Combinatorial Action of Extrinsic and Intrinsic Factors

**Research Question:** How do extrinsic and intrinsic factors control neural patterning in the Dophila optic plac, leading to the segregation of larval eye and opticobe precursors, and specification of primary and secondary photoreceptor (PR) precursors?

**Methods:** We investigated the genetic mechanisms of neuroepith patterning in the Dophila optic plac during embryogenesis, focusing on the specification of larval eye and opticobe precursors, and primary and secondary PR precursors. We analyzed the expression patterns of transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways, including Notch and Hedgehog, and their interactions with proneural factor Aton (A) and orphan receptor Tailless (T).

**Findings:** Our results show that A specifies larval precursors, while T is crucial for opticobe specification. Not and Hedgehog signaling act upstream of A and T to coordinate precursor specification in a timely manner. The spatial placement of the boundary between A and T is required to control the number of primary and secondary precursors. Not signaling also controls binary cell fate, acting in a cascade of transcription interactions to define PR subtype identity.

**Implications:** Our study provides a model of combinatorial action of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in neural patterning, highlighting the importance of spatial and temporal regulation of transcriptional and signaling pathways in the Dila optic plac.

**Conclusions:** The Dila optic plac exhibits unique neuroepith pattering, with segregation of lar eye and optic precursors during embryogenesis. We identified genetic mechanisms controlling early and late steps specifying PR versus non- cell fate, ensuring expression of precursor determinants. Our findings provide a link to subsequent PR subtype specification. The overlapping patterns of A and T in the plac mark domains giving rise to lar precursors (A) and optic primordium (T). During embryonic development, the Dila plac produces lar PR and prec of opticobe. We mapped expression of proteins in subregions of the plac to establish the boundary between these groups. Not and H signaling define PR and non-domains of lar eye and optic primium. Our results support a new model of subdivision of precursor domains.

**Title:** Unveiling the Multifaceted Mechanisms of Human β-Defensin 1 (hBD1): A Ubiquitous Endogenous Antimicrobial Peptide with Distinct Oxidized and Reduced Forms

**Research Question:** How does human β-defensin 1 (hBD), a ubiquitously expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide, exhibit qualitatively distinct activities between its oxidized and reduced forms, and what are the underlying mechanisms of its antimicrobial action?

**Methods:** We employed electron microscopy and transmigration assays to investigate the antimicrobial mechanisms of hBD. We treated bacteria with reduced and oxidized forms of hBD and observed the formation of a net-like structure surrounding bacteria using electron microscopy. Transmigration assays demonstrated that hBD-derived nets capture and inhibit bacterial transmigration independent of bacterial killing.

**Findings:** Electron microscopy revealed a net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with the reduced but not oxid form of hBD. Transmigration assays showed that hBD-derived nets capture and inhibit bacterial transmigration independent of killing. The presence of nets completely prevented migration of h1-resistant pathogens and were stable in the presence of human duodenal secretion with high amount of proteases. In contrast, cysteines were necessary for net formation. Redox function served as an additional mechanism of action for hBD, differing from net formation by other defens such as human-derived α-defin 6 (HD).

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the multifaceted mechanisms of hBD, providing distinct killing and killing-independent antimicrobial activities. The reduced form of hBD entraps bacteria in extracellular structures preventing invasion. Understanding the modes of action of endogenous peptides will aid in developing new antimicrobial strategies.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the contrast between conventional antibiotics, primarily bacterial origin, and endogenous host molecules like hBD, providing multifunctional activities, including antimicrobial mechanisms from a single peptide. Post-translationally, hBD forms distinct structures controlled by local environment. The TR system transforms oxidized hBD into reduced peptide forms (S Fig. 2). Unlike hBDox, only hBD entraps bacteria, a previously unknown mechanism. Reduced hBD nets entraps bacteria preventing translocation independent killing, distinct from HD6 formation, indicating broad evolutionarily conserved mechanisms.

**Title:** OCRL Deficiency Impairs Endocytosis in the Zebraf Pronephric Tub, a Model for Mammalian Renal Tubulopathy

**Research Question:** What is the underlying basis for the renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2, characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of OCRL in endocytic trafficking in the zebraf pronephric tub, a model for mammalian renal tubule.

**Findings:** OCRL deficiency impairs endocyt in the zraf pronephric tub, coinciding with reduced levels of megal and accumulation in endytic compartments, consistent with reduced recycling within the endytic pathway. We also observed reduced numbers of early endytic compartments and enlarged vacuolar endosomes in the subapical region of proneph cells. Cell polarity within the proneph tub is unaffected in mutant embryos. OCRL-deficient embryos exhibit mild ciliogenesis, but this cannot account for observed endocyt defect. Catalytic activity of OCRL is required for renalular endyt and endytic defect can be rescued by suppression of P5K.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that OCRL is required for endytic trafficking in vivo, supporting the hypothesis that endytic defects are responsible for renalulopathy in Lowe and Dent disease. Moreover, our results reveal P5 as a potential therapeutic target for Lowe syndrome and Dent disease.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first evidence that OCRL regulates endytic trafficking in vivo and supports the hypothesis that endytic defects cause renalopathy in Lowe and Dent disease. Our results reveal a role for OCRL in endytic recycling in the proximal tub. Strikingly, suppression of P5b in OCRL-deficient embryos restores endyt to wild-type levels, indicating that Ptd(4,5)2 is critical for endytic trafficking in the tub.

**Title:** Post-Epidemic Transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus in Livestock in the Kilbero Valley, Tanzania: A Cross-Sectional Sero-Survey

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the presence and determinants of interepid Rift Valley Fever (RV) transmission in an area experiencing annual flooding in southern Tanzania, specifically in the Kilbero Valley.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in randomly selected cattle and sheep in the Kilbero Valley from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2007 RV outbreak in Tanzania. Exposure to RV virus (RV) was determined using commercial ELISA kits detecting IgM and Ig antibodies in serum. Information about determinants was obtained through structured interviews with herd owners.

**Findings:** An overall seroprevalence of 11.3% (n=168) was recorded; 5.5% in animals born after 2007 RV outbreak and 22.7 in present during outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in post-epid annual cohorts. Nine ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVV Ig antibodies indicating recent infection. Spatial distribution of serreval exhibited hotspots. Difference in serreval in born previous was not significant (6.1% vs.4.6 for females and males, p=0.158) whereas was in present (26.0 vs.7.8 for females and males, p<0.001). Animals >15 from flood were more likely to have than those <5 (OR 1.92; CI 1.04-3.56).

**Implications:** These findings indicate post-epid transmission of RVV in the study area. Linear in serreval in postid cohorts implies constant exposure and presence of active transmission preceding survey.

**Conclusion:** This study provides baseline information on exposure to RV in livestock during interid period and assesses relationship between RV seros, animal and environmental factors. Interid transmissions generally undetected but can be revealed through active surveillance in livestock or human populations. RV is a viral zoonosis affecting livestock and wild animals.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of the Contractile Vacuole Complex in Glycosphosphatidylinositol-Anchored Protein Trafficking and Host Invasion by Trypanosoma cruzi

**Research Question:** How does the contractile vacuole complex (CVC) contribute to the trafficking of glycosphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane of Trypanosoma cruzi and promote host invasion?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the role of VC in the trafficking of GPI-anch proteins to the plasma membrane of T. cruzi and its impact on host invasion. We generated a dominant-negative (DN) mutant of Trypanosoma cruz Rab11 (TR11) tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), which localized to the cytosol, while the wild-type TR localized to the VC. Epimastigotes expressing the mutant were less responsive to hyposotic and hyperosotic stress, but still differentiated into metacyc forms and infected host cells.

**Findings:** GPI-anch transialase (TTS), mucins of 60-200 kDa, and trypastigote surface antigen (TSS II) co-localized with GFP-TR11 to the VC during transformation of intramastigotes into trypastigotes. Muc of gp/50 also co-localized with VC during metacgenesis. Parasites expressing GFP-TR11 prevented TS, but not other proteins, from reaching the plasma, and were less infective compared to wild-type cells. Incubation of mutants with exogenous recombinant active, but not inactive TS, and sialic donor before infecting host cells partially rescued infectivity of trypastigotes.

**Implications:** Our results reveal the role of TR in osmoregulation and trafficking of TS to the plasma, the role of TS in promoting infection, and a novel mechanism of GPIanch protein secretion. The VC, enriched in lipidraft structures, mediates the unconventional transport of TS to the surface of eukotic cells. TS, a GPIanch protein, catalyzes the transfer of sial acid from host to parasite mucins.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest a novel mechanism of GPIanch protein transport to the surface of eukotic cells. The VC plays a crucial role in the trafficking of TS, a GPIanch protein, to the plasma membrane of T. cruz, which is essential for host invasion. This study provides new insights into the biology of T. cruzi and its interaction with host cells.

**Title:** A Phase III Clinical Trial Evaluating the Immunogenicity and Safety of a Purified-Chick Embryo Rabies Vaccine (PCV) Administered According to a Shortened-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) 4/1-Week Intradermal Regimen Compared to the Recommended 2-Site Thai Cross (TR) Regimen

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the immunogenic and safety of a purified chick-embryo rabies vaccine (PCV) administered according to a shortened-exposure prophylaxis (PE) 4/1-week intrader regimen compared to the recommended 2-site Thai Cross (TR) regimen in healthy individuals ≥1 year of age.

**Methods:** This controlled, open-label, multi-center trial (NCT02132) enrolled 443 participants into four groups to receive intradermal PCV according to one of two regimens, with or without rabies immunoglobulin (HR) administration at the first visit in adults. Rab virus-neutralizing antibody (RV) concentrations and percentages of participants with RV concentrations ≥ 0.5 IU/mL were assessed up to day (D) 365 post-vaccination.

**Findings:** Noninferiority of the 4-site/1 regimen to the 2/TR regimen was demonstrated at D49, with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in percentage of participants with RV concentrations >5%. Of 443 participants receiving the 4/1 regimen, 88 received HR, while 442 received the 2/TR (with HR). All achieved RV concentrations by D14. At49, the difference in percentage with RV concentrations between 4/1 and 2/TR was -1 (95CI -2.4-0; thus, noninferior was concluded. RV geometric mean concentrations were 18 IU/mL in 4/ groups and 12/mL in 2/TR at14, and declined in all. RV concentrations were lower with HR administration than without.

**Implications:** The 4/1 regimen might be an alternative to current recommendations, with benefits in terms of cost-efficiency and compliance vaccination.

**Conclusion:** This study suggests that the 4/1 regimen is noninfer to the 2/TR in terms of percentages with RV concentrations 0.5 IU at D49, elicited responses at D14, and declined to D365. Concentrations were lower with conitant HR administration than without HR, confirming previous observations.

**Title:** Unveiling the Dynamic Functional Architecture of the Salience Network: A Hub for Flexible Interactions in the Human Brain

**Research Question:** How does the salience network (SN), anchored in the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex, facilitate flexible detection of goal-relevant events and access to cognitive resources in the human brain?

**Methods:** We leveraged high-resolution multisession fMRI data from the Humanome Project and novel graph-theoretical techniques to investigate the spatiotemporal organization of the SN. We analyzed dynamic interactions among 264 distributed brain regions implicated in various cognitive paradigms.

**Findings:** Our results reveal distinctive and robust properties of the SN: (1) high flexibility in time-vary connectivity with frontopetal network (FPN), culateopular (CON), and ventral dorsal attention (VAN) networks; (2) spatially varied dynamic interactions; (3) consistently high network centrality, indicating a hub for cross-network interactions; (4) unique timeary profiles distinct from prefrontal control systems; and (5) temporal flexibility predicting individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These findings were replicated in a second dataset, demonstrating robustness.

**Implications:** Our study provides fundamental insights into the dynamic architecture of the SN, demonstrating its unique position to facilitate interactions with multiple systems and support a wide range of cognitive processes in the brain. The SN's spatiemporal organization is characterized by high flexibility, diversity, and centrality, distinct from other control systems, including FPN, DAN, and VAN.

**Conclusions:** Our findings support the triple-network model and reveal a previously unknown spatiemporal organization underlying the SN's ability to flexibly engage diverse brain regions. Analysis of timeary functional connectivity offers novel insights into brain dynamics, but little is known about the SN and cognitive systems' links to flexible behaviors. This study highlights the SN's crucial role in facilitating cross-network interactions and supporting various cognitive processes.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of VP4 in the Release of Non-Enveloped Viruses: A Novel Insights into the Mechanism of SV40 Viral Egress

**Research Question:** What is the role of the late-expressed protein VP4 in the release of non-envelop viruses, specifically SV40, and how does it interact with cellular membranes to facilitate viral egress?

**Methods:** VP4, a newly identified SV40 gene product, was expressed as a GST-fusion protein in bacteria and purified. Its membrane-binding and membrane-disrupting activities were characterized using various assays, including flotation and release of fluorescent markers from liposomes. The hydrophobic domain of VP4 was essential for these activities, which were optimal at 37°C and neutral pH in the presence of calcium.

**Findings:** VP4 efficiently bound and permeabilized bovine red blood cells (RBCs), with the hydrophobic domain required for these activities. Disruption of liposomes by VP demonstrated a preference for membranes composed of lipids similar to those of plasma and nuclear membranes. Disruption of RBC and permissive SV40 host (Cos7) cells by VP resulted in formation of ∼3 nm pores, consistent with VP causing lysis of infected cells.

**Implications:** These results support a central role for VP as a viropin in perforating cellular membranes to trigger SV40 release, a poorly understood process in nonvelop viral egress. Efficient release of viral particles by cell lysis ensures spread of the virus.

**Conclusions:** VP, a late-expressed SV40 protein, plays a crucial role in the release of non-envelop viruses, specifically SV40, by interacting with and disrupting cellular membranes. The hydroobic domain of VP is essential for this activity, which is optimal at 37°C and neutral pH in the presence of calcium. Disruption of membranes by VP results in formation of ∼3 nm pores in mammalian cells, including permissive SV host. These findings are consistent with VP causing lysis of infected cells, supporting the poorly understood process of nonvelop viral release.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses in Dengue Virus Protection Mediated by a DNA Vaccine Encoding the NS1 Antigen

**Background:** Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions, with no antiviral or vaccine available, affecting half of the global population at risk of infection. Understanding the immune response against DENV is crucial for vaccine development.

**Research Question:** What is the contribution of humoral and cellular responses elicited by a DNA vaccine encoding the NS1 antigen (pcANS1) in protection against DENV?

**Methods:** We immunized Balb mice with pcANS and challenged with DENV2. We measured anti-NS antibodies, T cell responses, and CD4+ and CD8 T cell activation, IF-γ production, and cytotoxic activity.

**Findings:** pcANS induced robust protection against DENV, with considerable anti-NS antibodies and T responses. Passive immunization with anti-NS antibodies conferred partial protection at low viral load (4 LD50), abated at high dose (40 LD). pcANS also activated CD+ and CD+ T cells, with IF-γ production and cytotoxic activity by CD+ T. Depletion CD+ cells abolished protection, while transfer of CD+ cells with anti-1 antiserum from vaccinated mice showed similar survival rates to pcANS-immunized.

**Implications:** The immune response to NS antigen by pcANS requires cooperation between CD+ cells and humoral immunity.

**Conclusion:** Our study highlights the importance of both humoral and cellular responses in DENV protection mediated by NS antigen. Effective protection was not achieved with antibodies or T cells alone, but their combination. CD+ cells play a critical role in protection. Our findings provide insights into DENV immunity and prospects for vaccine development.

**Title:** Elucidating the Structure-Function Relationship of the Transcription Factor ComR, a Novel Member of the RNPP Family, in Streptococcus thermophilus

**Research Question:** How does the transcription factor ComR, a member of the RNPP family, regulate competence for natural transformation in Streptoccus thermus, and what is the molecular mechanism of its activation?

**Methods:** Crystal structure analysis of ComR from Streptoccus thermus combined with mutational analysis and in vivo assays were used to elucidate the structure-function relationship of ComR.

**Findings:** Com is directly activated by the binding of its pheromone X, the mature form of the Com/X-inducing-peptide ComS, which induces the release of the sequestered HTH domain and dimerization to DNA binding. This mechanism is conserved and specific to Com orthologs, demonstrating that Com is not an R protein as initially proposed, but a new member of the RNPP family. Identification of X and Com residues important for activation constitutes a crucial step towards designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges in Streoccus.

**Implications:** This study proposes a molecular mechanism of Com activation and offers opportunities to engineer well-controlled peptide-based systems in Streoccus and Gram-positive bacteria. This is the first report of a peptide-mediated control of a transcription regulator by sequestration of its DNA domain.

**Conclusions:** Com is a novel member of the RNPP family that regulates competence in Streoccus thermus, activated by the binding of its pherone X. The molecular mechanism of activation involves the release of the sequest H domain and dimerization to DNA, conserved and specific to Com orthologs. Identification of X and Com residues for activation is crucial for designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges in Streoccus.

**Title:** Functional Characterization of the Pentameric Ligand-Gated Ion Channel EL through Electrophysiology and X-ray Crystallography

**Research Question:** What are the agonists that activate the pentameric ligated ion channel EL, and how do they interact with the protein to induce channel activation, and what are the ion conduction properties of EL?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography to investigate the functional characterization of EL. A library of molecules were selected based on the chemical features of the lig binding site, and a ligand was located in a crystal structure. Functional properties of the channel were characterized by electrophys.

**Findings:** EL is activated by a class of primary amines, including neurotransmitter GABA at high to millimolar concentrations. Ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that desitize over time. EL forms cation channels with properties resembling nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Single channel conductance and comparably simple behavior make EL an attractive system to study mechanisms of ionduction and gating in this family of neurotransmitter receptors.

**Implications:** This study identifies agonists of EL, locates a ligand in crystal, and characterizes functional properties of the channel, providing insight into mechanisms of activation and ionduction in this family of receptors.

**Conclusions:** EL is activated by primary amines, including alkamines, aminothols, aminocoh, bromamines, and diamines, and neurotransmitter GABA. The conserved binding site is large enough to accommodate different ligands, but interaction with protein likely stronger, fulfilling requirement for lig activation. Ion conduction properties of EL closely related to nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin, and glycine receptors. EL is cation selective, impermeable to anions. Crystal structure of EL shows non-conduct conformation in absence of ligands, relationship to resting or desitized state unknown.

**Title:** The Role of Thymic Stromal Lymphopoietin (TSL) in the Progression from Atopic Dermatitis to Asthma: A Novel Insights into the "Atopic March"

**Research Question:** What is the underlying mechanism of the progression from atopic dermatitis (AD) to asthma, also known as the "atopic march", and how can it be prevented?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSL), a cytokine overexpressed by skin keratinocytes, in the development of asthma in mice with skin-barrier defects and AD-like inflammation.

**Findings:** We found that mice with skin-bar defects and AD-like inflammation are susceptible to allergic asthma, and that TSL is the systemic driver of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Mice with keratin-specific deletion of RBP, which sustained high levels of T, developed a severe asthm phenotype upon antigen challenge. Elimination of T signaling in these animals blocked the atopic march, demonstrating that high T levels are required to sensitize the lung to allergic inflammation.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that in addition to early treatment of primary skin-barrier defects, selective inhibition of T may be key to blocking development of asthma in AD patients.

**Conclusions:** We propose that skin can act as a signaling organ, driving susceptibility to allergic inflammation in another organ (lung) by releasing T, and that high availability of T can sensitize lung to allergens, providing a novel mechanism for the atopic.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genomic Features of Thermotoga maritima: A Hyperthermophilic Bacterium through Multi-omics and Bioinformatics Integration**

**Research Question:** How can the integration of multi-omics datasets and bioinformatics tools elucidate the genomic features of Thermot marima, a phylogenetically deep-branching, hyperthermophilic bacterium?

**Methods:** We employed a comprehensive approach combining whole-genome sequencing, transcription start site (TSS) determination, transcriptome, and proteome profiling to generate datasets, which were analyzed with bioinformatics tools to improve gene annotation, elucidate transcription units (TUs), identify putative non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and determine promoters and ribosome binding sites.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed distinctive properties of T. marima genome relative to other bacteria, including a high number of genes per TU (3.3), paucity of putative ncRNAs (12), and few TUs with multiple SS (3.7%). Quantitative analysis of promoters and ribosome sites showed increased conservation relative to other. 5'UTRs exhibited atypical bimodal distribution of "short"5'UTs (11-17) and "common5'UTs (26-32). Transcription regulation was limited by lack of intergenic space for majority TUs. A high fraction of annotated genes were expressed independently of growth and linear mRNA/protein observed (Pearson r=0.63, p<2.2×10-16-test).

**Implications:** These properties are hypothesized to reflect the organism's hypermophilic lifestyle and yield insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on earth.

**Conclusions:** This multi-omics and bioinformatics approach provides a valuable resource to the research community and facilitates quantitative comparative analysis of annotated features across microbial species. For T. marima, several characteristics were identified and their causal factors discussed. The integrated approach enables experimentally anchored annotation of several genomic features, including protein-coding genes, functional RNAs, nonoding RNAs, transcription units (T), promoters, ribosome sites (BS), and regulatory sites such as transcription factor (TF) binding, 5' and 3 untranslated (UTRs) and intergenic regions.

**Future Directions:** This methodology is applicable to many microbial species. Applying to the genome of T.ima revealed it has distinctive compared other organisms. Genome-scale analysis showed Tima encodes highly conserved, robust architecture ensuring transcription initiation.

**Title:** Contextual Influences on Visual Perception: A Bayesian Model of Inference and the Role of Cortical Areas Beyond Primary Visual Cortex

**Research Question:** How does contextual information influence the perception of visual features, specifically the presence or absence of a target bar at a known orientation at the center of a display, given weak or zero contrast at the target location with or without context of other bars?

**Methods:** Observers judged a briefly presented stimulus whether a target bar of known orientation was present at the center of a display with weak or zero contrast at the target location or without context of other bars. Results showed that observers were more likely to perceive a target when context had weaker rather than stronger contrast. High-contrast contextual bars, regardless of grouping with target, biased observers to perceive no target, while low-contrast contextual bars aligned with target biased to perceive target, even with zero contrast in input.

**Findings:** Our data suggest that context influences perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief that target should be present according to visual grouping principles and (2) biasing observers' model of likely contrasts caused by target. A Bayesian model of visual inference accounts for data, illustrating that context does not influence perceived contrast despite influence on bias to perceive target presence, suggesting cortical areas beyond primary cortex responsible for inferences.

**Implications:** This study is one of the first to investigate how context biases perception of visual inputs using simple stimuli familiar in psychophysical and physiological studies. Perception of presence or absence of target at known orientation at central location with low or zero contrast, in context of other stimuli. Filling-in bias stronger when contextual have weaker contrasts and target seen more likely group with context as straight. Findings unexpected from facilitation on sensitivities can be accounted by Bayesian decision model, whether target or noise is cause luminance at target location in input. This yes-no task assess bias to infer target, even contrast missing in image.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals how bias depends on contextual, Bayesian can explain data, and model enabled show no facilitation or suppression of contrast in visual task. Model parameters and σ reflect brain's internal world and encoding.

**Title:** The Paradoxical Role of Defectors in Promoting Cooperation in Structured Populations

**Research Question:** How do defectors, individuals that exploit common goods without contributing fairly, contribute to the persistence of cooperation in structured populations?

**Methods:** We employed an individual-based model of stochastic birth, death, migration, and mutation events to investigate the dynamics of cooperation in populations with defectors and cooperators.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, our results show that defectors can lead to conditions that rescue cooperation from defector-induced destruction. We identified three mechanisms by which this occurs: (1) during defector-induced population collapse, defectors occasionally go extinct before cooperators by chance, allowing cooperators to grow; (2) empty locations, either pre-existing or created by defector-induced extinction, favor cooperation as they allow cooperator but not def migrants to grow; and (3) resource limitation, induced by defectors, selects for adaptive mutations to limitation, favoring cooperation.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that small population sizes, precipitated by defectors, provide a "built-in" mechanism for the persistence of cooperation in structured populations. This is because defectors increase heterogeneity in population dynamics, reducing the likelihood of simultaneous extinction. Additionally, selection for rare mutants adapted to limitation, induced by def, introduces another bottleneck, facilitating survival of cooperation when defectors are initially present. These factors generate variation in cooperator frequency across metapopulations, promoting cooperation.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a counterintuitive role of defectors in promoting cooperation in structured populations. Unlike deterministic models, which predict synchronous extinction of cooperation in all locations, our results show that defectors can rescue cooperation through three mechanisms: (1) def-induced collapse, (2) empty locations created by extinction, and (3) resource limitation. This highlights the importance of considering stochasticity and heterogeneity in understanding cooperation dynamics.

**Title:** Opportunistic Pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa Exploits Altered Epithelial Barriers through Apoptotic Cell Tropism and Efferocytosis**

**Research Question:** How does the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aerugin interact with and infect epithelial cells, particularly in the context of altered epithelial barriers?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between Pseudas aerugin and epithelial cells, focusing on the role of apoptotic cells and efferocytosis in infection.

**Findings:** We found that Pseud aerugin adheres to apoptotic cells at multi-cell junctions, independent of cell death type, and is internalized through efferytosis by surrounding epithelial cells. Intracellularly, P aerugin inhabits an eocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features and is killed.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that P aerugin elimination through eocytosis is part of a host defense mechanism. In healthy individuals, apoptotic cells are quickly removed, preventing P aer colonization. However, contexts favoring dead cells may offer an opportunity for aer colonization.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the ability of epithelial cells to eliminate P aer through eocytosis, which could be part of a defense mechanism. We speculate that apoptotic cells with aer associated surface could be targets for professional phagocytes. While some bacteria may escape, our findings emphasize the role of eocyt in host defense.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of the Hedgehog Signaling Pathway in Primordial Germ Cell Migration during Drosophila Embryogenesis

**Research Question:** How does the hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway, specifically the shifted (sh) gene, contribute to the migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) to somatic gonadal precursors (SGs) during Drosila embryogenesis?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to investigate the role of sh in PGC migration. We examined the expression of sh in the gonadal mesoderm and found that it is required for PGC migration. Additionally, we demonstrated that the production of the P attractant by SGs and other tissues depends on sh as well as another hh gene, g1. Furthermore, we showed that ectopic expression of hcr in the nervous system promotes the release and transmission of H-ligand from these cells into the underlying mesermal layer, where it can contact migrating PGs.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that sh plays a crucial role in PGC migration by facilitating the long-distance transmission of H through the proteoglycan matrix. We also found that potentiation of H by hcr depends on cholesterol modification. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of PGC migration and the role of the hh pathway in this process.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of the hh pathway in PGC migration and the role of sh in facilitating long-distance signaling. These findings have implications for understanding the development and patterning of the embryonic ectoderm, particularly the role of attractants produced by SGs in guiding PGs.

**Conclusions:** The hedgehog signaling pathway, specifically the shifted gene, is essential for the migration of primordial germ cells to somatic gonadal precursors during Dros embryogenesis. Our results demonstrate that sh facilitates long-distance transmission of H through the proteogcan matrix and that potentiation of H by hcr depends on cholesterol modification. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of PGC migration and the role of the hh pathway in this process, and have implications for understanding the development and patterning of the embryonic ecterm.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of HIV Immune Control: Enhanced Cytotoxic Capacity of HIV-Specific CD8+ T Cells in Vaccine Recipients and Long-Term Non-Progressors

**Research Question:** Understanding the mechanisms underlying immune control of HIV replication is crucial for the development of effective vaccine strategies. We investigated the cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in vaccine recipients of a replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad) HIV-1 recombinant vaccine and compared it to HIV-negative and chronically infected individuals, including long-term non-progressors (LTNP).

**Methods:** We measured granzyme B target activity and HIV-1-infected CD4 T-cell elimination in samples from vaccine recipients, HIV-negative individuals, and chronically infected individuals, including LTNP.

**Findings:** We observed detectable HIV-specific CD8 T recall responses in vaccinees at a median 331 days post-immunization, which did not correlate with the number of vaccinations or cytokine-secreting T cells. The cytotoxic capacity of CD8 T cells in vaccinees was less than LTNP but overlapped with progressors. However, significantly higher cytotoxic responses were observed in recipients carrying HLA class I alleles B*27, B57, or B58, associated with immune control of HIV replication in chronic infection.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that HLA I alleles may lead to better outcomes in chronic infection and immunization due to efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8 T cytotoxic responses.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to measure cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8 T cells in response to autologous HIV-infected CD4 T targets in vaccine recipients. Our results indicate that cytotoxic directly correlates with proliferative capacity and expression of cytotoxic proteins within cytotoxic granules. HIV-specific CD8 T cytotoxic responses in vaccine recipients were distinguishable from HIV-negative and LTNP but comparable to progressors. Higher cytotoxic responses were observed in vaccinees carrying HLA I B27, B57, or B58 alleles, associated with immune control of HIV replication in chronic infection.

**Title:** Modeling the Co-Evolution of Intentional Behavior and Cumulative Culture: A Unified Mechanism for the Emergence of Shared Intentions and Collaborative Behavior in Humans

**Research Question:** How did the evolution of humans' unique cognitive abilities, particularly the ability to engage in jointly intentional behavior, emerge and interact with technological advancements in culture?

**Methods:** This study formally models the coevolution of intentional behavior and cumulative culture, demonstrating that rapid technological advancements are linked to the emergence of collaborative behavior, and conversely, in the absence of opportunities for significant cultural improvement, the ability to undertake intentional behavior is selected against.

**Findings:** Our results show that individuals with the ability to share intentions can adjust their strategy in tandem with neighbors to mutual benefit, leading to faster convergence to improved technological norms. We derive a unified mechanism for the emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a potential cause for inter-species diversity in prevalence of such behavior.

**Implications:** The findings support the "shared intentionality hypothesis" or Vygotskian intelligence, suggesting collaborative behavior amongst early hominins facilitated development of modern cognitive abilities. The emergence of shared intentions at time of technological advance is consistent with composite manufacture evolving contemporaneously with grammatical language, facilitating intentional behavior. This concords the "cultural hypothesis, suggesting socially learned culture affected evolution of traits.

**Conclusions:** This is the first paper to formally model the evolution of ability to undertake intentional behavior, showing under what conditions it likely emerges. Collaborative sharing alters strategies chosen, not how they are chosen, affecting latter depends on circumstances. We provide a mechanism for the emergence of ubiquitous human trait, ability to undertake intentional, likely in environments with rich coordination problems.

**Title:** Identification of miR-34 and miR449 as Essential MicroRNAs Regulating Spermatogenesis and Oligoastoteratoospermia

**Research Question:** What are the roles of microRNAs (mi) in regulating spermatogenesis and the development of oligoastoteratoospermia, a common cause of male infertility in humans?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of miRNAs during spermatogenesis, specifically focusing on the meiotic and post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis. We identified two miRNAs, miR-34 and mi-449, highly expressed in post-meiotic male germ cells and associated with reduced fertility in humans.

**Findings:** Deletion of mi-34 and mi449 loci resulted in oligoastoteratoospermia in mice, characterized by low sperm count, aberrant morphology, and motility. Histological analysis revealed thinning of seminiferous tubules, reduced mature sperm quantity, and aberrant morphology, and immotile spermatozoa.

**Implications:** Our study establishes mi-34 and mi449 as causal factors in oligoastoterospermia, a major cause of male infertility in humans. These miRNAs regulate both meiotic and post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis, fine-tuning gene expression in pachene spermatocytes.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies mi-34 and mi449 as the first functionally important miRNAs in spermatogenesis, whose deregulation leads to oligoastoterospermia and infertility. Loss of these miRN does not block spermatogenesis but impairs developmental transitions, resulting in low sperm count, aberrant morphology, and motility, hallmarks of oligoastoterospermia.

**Title:** Decoupling Antagonistic and Genotoxic Activities of Escherichia coli Niss 191 (Ec) by Targeting the ClP Peptase Domain

**Research Question:** Despite its therapeutic use for over a century, the probiotic properties of Escherichia coli Niss 191 (Ec) remain elusive. Ec produces two siderophore-microins (Mcc) responsible for antagonistic activity against Enterobacteraceae and synthesizes genotoxin colactin encoded by the p island. Colactin is a virulence and putative pro-cinogenic compound. We aimed to decouple antagonistic activity of Ec from genotoxic.

**Methods:** We analyzed a series of ClP mutants to reveal that the transmembrane helices of ClP, not the periplasm peidase domain, are involved in antagonistic activity. A single amino acid substitution in ClP inactivates genotoxic but maintains antagon activity. In an in vivo salmonelis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to wild type, whereas ClP deletion neither protected nor outcompeted pathogen.

**Findings:** ClP-dependent antibacterial effect observed in vitro with other E. coli strains carrying truncated M gene cluster and p island. Siderore-M synthesis required glucosyltransferase IB in salochelin production. This interplay between colact, salochelin, and sider-M biosynthetic pathways suggests genomic islands co-selected and role in E. coli phyroup 2 evolution.

**Implications:** Co-evolution in Ec illustrates fine between pathogenic and probiotic activity and need to address effectiveness and safety of probiotics. Decoupling antagonistic from genotoxic by inactivating ClP peid opens way to safe use Ec.

**Conclusions:** Ec ClP-dependent antibacterial activity due siderore-M. Biosynthetic pathway of colact and secondary metabolites directly or indirectly by p/cl island specifically abrogated genotoxic colact. Mutants inhibited growth pathogenic bacteria while producing secondary metabolites. Decoupled antibacterial from genotoxic opening way to optimize Ec.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Nucleotide Sugar Transporters in Cryptocococcal Glycan Biosynthesis and Pathogenesis

**Research Question:** How do nucleotide sugar transporters (NSTs) facilitate cryptococcal glycan biosynthesis and contribute to the virulence of Cryptococcus neoform, an AIDS-defining opportunistic pathogen?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of two nucleotide sugar transporters, Uxt1 and U2, in cryptococcal glycan synthesis and pathogenesis using biochemical and genetic approaches. We analyzed the subcellular localization, kinetic parameters, and substrate specificity of U1 and U2, and assessed their requirement for cryptococcal viability and virulence in a mouse model.

**Findings:** U1 and U2 are nucleotide transporters specific for UDP-xylose and UDP-galactose, exhibiting distinct subcellular localization patterns and kinetic parameters. Both transporters are required for xylose incorporation into the cryptococcal capsule and necessary for C. neoans to cause disease in mice, although not for fungal viability in the context of infection.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a starting point for deciphering the substrate specificity of an important class of transporters, elucidate a synthetic pathway that may be productively targeted for therapy, and contribute to understanding of fundamental glycobiology. We identified the first fungal UDP-X/UDP-G transporters and set the stage for studies of mutants that may elucidate mechanisms of cryptococcal pathogenesis and host response.

**Conclusions:** Nucleotide transporters play a critical role in cryptococcal glycan biosynthesis and pathogenesis. U1 and U transport UDP-xy and UDP-galose and are required for cryptoc capsule formation and virulence, highlighting the importance of glycosylation in cryptococcal pathogenesis. Our study expands understanding of cryptococcal glycan synthesis, including sequence and localization of synthetic events, and NST as a protein family, and sets the stage for future research on cryptococcal pathogenesis and host response.

**Title:** Development of a Global Database for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) Surveillance and Control: A Step towards Spatial Risk Modeling and Control

**Research Question:** What is the current state of neglected tropical disease (NT) surveillance and control, and what is the need for a georeferenced global database providing open-access to available data for researchers and disease managers?

**Methods:** We systematically searched peer-reviewed and grey literature, contacted Ministries of Health and research institutions in schistomiasis-endemic countries for location-specific data, extracted, geferenced, and stored in a MySQL database with a web interface for free access and management.

**Findings:** Our database contains over 12,000 geferenced schomiasis surveys from 35 African countries (http://www.gd.org) and is expanded to a global repository including soil-transmitted helthias and lemanias. An open-access spatial NTD database offers opportunities for risk modeling, targeting interventions, monitoring, and surveillance, and geostatistical analyses.

**Implications:** The establishment of a global NTD database is feasible and should be expanded without delay.

**Conclusions:**

The development of a gefer global database for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NT) is crucial for surveillance and control. Our database contains over 12,000 gefer schiasis surveys from 35 African countries and is expanded to a global repository including soil-transmitted helias and leman. An open-access NTD database offers opportunities for disease modeling, targeting interventions, monitoring, and surveillance, and geostat analyses. We demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a global NTD database with an initial focus on schias in Africa.

**Title:** Chronic Helminth Infections Do Not Exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection in a Cotton Rat Model

**Research Question:** Do chronic helminth infections worsen the course of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) infection in a cotton rat model, a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomoides sigmodis?

**Methods:** Cotton rats were co-infected with 100 L. sigmodis larvae and challenged 11 weeks later with 5 × 10^4 MT bacteria. Immunological, histological, and mycobacterial studies were conducted 2 months post-challenge.

**Findings:** Contrary to our hypothesis, MT loads and granuloma size were not increased in co-infected animals. Sple cell proliferation and interferon-gamma response to purified protein derivative were similar between co-infected and MT-only animals.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that filarial infections do not exacerbate MT infection in the cotton model, indicating that eradication programs may not facilitate MT control. However, worm-derived therapies may be developed for autoimmune diseases without increasing MT risk.

**Conclusions:** Unlike murine mycobacterial models, MT infection in cotton results in granulomas containing macrophages, mycobacteria, and necrosis similar to human TB. This study reveals whether helmin have different effects on mycobacterial infection. Our results suggest that filarial immunomodulation can be overcome in active MT infection.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of the DEG/ENa Channel PPK23 in Drosophila Melanogaster's Sensory System and Courtship Behavior

**Research Question:** What is the physiological function of the DE/ENa channel PPK23 in Dophila melanogaster's sensory system, particularly in relation to courtship behavior?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression and function of P23 in sexually dimorphic gustatory chemosensory bristles and its role in male courtship behavior using genetic and behavioral assays.

**Findings:** We found that P23 is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory chemosensory bristles distinct from those expressing feeding-related gustatory receptors. Disrupting or inhibiting P23-expressing neurons did not alter gustatory responses, but blocking P23-positive neurons or mutating the P gene delayed and reduced the intensity of male courtship. Mutations in P altered the behavioral response of males to the female-specific pheromone (7,11Z)-heptadiene.

**Implications:** These data indicate that P23 and cells play a crucial role in the peripheral sensory system determining sexual behavior in Dophila. Our findings suggest that P23 is a potential pherom receptor or a key component of the phonal cascade.

**Conclusions:** DE/a signaling contributes to sensory functions underlying sex-related behaviors, revealing a novel physiological function for this family of ion channels. P-express cells may play a role in intra-species interactions independent of sex. Our behavioral data suggest that P mutation did not alter female receptivity, but do not exclude a role in other behaviors. We do not know whether P interacts or physiologically with other receptors implicated in Dila court behaviors.

**Title:** Mitochondrial tRNA Import: A Dynamic Adaptation or Co-evolutionary Process?

**Research Question:** Despite the widespread occurrence of mitochondrial tRNA import from the cytosol in diverse phyla, including protozoa, fungi, higher plants, and humans, the mechanisms and regulation of this process remain poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between mitochondrial codon usage and tRNA import in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas to test the hypothesis that tRNA import is a dynamic process adapting to the mitochondrial genome.

**Methods:** We manipulated the Chlamdomonas mitochondrial genome by introducing mutations to modify cod usage, specifically replacing often-used codons with seldom-used codons encoding the same amino acid. We analyzed the effects on tRNA import, translation, and respiratory complex activities.

**Findings:** Codon modification resulted in reduced tRNA levels, translation, and respiratory complex activities, linked to limited tRNA pool in mitochondria. This indicates tRNA import is not rapidly regulated in response to novel genetic context, suggesting it is not a dynamic process. Instead, steady-state tRNA levels result from co-evolution between import mechanism and translation machinery.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that fine-tuning between tRNA import and cod usage in Chlamdomonas originates from co-evolution, not dynamic adaptation of cytosolic import. Future research should focus on characterizing tRNA machinery and early stages of import, particularly in heterotrophic conditions. Our data demonstrate cod bias affects translation efficiency, and residing DNA information does not regulate tRNA import.

**Conclusions:** MitochondrialRNA import is not dynamic in Chdomonas, and cod usage has direct effect on translation. Steady-state tRNA levels correlate with cod usage, suggesting imported tRNA defined by mitochondrial DNA for optimal translation. The Chdom mitochondrial genome can be manipulated, offering possibility to modify cod usage. In many organisms, tRNA is insufficient, and nucleus-encoded tRN imported from cytos. Mitochondrial import is widespread, documented in diverse phyla, including protoa, fungi, plants, and mammals. We replaced tAG isoacceptors with G and GGG codons in Chdom genes to test repercussions on tRNA import.

**Key Takeaways:**

* tRNA import is not rapidly regulated in response to novel genetic context
* Cod usage affects translation efficiency
* Steady tRNA levels result from co-evolution between import and translation machinery
* Mitochondrial genome can be manipulated to modify cod usage
* tRNA is insufficient in many organisms, nucleus-encoded t imported from cytos
* Mitrial import is widespread in diverse phyla

**Title:** Unveiling the Heterogeneity of Glucose Regulation in Diabetes and Prediabetes: A Novel Insights from Continuous Glucose Monitoring

**Research Question:** Can continuous glucose monitoring (CG) reveal the heterogeneity of glucose regulation in individuals with diabetes and predabetes, and identify specific patterns of glycemic responses that predict progression to type 2 diabetes?

**Methods:** We conducted a study using CG to evaluate the frequency and patterns of postprand glucose elevations in response to identical nutrient challenges in individuals with diabetes and predabetes. We developed an analytical framework, called "glucotypes," to group individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses, highlighting heterogeneity within traditional categories of glucose regulation. We also measured insulin resistance and secretion to understand the underlying physiology of dysglycemia.

**Findings:** Our results show that glucose dysregulation, as characterized by CG, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought, affecting individuals considered normoglyc by standard measures. We found that 15% and 2% of normlyc individuals exhibit glucose levels in predabetic and diabetic ranges, respectively, using CG. Furthermore, we identified specific patterns of glycemic responses that reflect variable physiology, highlighting the personal nature of glucose regulation. Through phenotyping, we developed a model for identifying mechanisms of glucose dysregulation and a webtool for visualizing user-uploaded CG profiles and classifying individual patterns into glucotypes.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that increased glucose variability may precede current measures of abnormal glucose, representing an earlier stage of "predabetes." Long-term studies are warranted to determine if identification of "severe glucotype" via CG has greater predictive value for type 2 diabetes than traditional tests. We also found heterogeneity in insulin metabolism relative to insulin and glucose profiles, demonstrating dynamic responses in several individuals.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the utility of CG in revealing heterogeneity glucose regulation and identifying specific patterns of glycemic responses that predict progression to type 2 diabetes. Our results highlight the need for personalized approaches to glucose management, considering individual variability in glucose responses to nutrient challenges. The glucotypes framework provides a novel tool for understanding underlying mechanisms of dysregulation and predicting risk of type 2 diabetes.

**Title:** The Raf-like MAP Kinase Kinase EDR1 Negatively Regulates the MKK/MKK-MPK/MPK Cascade to Fine-Tune Plant Innate Immunity in Arabidopsis

**Research Question:** How does the Raf-like MAP kinase kinase (MAPK) EDR1 regulate plant defense responses and cell death in Arabidopsis, and how does it affect the regulation of MAPK cascades?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of EDR1 in the regulation of the MKK/MKK-MPK/MPK cascade in Arabidopsis using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches.

**Findings:** Our results show that EDR negatively regulates the MK/MKK-MPK/MPK cascade through direct interaction with MK4 and MK5, modulating plant defense and cell death. We found that ed1 mutants have higher MPK/MP6 activity and protein levels than wild-type, and E1 physically interacts with MK4 and MK5, requiring the N-terminal domain of E1. Additionally, E1 affects MK4/MK protein levels. Moreover, mpk, mkk, and mkk mutations suppress ed1-mediated resistance, while overexpression of MK4 or MK5 causes ed1-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death.

**Implications:** Our data indicate that E1 associates with MK4/MK5 and negatively regulates the MAP cascade to fine-tune plant immunity. The mechanisms of negative regulation of MK/MK in Arabid remain unclear, and our study provides new insights into the role of E1 in plant defense responses.

**Conclusions:** We show that E1 directly interacts with MK4 and MK5, and affects levels of MK, MK, MK, MP, and MP, which may represent an important mechanism fine-tuning plant responses. E1 belongs to the MAPK family, but mechanistic link to kinase cascades has remained elusive. Our study provides genetic evidence that MK and MK are key players in plant immunity, and loss-of-function mutants display susceptibility to powd mildew. The m and m alleles will be valuable tools dissecting the role of MK/ mediated cascade in biotic and abiotic stresses.

**Title:** Spatiotemporal Prediction of Infectious Diseases using Gaussian Processes: A Novel Computational Framework for Public Health Policy Decision-Making

**Research Question:** Can a computational framework based on Gaussian processes effectively predict spatiemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, enabling informed decision-making for public health policymakers?

**Methods:** We developed a novel computational framework that leverages Gaussian processes to perform spatiemporal prediction of infectious diseases, exploiting the structure of similarity matrices to achieve efficient implementation. We tested our framework on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases in Turkey (2004-2015) and compared it with standard machine learning algorithms (random forests and boosted trees) under temporal, spatial, and spatiemp scenarios.

**Findings:** Our Gaussian formulation outperformed standard algorithms in all scenarios, demonstrating its potential to contribute to public health policy.

**Implications:** This study highlights the utility of Gaussian processes in identifying nonlinear dependencies and making reliable predictions, outperforming tree-based algorithms. Our framework combines spatial and temporal similarity matrices into a larger matrix, training a Gaussian regression model to predict cases under three scenarios: temporal, spatial, and spatiemp. We applied our framework to Turkey's surveillance data on Crimean-Congoagic fever, an endemic in Africa, Balkans, Middle East, and Asia, with 5-40% fatality rate.

**Conclusions:** Our spatiemp framework has the potential to aid public health policymakers in making informed decisions. Gaussian processes capture complex dependencies better than tree-based algorithms, making it a valuable tool for spatiemp modeling. This study contributes to the development of reliable computational tools for infectious disease control and prevention.

**Title:** Investigating the Dynamics of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVF) Transmission among Livestock in Northeast Africa: A Spatial Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** What are the key factors contributing to the transmission and dispersal of Rift Valley Fever (RV) virus among livestock in Northeast Africa, particularly during the Eid al-Adha festival, and how do these factors impact the severity of outbreaks?

**Methods:** We developed a three-patch model to investigate the transmission dynamics of RVV among ruminants with spatial movements, incorporating human activities associated with the Eid-Ad festival and climatic factors such as rainfall and hydrological variations.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that in Northeast Africa, human activities related to the Eid-Ad festival, combined with climatic factors, contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the disease. Sporadic outbreaks occur when two events occur: 1) abundant livestock are imported into areas at risk due to demand for the festival and 2) abundant mosquitoes emerge. These factors impact the severity of RV outbreaks. Numerical results show transmission dynamics of the pathogen over short and long periods, particularly during festival time.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of festival and seasonal factors on patterns of RV outbreaks among livestock in Africa and the Middle East. Although we did not consider human compartments directly, human activities, such as importation and transportation, impact patterns of disease at different locations. Temporal superposition of risk can be predicted in advance. Implementing vaccination strategies and stochastic events, such as festival preparations, change disease patterns. We extend model to consider latencies in hosts and vectors and import of RVV during latency.

**Conclusions:** This study evaluates seasonal and festival impacts on RV outbreaks and dispersal. An unexpected outbreak in 2010 was attributed to camels in Mauritania and heavy rainfall. Our findings provide information for governments to predict and control disease transmission.

**Title:** Spatial and Temporal Changes in the Occurrence of Anthrax in Azerbaijan: A 1984-2010

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in the occurrence of anthrax in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010, analyzing data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human incidence under Soviet and post-Soviet governance.

**Methods:** We employed a combination of spatial analysis, cluster detection, and weighted least squares regression to evaluate the spatio-temporal distribution of anthrax.

**Findings:** Our results showed an annual percent increase in incidence of 11.95% from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline of 35.24% after the initiation of livestock vaccination in 1996. Spatially, cases were primarily concentrated in the west in the early period, shifting eastward as time progressed. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the distribution of anthrax in Azerbaijan underwent marked changes.

**Implications:** Despite decreases in incidence, continued control measures in livestock are needed to mitigate occurrence. Shifting patterns of anth highlight the need for an integrated "One Health" approach accounting for geographic distribution.

**Conclusion:** Our study revealed two patterns: increasing trend in anth during Soviet governance through mid-1990s, followed by decline in number of cases subsequent to vaccination and geographic shift in distribution eastward. Evidence of shifting pattern necessitated dynamic surveillance. This study aimed to analyze and describe historical distribution of anth to identify spatial and temporal changes, providing understanding of occurrence, areas to prioritize, and aid management. Incidence of cutaneous anth was concentrated west and south in early period, shifting east towards Baku in mid-199s, then primarily in eastern and northern throughout vaccination period.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Modulation of Shaker Voltage-Gated Potassium Channels through Molecular Dynamics Simulations

**Research Question:** How do polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) interact with the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel, and what is the molecular basis for their modulatory effects on channel gating?

**Methods:** We employed microsecond molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between the Shaker channel in open and closed states and a PU-enrich lipid bilayer.

**Findings:** Our simulations revealed a putative PU binding site in the open state of the channel at the protein-lip interface, near the extracellular halves of the S3 and S helices of the voltage-s domain (VSD). The lipophil PU tail exhibited non-specific hydrophobic interactions in the hydroobic core of the proteinip interface, while the carboxyl head displayed specific interactions with polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of S and S helices, encompassing the S-S linker. In contrast, saturated fatty acids (SFA) interactions with the Shaker channel showed increased conformational flexibility in polyunsaturated tails compared to saturated chains, explaining the specificity of PU action on channels.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of PU modulation of Shaker channels, which may underlie the effectiveness of ketogenic diets in treating refractory epilepsy. Our results highlight the importance of PU interactions with the protein-lip interface, particularly the extracellular regions of S and S helices, in modulating channel gating.

**Conclusions:** Our study elucidates the molecular basis of PU modulation of Shaker channels, providing a framework for understanding the mechanism of ketogenic diets in treating refractory epilepsy. The identification of a putative PU binding site at the proteinip interface and specific interactions with polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of S and S helices underscores the critical role of PU interactions in modulating channel gating.

**Title:** Development of a Novel Pipeline for In Vivo Screening of Cryptosporidium parvum Inosine Monophosphate Dehydrogenase (CpIMPDH) Inhibitors: A Promising Leads for Anticryptosporid Chemotherapy

**Research Question:** The protozoan parasite Cryptosporium parum is a significant cause of disease burden among children in developing countries, and Cryptosporiosis can lead to chronic and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. Current drugs lack efficacy in treating severe conditions, hindering the development of novel anticryptporial therapeutics due to poor tractability of the pathogen.

**Methods:** We developed a pipeline to accelerate in vivo screening of C. parum IMPDH inhibitors by genetically engineering the related parasite Toxoplas gondii as a model of C. parum infection. This assay provides target validation and a large window not possible in assays involving C. parum. We established a fluorescence-based host proliferation assay and C. parum growth that utilizes automated imaging for enhanced throughput. We used these assays to evaluate C. par IMPDH inhibitors from ongoing chemistry and identified a subset 1,2,3- triazole with excellent in vivo selectivity in T. gondi and anticryptporial activity.

**Findings:** We describe an assay to evaluate anticryptial activity in tissue models. Engineered T. gond to mirror purine of C. par and depend on IMP for survival, providing rapid assessment and target specificity. Developed a host growth assay using H-8 express fluorescent and a high-content imaging to measure C parum proliferation. Utilized these to probe structure-activity for series of IMPH inhibitors.

**Implications:** The lack of suitable culture and animal models to assess candidates is the most prominent roadblock. Our pipeline overcomes this challenge by using a T. gond model that mirrors C. purine pathways and depends on IMP. We constructed a T. g reporter that mirrors C. pur metabolism (Figure 1). The T. gii does not negate necessity testing C directly, but is indispensable winnowing candidates to this model. Identified two promising antic candidates: A103 and A110, >100 more potent than paromycin.

**Conclusions:** We developed a pipeline to accelerate in vivo screening of C. par IMPDH inhibitors. Engineered T. g as a model of C infection, providing target validation and specificity. Established a host proliferation assay and C growth that utilizes imaging for throughput. Utilized these to evaluate C IMP inhibitors and identified a subset 1,2,3- triazole with excellent in vivo selectivity and anticporial activity. Our pipeline overcomes the challenge of tractability, enabling the development of novel anticpor therapeutics.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Genetic Loci Associated with Tooth Development and Eruption in Infancy

**Research Question:** What are the genetic loci associated with tooth eruption time and number in infancy, and how do these loci relate to other developmental processes and cancer?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study of 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Birth Cohort (NF196) and 1,518 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPC) to identify loci associated with tooth eruption time and number at one year of age.

**Findings:** We identified 5 loci at P<5×10-8 and 5 suggestive (P<5×10-6) associated with tooth eruption time and number. These loci included genes linked to tooth and organ development (KCNJ2, DA, HOXB, RADL1, I2BP, HM2 MS3) and four of which are implicated in cancer. A variant in the HO gene associated with occlusion requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that genetic determinants of tooth eruption in infancy associate with dental occlusion in later life. Genes at the loc have roles in organogenesis, growth, and developmental processes, and cancer. Mutations in three lead to altered organ development; KC2 (teeth, jaws, palates, ears, fingers, toes), DA (teeth, hair, sweat, salivary glands) and I2 (intestines). Given the influence of tooth on dental occlusion, we hypothesized that genetic determinants of early eruption associate with occlusion later.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides first insight into the genetic architecture of dentition and has implications for the study of other developmental and organogenic processes. Genes at the loc have been implicated in cancer and developmental processes, suggesting a link between abnormal tooth development and cancer. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between genetic determinants of tooth eruption and occlusion.

**Title:** Dosage-Sensitive Genes in the Hsa21 Region Contribute to Locomotor Deficits in Down Syndrome

**Research Question:** What is the role of the H13-App region on chromosome 21 in the development of locomotor deficits in Down syndrome?

**Methods:** We generated two mouse models, TsY and MsY, carrying a tandem duplication and deletion of the H13-App syntenic region, respectively, to investigate the contribution of this region to locomotor phenotypes.

**Findings:** Both trisomy and monomy of the H13-App region altered locomotion, muscle strength, and balance. Skeletal muscle profiling revealed changes in gene regulation of energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Genes were downregulated in TsY and upregulated in Ms mice. Shift in muscle metabolism correlated with change in mitochondrial proliferation without alteration in respiratory function. ROS production from complex I decreased in MsY, while membrane permeability of Ts mitochondria increased.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that copy variation in the H-App region impacts locomotor activity by altering muscle function.

**Conclusions:** The H-App region controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles as a consequence of change in Gab, N1, and A5. This study demonstrates the contribution of the H-App region to locomotor deficits in Down syndrome.

**Title:** Quantitative Analysis of the GPCR-Gi-GIRK2 Cascade: Unveiling the Mechanisms of Basal and Agon-Evoked Activities of GIRK Channels

**Research Question:** How do GIRK channels, activated by Gβ subunits from Gi/o proteins, regulate neuronal excitability and plasticity, and what are the mechanisms underlying basal and agon-evoked activities?

**Methods:** We developed a quantitative model of GIRK2 function, characterized single-channel and macroscopic GIR2 currents, and surface densities of GIR2 and Gγ in Xenopus oocytes, and constructed a mathematical model of GIR2 activity under steady-state before and after activation by neurotransmitter.

**Findings:** Our model accurately recapitulates basal and agon-evoked GIR2 currents in Xenopus o, HEK cells, and hippocampal neurons, predicts dose-dependent activation of GIR2 by coexpressed Gγ, and accounts for the inverse basal-agon correlation. Modeling indicates that 3-4 Gγ dimers are available for each GIR2 channel, while Gα decreases from 2 to less than 1 per channel as GIR2 density increases.

**Implications:** The unequal association of GIR2 with G subunits and cooperative gating by Gγ underlie the complex basal and agon-evoked activities, allowing GIR2 to act as a bidirectional detector of Gγ and α.

**Conclusions:** Our quantitative analysis of the G-Gi-GIR2 cascade reveals that basal and agon-evoked activities are interrelated, with the extent of activation by neurotransmitter activation inversely related to basal. The unequal association of GIR2 with G subunits and cooperative gating by Gγ underlie the complex pattern of basal and agon-evoked activities, allowing GIR2 to act as a bidirectional detector of Gγ and α.

**Title:** Predicting Virulence Targets of Plant-Pathogenic Xanthomonas Bacteria using a Novel Computational Approach

**Research Question:** How can we accurately predict the transcriptional targets of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) secreted by plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria, which play a crucial role in bacterial virulence?

**Methods:** We developed a novel computational model, PredTALE, to predict TALE targets based on recent findings concerning TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding repeats of aberrant lengths and flexible orientation of target boxes relative to the transcription start of downstream genes. The model accounts for dependencies between repeat variable di-residue (RVD) positions and is learned from a wealth of quantitative data generated over the years. We benchmarked PredTA using RNA-seq data from Xanthas infection in rice and found an improvement in performance compared to previous approaches.

**Findings:** Using PredTA, we predicted novel putative virulence targets and observed that no genes were predicted by any tool for several TALEs, termed orphan TALEs. We postulated that orphan TALEs are due to incomplete annotations, proposing promoter-wide genome scans for target boxes. Demonstrated that known targets from promoter-wide scans can be recovered by genome-wide, and combined with RNA-seq, detect putative independent of existing annotations.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate genome-wide prediction of target using PredTA enables identifying novel targets independently of existing annotations, including non-coding RNAs. Accurate predictions of TALE targets are essential for elucidating virulence of TALE supporting bacterial infection of plants. Performed promoter-wide scans for putative boxes of TALE from five Xanthas and host plants with published virulence, finding known targets rank 1 or 2 of PredTA predictions.

**Conclusions:** PredTA predicts unique targets, several promising for experimental validation. RNA-seq supports activation by TALE in planta, but importance for infection needs investigation. Previously, predictions were limited to annotated promoter regions. Demonstrates results depend on approach, but accuracy without knowledge of upregulated genes upon Xas infection. Collected RNA-seq for three strains, including unpublished PX83, 24 hours post-infection. Performed genome-wide for putative boxes and differentially expressed in vicinity predicted boxes.

**Title:** Predicting the Pathogenicity of Mitochondrial Non-synonymous Variants with APOEE: A Machine Learning Algorithm Outperforming Existing Methods

**Research Question:** Can we develop a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts the pathogenicity of mitochondrial non-synonymous variants, a subset of which have been functionally evaluated with certainty, while the majority assessed in-silico by incongruent predictors?

**Methods:** We designed and implemented APOEE, a machine learning algorithm that outperforms existing methods in estimating the harmfulness of mitochondrial non-syn genome. APOEE was trained on a curated set of 864 known variants and tested on an array of performance metrics. We calculated the frequency of coevolving amino acids and mean Z-score for each amino site for 24,189 non-syn variants affecting human DNA, available as a flat file. Variants were grouped and used to build and verify APOEE classifier.

**Findings:** APOEE outperformed existing predictors in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (Table 1). APOEE's logic is based on Logistic Tree (LMT) model, offering transparent, reproducible, and easy-to-understand results. It feeds third-party features related to 13 mitochondrial proteins, multi-alignments, and amino conservation, and uses decision tree learning to provide pathogenic rules.

**Implications:** Assessing pathogenicity of mutations is challenging in-vitro, inivo, and even uniable due to paucity of funds or facilities, particularly with mitochondrial DNA, less studied than nuclear. AEE addresses this challenge by providing a finely-tuned, reproducible, and easy-to-understand classifier for mitochondrial variants.

**Conclusions:** AEE outperforms existing methods in predicting pathity of mitochondrial non-syn variants. Its transparent, reproducible, and easy-to-under results make it a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians. AEE addresses the challenge of assessing pathity in mitochondrial DNA, less studied than nuclear.

**Title:** Dengue Virus Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) Triggers Platelet Activation and Thrombocytopenia through Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) Signaling

**Background:** Dengue virus (DENV) infection, transmitted by mosquitoes, causes a spectrum of diseases ranging from self-limiting deng fever to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever and shock. Thrombocytopenia is a hallmark of both mild and severe deng disease and correlates with disease progression. Previous studies have shown that DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1), secreted into patients' blood, stimulates immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and causes endothelial leakage. However, whether DENV NS directly induces platelet activation or thrombocytopenia during DENV infection remains unclear.

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate whether DENV NS induces platelet activation and thrombocytopenia through TLR4 signaling.

**Methods:** We demonstrated that DENV, but not Zika virus culture supernatant, induced P-selectin expression and phosphatylserine (PS) in human platelets, abolished when NS was depleted from D supernant. Similar results were found using recombinant NS from four D serotypes and blocked by anti-NS F(ab')2, anti-TL4 antibody, T4 antagonist (Rhobacteroid lipopolyscharide, LPS), and T4 inhibitor (AK242), but not polymyxin (L inhibitor).

**Findings:** Activation of platelets by D NS promoted subthreshold adenos diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and plate adhesion to endothelial and phagocyt by macrophages. D-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in T4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS was depleted from D supernant.

**Implications:** These results suggest that binding D NS to T4 on platelets triggers its activation, contributing to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during D infection. Activated platelets modulate monocyte responses and endothelial hypermeability, causing vascular leakage during D infection. Plate activation by D NS not only causes thrombocytopen but enhances inflammatory and vascular response in D patients.

**Conclusions:** DENV NS plays a central role in the interplay of deng pathogenesis. Plate from D-infected patients exhibit increased activation and apoptosis compared to healthy donors and noneng febrile patients. Mechanisms of plate activation and apoptosis leading thromocytia are not fully understood. This study demonstrates plate activated by D NS prone to aggregation, attachment endothelial, and phagoc by immune cells. D NS binds endothelial to induce vascular leakage and stimulate immune cytokine, considered a viral toxin in deng pathogenesis.

**Title:** Mathematical Analysis of the Dynamic Loops Regulating Vasotone of Smooth Muscle, Blood Volume, and Arterial Pressure: Insights into the AVP-AN-RA System

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the mathematical modeling and analysis of the dynamic loops regulating vasotone of smooth muscle, blood volume, and arterial pressure, involving the arginine vasopressin (AV) system, atrial natriuretic peptide (AN) system, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RA) system.

**Methods:** A mathematical model was built to describe the control loops regulating vasotone of smooth muscle, blood, volume, and arterial pressure, with key players and interactions represented by a diagram. The system was found to be a closed-loop, with interplay among AV, AN, and RA systems through regulatory effects on smooth muscle, blood, and pressure.

**Findings:** Analysis of the AV-AN-RA system revealed the presence of two regulatory mechanisms: one affecting blood pressure through vasoconstriction, the other regulating volume. Both systems were found to be oscillators consisting of negative feedback loops, with a single equilibrium that can be stable or lead to oscillatory instability. A subsystem including AN and AV stimulation of smooth muscle turned out to be an oscillator composed of monotone with multiple feedback, showing oscillatory potential when delays in all loops are comparable.

**Implications:** Our results provide insight into physiological mechanisms of long-term homeostasis of blood parameters, based on dynamical loops interactions. The AV-ANRA endocrine control of fluids and pressure was analyzed using mathematical tools to highlight loop arrangement and function. The whole system was found to be split into two coexisting dynamic, containing VSM and D agents as nodes, exerting effects on pressure and volume, respectively.

**Conclusions:** A subset of the system, including AN and AV stimulation of smooth, complex crosstalk between AV and AN-dependent pathways within smooth cells, and stretch loops onto AV and AN systems, was analyzed. The representation is shown as AAV (AV-AN-VSM) subsystem. Remarkably, the system can be seen as a feedback of input monotone subsystem, formed by smooth cell, with three loops due to effects: (i) AN released by heart, stimulated right stretch; (ii) AV by SP, stimulated right stretch; (iii) AV by SP, stimulated aortic carotid.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Mechanism of Thrombus Growth Inhibition: The Role of Fibrin Network Permeability and Protein Diffusivity

**Research Question:** What is the role of fibrin network permeability and protein diffusivity in the transport of thrombin through the fibrin cap, a component of thrombus, and how does it impact thrombus growth?

**Background:** Thrombosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent studies have sought to identify mechanisms to inhibit thrombus growth. This study investigates the novel mechanism of fibrin cap formation and its impact on thrombus growth.

**Methods:** Experiments and simulations were conducted using microfluidic devices to model the permeable fibrin network. In vivo studies in mice showed stabilized thrombi are covered by fibrin (fibrin cap). Simulations accounted for fibrin structure demonstrated thrombin washout through fibr network, limiting platelet exposure to thrombin and restricting platelet approach to throm core.

**Findings:** Permeability and diffusivity are key factors in protein transport through fibr network. Thrombin generated inside throm is washed out, limiting platelet activation and throm growth. Fibr cap prevents small throm from developing into life-threatening events.

**Implications:** Fibr network limits throm growth by restricting protein transport and platelet access to high thrombin concentrations. Spatial distribution of hemostatic activators, such as thrombin, is crucial for plate activation and fibrin polymerization.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of fibr network permeability and diffusivity in throm transport and thrombus growth. Fibr cap prevents small throm from developing into life-threatening events by limiting protein and platelet access to thrombin.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Mechanism of Invariant Natural Killer T Cell-Mediated Antimicrobial Activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis

**Research Question:** How do invariant natural killer T (iKT) cells control the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) during infection, and what are the underlying mechanisms involved?

**Methods:** We investigated the antimicrobial activity of iKT cells against M-infected macrophages using a co-culture system. We measured iKT activation by CD25 upregulation and IFγ production and found that it was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18 produced by macrophages. However, iKT control of M growth was CD1-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFγ.

**Findings:** We discovered that conventional markers of iKT activation (CD25 and IFγ) did not correlate with iKT effector function during M infection. Moreover, iKT control of M replication was independent of TNF and cytotoxicity. By dissociating cytokine-driven activation from CD1-restricted effector function, we identified a novel mediator of iKT antimicrobial activity: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). iKT produced GMF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1-dependent manner during M infection, and GMF was both necessary and sufficient to control M growth.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of iKT antimicrobial activity and a potential role for GMF in cell immunity against M. Our findings suggest that iKT cells limit M growth through a non-classical effector function, independent of cytolytic activity and cytokines previously identified as antimicrobial.

**Conclusions:** We have identified GMF as a novel iKT antimicrobial effector and uncovered a potential role for GMF in cell immunity against M. This study highlights the complexity of iKT function and the need to dissociate conventional markers of activation from effector function. Our findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting iKT and GMF to combat M infection.

**Title:** Regulation of Colonization of Candida albicans by the Transcription Factor EF1: Implications for Commensalism and Opportunistic Pathogenesis

**Research Question:** How does the transcription factor EF1 regulate colonization of Candida albicans in the human host, and what are the implications for commensalism and opportunistic pathogenesis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of EF1, a putative transcription factor, in regulating colonization of C. albicans in the murine intestinal and oral tracts. We generated EF1 null and EF1 overexpressing strains of C. alb and analyzed colonization in immunocompetent and athymic mice.

**Findings:** EF1 was highly expressed during growth of C. alb in the intestinal tract, but paradoxically, EF1 null exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, whereas EF1 overexpressing exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal and oral cavity of athym mice. When inoculated into the bloodstream, both EF1 null and EF1 overing strains caused lethal infections. In contrast, mutants attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation exhibited normal levels of intestinal colonization. Expression of several genes dependent on EF1 was observed during laboratory growth, but not within the murine tract.

**Implications:** Our results show that EF1 regulates the level of colonizing C. alb, favoring commensism over candidiasis. Different genes are required in different niches, and pathways regulating expression during colonization differ from those used during laboratory growth. EF1 is crucial for determining population size of C. alb during colonization, and expression may affect interactions between colonizing C. alb and intestinal cells, altering adherence or signaling to the immune system. Reducing EF1 may reduce likelihood of C alb infection, favoring commens colonization over candidias.

**Conclusions:** EF1 is a regulator of colonization of C. alb in the murine intestinal tract. High expression of EF1 attenuated colonization, while deletion of EF1 resulted in enhanced colonization, demonstrating EF1's role in regulating colonization. Expression of EF1 was low in oral lesions, but high in the intestinal tract, suggesting optimal colonization is crucial for survival of C. alb. Our findings highlight the importance of EF in commal colonization and opportunistic pathogenesis of C. alb.

**Title:** Prolonged Antigen Presentation is Essential for the Development of Protective CD8+ T Cell Immunity against Malaria Liver Stages

**Research Question:** What is the mechanism underlying the success of immunization with irradiated sporozoites against malaria liver stages of Plasmodium parasites?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of antigen persistence in the development of CD8+ T cell immunity using TCR transgenic cells specific for the circumsporozo protein, a leading candidate vaccine antigen. Irradiated sporites, incapable of replication and differentiation, were used as a model system to study antigen persistence in the absence of infection.

**Findings:** We found that sporozo antigen persists for up to 8 weeks post-immunization in lymphoid organs, dependent on the presence of CD11+ cells. Prolong antigen presentation enhanced the magnitude of CD+ T response in several ways: (1) reduced primed CD+ T cells exposed to antigen in vivo reduced the size of developing memory population; (2) fully developed memory cells expanded in immunized mice, but not transferred to naïve animals; (3) persisting antigen primed naïve cells, including thymic emigrants, to become effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in liver.

**Implications:** Our data demonstrate that optimal development of CD+ T immunity against malaria liver stages depends on prolonged presentation of sporite-derived antigen. This understanding is crucial for emulating a practical and effective vaccine, as irradiated sporite immunization is one of few models where CD+ cells play major protective role.

**Conclusions:** Prolong antigen presentation is essential for the development of protective CD+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages. Our findings have significant implications for malaria vaccine development, as they highlight the importance of antigen persistence in the immune response.

**Title:** Overcoming Barriers to Leishmaniasis Treatment: Polymyxin B-Loaded Nanoparticles as a Novel Therapeutic Alternative

**Research Question:** Can polymyxin B-loaded nanoparticles (PBCp) overcome the challenges of leishmanias treatment, including hospitalization and parasite resistance, by augmenting internalization in infected macrophages?

**Methods:** PBCPs were fabricated via anionic polymerization and characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (size, ζ-potential, Nanoparticle Analysis (size/concentration, vertical cell release rate, drug incorporation, and indirect protein determination) and in vitro viability. Nanoparticles coated with pol (PBCp-pol) presented an adequate size of 261.5 ± 25.9 nm, low polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.79 ± 0.17 m (stable for 45 days), and 50 drug release 6-7 times slower than free pol, favoring a prolonged release profile.

**Findings:** In vitro, pol alone reduced amastigote infection of macrophages (10 μg/mL) without complete elimination, even at higher concentrations, limiting its application as adjuvant leishicidal or antimicrobial coating. However, the nanocarrier PAn presented lemanidal effect surpassing pol activity, with no antimicrobial activity detected. Pol maintained activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsella, adding antimicrobial properties to nanoparticles.

**Implications:** This drug delivery system, described for the first time, demonstrated antileishial and antimicrobial properties. The bactericidal feature helps concomitant prevention/treatment of secondary infections caused by cutaneous L. amazon, ending disfiguring or disabling lesions.

**Conclusions:** Our results show that increments in pol concentration were not enough to increase leishicidal efficacy. The sustained release profile of pol from NPs confirms prolonged antimicrobial effect. Leishicidal tests performed with Leish amazon promastigotes showed IC50 for free pol 77.1 μg (59.2 μM). PBCp presented coating approximately 2.4 x105 pol molecules per unit, with sustained profile. Pol did not change toxicity to protoa or macroages. Optimal PAn present antishial activity by itself, surpassing pol. However, serum presence in media underestimated pol efficacy.

**Title:** Prognostic Factors for Death from Visceral Leishmaniasis in Belo Horizonte, Brazil: A Historical Cohort Study

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors for death from visceral leishmanias (VL) in Belo Horizont, Brazil, a region with high lethality rates.

**Methods:** A historical cohort study was conducted using data from the Reportable Disease System-SAN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) from 2002-2009. Multivariate logistic regression models were performed to identify variables associated with death from VL, and a prognostic score was developed.

**Findings:** Two models were analyzed: Model 1 (2002-2009, 111 deaths and 777 patients) and Model 2 (2007-200, 49 deaths and 327). In Model 1, variables associated with greater risk of death from VL were weakness (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.4), Leish-HIV co-infection (2.4, 95 CI 1.2-4.8), and age ≥60 years (2.5, 95 CI 1.5-4.3). Model 2 variables associated with death were bleeding (3.5, 95 CI 1.2-10.3), other infections (3.2, 95 1.3-7.8), jaundice (10.1, 95 3.7-27.2), and age ≥60 (3.1, 95 1.4-7.1). The prognostic score was developed using variables from the latest SIN version of AN (Model 2).

**Implications:** The study identified factors associated with death from VL were weakness, Leish-HIV co-infection, other infections, bleeding, jaund, and age ≥60. These findings are in agreement with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which considered age <6 or >65, jaund, and co-morbidities including infections as factors associated with death from VL.

**Conclusions:** This study contributes to the understanding of prognost factors for death from VL, which may improve clinical management of patients and contribute to lower mortality. The developed prognost score showed good predictive performance (sensitivity 71.4, specificity 73.7, PPV 28.9, NPV 94.5, and AUC 75.6). The study highlights the importance of considering Leish-H co-infection, other infections, bleeding, jaund, and age in clinical management of VL patients.

**Title:** Differential Regulation of Arabidopsis Regulatory Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor Kinase 1 (LRRK) Signaling by a Novel Allele BAK1 (bak-5) Reveals Phosphorylation-Dependent Control of Plant Innate Immunity and Cell Death

**Research Question:** How does the novel allele BAK1 (bak-5) regulate Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRRK) signaling pathways involved in plant innate immunity and cell death?

**Methods:** We investigated the differential regulation of three BAK-dependent pathways by the novel allele BAK (bak-5) using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants and biochemical assays.

**Findings:** Our results show that bak-5 mutants are severely impaired in innate signaling mediated by BAK-dependent receptors FLS and EFR, but not in BR signaling or cell control. We found that non-kinases F2 and EFR have low kinase activity and are unable to phosphorylate BAK in vitro. However, kinase activity is dispensable for ligand-induced heteromerization of F2 or E with BAK in planta, revealing a specific mechanistic difference. The suppression of F2 and E-dependent signaling in bak-5 is due to BAK-5 interaction with the ligand-binding RK, not kinase activity.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate phosphorylation-dependent control of plant innate immunity and cell death by regulatory LK BAK, revealing differences in mechanisms underlying regulation of ligand RD and non-RK.

**Conclusions:** The interaction of E and F with BAK is not a consequence of detectable phosphorylation, contrasting the absolute requirement of B1 activity for lig-induced formation with B in planta. B1 dictates specificity of downstream signaling as B-5 nearly blocked F2 and E-mediated PTI signaling but barely influenced death and B1 BR signaling. The importance of heteromer with BAK in innate immunity is substantiated by targeting the lig-induced B-FL2 interaction by bacterial effector Avr to block PT signaling. The function of B in death and immunity seems independent of function in BR.

**Title:** Elucidating the Antiproliferative Response to Anticancer Treatment: A Novel Experimental/Computational Approach to Modeling Cell Cycle Dynamics

**Research Question:** How does the antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment result from concurrent responses in cell cycle phases extending over several generations, and can current methods capture this complexity?

**Methods:** We developed an experimental/computational approach combining time-lapse cell microscopy and flow cytometry data to render the proliferative process through cell cycle and subsequent generations during treatment. We modelled treatment effects with modules describing functional activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair, and death in each phase. A framework was created to apply different modules in each phase and test at complexity justified by data.

**Findings:** We challenged the method with time-course measures in parallel with flow cytometry and timeapse cell microscopy in X-treated human ovarian cancer cells spanning a wide range of doses. A suitable model of treatment, including dose-response effect, was built combining modules with a strategy fitting all data different doses and platforms. The final model provided the first complete in silico rendering of cycling following X exposure, providing quantitative measures of dose-dependence G1, S, and G2 checkpoint activities subsequent, reconciling ionizing radiation effects and new insights in a unique scenario.

**Implications:** Our method enables detailed study of mechanisms contributing to antiprolifer response at population level, accounting for inter-cell variability and cell-to-cell heterogeneity. This approach reconciles current limitations of single-cycle models, where cells re-enter same cycle and generations mixed, and FC data alone or coupled with absolute counts.

**Conclusions:** The proposed experimental/comput method provides a novel framework for understanding antip response to anticancer treatment at cell population level. Our results demonstrate the complexity of antip response not captured by current methods, highlighting the importance of concurrent responses in cell phases and generations. This approach enables detailed study of mechanisms contributing to antip response, providing new insights into anticancer treatment efficacy and resistance.

**Key contributions:**

* Developed an experimental/comput approach combining timeapse microscopy and flow cytometry to render proliferative process cell cycle and generations

**Title:** Mitochondrial Coenzyme Q Biosynthesis Deficiency in Podocytes Leads to Nephrotic Syndrome in Mice

**Research Question:** We investigated the role of mitochondrial coenzyme Q (Co) biosynthesis in the development of nephrotic syndrome in mice with a missense mutation in the PSS2 gene.

**Methods:** We generated mice with a missense mutation in the PSS gene (Psskd/kd) and analyzed Co levels in kidney homogenates. We also generated mice with conditional knockout of PSS in podocytes, tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes, and liver.

**Findings:** Levels of Co9 and Co10 in kidney homogen from Psskd/kd mice were significantly lower than in controls. Disease manifestations originated in glomer podocytes, as seen in Podin/Psslox/Plox knockout mice, but not in conditional knockouts targeted to tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver-conditional mice had no disease despite undetectable Co9 levels, impaired respiratory capacity, and altered metabolism.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that disease manifestations of Co deficiency relate to tissue-specific respiratory capacity, with glomer podocytes displaying greatest sensitivity to PSS impairment.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that renal disease in Pkd mice results from pod-specific PSS dysfunction. Biochemical evidence of Co deficiency, respiratory dysfunction in isolated mitochondria, and altered amino profiles present in livers of both Pkd and control mice. Inflammation is not primary cause of disease, but mechanism to dispose cellular debris. Availability of mice will permit investigations into sites Co deficiency and damage, particularly central system and muscle, leading heterogeneous consequences primary disease observed in human PD2 patients.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Phenotypic Robustness: Determinative Cell Lineages as a Key to Multicellular Robustness

**Research Question:** What are the underlying mechanisms of phenotypic robustness, a characteristic of all forms of life, and how do they arise in the face of environmental and genetic perturbations?

**Methods:** We investigated the determinative developmental lineages of protostomes and deuterostomes, analyzing their cellular composition and topology, early ontogenic appearances, and clonality of cell types. Computational simulations of lineage evolution demonstrated the possibility of robustness as an adaptation to random cell deaths in development.

**Findings:** Our results show that determinative cell lineages are robust to necrosis and cell program failure, representing environmental (somatic) and genetic (germl) disturbances. Analysis of three cell lineages provides experimentally testable hypotheses on organizing principles of developmental lineages, opening the door to characterizing systemic properties of complex lineages.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a new mechanism of phenotypic robustness, distinct from previously studied mechanisms acting at subcellular or cellular levels, manifesting at supracellular and unique to multicellular organisms. This study provides a novel explanation of contribution of ontogenesis to phenotypic robust, crucial for species with determinative development. Lineage robust, along with regulative development, complements subcell and cellular mechanisms to form a multi-layer defense against environmental and genetic perturbations.

**Conclusions:** Determinative cell line robustness is a key component of phenotypic robust, arising as an adaptation to disturbances in ontogenesis. Features of line, including shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearances, and clonality of cell types, underlie this robustness. Our results have implications for understanding development, evolution, and carcinogenesis, as well as theoretical and applied values in characterizing complex lineages.

**Title:** EmbryoPhomics: A High-Throughput Platform for Phenomics in Aquatic Embryos

**Research Question:** Can we develop a high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos that can capture dynamic, temporal, spatial, and functional changes during embryonic development?

**Methods:** We present EmbryoPhomics, an open-source, high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos comprising an Open Video Microscope (OpenIM) that produces high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under tightly controlled environmental conditions. These videos are analyzed by Python Embryo Vision (EmbCV), which extracts phenomic data for morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during embryonic development.

**Findings:** We demonstrate the broad applicability of EmbryoPhomics in a series of experiments assessing chronic, acute, and multistress responses to environmental (temperature and salinity) in 30 million images of 600 embryos of two species with markedly different patterns of development - the pond snail Radix bica and the marine amphod Orchest gammellus. EmbryoCV successfully extracted phen-level data from 95% of the images, producing high-dimensional data describing morphological, physiological, and behavioral responses.

**Implications:** EmbPhomics has the potential to facilitate significant advances in biology, but requires development of high-through technologies capable of generating and analyzing high-dimensional data. EmbryoPhomics can acquire and process data capturing functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest, most life stages and is potentially changing for those interested in studying development and phenomics widely.

**Conclusions:** Embryoomics can underpin the generation of data describing whole-organ responses at scale, diversity, and quality required to study embryonic in a manner fitting phenomics, which with that produced molecularomic technologies. Concordance between manually EmbCV-determined of embryo and spatial temporal characteristics was high. EmbryoPhomics is versatile and demonstrate application to broad experimental designs, from 2-week to 24 experiments, and application two species.

**Title:** Deciphering the Metabolic Adaptations of Plasium spp. in Different Host Environments: A Stable Isotope Labeling, Targeted Metabolomics, and Reverse Genetics Reveal Stage-Specific Changes in Carbon Metabolism

**Research Question:** How do Plasium spp. parasites adapt their metabolism to different host environments during their complex life cycles in mosquitoes and humans, and what are the functional implications of these changes on parasite survival in blood and mosquito stages?

**Methods:** We employed stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics to map stage-specific changes in Plasium berghei carbon metabolism and determine the significance of these changes on parasite survival in blood and mosquito stages.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that glutamine serves as the primary input into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism in both asexual and sexual stages and is crucial for gametogenesis. Glutamine catabolism, as well as key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are essential for ookin toocyst transition in mosquito. These findings highlight significant differences between Plasium species not anticipated by genomics or transcriptomics and underscore the importance of integrating metabolomics with other platforms to inform drug discovery and design.

**Implications:** This study extends our understanding of Plium metabolism and points to potential targets for transmission-blocking strategies. Moreover, it highlights metabolic differences between Plium species, underscoring the need for integration of metabolomics with genomics and transcriptomics to better inform drug discovery and design.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of central metabolism in blood and mosquito stages of rodent malaria parasite Plium berg using 13C-stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics. Our findings add to existing knowledge of stage-specific metabolism in malaria and highlight key differences between Plium species.

**Title:** Decoding Oscillatory Signals with Inherent Feedforward Loops: A Quantitative Modeling Reveals Constraints and Implications for Information Processing in Biological Networks

**Research Question:** How do inherent feedforward loops (ILFs) process oscillatory signals in biological networks, and what are the constraints that limit their ability to decode pulsatile dynamics?

**Methods:** We employed quantitative modeling to investigate the ability of IFLs to process oscillatory signals, focusing on their capacity to count the number of pulses.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the IFL's ability to translate pulsatile dynamics is limited by two constraints: (1) the kinetics of IFL components dictate the input range for which the network can decode pulsatile, and (2) a match between network parameters and signal characteristics is required for optimal counting. Furthermore, we elucidate a mechanism by which information processing occurs in natural networks.

**Implications:** Our work has implications for the design of synthetic gene circuits for processing oscillatory signals and understanding natural decoding mechanisms in biological networks.

**Conclusions:** IFLs, a common motif in divergent signals, are ideal for decoding oscillatory signals due to their ability to respond to fold-changes rather than absolute input concentration. We establish the dynamic constraints of input and network parameters for counting to occur. Our insights can be used to identify information systems and understand perturbations to networks.

**Title:** Development of Standardized Methods for Quantification, Propagation, and Long-term Storage of Orientia tsutsugam, a Neglected Human Pathogen

**Research Question:** Despite being a leading cause of serious febrile illness in rural Asia, the mechanisms of cell biology and pathogenicity of Orientia tsugamushi, an obligate intracellular bacterium transmitted by Leptromidium mite bite, remain poorly understood due to technical difficulties in culturing in mammalian cells.

**Methods:** We developed a body of work to improve methods for quantification, propagation, purification, and long-term storage of this neglected pathogen. A clinical isolate of O. tsugamushi was grown in mouse embryonic fibroblast (L929) cells. Bacterial growth was measured using O. tsam-specific qPCR. Conditions for improved viability and growth were monitored in terms of effect on bacterial number after cultured in mammalian cells.

**Findings:** We present a standardized method for comparing viability of O. tsam after treatment and propagation under various conditions. Our data support improved techniques for propagation, purification, and storage of this organism, useful for clinical isolation and in vitro biology experiments.

**Implications:** This study addresses a critical gap in research on O. tsam, an obligate intracellular bacterium requiring specific methodologies for propagation and analysis. Our methods will be useful for researchers on O. tsam and other oblig intracellular pathogens like Ricketiales and Chlamdia families. Improved quantification, propagation, and storage of O. tsam will enhance understanding of its biology and pathogenic mechanisms.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a toolkit for future research on neglected human pathogen O. tsam. Simplified assay for comparing growth across conditions will be useful in comparing antibiotic sensitivity of isolates. Optimized assay showed growth of O. We quantified O. ts levels by extracting DNA and measuring genome copy number using primer/probe specific to short region within O. ts 47Da Htra gene. This approach has been used to track growth spotted fever Ricketiae in cells. Our methods will improve clinical diagnosis and generate isolates for strain diversity and resistance research.

**Title:** Safety and Efficacy of Praziquantel (PZ) Treatment in Zimbabwean Children Aged 1-5 Years Infected with Schistosoma haematobium

**Research Question:** Is Prazantel (P) treatment safe and effective in children aged 1-5 years infected with Schistoma haematium?

**Methods:** A total of 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 years were treated with Prazel tablets, and side effects were assessed by questionnaire administered to their caregivers within 24 hours of treatment. Efficacy was determined 6 weeks post-treatment through Schist egg counts in urine. The change in infection levels in children 1-5 years (n=100) was compared to 6-10 year olds (n=435) pre-treatment.

**Findings:** Pre-treatment Schist infection intensity in 1-5 olds was 14.6 eggs/10 ml and prevalence 21%. Of 104 children, 3.8% reported side effects within 24 hours of P treatment. These were stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation of face and body. P treatment significantly reduced Schist infection in 1-5 olds with an egg reduction rate (ERR) of 99% and cure (CR) 92%. This was comparable to efficacy in 6-10 olds where ERR was 96 and CR 67.

**Implications:** Prazel is safe and efficacious in children 1-5 as it is in older 6-10, whom P is drug of choice for Sch control.

**Conclusions:** These findings support growing calls to include pre-school and infants in Sch control programs. Prazel treatment is safe and effective in children 1-5, and should be included in Sch control programs.

**Title:** Identification of Novel Evolutionarily Conserved Pathways and Genes Involved in Ras-Driven Epithelial Tumorigenesis using Drosila

**Research Question:** What are the novel evolutionarily conserved pathways and genes involved in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis, and can they serve as potential biomarkers and drug targets for human epithelial cancers?

**Methods:** We performed an in vivo genome-wide functional screen in Drosila using RNAi-mediated knockdown to identify genes involved in Ras-driven epithelial tumenesis, stratified mammalian orthologs of hits in thousands of human cancers, and validated top 100 candidate tumor suppressor genes in secondary Dila assays.

**Findings:** We discovered multiple evolutionarily conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven epithelial tumenesis in Dila, and human orthologs of hits were significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, revealing novel prognostic markers for epithelial tumors. Among the top 100 candidate genes, 80 were validated in secondary Dila assays, including known and novel genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumenesis. Low expression of confirmed hits correlated with KRAS12 status and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. We mechanistically characterized the top hit, Tetrasin family member T29b, revealing T29 regulates EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrains tumor growth and invasion.

**Implications:** Our Dila screen uncovers novel and evolutionarily conserved epithelial genes and experimentally confirmed T29 as a key regulator of EG/Ras-induced epithelial growth and invasion. This study provides a starting point for identification of genes and pathways involved in tumor suppression and metastasis of Ras-driven epithelial cancers.

**Conclusions:** The accessibility of Dila to in vivo RNA screening and conservation of major pathways, including Ras, offers a valuable opportunity to genetically dissect cancer-relevant networks in a whole animal, leading to identification of novel biomarkers and drug targets for diverse epithelial tumors. This study highlights the potential of Dila as a model for understanding Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis and identifies T29 as a key regulator of EG/Ras-induced epithelial growth and invasion.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Meiotic Drive: A Novel Insights into the Evolution of Selfish Alleles in Schizosaccharomyces pombe

**Research Question:** How do meiotic drivers, selfish alleles that subvert gametogenesis to increase their transmission into progeny, impose fitness costs on the genome, and evolve suppressors?

**Methods:** We investigated the wtf gene family in Schizosacomyces pombe, previously shown to contain meiotic drivers in wild isolates. We discovered that wtf13 in lab stocks is a meiotic driver, killing spores that do not inherit it by generating a diffusible poison and sp-specific antidote. Additionally, we demonstrated that wtf is suppressed by another w gene, wtf-2, that arose in the lab and only produces an antidote. Wtf-2 does not act indiscriminately prevent spore destruction, instead rescuing only spores that inherit w-2.

**Findings:** Our results establish a novel paradigm for meiotic suppressors and provide insight into mechanisms of drive systems. Four wtf genes were identified as meiotic in different S. pombe isolates, S. kucha (denoted as Sk) and CBS7. These genes kill spores (meiotic products) that do not inherit them, with >70% of viable spores generated by w+/heterozyotes being w+. At least one gene, w4 from S. kucha, causes meiotic by poison-antidote mechanism. Similarly, the W13antote rescues spores that inherit the w13 locus. We hypothesized W-2 would act similarly, rescuing only spores that inherit W2. This is a departure from prevailing hypothesis about suppressors of meiotic drivers: indiscriminately rescuing all gametes.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that at least some w genes encode antidotes that act as suppressors of w drive. We show w13 is a poison-antote meiotic driver, and w- encodes a protein that suppresses w via molecular mimicry of W13antote. Results are consistent with ancestral w gene dual-transcript-antote meiotic driver. Duplications of this driver to unlinked loci (e.g. R locus) could be selected based on driving and protecting spores from ancestral (e.g. A locus).

**Conclusions:** This study identifies S. pom w13 as an autonomous meiotic driver, acting like previously characterized Sktf driver. w13 joins other proven w meiotic genes in wild isolates S. group: w4 and w28 Sk, cw and cw27 CBS7. Dual-transcript-ant mechanism used w13 is homologous to other w drivers. Our results provide novel insights into mechanisms of meiotic drive and evolution, highlighting the complex interplay between drivers and suppressors.

**Title:** Predicting Gene Expression from Genotype: A Novel Algorithms for Robustly Predicting Gene Expression in Unseen Individuals

**Research Question:** Can we develop an algorithm that accurately predicts gene expression in unseen individuals based on their genotype in the local vicinity of the gene?

**Methods:** We devised two multi-SNP algorithms that use information from multiple SNPs in the vicinity of the predicted gene to predict gene expression among individuals. The algorithms were trained on expression and genotype data from a set of individuals and tested on unseen individuals from distinct populations. We also developed an extension that incorporates heterogeneous genomic annotations to weigh the importance of various SNPs, assigning higher weights to variants with annotations such as proximity to genes and high GC content.

**Findings:** The predictions were remarkably robust, agreeing between training and test sets, even when training and test consisted of individuals from distinct populations. Although the number of predicted genes was relatively small, the robustness of predictions indicates the identity and degree of genes that can be predicted in advance. We found that predicted genes had higher expression and variability across individuals, providing insight into characteristics of genes that can be predicted from cis variation.

**Implications:** Our algorithms can predict gene expression in unseen individuals with robustness, even when training consists of data from different populations. This suggests that part of predictive power comes from shared variation across populations, which may be difficult to distill using only individuals from same population. We also showed that incorporating expression of other genes improved predictions, making it challenging to assess contribution of SNP information versus expression correlated genes.

**Conclusions:** We present novel algorithms that predict gene variation among individuals using genotype, leveraging multiple SNPs in local vicinity and incorporating heterogeneous annotations. Our results demonstrate robustness and accuracy, even across populations, and provide insight into characteristics of genes that can be predicted from cis variation. These findings have implications for understanding susceptibility to diseases and phenotypes, where variation plays a key role. Future work will focus on incorporating additional factors, such as environmental and epigenetic variation, to further improve predictions.

**Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Competitive Suppression between Virulent and Avir Plasmodium chaudi Clones in Immuno-competent and Immuno-deficient Mice

**Research Question:** What are the underlying mechanisms driving the competitive suppression of an avirulent Plasmodium chaudi (AS) clone by a virulent clone (AJ) in immuno-competent and immuno-deficient mice, and how do these mechanisms differ between single- and mixed infections?

**Methods:** We employed dynamical-based Bayesian inference to investigate the cause of competitive suppression, testing whether it is due to clone-specific differences in adaptive clearance of meroites and parasitized red blood cells (RBCs), loss of meroites and parasitized RBCs, RBC preference, R infection rate, burst size, and within-R interference. These processes were parameterized in dynamical mathematical models and fitted to experimental data.

**Findings:** We found that only one parameter, the ratio of background loss of meroites to invasion of mature RBC, needed to be clone-specific to predict the data. Interestingly, this parameter was the same for both clones in single-infections but different between clones in mixed-infections. The size of this difference was largest in immuno-compet mice and smallest in imm-def mice, explaining why suppression was alleviated in imm-def mice. Competitive acts early in infection, even before day of parasitemia.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that innate response clearing mites is most likely but not the only mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avir clones. In mixed infections, we predict an interaction between clones and innate response which changes the strength of clearance mites. This interaction is unknown, but refinement of model with other datasets may lead to its discovery.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of understanding within-host competition between strains to the evolution of virulence and drug resistance in malaria infections. Competitive can drive the evolution of virulence in parasites, and understanding the mechanisms of competition is essential for developing effective vaccines and treatments. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of competitive suppression between virulent and avir clones in imm-compet and imm-def mice, with implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

**Title:** Origin-Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIR): A Novel Mechanism for Generating Interstitial Inverted Triplications and Large Copy Number Variations (CNVs) through Replication Errors

**Research Question:** How do replication errors contribute to the generation of interstitial inverted triplications and large copy number variations (CNVs) in the genome?

**Methods:** We propose the Origin-Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIR) model, which posits that replication errors at existing short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences generate extrachromosomal, dimeric, autonomously replicating intermediates that integrate into the genome without loss of distal chromosomal sequences. We tested the feasibility of this model using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

**Findings:** Our results show that the proposed replication error, ligation of leading and lagging nascent strands to create closed forks, can occur in vitro at short, interrupted repeats. Removal of molecules with closed forks results in a hairpin-linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted dimer plasmid, which integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication.

**Implications:** Our model, ODIR, can explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons with 2:1 mixture of sequences from homologues of a single parent, a feature explained by plasm intermediate from one homologue integrating into other prior meiosis. Tests of key features of ODIR support this mechanism and suggest avenues for unraveling origins of interstitial, inverted CNVs in health and evolution.

**Conclusions:** Replication errors are a major driver of evolution, from single nucleotide polymorphisms to large CNVs. Our model, ODIR, provides a novel explanation for generation of interstitial inverted triplications and CNVs, highlighting the importance of replication errors in shaping genome structure and evolution.

**Title:** Alternate Translation Initiation at Non-canonical Codons in Response to Stressful Stimuli in Mammalian Cells: A Systematic Analysis of Influenza Virus Infection

**Research Question:** How do mammalian cells respond to stressful stimuli, such as viral infection, by altering translation initiation at non-canonical codons, leading to the production of novel immune epitopes?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of computational and experimental approaches to investigate the extent of alternate initiation in mammalian cells infected with influenza virus. First, we performed evolutionary analyses to identify signatures of selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in influenza lineages adapted to mammalian hosts. Next, we used ribosome profiling with the inhibitor lactimidycin to experimentally delineate initiation sites in human epithelial cells infected with influenza.

**Findings:** We identified several candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs, all of which occur at AUG codons downstream of canonical codons. One of these downstream sites truncates 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the N neuraminidase protein, resulting in loss of its cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain. This truncated neuraminase is expressed on the surface during infection, enzymatically active, and conserved in N1 lineages. We did not detect globally higher levels of alternate initiation on host transcripts upon infection or antiviral response, but a subset induced by antiv response is enriched for alternate sites.

**Implications:** Our results systematically map the landscape of initiation during influenza infection, shedding light on evolutionary forces shaping this landscape. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of initiation during virus infection, identifying new translation sites, one of which produces functionally active protein not previously described.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that mammalian cells respond to stressful stimuli, such as viral infection, by altering translation at non-canonical codons, leading to production of novel epitopes. We demonstrate selection against CUG initiation in lineages adapted to mammalian hosts, but minimal support for C initiation on transcripts in ribosome experiments. Critically, our study integrates computational and experimental approaches to comprehensively examine initiation in infected cells.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHE) Pathogenicity: Nle1 and Nle2 Proteins Bind to Ribosomal Protein S3 and Disrupt Intestinal Epithelial Function

**Research Question:** How do Enteremorrhagic Esichia coli (E) effectors, specifically Nle1 and N2, interact with host proteins to disrupt intestinal epithelial function and promote disease?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between E. coli O157:H7 Nle1 and N2 proteins and human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-enhancer of activated B (NF-κB) transcription complexes, using biochemical and cellular assays.

**Findings:** N1 and N2 localized with R3 in the cytoplasm, not nuclei, and bound to the N-terminus of R3. Both proteins are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr kinases, but binding to R3 is independent of kinase activity. N1, but not N2, reduced R3 nuclear abundance without affecting p50 or p65 NF-κ subunits or phosphorylation state of inhibitory NF-κ chaperone Iκα. N1 repressed transcription of R3/NF-κ-dependent reporter, but not R-independent reporters. In contrast, N2 stimulated R-dependent transcription and AP-1 reporter. We identified a region N1 (40-45) responsible for inhibitory activity toward R3. Deleting N from E. coli157 produced a hyper-virulent phenotype in a gnotiotic pig model of Shiga toxin-producing E infection.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest N1 disrupts host immune responses by binding a cofactor of transcriptional complexes, highlighting a novel mechanism of E pathogenicity.

**Conclusions:** N1 and N proteins are TSS effectors that bind R3, a subunit of NF-κ transcription complexes, disrupting intestinal epithelial function. N1 inhibits R-dependent transcription, while N stimulates R-dependent and AP-1. A region of N1 is responsible for inhibitory activity toward R. Deleting N from E.157 results in increased virulence in a gnotiotic model. These findings provide new insights into E pathogenic mechanisms and potential targets for intervention.

**Title:** Feature Models for Transcription Factor-DNA Interactions: A Novel Probabilistic Approach to Modeling Binding Specificities

**Research Question:** Transcription factor (TF) binding to its target DNA site is a fundamental regulatory interaction, yet the current models used to represent TF specificities, such as position scoring matrices (PM), assume independence between binding positions, which may not hold in many cases.

**Methods:** We present feature models (FMs), a novel probabilistic method for modeling TF-DNA interactions based on log-linear models. Our approach uses sequence features to represent binding specificities, where each may span multiple positions. We develop the mathematical formulation of our model and devise an algorithm for learning features from binding site data.

**Findings:** We developed a discriminative finder, which discovers de novo FMs enriched in target sets compared to background. We evaluate on synthetic and widely used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harrison et al. and apply to high-throughput TFIP from mouse and human, revealing features present in binding specificities of mouse and human TFs. FMs explain TF binding significantly better than PMs.

**Implications:** FMs capture complex dependencies between positions and high-level features (e.g., palindromes), generalizing the PM model. Our learning and finder are available at http://gen.weizmann.ac.il.

**Conclusions:** FMs offer a novel approach to modeling TF-DNA interactions, enabling richer representation of binding specificities. Integrating FMs into common and state-of-art finding algorithms is a future direction. We demonstrate benefits of log-linear representation and methodology for learning features from aligned and unaligned sequences. Our approach identifies TFBS in yeastIP data, comparable to state-of-art finders, and learns binding specificities of human and mouse TFs better than PM.

**Title:** Evolutionary Regulation of the Adrenergic αC Receptor (AD2) Gene in Humans and Chimpanzees: Insights into the Emergence of Enhanced Sympathetic Activity

**Research Question:** What are the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the repression of the Adnerg αC receptor (AD2) gene in humans and chimpanzees, and how do they relate to the evolution of enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in these species?

**Methods:** We analyzed transcriptomic, epigenomic, and genomic data from humans, chimpanzees, and rhes macaques to identify cis-regulatory variants responsible for AD2 repression. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) to examine histone marks at the AD2 promoter, and CRISPR/Cas genome editing and reporter assays to test the function of identified variants.

**Findings:** We found that AD2 expression is lower in humans and chimpanze than in other primates, and identified a cis-regulatory region with accelerated in humans and chimpanze. Histone marks were enriched in rhes macques but not humans, while repressive marks were present in human samples. The region contains two neuronstrictive silencer (NRS) motifs, each with polymorphism. Genotyping analysis revealed that both polymorphic alleles reached fixation in humans and chimpanze but not bonos, while the ancestral allele is present in macques. CRPR/Cas editing and reporter assays showed that derived nucleides repress AD2, likely by increasing NRS binding. We also detected signatures of recent selection for lower AD2 expression in humans.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanze. The repression of AD2 may have contributed to the emergence of distinct behavioral and physiological traits associated with the fight-or response in these species.

**Conclusions:** This study provides insights into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the repression of AD2 in humans and chimpanze, shedding light on the evolution of enhanced sympathetic activity in these species. Our results highlight the importance of cis-regulatory variants and epigenetic marks in shaping gene expression, and the role of selection in shaping species-specific traits. Future studies in chimpanze and other species will further elucidate the mechanisms of AD2 repression and its impact on behavior and physiology.

**Title:** Convergent Evolution of C4 Photosynthesis in Monocotyledons and Dicotyledons: A Comparative Analysis of Gene Expression and Regulatory Networks

**Research Question:** How do independent lineages of C4 plants use the same genetic networks to maintain C4 photosynthesis, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying the convergent evolution of this complex trait?

**Methods:** We developed a new informatics framework to enable deep comparison of gene expression in species lacking reference genomes and applied it to two C4 lineages (Cle gandra and Ze mays) whose common ancestor diverged ∼140 million years ago. We identified a cohort of 3,335 genes conserved components of leaf and photosynthetic development in these species and showed that genes encoding C cycle proteins are recruited into networks by photos-related genes.

**Findings:** Despite wide separation and independent origins of C phenotype, we report that species use homolog transcription to induce C photosynthesis and maintain specific expression required for pathway. We defined a molecular signature associated leaf and photosyn maturation shared by angios species from common ancestor of monocot and dicot. Deep comparisons revealed insight into molecular convergence of complex phenotypes and parallel evolution transactors underpinning C photosynthesis.

**Implications:** Exploitation of natural variation with complex traits can identify regulators. Shared transcription factors by C lineages are targets for engineering C pathway into C crops such as rice.

**Conclusions:** Evolution C photosynthesis is driven by convergent and parallel changes expression, but governed by same regulators. Our analysis of dicot C gandra and monocot maize provides insight into molecular processes C in distantly related line, also leaf maturation generally. Genes for C cycle co-regulated with photos-related and transcription homolog form cohort underpin C development in species. Transcript overlap in gandra and maize indicates C photos associated parallel evolution transactors. We show not only underpinned by parallel cis and amino substitutions, but expression homolog transcription follow temporal and spatial patterns in line C plants.

**Title:** Investigating the Persistence of Ebola Virus in the Respiratory Tract: Implications for Human-to-Human Transmission

**Background:** The 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBO) epidemic in West Africa rapidly spread to Europe and North America, infecting numerous healthcare workers (HC). Understanding EBO infection patterns in different body compartments is crucial for developing countermeasures and comprehending human-to-human transmission pathways.

**Research Question:** We longitudinally explored the persistence of EBO-specific negative genomic RNA (neg-RNA) and positive RNA (pos-R), including replication (antigenomicRNA) and messenger (mRNA) molecules in the upper and lower respiratory tract compared to plasma in HC infected with EBO in Sierra Leone, hospitalized at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases "Lazz Spallani" IN, Rome, Italy.

**Methods:** We collected and analyzed clinical specimens from the second EVD patient treated at INMI to explore the role of different body compartments in EBO replication.

**Findings:** EBO total RNA, neg-R and pos decayed overtime, significantly different in plasma compared to respiratory samples. Prolonged detection of EBO RNA may reflect stability, but detection of pos-R with neg in samples (day 9 and 10) supports active replication within respiratory rather than plasma-over or stability. Detection of markers in respiratory with absence in plasma (day 5) can be explained by replication in lung tissues.

**Implications:** EBO can replicate in human airways, supported by post-mortem analysis of fatal filoviral infections, including EBO, showing viral antigens in lung tissues and nucleic acids in macrophages.

**Conclusion:** This study enhances knowledge on EBO features contributing to human-to transmissibility and intervention strategies. Further investigation is needed to understand clinical replication and shedding in respiratory tract.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Glycoprotein Domains in the Attenuation and Immunogenicity of Machupo Virus

**Research Question:** What are the specific domains of the Machupo virus (MAC) glycoprotein (GPC) responsible for its attenuation and immunogenicity in a murine models?

**Methods:** We generated recombinant chimeric Machupo viruses (rMAC) expressing the glycoprotein from the Candid#1 (Cd1) strain of Junin virus (JUN), a close relative of MAC, and investigated their replication and lethality in murine models. Specifically, we rescued rMAC with the ectodomain of GPC from Cd1 alone (MC1), with the transmembrane domain (TMD) F438 substitution (MC2), or the TMD of Cd1 (3). We characterized their growth in cultured cells and lethality in mice.

**Findings:** All rMAC exhibited similar growth curves in cultured cells, but MC1 displayed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMAC. MC1 was detected in brains and spleens of MC-infected mice, associated with tissue inflammation. In contrast, animals survived MC2 and MC3 infection without detectable virus in organs, producing neutralizing antibodies against Cd1.

**Implications:** Our data suggest the indispensable role of each GPC domain in full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMAC/Cd1-G. The ectomain of Cd1 G contributes to attenuation, but is not sufficient for complete attenuation, indicating other domains of G may also contribute.

**Conclusions:** This study sheds light on the development of vaccine candidates not only for MAC but also other New arenaviruses. The TMD is important for virulence, but other domains of G may also be important. Our findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of New arenaviruses and development of therapeutic strategies.

**Title:** Elucidating the Functional Constraints of Centromere Histone 3 (CH3) in Arabidopsis thaliana: Implications for Haploid Inducer Identification and Chromosome Segregation

**Research Question:** What are the functional constraints of the centromere histone 3 (CH3) in Arabidopsis thalian, and how do single amino acid substitutions in the histone domain affect chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis?

**Methods:** To investigate the functional constraints of CH3, we complemented a null allele in Arabidopsis with a variety of mutant alleles, each inducing a single amino acid change in conserved of the histone domain. We tested the transgenic lines for fertility, postzygotic death, and uniparent inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants.

**Findings:** Many transgenic lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-poll, but exhibited postzyotic death and uniparent inheritance when crossed with wild-type. The failure of centrom marked by these mutations in the histone domain of CH reproduces the genome syndromes with chimeric CH and CH from diverged species. A single point mutation is sufficient to generate haploid, providing a simple method for identification of non-transgenic haploids in mutagenized collections.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that altering conserved amino acids in the histone domain results in fertile plants that display postzy incompatibility and produce hapids when crossed with wild. Centrom determined by point mutations CH specify chromosome inheritance in self-crosses, but lead misegregation in F hybrid when confronted with centrom determined by wild CH. This suggests that haploids may exist among mutagen populations or natural variants.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of CH in chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis, and provides a simple method for identifying nongenic haploids in mutagen collections. The extreme simplicity of this approach to create haplo-inducing lines is demonstrated by an in silico search of previously identified mutations in CH and an Arabid line carrying the A86 substitution in the histone domain. This nongenic line, while fertile on self-poll, produced postzy death and unip hapids when crossed with wild.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Alternative Splicing in Human Embryonic Stem Cell Self-Renewal, Pluripotency, and Tissue Specification

**Research Question:** The regulatory mechanisms governing alternative splicing (AS) in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) self-renewal, pluripotency, and lineage specification are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we modified the H9 hESC line to enable selection of pluripotent ESCs by neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors by puromycin resistance.

**Methods:** We analyzed exon microarray data from undifferentiated ESCs and cardiac and neural precursors to identify isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common/neural differentiation patterns. Splice events corresponding to cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle control pathways, as well as ser/threon kinase and helicase genes were identified. Using AltAnalyze, a novel program, we predicted changes in protein and microRNA binding architecture affecting function and expression, including enrichment of isoforms opposing cell arrest in ESCs and promoting cardiac development in precursors.

**Findings:** Genome-wide AS predictions combined with functional annotations suggest mechanisms influencing lineage commitment and ESC maintenance at the level of isoforms and microRNA regulation. Genes with cardiac-specific AS patterns included calcium signaling, metabolism, cell cycle, and double-stranded RNA binding proteins. Several confirmed events exhibited cardiac/mus-specific and common-NP differentiation patterns. Results imply loss of pluripency corresponds to AS regulating transcription, cell contact, and metabolism, while cardiac-enrich events favor contractile pathways, neurogenesis, and Wnt signaling. Fifty exons with CP-specific or common-NP patterns were selected for further analysis of domain/mRNA sites, supporting a role in cardiac specification.

**Implications:** These findings offer novel targets for driving pluripotent cells to distinct lineages and inducing pluripency from adult cells at the level of isoforms. Genes undergoing AS during differentiation and observed trends suggest functional elements, such as domains and sites, are coordinately regulated by AS. This study highlights the importance of AS in ESC self-renew, pluripency, and lineage specification, and provides a framework for future research into regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic applications.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into the role of AS in human ESC self-renew, plurip, and lineage specification, and identifies potential targets for inducing pluripotent cells to distinct lineages and inducing plurip from adult cells at the level of isoforms. Further research is needed to experimentally validate protein and miRNA predictions and comparative sequence analysis to delineate common and distinct regulatory sequences.

**Title:** Targeting Trehalose-6-Phosphate Phosphatase B2 for Antimicrobial Therapies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis

**Research Question:** Is Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase B (Tphosphat B) a viable target for antimicrobial therapies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis?

**Methods:** We generated a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis with regulated silencing of the Tphosph B gene (oB) to assess its essentiality in vitro and in vivo.

**Findings:** Tosph B is essential for growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and acute infection in mice, but not in chronic infection, indicating remodelling of trehal metabolism during infection. Blocking Tosph resulted in accumulation of its substrate, trehalose-6-phosphate (TP), which is toxic, leading to cell self-poison. Blocking TP production in a Tph A mutant abrogated Tosph essentiality. TP accumulation elicited global upregulation of over 800 genes, likely due to increased RNA stability and neutralization of ribonuclease activity. Surprisingly, overlap with stress caused by accumulation of another toxic sugar molecule, maltose-1-phosphate, was minimal.

**Implications:** Tosph is a potential target for antimicrobial therapies against M. tuberculosis, as blocking its activity leads to accumulation of toxic TP, which is lethal to cells. Alternative pathways for trehal biosynthesis are present in M. tuberculosis, but Tosph-O-B pathway dominates in vitro and acute infection. Essentiality of Tosph relies on direct or indirect effects of T-mediated TP accumulation.

**Conclusions:** Tosph is a viable target for antimicrobial therapies against M tuberculosis, as blocking its activity leads to accumulation of toxic TP, which is lethal to cells. Alternative pathways for trehal biosynthesis are present in M. tuberculosis, but T-O-B pathway dominates in vitro and acute infection. Essential of Tosph relies on direct or indirect effects T-mediated accumulation.

**Title:** Elucidating the Conformational States of Trypanosoma cruzi Proline Racemase (Tc) through Advanced Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Implications for Chagas Disease Therapeutics

**Research Question:** What are the conformational states of Trypanosoma cruzi proline racemase (T) and how do they contribute to the mitogenic B-cell response in Chagas disease, a life-threatening illness affecting 11-18 million people?

**Methods:** We employed advanced molecular dynamics simulations to extend the effective simulation time scale and capture large motions of functional relevance. Conservation and fragment analyses identified conformation epitopes located in the vicinity of newly identified binding pockets.

**Findings:** Our results reveal the first model of the open form of TPR through state-of-the-art molecular simulation and indicate that mitogenic properties are associated with exposure of conserved conformation epitopes around previously unidentified pockets.

**Implications:** This study advances our understanding of TPR function and provides new insights for structure-based drug discovery. TPR represents a promising target for therapies that may combat Chagas disease more efficiently.

**Conclusions:** Characterization of the conformation states of TPR is critical for rationalizing the molecular basis of the mitogenic B-cell response. This work constitutes an important step toward the development of new treatments for Chagas disease, where current therapies have poor efficacy and safety profiles.

**Title:** Inducible and Reversible Regulation of Gene Expression: A Powerful Approach for Uncovering Gene Function

**Research Question:** We aimed to develop a method for efficiently producing reversible and inducible gene knockout (iKO) and rescue in mice, enabling the target gene to be turned on and off at will by treating mice with doxycycline.

**Methods:** We established a binary system, named iKO, combining two genetically modified mouse lines: a) a KO line with tetracycline-dependent transactivator (rt) replacing the endogenous target gene and b) a line with tetrcline-inducible cDNA of the target inserted into a tightly regulated (TRE) genomic locus, providing low basal expression and high inducibility. We developed a method to introduce genes into the TRE site of embryonic stem (ES) cells by recombinase-mediated insertion. Both KO and TRE lines were engineered for high-throughput, large-scale and cost-effective production of iKO mice.

**Findings:** As a proof of concept, we created iKO mice in apolipoprotein (ApoE) gene, allowing sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. Results demonstrated reversible switching of Apo transcription, plasma levels, atherosclerosis progression, and regression. The i system showed stringent regulation and versatility, easily incorporating other techniques and adapting to a wide range of applications.

**Implications:** The i system complements existing inducible gene expression approaches, providing advantages: 1) tamoxifen-dependent CreERT recombination drives inducible knockout of endogenous gene, but is irreversible; 2) efficiency of tamoxifen inducibility throughout the body yet to be demonstrated; 3) Cre/lox recombination efficiency; 4) streamlined production of KO and TRE makes possible generating iOs for numerous genes in a cost-effective manner; 5) KO and TRE can be independently engineered and combined, making numerous applications possible.

**Conclusions:** We report the development of a system for inducible and reversible gene inactivation in mice, scalable for high-throughput applications. The iKO is a binary approach based on Tet-dependent technology. We applied this method to the Apo gene, demonstrating reversible regulation of transcription, plasma levels, atherosclerosis progression, and regression. The i system is a stringent and versatile tool, easily incorporating other techniques and adapting to a wide range of applications.

**Title:** Congenital Transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi: Unveiling the Placental Genetic Response to Infection through Functional Genomics Analysis

**Research Question:** What is the genetic response of the placental environment to Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection, and how do different T. cruzi strains affect this response?

**Methods:** We performed a functional genomics analysis using microarray in C57/BL/6 mice placentas from uninfected and infected animals with two T. cruz strains: K (a clone of non-lethalotropic CA-I) and V (TVI, isolated from a human congenital case. We analyzed differentially expressed genes using GeneMANIA and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithms.

**Findings:** "Secretoryule" pathway was downregulated in both infected groups, while "Inate Immune Response" and "to Interferon-gamma" pathways were upregulated in V but not K. Metabolic processes and macromolecular transport were downregulated in infected placentas, and pathways related to signaling had opposite regulation: overpresent in V and downregulated K. We found stronger tropism to the placental organ by V strain, detecting parasite DNA and RNA.

**Implications:** Our study is the first to describe the genetic response of placent to T. cruz infection in a murine model, suggesting a strong parasite-dependent immune response, detrimental to cellular metabolism, which may prevent congenital transmission risk.

**Conclusions:** The placenta is a complex environment where mother and fetus interact, and T. cruz infection alters immunoregulatory circuits. Our study highlights the role of T. cruz genotypes in pregnancy and congenital infection, and the importance of functional genomics in understanding host-pathogen interactions. The upregulation of genes in antigen processing and presentation in placent during V infection may indicate defense against fetal infection.

**Title:** Investigating Sindbis Virus (SINV) Outbreaks in Northern Europe: A Vector Abundance and Prevalence Analysis in Mosquitoes from an Endemic Area in Central Sweden

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the Sindbis virus (SINV) outbreaks in northern Europe by evaluating mosquito abundance and prevalence in vector mosquitoes from an endemic area in central Sweden.

**Methods:** Mosquitoes were collected from the Riveräl floodplains in Sweden during 2001, 2002, and 2003 and assayed for virus on cell culture. Obtained isolates were partially sequenced and nucleotide sequences analyzed using Bayesian clade and median network analysis.

**Findings:** One SINV strain was recovered in 2001, 4 strains in 200, and 15 in 200 with increased infection rates in both enzotic and bridge vectors in 200. Maximum Likelihood infection rates were 10.0/100 in enotic Cx torrentipiens and 0.62/100 in bridge Aedes in 200, compared to 4.9/100 and 0.0/100 in 1 and 0.0/100 and 0.32 in 200. Sequence analysis showed all isolates belonged to S genotype S-I (S-I). Genetic analysis revealed local maintenance of S-I clades in Riveräl floodplains over years.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest increased S-I prevalence in vector constitutes valuable marker for scrutinizing hypothesized seven-year cycle S-I outbreaks and mechanisms behind.

**Conclusions:** This study provides first objective evidence for SINV outbreaks in northern Europe. Higher S-I prevalence in enotic vector during 200 than 200 coincides with hypothesized seven-year reoccurrence, although picture unclear comparing annual reported cases. Distinctly higher S prevalence in enotic during 200 than 200 is mirrored in increased S antibody in main host population. Documented S prevalence in Riveräl floodplains during 200 and 200 than interepid years provides markers for S polyarthritis in northern Europe.

**Title:** Investigating the Interplay between Neural Coding Mechanisms and Plasticity in the Locust Olfactory System

**Research Question:** How do multiple coding mechanisms interact and integrate in the locust olfactory system, and what role does synaptic plasticity play in regulating the specificity of Kenyon cell responses to familiar odors?

**Methods:** We recorded in vivo from Kenyon cells (KC) in the mushroom body (MB) of locusts and found that only a few KCs responded reliably to specific odors. We developed a biologically plausible model to explore the possibility that synaptic plasticity at the synapses between antennal lobe (AL) and MB regulates the specificity of KC responses to familiar odors.

**Findings:** Plasticity at AL-MB synapses efficiently filtered the intense oscillatory output of AL and condensed it to a sparse representation in MB. Activity-dependent plasticity drove the specificity, reliability, and persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role for plasticity in information processing.

**Implications:** Our study is consistent with recent results supporting pre-synaptic plasticity between Kenyon cells and mushroom extrinsic neurons as critical in olfactory memory. Synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses may be a key mechanism for learning and memory formation in the locust olfactory system.

**Conclusions:** The locust olfactory system provides a well-stud preparation for investigating the interplay of coding mechanisms and plasticity. Our results suggest that plasticity at AL-M synapses regulates the specificity of KC responses to familiar odors, supporting the idea that sparseness is a coding strategy exploited by different modalities across organisms. This study provides a testable prediction for synaptic plasticity at AL-M synapses and highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between neural coding mechanisms and plasticity in the locust olfactory system.

**Title:** The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene (ST) Study: Identifying Functionally Associated Genes for Coronary Artery Disease Development

**Research Question:** Do functionally associated genes, rather than individual genes, play a crucial role in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD)?

**Methods:** The ST study employed two-way clustering on transcription profiles of liver, skeletal muscle, and visceral fat tissues (n=66/tissue) and atherosclerotic and unaffected arterial wall (n=40/tissue) isolated from CAD patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. mRNA signals (15,042/12,621 RefSeq/genes) in each tissue resulted in 60 tissue clusters (395 genes). Within clusters, atherosclerotic lesion (49/48) and visceral (59) segregated patients into two groups differing in coronary stenosis (P=0.008 and P=0.000).

**Findings:** Associations with coronary atherosclerosis were validated by carotid atheros expression profiles. One cluster (55/54) relating caridosis (P=0.04) and 27 genes in two clusters relating coronaryenosis confirmed (16/17, P<−27−30). Genes in transendothelial migration leukocytes (TE) pathway were overrepresented in three clusters, referred as atherosclerosis module (A-module). A-module was found genetically enriched in CAD by 1.8-fold (P0.004) in three independent cohorts. Transcription-factor LIM binding 2 (L2) was identified as a high-hierarchy regulator A-module, supported by subnetwork analysis, cellular expression L2, and expression 13TE genes in L2-deficient wall.

**Implications:** The A-module appears crucial for atherosclerosis development, with L2 deserving further attention in CAD research. The study identified 128 genes strongly associated with atherosclerosis (A-module) were found in atherosclerotic arterial and visceral fat. Seven genes (12,14) were present in both clusters. Two clusters segregated patients into groups according coronaryen (P=0.008 and P=0.000).

**Conclusion:** The ST study aimed to determine functionally associated genes for CAD, revealing 60 clusters (395 genes) in five-relevant tissues. A-module was found enriched in CAD and involved TE pathway. A-module active in atherosclerotic wall and visceral fat. Overlap between atheros-related clusters in arterial and fat was 12,14. Two clusters segregated patients according coronaryen (P=0.008 and P=0.000). Clinical phenotypes were similar in patients with gene profiles from visceral, liver, muscle, and atheroserotic, unaffected wall. A-module represents biological activity for atherosclerosis, with L2 a potential regulator.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of KaiC Phospho-States in Transcriptional Regulation of the Cyanobacterial Circadian Clock

**Research Question:** How do the different phospho-states of KaiC regulate the transcription of its own gene, kai, in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus, and what is the underlying mechanism of this regulation?

**Methods:** We developed a combined transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TT/PT) model incorporating four phospho-states of KaiC and tested various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional feedback to reproduce experimental observations, including knockout and overexpression of kai genes.

**Findings:** Our simulations revealed that threonine and double-phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate kai transcription, while unosphorylated Kai hexers suppress it. The peak ratio of positive and negative components of kai expression determines the response to removal or overexpression of k genes.

**Implications:** Our TT/PT model, with various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional regulation, can help reveal how the circadian pathways allow Kai protein to control rhythmically regulate hundreds of genes in the cyanobacterial genome. Our results support the view that phospho-states of Kai govern the timing of the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator and output 24-hour gene rhythms.

**Conclusions:** The phospho-states of Kai play a crucial role in regulating the cyanobacterial circadian clock, with threon and double-phosphorylated Kai hexers promoting and unosphory Kai hexers suppressing kai transcription. The peak ratio of positive and negative components of kai expression determines the response to removal or overexpression of k genes. Our TTPT model provides a framework for understanding the complex regulation of the cyanobacterial circadian clock, with parallels to mammalian clock mechanisms.

**Title:** Investigating the Pathogenic and Replicative Potential of HIV-2: A Comparative Analysis of HIV-2 Reservoirs in Non-Progressors and Progressors

**Research Question:** The pathogenic and replicative potential of HIV-2 is poorly understood. We investigated whether HIV-2 reservoirs follow the distribution patterns reported in attenuated HIV-1/SIV infections, i.e., limited infection of central-memory CD4 T lymphocytes (TCM).

**Methods:** Antiretroviral-naive HIV-2 infected individuals from ANRS O12 (non-progressors, progress) were prospectively included. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were sorted into monocytes and CD4-cell subsets (naive [TN], central [TCM], transitional [TM], and effector [TEM]. Reactivation of HIV-2 was tested in 30-day cultures CD-depleted PBMC. HIV-2 was quantified by real-time PCR. Cell markers, co-receptors, and restriction factors were analyzed by flow cytometry and multiplex transcriptomic study.

**Findings:** HIV-2 was undetectable in monocytes from all individuals and quantifiable in TM from 4 individuals (median: 2.25 x 10^6 copies/ cells [IQR: 1.99-2.94) but in TC from only 1 (1.75 x 10^6 cells). HIV-2 levels in PBMC (median: 1.94 x 10^6 PB [IQR 1.53-2.13) positively correlated with TM (r = 0.66, p = 0.01) but not TC. HIV-activation was observed in cells from only 3. CCR co-receptor was distributed similarly in populations from individuals. TC had lower CX6 transcripts (p = 0.002) and higher TR5 transcripts (p = 0.004) than TM.

**Implications:** HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 reservoirs by lack of monocytic infection and limited TC infection associated with lower CX6 expression and higher TR5. These findings shed light on pathogenic mechanisms of HIV-2 suggesting close to attenuated HIV/SIV models.

**Conclusion:** Our study provides immunological characterization of HIV-2 peripheral cell reservoirs in infected with poorly HIV-2 and slow or absent progression. Analysis demonstrates HIV-2 reservoirs have characteristics different from HIV-1 by lack of monocytic infection and trend towards predominance in TM over TC. To understand determinants of atypical distribution, we performed multiplex profiling of 96 genes in each CD subset (TN, TCM, TM, TEM) and monocytes from 14 HIV-2 subjects. Two attributes characterize distribution: lack of HIV in monocytes and low TC infection due to CX6 expression and TR5.

**Title:** Mechanistic Modeling of Selective Attention in the Visual Cortex: The Attention Routing Circuit (ARC) Model

**Research Question:** How do neurons in the visual cortex process selective attention, and what are the underlying mechanisms that govern this process?

**Methods:** We developed a spiking neuron model called the Attention Routing Circuit (ARC) that provides a mechanistic description of selective attentional processing in the visual cortex. The model is mathematically implemented at the level of individual neurons, with computations for selective attention mapped to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry. We used ARC to simulate three studies of attention in macaques and quantitatively matched several forms of attentional modulation.

**Findings:** ARC demonstrates that shifts in spatial attention result in shrinking of receptive fields, increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features (i.e., response gain), and that the effect on contrast-response is better explained as response-gain than contrast-gain. Unlike past models, ARC embodies a single mechanism unifying the forms of attention modulation, consistent with a wide array of available data and making specific and quantifiable predictions.

**Implications:** The ARC model overcomes limitations of past models by providing a unified explanation of attentional effects, implemented in spiking neurons, defining attentional modulation across cortical areas, and quantitatively comparing to physiological data, and making testable predictions. Our results suggest that spatial attention only affects neural selectivity, without altering selectivity other dimensions, distinguishing ARC from normalization model. The ARC predicts seemingly forms attention modulation are consequences of single selective routing mechanism.

**Conclusions:** We present a model of visual attention that mechanistically describes selective processing in the cortex, fully implemented in spiking, with computations for attention mapped to neuron and laminar circuit. ARC's mechanisms for routing predict attention only affects spatial selectivity, without selectivity other features, a prediction distinguishing from normalization model. The primary prediction of ARC is that forms attention modulation are of single mechanism selective routing. We demonstrate biological plausibility of model with spiking implementation accounting five forms attention effects. A qualitative observation from model, supported, is proportion neurons higher cortical show attention modulation, as result switching default to selective during attention tasks. ARC predicts magnitude increase higher areas.

**Title:** Investigating the Genetic Underpinnings of Atrial Fibrillation: A Whole-Exome Sequencing Analysis of a Large Community-Based Sample

**Research Question:** What is the contribution of coding genetic variation to the susceptibility of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and debilitating arrhythmia?

**Methods:** We conducted a whole-exome sequencing analysis of a large community-based sample of 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 without AF from the Framingham Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Atherosclerosis in Communities, and NHLBI-G Exome Sequencing Project. We examined whether genetic variation was enriched in suspected AF genes (n=37) in cases versus controls.

**Findings:** None of the 99,404 common variants evaluated was significantly associated with AF after adjusting for multiple testing. The most significantly associated variant was a common allele (86%) missense in SYN2 (rs262, p.Pro707Le, odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.43, P=6.6x10-5), which lies at a known AF locus and is in linkage disequilibrium with a marker from prior analyses. We did not observe associations between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. Individuals with AF did not display statistically significant enrichment for common or rare variation in previously implicated AF genes.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF. A variant in SYN2 requires further evaluation to determine its causal relationship to AF. Efforts to identify biologically meaningful variation underlying AF may require large sample sizes or populations enriched for genetic effects.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to the understanding of AF's genetic underpinnings, underscoring the complexity of the arrhythm. Whole-exome sequencing may help clarify the genetic contributions to AF. Our findings highlight the need for larger sample sizes or populations to identify therapeutic targets through exome analyses.

**Title:** Emerging Alveolar Echinoccosis in Poland: A Decadal Analysis of Human Cases and Implications for Public Health Policy

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of alolar echoccosis (AE) caused by Echinoccus multularis in Poland over the last two decades, analyzing cases detected through official and active laboratory surveillance, clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory verification criteria.

**Methods:** A total of 121 human AE cases were detected, with 83 (68.6%) classified as confirmed, 16 as probable, and 22 as possible. The mean age at diagnosis was 47.7 years, with a sex ratio M/F of 0.86:1.0. AE was fatal in 23% (19) patients, with a mean age at death 54.1 years. Aggregation of AE was found in 4 foci involving 9 patients, with 76 cases diagnosed in advanced stage. The liver was the primary location in all cases, with 30 (24.8%) showing spread to other organs. 94 patients were treated with albendazole, and 73 (60%) underwent surgery, including 15 liver transplantations.

**Findings:** The study confirms AE as an emerging disease in Poland, ranking 4th in Europe with over 120 cases. Results indicate the need for a national screening program in high-risk areas (northern Poland) and public awareness of E. multular and training primary care physicians for early detection.

**Implications:** The study highlights the need for:

1. **National screening program in high-risk areas (northern Poland)**
2. Public awareness of E. multular
3. Training primary care physicians for early detection

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the increasing incidence of AE in Poland, emphasizing the need for public health policy to address this emerging disease.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanism of Zinc Sensing in Escherichia coli: Unvealing the Role of the Zinc-Sensing Uptake Regulator (Zur) Protein in Gene Regulation

**Research Question:** How do microorganisms, whether beneficial or pathogenic, respond to fluctuations in zinc availability at the molecular level, and what is the mechanism of the zinc-sensing uptake regulator (Zur) protein in Escheria coli?

**Methods:** We investigated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing uptake regulator (Zur) protein at each of the known-regulated genes in Escheria coli by solving the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PnuABC promoter and analyzing protein-DNA interactions.

**Findings:** Our results show that zinc-loaded Zur represses gene expression by cooperative binding of two dimers to the core element of each-regulated promoters. Cooperativity in protein-DNA interactions requires a pair of salt bridges between Arg and Asp that connect independent dimers. Analysis of protein-DNA led to the discovery of a new-regulated gene, plG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc manner. The plG forms complexes with one or two dimers with less protein-D cooperativity than other-reg promoters. Comparison of in vitro-D binding at each-reg promoters reveals a 10,000-fold variation in Zur-D constants. The degree of repression in vivo by transcript number in wild-type and Δur strains parallels this trend, spanning a 100-fold.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the number of ferric uptake regulator (ur) dimers that bind any promoter varies significantly and the thermodynamic of protein-D interactions correlates with physiological response at different promoters. These results support the idea that thermodynamics of ensemble protein-D interactions play a dominant role in gene regulation. Our results open the door to understanding how availability and partial occupancy of zinc sites in repressor can fine-tune responsive expression across promoters.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a layer of regulation based on differential affinities zinc-saturated dimers for various promoters in this regulon. Transcription factors control diverse factors, including membrane metal transporters, optimize physiology in face shifts metal availability. Zinc regulator (ur) is a homolog of ferric regulator (ur), one of the first metalregulatory proteins identified. Our results provide strong support for the idea that thermodynamics protein-D interactions play a crucial role in gene regulation and open new avenues for understanding zinc sensing in microorganisms.

**Title:** Understanding the Recurrent Transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus in the Madagascar Highlands: A Spatial Discrete-Time Metapulation Model Approach

**Research Question:** What are the key determinants of the recurrent transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVF) in the Madagascar highlands, despite unfavorable climatic conditions for mosquito proliferation?

**Methods:** A spatial discrete-time metapulation model combined with cattle network was designed and parameterized to reproduce local conditions using observational data. Three scenarios were analyzed: (i) RVV overwintering due to direct transmission between vemic cows, (ii) low vector-based circulation due to residual population, and (iii) combination of both.

**Findings:** Multi-model inference resulted in a model incorporating both low RVV vector-borne transmission and direct transmission between vemic cows. Predictions satisfactorily reproduced field observations, with 84% of cattle infections attributed to vector-borne and 16 to direct transmission. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis.

**Implications:** Interactions between agricultural practices, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange may be key to understanding RVV circulation in this area.

**Conclusions:** Our study suggests that in Madagascar highlands, recurrent RVV circulation is attributable to both vector-borne (mainly) and direct transmission between vemic cows. Socio-economic practices appear determinant in virus introduction and persistence.

**Title:** Unveiling the Invasion History and Population Structure of the Invasive Asian Tiger Mosquito, Aedes albopictus, in the Indo-Pacific Region

**Research Question:** What are the historical and contemporary movements of the invasive Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albictus, in the Indo-Pacific region, and what is its population structure?

**Methods:** We analyzed 13 microsatellite loci from 911 individuals and mitochondrial COI sequences to understand the historical and contemporary movements of Ae. albict in the Indo-Pacific. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) was employed to test competing routes of invasion of Ae. albict within the Southeast Asian/Australian region.

**Findings:** Our results show that Ae. albict was likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Asia, colonizing the Solomon Islands via Papua New Guinea or Asia. The analysis supported recent incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait was seeded from Indonesia. Notably, we found evidence of a recently colonized population in the Torres Islands that has undergone rapid genetic changes, potentially due to genetic drift or secondary invasion from an unknown source. High genetic structure and gene flow exist between geographically distant populations, suggesting dispersal driven by human movements.

**Implications:** This study provides a more widespread distribution of the species' native range, revealing spatial structure not previously shown. We present the probable invasion history of Ae. albict in the Australasian region using ABC analysis.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to use ABC to compare invasion scenarios of Ae. albict in the Australasian region and explore genetic structure of populations in the Indo-Pacific. We found temporal structure in introduced Torres Island populations, demonstrating drastic changes within a short period (less than a decade), impacting practicality and accuracy of genetic databases for estimating invasion sources. Established populations of Ae. albict in the Indo region have high genetic structure, favoring dispersal driven by human movements.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Schistosoma mansoni Infection on Children's Physical Health and Well-being: A Study of Morbidity Indicators and Quality of Life among School-aged Children in Tanzania

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) infection on morbidity indicators, with emphasis on quality of life (Peds) and physical fitness (VO2max) among school-aged children in Tanzania.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted among 572 children aged 7-8 years in Mwan Region, Tanzania. Prevalence of S. mans was 58.7% with an arithmetic mean (95% CI) of 207.3 (169.2-245.4) eggs per gram (pg). Infections were mostly light (56.5%), while 16.4% had heavy infections. Girls had significantly higher mean intensities (95 CI) than boys (247.4 (189.2-305.6) vs 153.2 (110.6-195.8); P=0.004). Total 30.1% were anemic with no sex difference. Stunting and wasting were less than 10% of the population.

**Findings:** There was no association between S. mans prevalence or intensities and anthropometry, anemia, or spleen pathology in univar nor multivar linear analyses. However, in univar analyses, children with S infection had significantly lower in Peds (95 CI) than uninfected (77.3 (74.5-80.1) vs 82.7 (79.9-85.5); P=0.033) and infected had higher VOmax (95) compared to uninf (51.4 (51.0-51.8) vs 50.8 (50.3-51.3); P=0.042). In multivar regression, age, S infection, hemoglobin, and VOmax were predictors for Peds while predictors VOmax were PQL, height, age, and hemoglobin. S was not retained in multivar analyses VOmax.

**Implications:** S mans infection had a significant effect on the emotional dimension of quality of life, but not physical fitness. PQL could be useful to measure schosome morbidity, but more studies are needed to refine the tool to focus on aspects of quality life affected by schosome infections.

**Conclusion:** This study found that among morbidity parameters, only the emotional dimension of quality of life was associated with S mans infection in children aged 7-8. This contrasts with two studies using same tool, which found no association between quality of life and infections at individual level. S infection was not associated with physical fitness using 20mRT, in line with other studies using same test.

**Title:** Comparative Analysis of Subcutaneous, Mucosal, and Intraperitoneal Routes of Leptira Infection in Adult Rats: Implications for Rat-Rat Transmission

**Research Question:** What are the effects of subcutaneous, mucosal, and intraperitoneal inoculation routes on Leptira colonization and urinary excretion in adult rats, and how do these findings inform our understanding of rat-rat transmission?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of subcut, mucosal, and intraper inoculation routes on Lept infection in adult rats using Lept isolation, serology, and histological analyses. Eight rats were inoculated subcutaneously, 8 mucosally, and 8 intraperitoneally with Lept. Renal colonization rates were 8/8, 5/8, and 1/8 for subcut, muc, and intraper routes, respectively.

**Findings:** Lept infection was asymptomatic regardless of inoculation route, with similar antibody production. Mucosal inoculation was more efficient for renal colonization with urinary excretion than subcut, and induced slower infection than intraper. These results facilitate understanding of infection modalities in rats, unlike epidemiological studies in wild rats.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that mucosal inoculation is a more efficient route for renal colonization with urinary excretion than subcut, and slower than intraper route. This informs ratat transmission studies and infection kinetics. The intraper route is nonatural Lept infection in rat colonies, and details transmission between rats unknown. Natural routes could explain heterogeneity renal carriage in rat colonies from same region.

**Conclusions:** This study provides first analysis of sub, muc, andaper routes Lept infection in adult rats. Mucosal inoculation is more efficient for renal colonization with urinary excretion than subcut and slower than intraper. These findings inform ratat transmission and infection kinetics. Future studies of natural routes in rat models will increase knowledge of ratat disease and allow investigation infection kinetics.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Annexin A2 in Regulating Inflammatory Responses during Seps: A Novel Insights into the AnxA-ROS-IL-17 Axis

**Research Question:** What is the role of Annexin A2 (AnxA) in modulating inflammatory responses during seps, a life-threatening disease characterized by excessive inflammation, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction, and mortality?

**Methods:** We employed a mouse model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis to investigate the function of AnxA in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling.

**Findings:** AnxA- mice exhibited increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, decreased bacterial clearance, and survival. AnxA deficiency led to intensified ROS and IL-17 levels. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed cystine 9 of AnxA was crucial for ROS regulation. ROS was responsible for elevated IL-17 levels and exaggerated response. Depletion of IL-17 via CRISPR/Cas KO downregulated inflammation and conferred protection against seps in An- mice.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel function of AnxA in regulating inflammatory responses in polymicrobial seps models via the AnxA-ROS-IL-17 axis, providing insights into the pathophysiology of seps. AnxA functions as a putative ROS inhibitor in seps progression, with cystine 9 being the most important site for oxidation. AnxA may mitigate seps severity by modulating ROS and IL-17 levels. Targeting neutrophils in seps may be a therapeutic strategy.

**Conclusions:** AnxA plays a critical role in inhibiting inflammatory responses by regulating ROS and IL-17 in seps. Our data indicate IL-17 is regulated by ROS, and inflammation reduced after IL-17 knockdown. Increased IL-17 correlates with ROS in An- mice, and IL- KO inhibits response in seps mice. As an intracellular protein, An is involved in diverse processes, including innate immunity, endosome function, and inflammation. Overall, AnxA is a mediator in host defense against seps using the CL model. An- mice exhibit severe seps phenotype, excessive macrophages, neutils, decreased survival, increased response, impaired clearance, and tissue injuries.

**Title:** Polyinosine-polycidylic acid (Poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of Toll-like receptors TLR3 and TLR4 abrogates HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) through microRNA-155-mediated post-entry restriction

**Research Question:** How do Poly(I:C and LPS stimulation of Toll-like receptors TLR3 and TLR4 influence HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MD)?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of Poly(I:C and LPS stimulation on HIV-1 infection in MD using CCR5-using macrophage-tropic HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudyped HIV-1 virions. TLR2, T7, and T9 agonists were also tested for comparison.

**Findings:** Poly(I and L-stimulation abrogated HIV-1 infection in MD, while TLR, T7, or T9 agonists only partially reduced infection to varying extent. Suppression of infection did not correlate with differential effects on CD4 or C5 expression, type interferon induction, or pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. Integrated viruses were detected in unstimulated T7 and T9-stimulated cells, but not T3 or T4-stim MDs, suggesting alteration of post-entry preintegration events. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed increased microRNA-155 (mi) levels in MD upon T3 but not T7 stimulation, and mi-155 inhibitor partially restored infectivity in Poly-stimulated MDs. Ectopic mi-155 expression diminished HIV-1 in primary MD and cell lines.

**Implications:** Our findings provide evidence that mi-155 exerts anti-HIV effect by targeting HIV-1 factors involved in post-entry preintegration, leading to diminished HIV-1 infection.

**Conclusions:** Poly(I and L stimulation of Toll-like receptors T3 and T4 abrogates HIV-1 infection in monocyte macrophages through microRNA-155-mediated post-entry restriction. Micro-155 targets HIV-1 factors involved in trafficking and nuclear import of preintegration complexes, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection.

**Title:** Deciphering the Interplay between Circadian Clock, Light, and Hormone Signaling Pathways in Regulating Plant Growth Rhythms

**Research Question:** How do the circadian clock, light, and hormone signaling pathways interact to control plant growth rhythms, particularly in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings?

**Methods:** We employed DNA microarray analysis of the Arabidopsis thalian seedling transcriptome under multiple growth conditions and mutant backgrounds to identify transcriptional components associated with rhythmic growth control.

**Findings:** A group of hormone-associated genes were co-expressed at the time of maximal hypocotyl growth, correlating with overrepresentation of a cis-acting element (CAT) in phytohorm gene promoters, sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian expression in vivo. Circadian and light mutants showed that internal phyhorm signaling and external coincidence with darkness are required for wild-type growth.

**Implications:** The circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive of light-mediated phyhorm transcript levels at the proper time of day, allowing plants to fine-tune phyh responses for seasonal and shade-appropriate growth.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a transcriptional module associated with increase growth, regulated by coordination of internal phyh pathways with external dark-light transition at dawn. The circadian acts upstream of light to gate phyh gene expression during the evening, ensuring time-specific growth. Integration of transcriptional component of phyh pathways is part of specificity and redundancy. The extensive network governed by circadian, light, temperature, and cycles ensures 90% of Arabidopsis transcripts accumulate at specific times over the day.

**Title:** Harnessing RNA Interference Technologies for Sustainable Control of Rhodnius prolix, a Vector of Chagas Disease: Modifying the Insect Microbiota for Systemic Delivery of dsRNA

**Research Question:** Can RNA interference (RNAi) technologies be used to control Rhodni prolix, a vector of Chagas disease, by modifying the insect microbiota to deliver dsRNA molecules to the gut?

**Methods:** We investigated the use of Escherichia coli HT115(DE3) expressing dsRNA for Rhodni heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT) to feed nymph and adult stages of Rhni prolix. RHBP is an egg protein and CAT an antioxidant expressed in all developmental stages. RNA interference was systemic and temporal. Concentrations of E coli115(DE) above 3.35 × 10^7 CFU/mL produced significant RH and CAT knockdown in nymphs and adults.

**Findings:** RH expression in the body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days after. CAT expression was reduced 99% and 96 in ovary and posterior midgut, respectively, five days after ingestion. Mortality increased 24-30 in first instars fed RH and CAT. Molting rates reduced 100 in first and 80 third instars fed bacteria RH or CAT. Oviposition reduced 43 RH and 84 CAT. Embogenesis arrested 16 RH and 20 of eggs. Feeding 105 CF/mL natural symbion Rhodoccus rhodii expressing RH-specific hairpin RNA reduced RH expression 89 and oviposition.

**Implications:** Modifying the insect microbiota to induce RNAi Rh prolix may result in a paratgenic strategy for sustainable vector control. Rhodni to produce dsRNA for genes important in development, fecundity, and vector competence.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the potential of RNA interference technologies for controlling Rhni prolix, a vector of Chagas disease, by modifying the insect microbiota to deliver dsRNA to the gut. Our results show that E. coli can express and deliver RH and CAT dsRNA into the midgut of Rh prolix, leading to systemic RNA spread to the body, anterior midg, and ovaries. Modified symbiotic Rhodii were effective in inducing gene silencing with physiological effects. Catal expression reduced in various tissues, suggesting silencing efficacy not determined by proximity to ds source. Early stage receiving bacterial treatment, higher impact on fitness, first instars presented 30 mortality. Data suggest CAT combined with molecular targets reduce fecund and development through RNA.

**Title:** Investigating the Causes of Fever in Pregnant Women on the Thai-Burm Border: A Prospective Cohort Study

**Research Question:** What are the causes of fever in pregnant women on the Thaiurm border, and how do they impact maternal and fetal outcomes?

**Methods:** A prospective cohort study was conducted from January 2004 to May 2006, where pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics were screened for malaria weekly. Women with fever were admitted to hospital, treated, and followed up until delivery. Convalescent serum was collected on day 21. Outcomes were recorded.

**Findings:** Fever episodes (n=438) occurred in 5.0% (409/8,117) of pregnant women. Malaria was the main cause in 55.5% (227/409). A cohort of 203 (49.6%409) had detailed investigations. Arthrop-borne (malaria, ricketial, and dengue) and zoon disease (leptosis) accounted for nearly half all febr illnesses 47.3 (96). Coinfection was observed 3.9 (8) mostly malaria ricketia. Pyonephritis 19.7 (40) was also common. Once malaria pyoneph and respiratory illness excluded, one-third febr infections were caused ricket or leptosis. Scr and murine typhus were associated with poor outcomes including stillbirth and low birth.

**Implications:** Malaria remains the leading cause of fever in pregnancy on Thaiurm border. Scr and murine typhus also important causes poor outcomes. Pregnant women on Thaiurm border without malaria pyone or respiratory infection should be treated with azithrom for typh and leptosis.

**Conclusion:** Fever in pregnancy increases maternal and infant mortality. Little is known about fever etiology in resource populations. This study aimed to identify causes of fever in pregnant women on Thaiurm border. Fever occurred 5% (4098,117) and malaria 55.5 (227) of febr women had malaria. Despite reduction, malaria remains leading cause in low transmission area. Arthrop (malaria, ricket, andeng) and zoon (leptosis) accounted for half febr illnesses. Coinfection observed in 3.9 mostly malaria ricket. Pyone 19.7 also common. Scr and typh associated poor outcomes.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Maternal Age and Recombination in Humans: A Genome-Wide Analysis of 600,000 Markers in 69 French-Canadian Pedigrees

**Research Question:** How does maternal age affect recombination in humans, particularly in relation to trisomies and aneuploidy?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide analysis of 600,000 markers in 69 French-Canadian pedigrees to investigate the relationship between maternal age and recombination. Using a previously described method, we localized recombination events at high resolution in 195 maternal meios.

**Findings:** We observed a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age in humans, driven by chromosome-specific effects. The effect is localized in the middle of chromosomal arms and subtelomeric regions.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that protection against non-disjunction provided by recombination becomes less efficient with advancing maternal age, contributing to higher rates of aneuploidy in older women. We propose a model reconciling our results with associations between maternal age and recombination in trisomies.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of maternal age-related effects on recombination in humans, particularly in relation to trisom and aneupidy. Chromosome-specific effects may vary among populations due to genetic differences in regulating recombination machinery. Our results support this hypothesis, with significant decay observed on nine chromosomes in French-Canadian cohort and two in Hutter. The most critical factor linked to chromosomal anupidy in women is maternal age. Little is known about age-related causes non-disjunction; our study establishes associations between patterns of re and maternal age in meios. Recombination initiated during fetal development in mammals can still influence re. Not all tris affected equally by maternal age, suggesting distinct mechanisms apply to anup conceptions. Our data emphasize that chromosomes are subjected to distinct selective, mechanistic or structural constraints influencing recombination over generations.

**Title:** Inducing Innate Memory in Macrophages via IFN-γ Priming: A Novel Vaccine Strategy for Opportunistic Infections in Immunocompromised Patients

**Research Question:** Can IFN-γ priming of macrophages in vivo induce a long-lasting innate memory phenotype and provide protection against opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients?

**Methods:** We employed an experimental immunization strategy to prime macrophages in vivo with IF-γ, a cytokine that plays a crucial role in innate immunity. Unlike traditional trained immunity models, our approach induced an innate-like phenotype in macrophages that persisted for at least 70 days post-immunization, conferring complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells.

**Findings:** RNA-seq analysis of IF-primed macrophages revealed rapid upregulation of IF-γ and STAT signaling pathways following secondary challenge. Enhanced cytokine responses were pathogen-specific, dependent on histone methylation and acetylation, and correlated with increased STAT binding to promoter regions of genes associated with anti-fungal immunity.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate an alternative mechanism to induce macroph innate memory in vivo, facilitating pathogen-specific vaccine-mediated responses. IF- priming macroph is a novel therapeutic approach that selectively targets IF- associated genes, leaving TLR and CLR functions intact for host defense. We show that macrophages can be primed in vivo with IF- to expedite STAT activation, maintain innate phenotype for 70 days, and provide complete protection against secondary challenge.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest immunization strategies driving memory-like innate responses may provide a novel mechanism for vaccine protection in immunocomised patients. This concept is supported by our previous studies using a fungal model delivering IF- in vivo to induce immunity in cell-deficient and CD4+/8 T-depleted mice. Our data are the first to show in vivo IF- priming of macroph extends memory-like phenotype, providing protection against subsequent infection. Defects in trained immunity have been documented in patients with STAT-mediated mucocutaneous candidiasis and blockade of IF- in PBs primed with C. Thus, priming macro via STAT activation is important for memory-like priming, correlating with microbial infection rather than microbial products.

**Title:** Unraveling the Specificity of Polycomb Repressive Complexes in Plant Developmental Regulation: A Quantitative Analysis of H3K27me3 in Arabidopsis Mutants

**Background:** Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play crucial roles in transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in both plants and animals. Depletion of PR components causes overlapping and unique phenotypic defects, yet the molecular mechanisms determining specificity and functional diversity are not fully understood.

**Research Question:** How do different PR members regulate distinct developmental programs, and what factors modulate their specificity?

**Methods:** We employed a newly developed package for quantitative epigenomic data analysis to compare genome-wide H3me3 and expression profiles in loss-of-function mutants of PR1 (BMI, At1, RING, and L1) and PR2 (CL) components in Arabidopsis seedlings.

**Findings:** We found that CURL LEAF (CL), a catalytic subunit of PR2, coordinates with PR1 members in suppression of distinct developmental programs. Expression of flower genes is repressed in seedlings via non-redundant role of CL, associated with LIKE HETCHROMIN PROTEIN1 (LHP). In contrast, expression of embryo genes is repressed by PR-catal coreunits AtBMI and At1RING in common with PR-catal enzymes CL or SWINGER (SW). This context-dependent role of CL corresponds with H3me profiles and is associated differential occupancy of transcription factors (TFs), including MADS and ABA-related.

**Implications:** Different PR members regulate distinct developmental programs, and their specificity is modulated by TFs. Our study provides a genome-wide understanding of PR specificity and highlights the importance of chromo-domain proteins in epigen modifications.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that PR employ multiple strategies for H3me maintenance at loci, using L1 or cooperating with coreunits of PR to create compact chrom structures. We propose that in addition to common targets At1, At1 also participate in regulating Hme modifications and expression for several genes CL and L (Figs 3 and 4), which may explain aberrant flower development in a1, but not b. Our results are analogous to a recent study on human blood development, indicating that PR composition regulates transcriptional programs.

**Title:** Dissecting the Mechanisms of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA Polymerase II at the Individual Residue Level: A Quantitative Phenotyping of TL Variants Reveals Insights into Substrate Selection, Catalysis, and Translocation**

**Research Question:** How do individual residues within the trigger loop (TL) of Saccharomycesvis RNA polymerase II contribute to substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation?

**Methods:** We employed a quantitative phenotyping approach to analyze nearly all single-residue variants of the TL in Sacomycesvis RNAase II, identifying three classes of mutants linked to transcription defects or stress responses. Our results reveal distinct distributions of phenotypes among TL residues.

**Findings:** Disrupting the intra-TL hydrophobic pocket, proposed to facilitate substrate-trigger TL folding through destabilization of a catalytically inactive state, confers phenotypes consistent with pocket disruption and increased catalysis. Allele-specific interactions among TL and TL-proximal residues support the contribution of funnel and bridge helices (BH) to TL dynamics.

**Implications:** Our study provides a high-resolution dissection of transcription mechanisms and evolution, applicable to other essential yeast proteins. The phenotypic landscape sheds light on functional contributions of TL to dynamics, catalysis, and evolutionary constraints of TL sequence function, expanding the scope of existing deep mutational studies.

**Conclusions:** Our genetic framework dissects mechanisms of Pol II, indicating intra-T interactions and interactions with nearby domains (e.g. BH and funnel helices) are critical for TL function. Coupled with structures of partially folded TL, these studies support a multi-step folding model for promotion of catalysis. We identified predicted gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) TL variants, some of which confer epist interactions (e.g. F6 and V9). TL is critical for translocation to DNA, a step in nucleotide cycle, and implicated in transcriptional pausing and intrinsic cleavage. TL's ability to fold into multiple conformations and convert between states is essential for its functions. Our results demonstrate TL's delicate balance, perturbations result in increased or decreased catalytic activity and trans dynamics, distinct consequences for transcription activity in vivo.

**Title:** Investigating Hematogenous Spread of Rabies Virus: A Novel Pathway to Central Nervous System Invasion

**Research Question:** Can rabies virus (RV) invade the central nervous system (CNS) through hematogenous spread, bypassing the traditional neuronal network, and what are the implications for post-exposure prophylaxis?

**Methods:** We infected mice intramuscularly (i.m.) or intravenously (i.v.) with dog-associated DOG or silver-haired bat-associated SB strains to monitor the progression of clinical signs, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to track virus spread from site to brain.

**Findings:** Contrary to i.m. infection, where both variants caused lethal encephalopathy, only i.v. infection with SB resulted in lethal infection. RT-PCR revealed no differences in virus loads in spinal cord or brain at different times after i.m. or i.v. infection of SB, but immunohisto analysis showed i.v. administered SB directly infected forebrain, particularly hypothalamic nuclei connected to neurosecretory fibers circumventricular neurohypophysis and medianence.

**Implications:** Our data suggest hematogenous spread of SB can lead to fatal encephalopathy through direct invasion of CNS at neurointerface of hypothalamus-hypysis. This alternative mode of spread has implications for post-exposure prophyl of rabies, particularly with silver bat-associated RV.

**Conclusion:** This study elucidates the pathogenic relevance of hematogenous RV spread, demonstrating that certain variants can directly invade CNS from periphery via vasculature. Our findings have significant implications for post-exposure prophyl of rabies, particularly with silver bat-associated RV.

**Title:** Segmental Reassortment and the Evolution of H1N1 Influenza Virus: Unveiling the Mystery of Notable Epidemics in the 1940s and 1950s**

**Background:** The H1N subtype of influenza A virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans since the 1918 pandemic, with notable epidemics in the 1940s and 1950s. Despite its impact, the evolutionary history of H1N virus remains poorly understood, particularly the virological basis for its unusual severity during these periods.

**Research Question:** What is the role of segmental reassortment in the evolution of H1N influenza virus, and did it contribute to notable epidemics in the 1940s and 1950s?

**Methods:** We analyzed 71 complete genome sequences of H1 isolates from 1918 to 2006, representing 17 countries on five continents. Phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct reassortment events affecting specific segments.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that the 1947 epidemic H1 isolate acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassort, explaining its abrupt antigenic evolution. Similarly, the 1951 epidemic may have been associated with reassortant H1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassort appears more important in HN evolution than previously thought.

**Implications:** Segment reassort plays a significant role in HN evolution, generating viruses with pandemic potential. Our findings highlight the importance of reassort between human and avian influenza viruses, as seen in H2 and H3 pandemics in 1957 and 1968.

**Conclusions:** Long-term analysis of 71 whole-genome sequences reveals distinct reassort events affecting H segments. Intra-subtype reassort is a key process in HN epidemiology, contributing to its rapid antigenic evolution. The 1947 and 195 epidemics may have been caused by reassort H1 viruses. Our study underscores the significance of reassort in HN evolution and its impact on human health.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Nicotine's Action in the Ventral Tegmental Area: A Computational Modeling and Experimental Insights

**Research Question:** The dominant pathway of nicotine's action in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key dopaminergic structure for reward and motivation, has been debated: direct stimulation of dopaminergic cells through nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh) activation or disinhibition mediated by desensitization of nA on GABAergic neurons.

**Methods:** We developed a novel computational model of the V circuitry and nA function to shed light on this issue, extending a population representation of DA and GABA neurons to describe nCh responses. This allowed us to clarify the interplay of pharmacodynamics nicotine and dopaminergic signal in the V.

**Findings:** Our model illustrates that αβ-containing nA on DA or G cells mediate the acute effects of nicotine, accounting for in vitro and in vivo data, and predicts conditions for direct or disinhibition to be the origin of DA increases. We propose experiments to disentangle the contribution of both mechanisms. Critically, endogenous acetylcholine input determines evoked DA response for both mechanisms.

**Implications:** Together, our results delineate the mechanisms V mediates the acute rewarding properties of nicotine and suggest acetylcholine dependence for reinforcement. The rate of endogenous cholinergic input is crucial for direct stimulation, whereas high cholinergic inputs are necessary for disinhibition to observe DA activity. This emerges from known activation and desensization properties αβ nA.

**Conclusions:** Our study reconciles in vitro and in vivo data, highlighting the role of GABA cells in nicotine's action. We identify specific circuit pathways of nicotine in V while clarifying the interplay of pharmacodynamics and dopaminergic signal. The model captures nicotine-evoked modulation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to DA neurons, supporting the critical role of β-containing nA on DA neurons in vivo.

**Title:** Novel Therapeutic Approach to Prevent Superinfections and Accelerate Wound Closure in Cutaneous Leishmanias due to Leishmania (L) tropica Infection: A Randomized, Double-Blinded Phase II Trial

**Research Question:** Can a novel combination of bipolar-frequency electrocauterization (EC) and moist-wound treatment (MWT) with polyacrylate hydrogel or sodium chlorite (DAC-055) prevent superinfections, accelerate wound closure, and improve the cosmetic outcome of cutaneous leishmanias (CL) due to Leishmania (L) tropica infection?

**Methods:** We conducted a two-armed, randomized, doubleinded, phase II trial in Kabul, Afghanistan, from 2004 to 2008, with 59 patients suffering from L. trop CL. Skin lesions were treated with EC followed by MWT with polyrylate hydrogel (group I) or without DAC-055 (group II). Patients below 5, with facial lesions, pregnancy, or comorbidities were excluded. Primary outcome was time for complete epithelialization. Biops for parasitological and immuno histological analyses were taken prior EC, after wound closure, and after 6 months.

**Findings:** Mean duration for wound closure was similar in both groups (43.1 and 42 days, p=0.83). Patients with Leish-positive biops DAC-055 caused rapid epithialization (37.2 vs. 58.3 days, p=0.08). Superfections occurred at same rate (8.8%). Except one, ulcerations (10.2 in I, 18.5 II, p=0.158) were confined to cases with persistent parasite after healing. In vitro, DAC-055 showed leishicidal effect on amastigotes.

**Implications:** Compared to previous results with intraional injections, EC plus M protocol led to rapid closure, lower relapse rate, and acceleration in subgroup patients with persistence warrant future studies on DAC-055 activity.

**Conclusions:** This novel therapeutic approach prevents superin, accelerates wound closure, and improves cosmetic outcome CL. DAC-055 shows leishicidal effect on amastigotes, and warrants further clinical trials.

**Title:** Elucidating the Complexity of RAS-MAP Signaling in Drosophila: A Genome-Wide RNAi Screen Reveals Novel Regulators of MAPK Expression

**Research Question:** What are the factors that modulate the RAS-MAP signaling pathway in Drosila, and how do they impact MAPK expression?

**Methods:** A genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosila cells was conducted to identify factors influencing R-MAPK activation, followed by validation and epist experiments to determine their position within the pathway.

**Findings:** 101 validated hits were identified, including known regulators of RAF activation and novel factors acting at different steps, including a protein modulating RAF activation. Unexpectedly, most hits worked downstream of ME, influencing MAPK expression, primarily through constitutive splicing. Two representative members of this group were found to regulate MAPK alternative splicing.

**Implications:** This study provides a comprehensive view of factors modulating R-MAP signaling in Dila, indicating that pathway output is not solely reliant on classical events like RAF activation, but also on MAP regulation. Moreover, splicing components can impact alternative splicing.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals the complexity of R-MAP signaling in Dila, highlighting the importance of splicing in establishing MAP levels. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of splicing in this pathway and its implications for cancer.

**Key Findings:**

* Genome-wide RNA screen identified 101 hits, including known regulators of RAF and novel factors acting at different steps
* Most hits worked downstream of ME, influencing MAP expression through constitutive splicing
* Representative members of this group regulate MAP alternative splicing
* Study provides unprecedented view of factors modulating R-M signaling inila
* Suggests pathway output is not solely reliant on classical events like RAF activation but also on MAP regulation
* Indicates splicing can impact alternative splicing

**Future Directions:**

* Investigate the role of splicing in R-M signaling and its implications for cancer
* Elucidate the mechanisms of splicing regulation in this pathway
* Explore the impact of splicing on MAP expression and its substrates

**Title:** Molecular Epidemiology of Cryptocococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii in Thailand: A Retrospective Study of 498 Isolates

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of Cryptococcus neoform and Cryptoccus gatt in Thailand by analyzing 498 isolates from clinical, environmental, and veterinary sources.

**Methods:** A retrospective study was conducted on 498 isolates of C. neo and C. gatt, with 386 and 29 from clinical and environmental and veterinary sources, respectively. Molecular typing was performed using URA-RP and M PCR fingerprinting, and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) analysis.

**Findings:** The majority of isolates (68.9%) were from males with a mean age of 37.97 years, with 88.5% C. neo and 37.5 C. gatt from HIV patients. U-RP and M fingerprinting revealed 94.8% C. neo type VNI, 2.4% type II, 0.2 type IV, 0.2 type I, and 2.4 type II. MLST analysis identified 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand, with 30 C. gatt ST and 82, 83, 137, 141, 172, and 173 C. neo unique to Thailand. Most C. gatt isolates were ST=VGb, identical to the virulent Vancouver outbreak genotype.

**Implications:** The study revealed greater diversity and range of molecular types amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. C. neo was common in HIV patients, while C. gatt in immunocompetent patients. Environmental and veterinary sampling would help fill the gap. Despite HIV treatment, cryptoccos is a major opportunistic infection in Thailand, further studies on epidemiology and virulence of C. neo and C. gatt mandatory for proper management.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to the understanding of cryptococcos in Thailand, highlighting the need for further research on epidemiology and virulence of C. neo and C. gatt for proper management. The diversity of cryptococ genotypes in Thailand is similar to worldwide, with predominance of C. neo var. grub, type V, isolated from HIV patients. The study suggests greater diversity amongst V strains with 13 STs than previously reported.

**Title:** Evolutionary Divergence of Transcription Factors Contributes to Phenotypic Variation in Drosophila and Other Metazoans

**Research Question:** To what extent do transcription factors (TFs) contribute to the evolution of regulatory networks and phenotypic variation in Dophila and other metazoans?

**Methods:** We analyzed the evolution of the largest class of metazoan TFs, C2-H2 zinc finger (CH-Z TFs, across 12 Drosila species spanning ~45 million years of evolution.

**Findings:** A significant fraction of CH-Z 1-1 orthologs in flies exhibit variations that affect their DNA-binding specificities. In addition to loss and gain of CH-Z domains, we found diverging DNA-contact residues in ~44% of domains between D. melanogaster and other species. These diverging DNA-contact residues, found in ~70% of D melanaster CH-Z genes and ~26% all D melan TFs, show evidence of functional constraint, conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolve slower than diverging residues. These variations were rarely found as polymorphisms in a population D melanaster flies, indicating rapid fixation. Specificities of these domains change gradually across phylogen distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that a subset of dynamic and understudied TFs are likely source of regulatory variation in Dila and other metans. We challenge the assumption that 1-1 ortholog TFs are highly conserved and provide evidence that specificity modifications in single TF may play role in regulatory evolution Dila and higher metans.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of TF divergence in regulatory evolution and phenotyp variation in Dila and other metans. We propose that dynamic TFs with varying domains are likely source of regulatory variation in Dila and other metans. Further research is needed to experimentally determine the binding specificities and genomic occupancies of poly-Z genes across species to understand the impact of TF divergence on regulatory networks.

**Title:** Development of Serotype-Specific PCR Assays for Salmonella enterica Serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi using CRIS Regions for Rapid Diagnosis of Typhoid and Paratyoid Fevers

**Research Question:** The development of serotype-specific PCR assays for Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paraty A, the causative agents of typhoid and paratyoid fevers, to accelerate diagnosis and overcome the lack of typing sera and, in some cases, the need for culture.

**Methods:** We employed a family of repeated DNA sequences, CRIS (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats), as serotype-specific targets to develop conventional multiplex PCR for detection and differentiation of serotypes Typhi and Paraty A from cultured isolates. We also developed EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex assays with the same primers.

**Findings:** We achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity for each protocol validation of assays on 188 serotype Typhi and 74 serotype Paraty A strains from diverse genetic, geographic origins and time, and 70 strains of bacteria encountered in bloodstream, including 29 Salmonella serotypes and 42 from 38 other species.

**Implications:** The performance and convenience of our serotype PCR assays facilitate rapid and accurate identification of these major serotypes in a range of clinical and public laboratories with access to PCR technology. These were developed for use with DNA from isolates, but modifications to assay, CRPR could be used in development for use with clinical samples.

**Conclusions:** We identified a unique conserved region in Salmonella genome for each serotype and demonstrated targets were highly stable and specific in tests of large collection of serotypes Typhi and Paraty A. CRPR regions could be used as target for development of PCR for Salmonella serotypes with unique spacers. As proof-of-principle, we developed PCRs for serotypes Typhi and Paraty A, agents of tyoid and paroid fe.

**Title:** The Role of Notch Signaling in the Differentiation of IFN-γ-secreting CD4+ T Helper 1 Cells in Response to Intracellular Parasites

**Research Question:** How do Notch receptors regulate the differentiation of IF-γ-secre CD+ T helper 1 cells in response to intracellular parasites?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Notch signaling in the differentiation of IF-γ-secre CD+ T helper 1 cells in response to Leishmania major infection using mice with T-cell specific ablation of Notch 1 (N1) and Notch 2 (N) or both (N1NΔCDCre) on a C57/BL/6 genetic background.

**Findings:** Mice with T-cell ablation of both Notch 1 and Not 2 (NNΔCDCre) developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia, correlated with impaired secretion of IFγ by draining node CD+ T cells and increased secretion of IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines. In contrast, mice with single inactivation of Not 1 or 2 in T cells were resistant to infection and developed a protective Th1 response, indicating that CD+ T expression of Not 1 or 2 is redundant in driving Th1 differentiation. Furthermore, we show that Notch signaling is required for secretion of IFγ by Th cells, independent of CSL/RBP-J, the major effector of Notch receptors.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate a crucial role for RBP-J-independent Notch signaling in differentiation of functional Th1 response following Leish major infection. Understanding the mechanisms of Notch regulation of IFγ-secre Th cells and ligands involved in this process will contribute to development of new vaccines and immunotherapeutic targets for Leish pathology and other infections requiring IFγ-se CD+ Th response.

**Conclusion:** Notch signaling plays a critical role in the differentiation of IF-γcre CD+ T helper 1 cells in response to intracellular parasites. Our findings highlight the importance of Notch signaling in the development of protective Th1 response and suggest that targeting Notch may be a potential therapeutic strategy for Leish and other infections.

**Title:** Schistosoma mansoni Infection Enhances Susceptibility to Mucosal HIV-1 Infection in Rhes Macaques: Implications for HIV/AIDS Control in Sub-Saharan Africa

**Research Question:** Does pre-existing infection with the parasitic worm Schistoma mansoni increase an individual's susceptibility to mucosal HIV-1 infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the effect of Schistoma mansoni infection on susceptibility to mucosal HIV-1 infection in rhes macques using a prospective in vivo model. Two groups of rhes macques, one infected with Schistoma mansoni and the other uninfected, were challenged with intrarectally decreasing doses of the R-tropicade Cian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C). Systemic infection occurred in parasitized rhes at doses that remained subfect in normal hosts, with a 50% infectious dose (ID50) 17-fold lower in parasitized compared to controls (P < 0.001).

**Findings:** Schistoma-infected rhes had significantly higher peak viral loads (P < 0.001) and increased viral replication in CD4+ memory cells (P = 0.03) compared to controls. Our results provide the first direct evidence that Schoma infection increases the risk of de novo AIDS acquisition and suggest that control of helmin infections may be a useful public health intervention to decrease HIV-1 spread.

**Implications:** This study is the first direct evidence that helmin infection significantly increases host susceptibility to mucosal virus transmission in primates. System infection of S mans-infected rhes was established by low doses that remained subfect in parasite-free hosts, with a large difference in viral dose needed to establish infection. This is highly relevant as 90% of new HIV infections occur mucosally, involving R strains, which cause 50% of all HIV worldwide. We also assessed the impact of Schoma on viral loads and immune profiles in SH-infected rhes.

**Conclusion:** Our data support the suggestion that control of helmin infections may favorably impact efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS spread in areas where both worms and HIV are endemic. Sub-Saharan represents 10% of the world's population but 62% of HIV cases. While transmission and disease in sub-Saharan may differ from industrial countries, high parasitic infections, such as Schoma, may exacerbate HIV/AIDS.

**Title:** Acetylcholine Regulation of Neural Excitability and Cortical Activity: A Biophysical Modeling of Functional Regimes

**Research Question:** How does acetylcholine (ACh) regulate neural excitability and cortical activity, and what are the implications for functional regimes of cortical activity during sleep and waking states?

**Methods:** We developed a biophysical model of a network of Hodgkin-Hux neurons with M-current regulated by ACh to investigate how changes in excitability and network structure interact to create distinct functional regimes: localized, asynchronous, traveling, and synchronous. The model qualitatively matches experimentally observed cortical activity during slow wave sleep (SWS) and REM or waking states.

**Findings:** Our results show that during SWS, traveling patterns of activity occur in the cortex, whereas in other states, stationary patterns are present. Regulation of ACh level can account for dynamical changes between regimes. Reduction of this current recreates the reduction in spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) and shift in phase response curve (RC) observed in presence of ACh. When S is minimal (waking or REM state, high A), patterns are localized and easily pinned by network inhomogeneities. When S is present (decreasing A), traveling waves arise naturally. Further decrease in A leads to high degree of synchrony within waves. We also show that level A determines network sensitivity to synaptic heterogeneity.

**Implications:** These regimes may have profound significance as stationary patterns play role in encoding external input as memory and traveling could lead to synaptic regularization. Our results indicate large-scale spatio-temporal dynamics can be induced by A mediated S and networks composed highly excitable will be responsive to heterogene. Additionally, A-induced changes S and RC occur differing values gs. The model used changes resemble dynam cycles in cortex during sleep. Both patterns can thought as upstates, differing lengths.

**Conclusion:** Acetyloline (A) is a regulator of neural excitability and neurosubstrate of sleep. Our biophysical model demonstrates how changes in excitability and network structure interact to create distinct regimes, qualitatively matching experimentally observed cortical activity during sleep and waking states. Regulation of A level can account for dynam changes between regimes. Reduction of current recreates reduction S and shift observed in presence A. Our results indicate large-scale spatio dynamics can be induced A mediated and networks composed highly excitable will responsive heterogene.

**Title:** Mutations in the Toll-Like Receptor Pathway Contribute to the Development of Esophageal Adenocarcinoma in an Inflammatory Microenvironment with Reduced Microbial Diversity

**Research Question:** What is the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway mutations in the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in an inflammatory microenvironment with reduced microbial diversity?

**Methods:** We interrogated whole-genome sequencing data from 171 EAC patients and identified non-synonymous mutations affecting the TLR pathway in 25/171 (14.6%, p=8.7x10-5) tumors. We validated our findings in an external EAC dataset with non-syn TLR pathway mutations in 33/149 (22.1%, p=0.05) tumors and in solid tumor-exposed microbiomes in the COSMIC database (10,318) including uterine endrioid carcinoma (188/320, 58.8%), cutaneous melanoma (377/988, 38.2%), colorectal adenocarcin (402/151, 26.5%), and adenocarcin (151/579 26.1%).

**Findings:** TLR was the most frequently mutated gene with eleven in 10/171 (5.8%) EAC tumors. TLR mutants E439, S570, F703, and R787 had impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide with marked reductions in signaling lucifer reporter assays.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that TLR pathway is recurrently mutated in EAC and TLR mutations may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that TLR mutations contribute to the development of E in an inflammatory microenvironment with reduced microbial diversity. TLR mutants were associated with proximal tumors and metastatic disease, indicating clinical significance of these mutations. Rare mutations were identified in adjacent Barrett's esophagus samples. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of TLR in cancer development and potential therapeutic targeting of TLR pathway in E.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Taste Cell Differentiation in Developing Taste Buds: A Novel Insights into the Role of Hes in Taste Development

**Research Question:** Despite significant advances in understanding taste signal transduction mechanisms, the ontogeny of taste cells remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the molecular regulation of taste development in mice by combining in silico and in vivo analyses.

**Methods:** We employed a novel approach to investigate the TRM regulatory network in type II taste cells, discovering that TRMs colocalized within circumvallate papillae (CVP). Computational analysis of upstream regions identified Hes as a likely regulatory factor, which we examined in vivo.

**Findings:** Expression analyses revealed decreased nuclear H1 correlated with type II cell markers, while H1−/− mutants displayed 5-fold more TRM-immunactive cells than wild-type littermates, suggesting H orchestrates taste cell differentiation in developing buds.

**Implications:** This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of taste development, highlighting the role of H in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing buds.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that H plays a crucial role in regulating taste cell development, underscoring the importance of further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of taste ontogeny. This research contributes to the understanding of taste system development, a critical for animal survival.

**Title:** Elucidating the Interaction between Ethylene and Auxin in Rice Seedling Root Elongation: A Novel Insights into Ethylene Signaling in Rice

**Research Question:** How do ethylene and auxin interact to regulate seedling root elongation in rice, a monocotyledonous crop differing from dicotyledon Arabidopsis?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic, biochemical, and molecular approaches to investigate the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling root elongation. We screened seedling primary root phenotypes from mutagenesis libraries following ethylene treatment and identified a ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein-1, in which YUC/RE7 is truncated at its C-terminus. We used an inhibitor of YUC activity to regulate auxin biosynthesis via conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and demonstrated that eth-inhibited root elong is dependent on Y-based auxin biosynthesis. Furthermore, Y/RE catalyzed the conversion of IPA to IAA, truncated at C-terminal of YRE resulted in significant reduction of enzymatic activity, indicating YRE is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and eth-inhibited elong in rice seedlings.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that transcriptional activation of OsIL on expression of Y/RE and IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for eth-inhibited root elong. We also showed that eth induced YRE expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots, and addition of low concentrations IAA rescued eth response in rein-1, demonstrating that eth-in elong depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed Y-mediated auxin bios function downstream of OsIL, which directly activated expression of YRE.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a model of interaction between ethylene and aux in seedling root elong, enhancing understanding of eth signaling in rice. Eth plays crucial roles in root development, and interaction with aux has been extensively investigated in Arabidopsis, but roles in rice are unclear. Our study reveals that YRE via IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis is essential for eth-in root elong, process enhanced by transcriptional modulation of OsIL.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into ethylene and aux interaction in rice seedling root elong, enhancing understanding of eth signaling in rice. Our results demonstrate that eth-inhibited root elong is dependent on Y-based auxin biosynthesis, and that Y catalyzes conversion of IPA to IAA, and is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and eth-in elong in rice seedlings. Furthermore, we show that eth induces Y expression and promotes auxin accumulation in roots, and addition of low IAA rescues eth response in rein-1, indicating that eth-in elong depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis.

**Title:** Nationwide Epidemiological Study of Non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NT) Diseases in Saudi Arabia: Emerging Trends and Challenges

**Research Question:** To investigate the epidemiological situation of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NT) causing pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases in Saudi Arabia.

**Methods:** A nationwide collection of NT isolates with clinical and demographical data was conducted for a period of 24 months. Primary identification was carried out by probe assays followed by sequencing 16S rRNA, 16-23 ITS, rpo, and hsp genes.

**Findings:** A total 527 isolates were enrolled with a higher proportion of Saudi (76.5%), elderly (>60 years) patients (34.2%), and male (65.3) respectively. Overall, 75.1% isolates were pulmonary with a clinical significance of 44.7%. 34 NT species, including 17 rare, were identified, in addition to 8 undefined isolates. M. simiae (22.6%), M. fortuit (18.1), and M. absus (17.8) were predominant. Interestingly, 27 cases of clinically relevant M. riyense were noticed.

**Implications:** Diabetes mellitus (p-0.04) and history of tuberculosis (p-0.001) were identified as risk factors associated with NT diseases. NT disease and pathogen diversity is an emerging challenge to any nation, including Saudi. Therefore, priorities will be given to NT with an initiative to develop infrastructures and disease plans.

**Conclusion:** Higher prevalence of Saudi with NT diseases must be investigated to rule out possibilities of disease vulnerability. Detailed plan for mycobacterial control must be developed with urgent priorities. Globally, pulmonary and extrapul human infections by NT were increased [1-5]. Although immunosup illnesses regarded as predisposing, recent of NT among immunocom patients. Despite rise, NT not considered public threat and largely neglected most world.

**Title:** Molecular Determinants of Quiescence and Lifespan Extension in Yeast: A Role of Signaling Pathways and Metabolic Reprogramming**

**Research Question:** What are the molecular determinants that orchestrate quies entry and lifespan in yeast, and how do signaling pathways and metabolic reprogramming contribute to this process?

**Methods:** We screened a subset of the yeast deletion library representing genes encoding signaling proteins, including previously characterized Rim15, Mck, and Yak1 kinases, SNF/AMP complex, cell integrity pathway, and cell cycle regulators for their role in quies establishment and chronological lifespan (CLS) extension.

**Findings:** Our results show that apart from Rim15, Mck, and Yak1 kinases, the SN/AMP complex, cell integrity, and cell cycle regulators are necessary for proper quies establishment and extension of CLS, suggesting that quies entry requires integration of starvation signals via multiple pathways. CL of these mutants and single, double, and triple mutants of Rim15, Y1, and M1 correlates with carbohydrate storage but not cell cycle status. Removal of glycogen and trehal biosynthetic genes, especially GSY and T1, abolishes carbohydrate accumulation and severely reduces CL. Concurrent overexpression of G2 and T1 or supplementation trehal to medium ameliorates CL defects displayed by mutants RimΔy1 or RimΔck.

**Implications:** Our data support the hypothesis that metabolic reprogramming to accumulate energy and activation of antioxidant systems are coordinated by Yak, Rim, and M1 kinases to ensure quies entry and lifespan in yeast.

**Conclusions:** Our findings indicate that signaling pathways and metabolic reprogramming play a crucial role in quies entry and lifespan in yeast. Specifically, Yak, Rim, and M1 kinases mediate TOR-regulated accumulation of carbohydrates and CL extension. Overexpression of glycogen and trehal biosynthetic genes or addition of trehal to medium rescues quies exit defects exhibited RimΔy1 and RimΔck mutants. Positive correlation between storage and survival has been shown in chronologically aging cells. Together, our data support that primary objective of signaling activated by starvation is reprogram carbon metabolism for transition cells to accumulate energy quies exit.

**Title:** Rapid Antigenic Evolution Enables Persistence of Seasonal Influenza A and B Viruses in Human Populations Despite Widespread Immunity: Uncovering the Role of Hemagglutinin Glycosylation in Compensating for Fitness Defects

**Research Question:** How do seasonal influenza A and B viruses persist in human populations despite widespread immunity, and what mechanisms enable their antigenic evolution?

**Methods:** We employed the primer method of error-correct viral sequencing to investigate the role of hemagglutinin (HA) glycosylation in compensating for fitness defects resulting from anti-HA neutralizing antibody escape.

**Findings:** We found that antigen-free propagation selected viruses with mutations modulated receptor binding avidity through the addition of N-linked glycans to the HA globular domain, expanding our understanding of viral mechanisms maintaining fitness during antigen evolution.

**Implications:** Our results highlight the immense power of high-definition virus sequencing in revealing novel adaptive mechanisms and shed light on the mutational plasticity of HA. Glycosylation plays a critical role in antigenic drift, increasing fitness of antigen escape variants by restoring optimal receptor interactions, even in the absence of antibody pressure.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates glycosylation can compensate for fitness costs imposed by escape substitutions on HA, increasing viability and emergence of Ab-escape variants. This raises the possibility that glycosylation and compensatory mechanisms contribute to steady accretion of linked glycans within the globular domain during human circulation of H1 and H3 viruses. The discovery of a new role for glycos in facilitating IAV escape highlights the power of population sequencing uncovering mechanisms through forward genetics.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Forward Rate Dependence in Antiarrhythmic Drugs: A Comprehensive Analysis of Ventricular Myocyte Models

**Research Question:** Can forward dependence, a desirable property of antiarrhythmic drugs, be achieved by modulating specific ionic perturbations in ventricular myocytes?

**Methods:** We performed a comprehensive analysis of 13 ventricular myocyte models, simulating populations with varying properties and analyzing results statistically to predict rate-dependent effects on multiple parameters. Average 40 parameters were tested at slow (0.2 Hz) and fast (2 Hz) rates.

**Findings:** Our analysis identified a variety of forward-dependent (FR) ionic perturbations and specific mechanisms, including an increase in L-type calcium current FR accompanied by indirect rate-dependent changes in delayed rectifier potassium current. Comparison across models revealed inward rectifier potassium and sodium-potassium as likely targets for FR prolongation. Statistical analysis demonstrated models with minimal rate changes in AP shape have little FR potential, whereas those with large changes have considerable FR capacity.

**Implications:** This study provides new insights into determinants of AP rate dependence and a strategy for designing beneficial antihythmic drugs. Our results suggest that FR prolongation can be produced by perturbations with indirect effects on ionic currents with rate-dependent properties, and a myocyte's capacity for FR depends on AP contour changes with rate.

**Conclusions:** This study addresses the question of whether the search for effective antihythmic agents is hopeless due to reverse dependence. Our findings indicate that FR can be achieved by modulating specific ionic perturbations in ventricular myocytes, providing novel insights into clinically-relevant R prolongation in ventricular myocytes.

**Title:** Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PAS) for Identifying Genetic Polymorphisms Associated with Phenotypes: A Novel Approach Using ICD-10 Codes and Biological Results

**Research Question:** Can phenome-wide association studies (PAS) using ICD-10 codes and biological test results identify genetic polymorphisms associated with phenotypes in patients treated with thiopur drugs?

**Methods:** We developed a novel approach to perform PWAS using ICD-10 codes and biological results as a quantitative trait selection criterion. We applied this method to thiopurine-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in patients treated with thiopur drugs. Two ICD-10 code aggregation methods were developed: ICD-10 hierarchy and mapping to existing ICD-9M PW codes. Biological results were analyzed using discretization algorithms. We applied these methods to 442 patient records from a French hospital's clinical warehouse between 2010-2013, analyzing TP activity after thiopine initiation.

**Findings:** Concordance between I-9M PW codes and I-10 codes validated I-phenotypes. Iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with high TP activity (p=0.0004 and p=0.001, respectively).

**Implications:** This study presents an original method to perform PWAS on a quantitative trait using ICD-10 codes and biological results to identify phenotypes. In pharmacogenomics, PW allows identification of new subgroups requiring personalized clinical management.

**Conclusions:** Using a quantitative trait in pharmacogenomics, we discovered associations between TPMT and thiopine treatment data. This is the first PW using I-10 classification, previously PW were based I-9M. Temporal relationship between thiopine prescriptions and TP assays was considered, restricting analysis to events after initiation. Biological results validated phenotypes from ICD analysis.

**Title:** Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Stem Cell Therapy in Animal Models of Spinal Cord Injury: Impact on Motor and Sensory Outcomes

**Research Question:** Can stem cell therapy improve motor and sensory outcomes in animal models of spinal cord injury?

**Methods:** We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of 156 publications using 45 different stem cell preparations in animal models of spinal cord injury.

**Findings:** Allogenic stem cell treatment appears to improve both motor (effect size 27.2%; 95% CI 25.0-29.4; 312 in 5,628 animals) and sensory (effect 26.3%; 95 CI 7.9-44.7; 23 in 473) outcomes. Facets of stem cell biology, differentiation, implantation route, and intravenous delivery favored better outcomes. Stem implantation did not improve sensory outcome in females and was enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. Biological plausibility supported by dose-response relationship. Motor outcome facets had little effect, instead heterogeneity explained by experimental and outcome measures. Location, method of injury, and immunosuppression impacted.

**Implications:** Extensive preclinical literature suggests stem-cell therapies may offer promise, but internal validity and publication bias mean efficacy is likely lower than reported. Unclear if magnitude of effects is clinically meaningful. Reports may be biased towards positive results.

**Conclusions:** This systematic review and meta-analysis of 156 publications using 45 stem cell preparations in animal models of spinal cord injury found allogenic cell treatment improves motor and sensory outcomes. Facets of stem biology, differentiation, implantation, and intravenous delivery favored outcomes. Biological plausibility supported by dose-response relationship.

**Title:** Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Soil-Transmitted Helminth (STH) Infections: Patterns and Dynamics of Reinfection after Treatment

**Research Question:** What are the patterns and dynamics of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, specifically Ascaris lumbricoid, hookworm, and Trichuris trura, reinfection after treatment, and what are the implications for preventive chemotherapy control strategies?

**Methods:** A systematic review and meta-analysis of 154 studies from PubMed, ISI, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochr Database Systematic Reviews, China Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanang Database, Chinese Journal, and Google Scholar databases. Studies were selected based on year, country, sample size, age, diagnostic method, drug administration, prevalence, and intensity of infection pre- and post-treatment, cure rate, and evaluation post-treatment, and adherence. Pooled risk ratios from random-effects models were used to assess the risk of ST reinfection after treatment.

**Findings:** At 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, Ascaris lumicoid prevalence reached 26% (95% CI: 16-43), 68 (95% CI 60-76), and 94 (95 CI 88-100) of pretreatment levels, respectively. Trichis trura reinfection prevalence were 36 (95 CI 28-47), 67 ( CI 42-100), and 82 ( CI 62-100), and hookworm 30 ( CI 26-34), 55 (34-87), and 57 (49-67). Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment status.

**Implications:** STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for Ascaris lumic and Trichis trura. Frequent anthelmint drug administrations are needed to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Integrated approaches emphasizing health and environmental sanitation are required to interrupt transmission of STH.

**Conclusion:** This systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the need for frequent anthelmint drug administration to prevent STH reinfection, particularly for Ascaris lumic and Trich trura, and underscores the importance of integrated approaches to control emphasizing health and sanitation to interrupt transmission. The findings suggest that prevalence and intensity of reinfection are positively correlated with pretreatment status, and that reinfection occurs rapidly after treatment. These results have implications for planning and timing of preventive chemotherapy to enhance effectiveness.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Deregulation of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Phenotypes through Minimal Network Enrich Analysis (MiA)

**Background:** Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFL) encompasses a spectrum of metabolic disorders, ranging from simple steatosis to complex nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, characterized by deregulation of metabolic processes at the molecular level. Traditional pathway analysis approaches, such as pathway enrichment analysis (EA), rely on predefined maps of metabolic subsystems, which are subject to annotation biases and cannot capture complex interactions of genome-scale metabolic networks (GEM).

**Research Question:** Can a novel framework, Minimal Network Enrich Analysis (MiA), applied to EMs, identify deregulated networks and key regulators in NAFL phenotypes, such as fatty liver and inflammation in humans and mice?

**Methods:** We developed MiA to generate all possible minimal networks (Mi), composed of reactions pertaining to metabolic subsystems synthesizing a target metabolite. We applied MiA to deregulated Mi in humans and mice, integrating condition-specific transcriptomics data from liver samples.

**Findings:** We identified key deregulations in cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, and hexadecate synthesis in both humans and mice, and regulators of hydrogen peroxide synthesis differed between species. Mi demonstrated general and specific characteristics of NAFL phenotypes.

**Implications:** MiA is applicable to any EM and target metabolite, making it flexible for studying condition-specific metabolism in any disease or organism.

**Conclusions:** MiA overcomes limitations of traditional pathway analysis, capturing complex interactions and cofactors, and byproducts, and provides insights into deregulated networks and key regulators in NAFL phenotypes. This study demonstrates the potential of MiA in understanding metabolic diseases, such as NAFL, and highlights its applicability to various conditions and organisms.

**Title:** Efficient Olfactory Representation through Primacy Coding: A Numerical and Statistical Analysis

**Research Question:** How does primacy coding, a model of olfactory representation where odor identity is encoded by the types of receptors that respond earliest, provide a compact and informative representation that can be efficiently interpreted by the brain?

**Methods:** We analyzed a simple model of neural representation of olfactory stimuli, where odors are identified by the strongest responding receptor types. Using numerical and statistical simulations, we examined the effect of primacy dimension on transmitted information and discriminability of odors.

**Findings:** Our results show that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types in the prim representation, but weakly on the size of the repertoire. The representation is independent of odor intensity, and the transmitted information is useful for typical olfactory tasks, close to experimentally measured. Interestingly, we found situations where a smaller repertoire is advantageous for discriminating odors. The model suggests that overly sensitive receptors could dominate the response and make the array useless, allowing us to predict receptor adaptation to environmental changes.

**Implications:** Primacy provides an efficient representation that is independent of odor intensity, thus helping to identify odors in olfactory cortex. Our results show that primacy is more useful than binary and normalized coding, as sparsity of representation is independent of odor statistics, unlike alternatives. The performance of the olfactory system hinges on tuned sensitivities, suggesting selective pressure to adjust on evolutionary and shorter timescales.

**Conclusions:** Primacy formed in olfactory bulb is more useful for identifying odors in olfactory cortex than alternatives because statistics are independent of odor. Our model predicts receptors are useful if responding to incoming odors similar. Experiments suggest odors encoded by types responding within a window after onset [23-25]. The identity can be robustly encoded by fixed receptors responding first, known primacy [24,26]. Our analysis suggests prim provides robust, sparse, concentration-invariant, and weakly dependent on receptor details. For representation to be useful, it needs solving olfactory tasks.

**Title:** Incomplete Neutralization and Non-Sigmoid Neutralization Profiles of Broadly Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies against HIV-1

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the extent of non-sigmoid slopes and plateaus <100 for broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMA) targeting various regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.

**Methods:** A panel of 278 pseudoviruses in a CD4 T-cell (U87.CCR.CX4) assay and a panel of 117 viruses in TZ-bl assay were used to evaluate the neutralization profiles of bnMA targeting different epitopes of the spike. Additionally, a peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC)-grown virus panel from patient swarms and molecular clones produced in 293 cells and PBs were assayed in TZ-bl.

**Findings:** Across both panels, bnMA targeting the V apex of Env and gp41 were most likely to show neutral curves that plateaued <100. Conversely, bnMA targeting high-mose epitopes were less likely to display such behavior. CD4 binding (CDbs) Abs also showed this behavior infrequently. Incomplete neutralization was observed in PBMC-grown virus panel and molecular clones produced in 293 and PBs assayed in TZ-bl. Examples of plateaus <90 were seen with both types of virus with no consistent patterns.

**Implications:** Incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoid neutral curves are possible for all bnMA against a wide range of viruses produced and assayed in cell and primary cells. This has implications for the use of antibodies in therapy and tools for vaccine design.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that all bnMA are subject to inhibition that do not reach 100 and most have neutral curves with nonigmoid slopes. bnMA targeting certain areas of trimer are more prone to these effects. CDbs 12 resulted in MP values >90 of all viruses in TZ-bl with median MP 100. In contrast, CDbs PG04 resulted in less neutral with median MP values close 100 but individual viruses incompletely neutral in TZ-bl than U cell. There may be mechanisms other than glycan heterogeneity for incomplete neutral and nonigmoid curves to be understood, such as conformation heterogeneity of trimer.

**Title:** Metabolic Reprogramming in Cancer Cells: Unveiling the Logic of Glucose and Glutamine Utilization for Enhanced Proliferation

**Research Question:** How do cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to prioritize glucose and glutamine utilization for enhanced proliferation, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to this selective advantage?

**Methods:** We employed a constraint-based modeling approach to simulate the human central metabolism, sampling the feasible space of flux to generate a large number of mutated cells with different glutamine and glucose uptake rates. We observed that in a subset of proliferating cells, glucose was fermented to lactate in the presence of oxygen, while high glutamine utilization decreased oxidative glucose utilization and increased lactate production from glutamine. This emergent phenotype occurred when carbon availability exceeded oxidation by oxygen.

**Findings:** Under these conditions, Flux Balance Analysis indicated that this metabolic pattern is optimal for biomass and ATP production, requiring branched TCA cycle activity, glutamine reductive carboxylation for lipid and protein production, and redox-controlled reactions. Experimentally, we validated glutamine metabolic changes in a K-ras transformed cell line, confirming computational predictions.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the metabolic reprogramming underlying cancer growth, suggesting that competition between glucose and glutamine plays a determinant role in cell growth. The emergent pattern is not specific, but a metabolic rewiring that may occur in various tumor lines. We examined if this pattern was the fittest for cell reorganization of hallmarks, requiring extensive metabolic flux reorganization, aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), and glutamine utilization for biosynthesis.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals the logic of metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells, highlighting the importance of glucose and glutamine interplay in cell growth. The emergent pattern is optimal for biomass and ATP production, sustained by branched TCA, glutamine reductive carboxylation, and redox reactions. Our results support the notion that metabolic rewiring is not specific, but a common in various tumor lines, emphasizing the role of competition between glucose and glutamine in cancer growth.

**Title:** Elucidating the Physiological Environment of Conformation Conversion of Cellular Prion Protein (Pr) to Disease-Associated Isoforms

**Research Question:** Despite significant progress in understanding the minimal requirements for prion protein (Pr) conversion in vitro, the molecular environment hosting the earliest steps of prion disease manifestation in neuronal cells remains enigmatic. This study aimed to investigate the Pr interactome in a cell model permissive to prion replication to recognize relevant interactors, including Doppel (Dpl) and Shadoo (Spr), mammalian Pr paralogs.

**Methods:** A quantitative interactome analysis was conducted in a neuroblastoma cell model permissive to prion replication. Bioinformatic methods and literature mining were used to identify candidate interactors, which were subsequently validated using biochemical assays.

**Findings:** This study established a similar physiological environment for the prion family members in neuroblast cells and suggested direct interactions amongst them. Multiple interactions between Pr and neural adhesion molecule lamin receptor, Na+/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) were confirmed, reconciling separate findings. Subsequent experiments revealed interactions of Pr with PDIs extend beyond the endoplasmic reticulum, potentially playing a hitherto unrecognized role in PrSc accumulation.

**Implications:** A hypothesis was presented accounting for observed interactions in uninfected cells, suggesting Pr organizes its environment by binding adhesion molecules harboring immunoglobulin domains, recognizing oligann-bearing membrane proteins.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the molecular environment hosting prion conversion in neuronal cells, highlighting biochemical interactions amongst mammalian prion family members. Prions are causative agents of fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and mammals, with Pr converting to disease-associated conformer (PrSc) with distinct physico properties. Our findings suggest prion family embedded in specialized domains with molecular networks supporting adhesion, lactate metabolism, and cell fusion.

**Title:** Unveiling the Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms of IL-5 Production during Respiratory Virus Infection: A Novel Insights into Eosin Accumulation in the Lungs

**Research Question:** What are the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IL-5 production during respiratory virus infection, and how does it contribute to eosin accumulation in the lungs?

**Methods:** We employed a mouse model of influenza virus infection to investigate IL-5 production and eosin accumulation in the lungs.

**Findings:** We observed a transient release of IL-5 into the airways and significant accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs, particularly during the recovery phase of infection, following virus clearance. The source of IL-5 was identified as group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) infiltrating the infected lungs, with a rapid expansion of c+ IL-5 producing ILC during recovery. Enhanced IL-5 production by ILC was concomitant with expression of the IL-33 receptor subunit ST2 by ILC. Additionally, NKT cells and alveolar macrophages (AM) were found to be endogenous sources of IL-33 that enhance IL-5 production by ILC.

**Implications:** Our results reveal that c+ ILC interaction with IL-33 producing NKT and AM leads to abundant IL-5 production by ILC, accounting for the accumulation of eosin observed during the recovery of influenza infection.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of IL-5 production during respiratory virus infection, highlighting the role of ILC, NKT, and AM in eosin accumulation in the lungs. These findings have implications for understanding asthma exacerbation and eosinophilic airway inflammation, and potential therapeutic strategies targeting IL-5 and IL-33 pathways.

**Title:** Invasive Non-Typhoidal Salmonella (NT) Infections in Vietnam: A Retrospective Study of Clinical and Microbiological Manifestations in a Major Infectious Disease Hospital

**Research Question:** What are the clinical and microbiological manifestations of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NT) infections in a major infectious disease hospital in southern Vietnam, and what are the risk factors associated with death in this population?

**Methods:** We retrospectively identified 102 cases of NT infections in an infectious disease hospital in Vietnam between 2008-2013. Clinical records were accessed to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with NT infection and identify risk factors with death. Multi-locus typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on all organisms.

**Findings:** Of 102 NT patients, 71% were HIV-infected, >90% were adults, 71% were male, and 33% reported intravenous use. 26/92 (28%) patients had known outcome; HIV was significantly associated with death (p=0.039). Enteridis Sequence (ST) 11 (43/89) and Typhimium (ST 19,34, 44) (23/89) were the most identified serovars. Tyim was more common in HIV-infected (p=0.003). Isolates from HIV-inf patients were more likely exhibit reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamox than HIV-negative (p=0.037).

**Implications:** NT disease is a severe infection in Vietnam with high mortality rate. In sub-Saharan, HIV was risk for death, with majority burden in population HIV-infected adults.

**Conclusions:** NT is not common in this setting compared to sub-Saharan Africa, but disease associated immunocomised adults and caused by serars Enteridis and Tyimium. Evaluations in sub-Saharan highlighted emergence NT driven by HIV, while malnutrition and infection associated NT in children [3,4]. Incidence NT in Asia limited compared Africa [26,27], similar context confirm HIV primary factor NT disease adults in Vietnam. Prevalence HIV low (0.5) [28], known disease common intravenous [29]. NT present Asia, few data regarding symptoms, disease, outcome, demographics, infecting serars. Clinical and bacterial isolates accessed to investigate retrospect clinical and microbi manifestations NT major disease hospital southern.

**Recommendations:** continued surveillance, sequence/whole sequencing to monitor emergence MDR strains or enhanced virulence phenotype, ST [41]. NT disease severe Vietnam, mortality (26) similar sub-Saharan. Highlight HIV major risk infection and death setting.

**Title:** Predicting Phage Structural Proteins using Artificial Neural Networks: A Novel Approach for Identifying Viral Components

**Research Question:** Can Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) be used to identify phage and prophage structural proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect through bioinformatic analysis?

**Methods:** We designed and trained feed-forward, back-propagation ANNs to classify phage protein sequences based on amino acid composition and isoelectric point (pI) to predict structural proteins, specifically major capsid and tail proteins.

**Findings:** Our ANNs achieved an accuracy of ∼80% in identifying a broad spectrum of phage and viral proteins. Two ensembles of 10 ANNs, each with specificity greater than the structural networks, identified phage caps or tail proteins. Electron microscopy validated ANN-predicted proteins, which self-assembled into structures resembling virion structures.

**Implications:** Our ANNs are novel tools for identifying ph and prophage structural proteins, valuable when sequence data is available but in vitro propagation may not be practical or possible. This approach can aid in better understanding physiological impact of viruses on microbial communities and human health, disease detection, diagnosis, and vaccine development.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of ANNs in predicting phage structural proteins, a challenging to detect through bioinformatic analysis. Our method can be applied to other viral components, such as enzymes, with low sequence conservation and few conserved catalytic sites. Future work will focus on improving ANN performance and expanding to other viral families.

**Title:** Characterization of Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) Protein ORF20 and its Interaction with Interferon-Stimulated Gene (ISG) Oligoadylate Synthetase-Like (OL) Protein

**Research Question:** What is the function of Kapos's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSH) protein ORF20 and its interaction with interferon-stimulated gene (IS) oligoadyl synthetase-like (OL) protein in the viral life cycle?

**Methods:** We used quantitative affinity purification coupled mass spectrometry (q-AP-MS) to identify specific partners of ORF20, including ribosomal and interferon-stimulated gene (IS) oligoadyl synthase-like (OL) protein. Both endogenous and transiently transfected OL co-immunprecipitated with OR20, and this interaction was conserved among OR20 isoforms and OR20 homologs of the UL family in other herpesviruses. Characterization of OL partners by q-APMS identified a similar interactome to OR20.

**Findings:** OR20 and OL copurified with 40 and 60 ribosomal subunits, and when coexpressed, associated with polysomes. OR20 did not have a global effect on translation, but enhanced RIG-induced expression of endogenous OL in an IR3-dependent but IFN-independent manner. OL has been characterized as IS with antiviral activity against some viruses, but its role in gammaherpesviruses was unknown. We show OL and OR20 expression were induced after reactivation of latently infected HuLT-rSH.219 cells. Intriguingly, we found OL enhanced K infection with KSH OR20 mutant, however, OL-dependent infectivity was lost.

**Implications:** Our data characterize the interaction of OR20 with OL and suggest OR usurps the function OL to benefit SH infection. We show the interaction OL is conserved among OR20forms and UL family present other herpesvir. Analyze OL interact by q-MS and find OL and OR share numerous ribosomal partners. Furthermore, both copur with 40 and 60 ribosomal subunits, and when together associate with polysomes, but have no global effect on translation.

**Conclusions:** OR20, a member of herpesiral UL family, is a poorly characterized protein, and we aimed to understand its function. We identified OL as a partner of OR20 by q-MS and novel interactions OR and OL with ribosomal and nucleolar proteins. Our data suggest OR usur the function of OL to benefit SH infection. The interaction OL is conserved among OR20forms and UL family present other herpesvir. Analyze OL interact by q-MS and find OL and OR share numerous ribosomal partners. Furthermore, both cop with 40 and 60 ribosomal sub, and together with polysomes, but no global effect on translation.

**Title:** Prevalence and Presentation of Lassa Virus Disease in Children with Fever and Convulsions in Endemic Areas of Nigeria

**Research Question:** What is the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febr children with and without convuls in endemic areas of Nigeria, which has multiple lineages of the virus?

**Methods:** This was a prospective study of consecutive febrile children aged ≥1–15 years admitted to the Children Emergency Room of Irrua Teaching Hospital over a period of 1 year. Febr children with convuls (Cases) were compared with those without convuls (Controls).VD was defined by the presence of a Lassa virus-RT-PCR. Rates were compared between groups using χ2 or Fisher’s tests and p<0.05 as significant.

**Findings:** 373 (40.9%) of 913 admissions had fever, of which 108 (29%) presented with convuls. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13/373 (3.5%; 95% CI 1.9,5%) in febr admissions, 3/108 (2.8%) in Cases and 10/265 (3.8) in Controls. Only vomiting (OR 0.09; 0.01,0.70) and bleeding (OR 39.56 8.52,183.7) were significantly associated with increased prevalence of L.

**Implications:** Lassa virus disease is an important cause of fever, undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas, but not significantly associated with convuls in febr children. Its prevalence and lack of clinical differentiation presentation underscores the importance of high index suspicion in diagnosis. Screening febr children undifferent fever endemic for L could be important medical public health measure.

**Conclusion:** This study aimed to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease in febr children with and without convuls in endemic areas of Nigeria, which has multiple lineages the virus. The results show that Lassa virus is an important cause of fever, undifferent fever in children in endemic areas, but not significantly associated with convuls febr children. Its prevalence and lack clinical differentiation presentation underscores the importance of high suspicion in diagnosis.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of KARRINSENSITIVE2 (KAI) in Drought Resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana: A Novel Insights into KAR Signaling Pathways and Drought Adaptation

**Research Question:** How does KINSENSITIVE2 (KAI) regulate drought resistance in Arabidopsis thalian, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses to investigate the role of KAI in drought response in Arabidopsis. Mutations in the KAI gene, encoding the proposed karin receptor, resulted in hypersensitivity to water deprivation. We analyzed the physiological and biochemical changes in k2 plants, including water loss rates, membrane damage, stomatal aperture, and cuticular permeability, anthocyan biosynthesis, and abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity.

**Findings:** k2 mutants exhibited increased water loss, drought-induced membrane damage, enlarged stomatal apertures, and higher cuticular permeability, reduced anthocyan biosynthesis, and hypersensitivity to ABA in stomatal and cotyledon assays. Genome-wide transcript analysis of k2 under well-water and dehydration conditions identified genes associated with observed physiological and biochemical changes. Our data suggest crosstalk between ABA and KAI-dependent pathways regulating drought responses.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that KAI signaling positively regulates drought resistance in Arabidopsis through membrane stability, stomatal movement, cuticle development, and anthocyan production. KAI is activated by binding KAR or an unknown ligand, regulating downstream genes involved in cuticle, stom closure, anthyan biosynthesis, and membrane integrity. These adjustments contribute to plant adaptation to drought.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the role of KAI in Arabidopsis survival after water deficit and identifies physiological and molecular explanations for this function, highlighting the importance of an unknown ligand and KAI-dependent signaling in drought resistance. Analyzing drought-specific d14 and k2 mutants, we find both pathways promote plant adaptation to water deficit. Our results suggest chemical or genetic manipulation of KAI and D signaling may improve drought resistance.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Insulin Signaling in Schistosoma japonicum Development, Maturation, and Egg Production: Insights from Insulin Receptor (SIR) Studies

**Research Question:** To investigate the importance of insulin signaling in the growth, development, maturation, and egg production of adult Schistosoma japonicum, we focused on the insulin receptors (SIR) of Schistosoma japonicum, previously cloned and partially characterized.

**Methods:** We employed biolayer interferometry to demonstrate human insulin binding to the L subdomain (insulin binding) of recombinant (r) SIR1 and SIR2 (designated SLD and SLD) produced using Drosophila S protein system. Additionally, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown the expression of SIR in S. japon in vitro, observing reduced transcription levels of downstream genes within the insulin pathway associated with glucose metabolism and schist fecundity. Furthermore, a significant decrease in glucose uptake was observed in SIR-knockdown worms compared to luciferase controls.

**Findings:** Vaccine challenge experiments revealed that SLD and SLD depressed growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal production in S. japon in mice presented with low challenge. These data emphasize the potential of SIR as veterinary blocking candidates against zoon schosomiasis in China and Philippines.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that schistosomes exploit host insulin for growth and development, with human insulin binding to recombinant L subdomains SLD and SLD of SIR expressed in Dophila cells. Schosomes reportedly unable synthesize insulin, although an insulin-like peptide S_048 has been annotated in S. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of SIR or S has indirect effect on regulation of downstream genes in insulin signaling. Evidence from protein assays, RNA, and vaccine challenge experiments strongly support adult schosomes having insulin transduction system.

**Conclusion:** The insulin pathway in schosomes is presumed activated by binding between host and parasite IR, regulating transcription of downstream genes such as PIK, GYS, SH, CBL, and GTP involved in glucose metabolism. RNA showed in vitro glucose level decreased when SIR and SIR were knocked down 6 days with control. This suggests knockdown of both binding sites SIR and SIR is effective in blocking signal transduction in different locations given tissue expression SIR is distinct SIR.

**Title:** Breaking the Lymphatic Filariasis Transmission Cycle: Interspecific Hybridization and Infection of Aedes aegypti with Wolbachia bacteria as a Novel Vector Control Strategy

**Research Question:** Can interspecific hybridization and infection of Aedes aegypt with Wolbachia bacteria be used as a novel control strategy to break the lymphatic filariasis (LF) transmission cycle in the Pacific regions where Aedes aegy is the primary vector?

**Methods:** We generated a bi-directionally incompatible Aedesegy strain (CP) stably infected with Wolbach bacteria from Aedesi and demonstrated its sterility in laboratory assays with naturally infected females. We then introduced CP males into wild Aeg populations and observed a significant reduction in population.

**Findings:** Our results show that CP males are equally competitive, leading to population elimination when introduced into wild Aeg populations. This demonstrates the feasibility of the strategy as a supplement to ongoing mass drug administration (MDA) efforts.

**Implications:** The inability of MDA to eliminate LF transmission in some Pacific regions highlights the need for additional control measures. Aedeseg is a logical target due to its broad range in the Pacific and ability to vector filari in low microfilaraemics. However, existing control methods have been ineffective against this species. Our findings support a species-specific approach using bi-directionally incompatible males to induce sterility ineg females, resulting in population elimination.

**Conclusions:** The Pacific geography is ideal for this strategy, aseg is an obligate host for Wolbach, and anti-vector interventions are recognized as a method to break the LF cycle. However, effective control has never been achieved due toeg inaccessibility and negative density-dependent transmission.eg is more efficient in low microilara, such as with M strategies. The stabilizing impact of this transmission is hypothesized as a contributor to inability to eliminate LF in French Polynes despite decades of M. Our results encourage extension of this strategy to additional species, such as Cule and other LF vectors in the Pacific, using the ability to artificially generate Wolia in medically important mosquitoes.

**Title:** Estimating the Burden of Rhodesian Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in a Highly Endemic Area of Tanzania: A Hospital-Based Study

**Research Question:** What is the public health and economic burden of Rhodesian trypanosomiasis (HAT) in a highly endemic area of Tanzania, specifically in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and financial costs?

**Methods:** This hospital-based study collected data from 143 patients admitted in 2004 for treatment of AT at Kali Health Centre, Uram District, Tanzania. Direct and indirect costs incurred by patients and healthcare services were calculated. DALs were estimated using the Global Burden of Disease methods and previous AT estimates, assuming 45% under-reporting.

**Findings:** The estimated DALs for AT in Uram District without weighting were 215.7 (95% CI: 155.3-287.5) and 281.6 (95% CI 209.1-362.6) respectively. With 45% underreporting, results were 622.5 (95% CI 155.3-109.9) and 978.9 (95 CI 201.1-187.8). The costs of treating 143 patients were estimated at $15,514, with patients paying $3,673 and services $11,841. Indirect non-medical costs for 143 were $9,781.

**Implications:** This study highlights the significant burden of AT on rural communities in Tanzania, emphasizing the need for location-specific estimates tailored to settings like Tanzania, where many infectious diseases are focal and concentrated.

**Conclusion:** The re-emergence of AT in Uram continues to burden health systems and communities. This is the first assessment of AT burden in Tanzania and second for East Africa. Our findings are consistent with previous studies on neglected zoonoses, showing high impact on health systems and communities. Tanzania loses 10 million life years annually through illness and death, with four months lost per man, woman, child. Families incur substantial costs maintaining sick members while treated for AT. Underreporting in Uganda estimated 7 unreported cases for every 10, with 12 undetected for every reported death. HIV may have increased AT burden in Tanzania, with patients developing long-term complications. Household income burden is associated with disease, with majority of rural population suffering due to socio-economic activities not covering basic needs.

**Title:** Elucidating the Function of Cytoplasmic N-glyase (Ng1) in Mammals: Insights from Ngly-Deficient Mice

**Research Question:** What is the precise role of cytoplasmic N-glyase (Ng1) in mammals, and how does its deficiency lead to embryonic lethality in mice?

**Methods:** We generated Ngly-deficient mice in C57/BL6 background and found them to be embryonically lethal. Surprisingly, additional deletion of the gene encoding endo-β-N-acetylucosidase (Eng), another de-glycosylating enzyme, resulted in partial rescue of lethality of Ngly-deficient mice. We also found that changing the genetic background of C57/BL mice by crossing with outbred strain ICR partially rescued embryonic lethality of Ngly-def mice.

**Findings:** Viable Ngly-deficient mice in C57/6 and ICR background showed severe phenotype reminiscent of symptoms of NGL1-deficiency. Many defects were suppressed by additional deletion of Eng in C57/ and ICR background. Defects in Ngly/Eng-def mice (C57/ background) and Ngly-def mice (57 and ICR background) closely resembled symptoms of patients with NGL1-def.

**Implications:** These observations suggest that Ngly or Ngly/Eng-deficient mice serve as valuable models for studying pathogenesis of N1-deficiency and cytoplasm ENG as potential therapeutic target for this disorder.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that embryonic lethality of Ngly mice is mainly related to de-glycosylation function, given that lethality was partially suppressed by deletion of Eng gene encoding another cytoplasm de-gly enzyme. Functional significance of Ng gene in mice was characterized, consistent with recent reports on N-def human bearing mutations Ng allele. Lethality of Ng mice was partially suppressed by knockout of Eng gene. Cytoplasm N-gly may serve precursors endogenous Nlc proteins, some linked to pathogenesis N-def in Ng cells. Glycoprote analysis on cytopl Ng;Eng MEF cells identified specific N-gly that accumulate in Ng;Eng MEF. Lethality Ng mice was rescued by deletion Eng or changing genetic background, but recognizable phenotypes observed in Ng;Eng mice and Ng mice C and I background.

**Title:** Controlling Gene Expression Noise in Embryonic Development: A Study on the Role of Promoter Structure and Transcription Dynamics in Hunchback Gene Regulation

**Research Question:** How do promoter structure and transcription dynamics influence gene expression noise in embryonic development, specifically in the activation of the hunch (hb) gene in fruit fly Drosophila?

**Methods:** We employed a stochastic model of the hb promoter, varying the number and strength of Bcd and Hb self-regulatory binding sites, and fit parameters to data from wild-type (WT), self-regulatory mutant hb14, and lacZ reporter constructs using different portions of the promoter. We corroborated model predictions experimentally and characterized the dependence of hb mRNA and protein noise on promoter structure and transcription dynamics.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that WT self-regulatory hb noise is predominantly dependent on transcription and translation dynamics of its own expression, rather than Bcd fluctuations. Constructs lacking self-regulation show that multiple B binding sites in the promoter and their strengths play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to variation in B binding site number across fly species.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of promoter structure and dynamics, such as self-feedback, in reducing expression noise. Many of these features are common to other genes (e.g., multiple sites, cooperativity, feedback), contributing to the understanding of reproducibility and determinacy in early development. The model illustrates reduction in noise from increasing site number and strength, role of cooperativity, slow timescales, and within-embryo to between-emb variability.

**Conclusions:** Our results show that noise amplitudes are determined by expression dynamics, producing probability distributions distinct fromcd. Validation against macro features, we are using the model to investigate noise in hb expression. By simulating mRNA synthesis, we determine relative contributions of site number, strength, cooperativity, self-reg, and diffusion. This characterizes inherent noise due to low DNA copy numbers and mRNA. Identifying noise control in spatial patterns is fundamental; dynamics provide a model for patterning events. Amplification can be significant in hierarchical signaling, butcd delivers a non-noisy signal, indicating internal noise generation in mRNA and protein production.

**Title:** Quantifying the Strength of Selection Against Neander Ancestry in Modern Humans: A Genome-Wide Analysis of Neander Allele Frequency

**Research Question:** How does selection act against Neander ancestry in modern humans, and what are the causes of this selection?

**Methods:** We developed a novel method to estimate the genome-wide strength of selection and density of selected sites using Neander allele frequencies in modern humans. We applied this method to published estimates of Neander ancestry in modern humans and found that East Asians had higher initial levels of Neander ancestry than Europeans, even accounting for selection.

**Findings:** The bulk of purifying selection against Neander ancestry can be understood as acting on weakly deleterious alleles. These alleles were effectively neutral in Neander, but became selected against after entering human populations of larger size. Individually small, these alleles imposed a heavy genetic load on early human-Neander hybrids.

**Implications:** Differences in effective population size may play a more significant role in shaping introgression than previously thought. Our results enhance understanding of how selection shaped Neander contribution to human genomes and shed light on Neander-human hybridization.

**Conclusion:** Our study represents one of the first attempts to estimate the strength of genome-wide selection against introgression between populations. We found patterns of Neander ancestry in humans consistent with purifying selection against weakly deleterious alleles. We propose that the bulk of selection against Neander in humans is due to accumulation of alleles neutral in Neander, which were purged by weak selection after introgressing into human due to larger population size.

**Title:** Regulation of HIV-1 Gene Expression and Latency by the HIV Promoter within the Long Terminal Repeat (LTR)

**Research Question:** How do the cis-acting Sp1 and NF-κ elements in the HIV-1 promoter modulate viral gene expression and latency through the recruitment of activating and repressing complexes?

**Methods:** We employed lentivirus variants with mutations in the Sp and NFκ elements, flow cytometry, mRNA quantification, pharmacological perturbations, and chromatin immunoprecitation to investigate the functional contributions of each site to viral regulation.

**Findings:**

* The Sp sites stabilize both the active and inactive states, promoting gene expression and reducing histone acetylation and deacetylation.
* NFκ sites exhibit distinct properties, with κ site serving a stronger activating role than site II.
* Sp site plays a crucial role in the recruitment of p300 and RelA to the promoter.
* Analysis of 362 clonal cell populations infected with variants revealed mutations in any of the Sp sites yield a 6-fold higher frequency of clonal bifcation compared to the wild-type promoter.

**Implications:**

* Each Sp and NFκ site differentially contribute to regulation of viral expression, with Sp sites functionally "amp" transcriptional noise and modulate the frequency and maintenance of this model viral latency.
* These results have biomedical implications for the treatment of HIV latency.

**Conclusions:**

This study demonstrates the power of quantitative, dynamic phenotyping viral for dissecting regulatory inputs to the promoter in a proviral HIV model, revealing that Sp influences control stochastic expression by stabilizing both active and inactive states, likely playing a role in regulation of bursts viral expression and establishment of proviral latency.

**Title:** Comparative Evaluation of Orthology Methods: A Systematic Assessment of Accuracy and Performance

**Research Question:** How do different orthology methods compare in terms of phylogenetic and functional accuracy, and what are the implications for their applications in comparative genomics?

**Methods:** We evaluated nine leading orthology projects (CO, KOG, Inparan, Ortho, Ensembl, Com, Homene, Round, EggG, OMA) and two standard methods (bidirectional best-hit, reciprocal distance) using six tests, involving millions of sequences, hundreds of predicted ortholog pairs, and tens of thousands of trees. Phylogenetic and functional analyses required high specificity.

**Findings:** OMA and Homene performed best in phylogen and functional tests with high specificity, while OrthoCL outperformed Ensembl and Inan at lower specificity but higher coverage. EggG provided broad functional coverage but was not specific for phylogen or detailed analyses. Bidirectional best-hit outperformed complex algorithms in phylogen tests.

**Implications:**

1. Our study provides guidance for orthology users to choose the best database for their needs.
2. Introduces new methodology to verify orthology.
3. Sets standards for current and future approaches.

**Phylogen tests:** OMA and Homene showed best performances, also in functional tests with high specificity. OrthoCL outperformed Ensembl and Inan at lower specificity but higher coverage. EggG provided coarse-grained functional categories.

**Conclusion:** Despite numerous orthology projects, little is known about their performances. Our study compared 11 projects on both phylogen and functional definitions, allowing objective comparison. OMA, our project, based on evolutionary distances, excludes pseudoorths. Ensembl's reconciliation approach is different. Our results show trade-off remains, but Inan is no longer best; other projects have higher specificity or sensitivity. Accurate orth prediction is crucial for applications from annotation to phylogen analysis.

**Title:** Elucidating the Kinome of Schistoma Species and Identifying Novel Therapeutic Targets for Schistosomiasis through Computational Repurposing and Phenotypic Screening

**Research Question:** The emergence of resistance to existing treatments necessitates the development of novel therapeutics for neglected diseases, particularly parasitic infections of the tropics and sub-tropics, such as schistosiasis, caused by parasitic helmin infection of the genus Schistoma. The current 40-year-old drug, praziquel, is ineffective due to mass administration leading to drug-resistance.

**Methods:** We developed an innovative computational repur pipeline supported by phenotyp screening to identify new targets for schosias. Focusing on protein kinases, essential in parasite biological processes, we elucidated the kinome of Schistoma japonicum and updated kinomes of S. mansoni and S. haobium. Comparing with human kinome, we identified potential targets of existing inhibitors unique to Schoma, suggesting novel targets and approved drugs.

**Findings:** We identified previously schosidal agents bosutin, dasatin, and imib as well as new inhibitors vetan, saratin, tideus, alocib, dinlib, and 22 new targets CHK, CDC, WEE, PA, ME1. Primary and secondary targets in Schoma of approved drugs were also suggested, enabling novel therapeutics against neglected disease.

**Implications:** Kinases represent a significant proportion of approved drugs, regulating cell processes. The kinomes of two Schoma species have been defined, providing a complete analysis across all species to identify novel targets. Our methodology applied to schosias identified potential targets and drugs, verifying efficacy against all human infective stages Schoma. We elucidated the S japonome, completing kinomes of major Schoma infecting humans.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the necessity of combining target-based approaches with phenotyp screening. Many predictions were kinase inhibitors, we undertook extensive analysis of kinomes all Schoma species, including unexplored S. Our methodology enables the development of novel therapeutics against schos, a significant neglected disease.

**Title:** Unfolding and Binding of the pID Domain of CREB to the K Domain of Coactivator CB: Insights into the Mechanism of Target Recognition

**Research Question:** How does the phosphorylated ID (pID) domain of the transcription factor CREB fold and bind to the K domain of coactivator CB, and what is the mechanism of target recognition?

**Methods:** We employed a topology-based G-type model to simulate the folding and binding of pID to KIX and analyzed the transition states using a Bayesian formula relating equilibrium and transition ensembles.

**Findings:** Our simulations predict a coupled folding and binding mechanism with the existence of partially bound intermediates. Transition-path and Φ-value analyses reveal that the binding state resembles the unstructured state in solution, implying that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. The change of structure following binding is reminiscent of an induced mechanism, contrasting with models where binding occurs to pre-structured conformations exist in the unbound state. Increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a "fly-casting-like" process. Inclusion of attractive non-native interactions forms non-specific complexes that enhance the rate of binding but do not change the mechanism.

**Implications:** Our study explains how unstructured can confer an advantage in protein recognition. Simulations are in agreement with a recent nuclear magnetic resonance study and aid interpretation of experimental kinetics.

**Conclusions:** The phosphorylated ID (p) of transcription factor CREB is known to be unstructured when not bound to a target, suggesting folding and binding are concomitant. Our results suggest binding occurs together with folding, but folding into a helix structure occurs mostly after, with the transition state of pID resembling the unfolded state. The mechanism of folding and binding of pID to KIX is consistent with an induced-fit interpretation, where the ligand undergoes structural change. Our analysis of transition states shows structure is formed after binding, making pID to KIX binding more consistent with induced-fit.

**Title:** Systematic Review of Schistosomiasis Prevalence and Intensity in Children in Latin America and Caribbean Countries: Implications for Elimination Efforts

**Research Question:** What is the current prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America and Caribbean countries, and what are the implications for elimination efforts?

**Methods:** A systematic review of 132 articles published between 1942-2014 was conducted, including PubMed, LACS, EMBASE, and institutional websites (PA/WHO, Ministries of Health). Prevalence and intensity data from 1,242 points were analyzed, with 69.7% from Brazil.

**Findings:** High prevalence and intensity were found in Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia, requiring updated epidemiological status for national programs. Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but follow-up surveys needed. Heterogeneity in methodologies made cross-national comparisons difficult.

**Implications:** The burden of chronic infection may be present even in countries with eliminated transmission. Improved standardization of monitoring and evaluation methodologies are recommended using WHO guidelines. Additional epidemiological data by age and sex are required to meet regional elimination goals.

**Conclusion:** This systematic review highlights the need for updated schosmias status in historically endemic countries in LAC to address public health interventions for control and elimination or verify transmission of Schos mansoni.

**Title:** Heterosexual Transmission of HIV-1 is Characterized by a Genetic Bottleneck that Selects a Single Variant, the Transmitted Founder (TF), but not Enhanced Viral Fitness or Interferon Resistance

**Research Question:** What are the characteristics of HIV-1 variants that facilitate heterosexual transmission, and do they differ from non-transmitted (NT) variants in terms of viral fitness and interferon resistance?

**Methods:** We sequenced 167 full-length HIV-1 genomes and generated 40 infectious molecular clones (IMC) including TF and NT variants from six heterosexual transmission pairs at the time of transmission. Consensus-like genomes sensitive to antibodies were selected during transmission in these pairs, but TF variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness in terms of particle infectivity or replicative capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte dendritic cells (MDC). Additionally, resistance of TF to antiviral effects of interferon-α (IF-α) was not significantly different from NT variants from the same transmission pair.

**Findings:** Our results support the hypothesis that within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to adaptive immune responses reduces viral transmission potential. Contrary to previous studies, we found that HIV-1 transmission was not mediated by viruses with higher levels of interferon resistance, indicating that factors other than IF-α resistance constituted dominant determinants of fitness in these pairs. In vitro replicative capacity and IF-α resistance did not discriminate transmission potential viruses in quasi-species of chronically infected individuals.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that HIV-1 transmission is permissive to viruses within the range of interferon profiles observed in donors, and that factors other than IF-α resistance are key determinants of transmission fitness in these pairs. Characterizing TF in comparison to NT from epidemi-linked partners provides insight into viral requirements of HIV-1, potentially leading to new targets for intervention.

**Conclusions:** HIV-1 transmission is characterized by a genetic bottleneck that selects a single variant, the transmitted founder (TF), but not enhanced viral fitness or interferon resistance. Our results support the hypothesis that within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to adaptive responses reduces transmission potential. These findings have implications for understanding HIV-1 transmission and may lead to new targets for intervention.

**Title:** Filarialial Parasites Directly Induce Lymphangiogenesis and Lymphatic Differentiation in Human Lymphatic Endothelial Cells

**Research Question:** How do filarial parasites influence the lymphatic system, particularly in the absence of an adaptive immune response, and what are the underlying mechanisms of lymphatic pathology in filariasis?

**Methods:** Human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected serum from patients. Live parasites and filarial antigens induced significant LEC proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Serum from patients with patent filariasis (microfilar positive) and chronic lymphatic obstruction showed increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. Differentiation of LEC into tube-like structures was associated with increased matrix metalloproteases and TIMP (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases) levels.

**Findings:** Filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation in LEC. Gene expression analysis revealed altered genes involved in cellular organization and junction pathways, decreasing transendothelial transport. Filar proteins stimulate LEC to proliferate and differentiate into tube-like structures involving matrix metalloproases and TIM inhibitors.

**Implications:** Filar parasites induce lymphangiogenesis, a process specific to LEC, related to excretory-secretory components and circulating lymphogenic factors. Vessels formed are associated with extracellular matrix and not prototypical markers of lymphogenesis. Patent filari infection is associated with lymphatic dilatation in animal and human models.

**Conclusions:** Filar parasites directly induce lymphangi and lymphatic differentiation in LEC, providing insight into mechanisms of lymphatic pathology in filariasis. This study demonstrates filarial influence on LEC and lymphangiogenesis, distinct from previous studies using human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Filar proteins stimulate L to proliferate and differentiate into tube-like structures involving metalloproteases and TIM.

**Title:** Enhancing Single-Cell Genomic Sequencing through Microfluidic Multiple Displacement Amplification (DA) in Nanoliter Volumes

**Research Question:** Can microfluidic Multiple Displacement Amplification (DA) in nanoliter volumes improve the quality and specificity of single-cell genomic sequencing, reducing amplification bias and increasing the representation of all sequences?

**Methods:** We employed a microfluid device to isolate individual Escherichia coli cells and amplify genomic DNA using DA in 60-nl reactions, comparing the results to standard 50-μl volumes. The quality of amplification was assessed by qPCR and high-throughput pyrosequencing.

**Findings:** Our results show that reducing DA reaction volume lowers nonspecific synthesis from contaminant DNA and primer interactions, increasing amplification bias in nanol volumes. Single-cell amplic from both microl and naniter provided high-quality sequence data by pyrosequencing, demonstrating a straightforward route to sequencing from cells.

**Implications:** This study highlights the potential of microic DA in naniter volumes to enhance single-cell sequencing, facilitating the study of microbial ecology and evolution. The majority of microorganisms cannot be cultured, and DA enables amplification from isolated cells by flow cytometry or serial dilution. Combining DA with emulsion PCR preparation may improve sequencing specificity, as nonspecific DNAs are lost during PCR or clean steps. Our results demonstrate improved specificity for E. coli, with 99% contigs mapping to the reference genome.

**Conclusions:** This research demonstrates the effectiveness of microic DA in naniter for single-cell sequencing, reducing amplification bias and increasing representation of sequences. High-throughput pyrosequencing of single amplicons from both microl and naniter volumes provides high-quality data, enabling the study of microbial ecology and evolution. The combination of DA and emulsion preparation may further improve sequencing specificity, making it a powerful approach for single-cell applications.

**Title:** Landscape Structure and Land Use Influence Hantavirus Hosts in the Atlantic Forest: Implications for Disease Dynamics and Surveillance

**Research Question:** How do landscape structure and land use patterns influence the distribution of hantavirus hosts in the Atlantic Forest, and what are the implications for disease dynamics and surveillance?

**Methods:** We analyzed 283 rodent capture records from the Atlantic Forest and used geographically weighted models to test the influence of landscape predictors on havirus host proportions. We also assessed the correspondence between havirus host proportions in rodent communities and human vulnerability to havirus infection across the entire biome.

**Findings:** We found that havirus host proportions were positively influenced by landscape diversity, not habitat type or agricultural matrix. Small mammal diversity positively influenced pathogenic havirus host proportions, indicating habitat quality may be more important than competition with native species. Sugarcane plantations increased rodent host proportion, while defaunation did not correlate with pathogenic havirus genotypes. Spatial match between hotspots and human vulnerability was 17%, coldspots 20%.

**Implications:** Our results suggest strong land change influences havirus hosts at the landscape level across the Atlantic. Disease surveillance must be reinforced in southern and southeastern regions where predicted host and vulnerability match. Complex rodent dynamics and disease interactions may be more than hypothesized.

**Conclusions:** Landscape diversity positively influences pathogenic havirus host proportions in the Atlantic rodent community, likely due to increased agricultural and native habitat availability. Havirus host proportions are influenced by local species in the forest, but richness dilutes in southern communities. Defaun intensity varies for known havirus hosts, but not pathogenic viruses. Our results support four hypotheses: agricultural matrix, habitat diversity, defaun, and small mammal diversity increase havirus host proportions. We investigated havirus response to landscape, climate, and biodiversity patterns. Defaun leads havirus dominance in northern Atlantic, small mammal richness reduces pathogenic genotypes in southern.

**Title:** BCL2 Family Proteins Regulate Mitochondria-Mediated Apoptosis to Maintain Cell Homeostasis via Removal of Damaged and Pathogen-Infected Cells: Roles of BCL in Flavivirus Infection**

**Research Question:** How do BCL proteins regulate apoptosis in cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese Encephalitis, Dengue, and Zika viruses?

**Methods:** We investigated the roles of BCL proteins in apoptosis induction in cells infected with flaviviruses using in vitro and in vivo models.

**Findings:** Our results show that survival of infected cells depends on BXL, a pro-survival BCL protein, due to suppression of expression of another pro-surival protein M1. Treatment with BXL inhibitors, as well as deficient BXL gene expression, induced B/BA-dependent apoptosis upon infection with flavir. Flivirus attenuates protein synthesis, leading to reduction of short-life proteins like M1. Inhibition of BXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that BXL plays a crucial role in survival of cells infected with flaviruses, and BXL may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress propagation of family Flavidae viruses.

**Conclusions:** We propose a model to explain regulation of B2 family proteins upon infection with flavir. Infection with flavir reduces expression of M1 but BXL delays apoptosis in infected cells. Delay of apoptosis is crucial for viral dissemination to neighboring cells, leading to pathogenicity. Our results demonstrate that cells with flavir including JEV, DENV, and ZIK induce apoptosis by inhibition BXL through suppression of M1 expression. Furthermore, host synthesis is impaired in cells upon infection with flavir, leading to decay of labile proteins such as M1. Treatment with BXL inhibitors, as well as deficiency BXL, induced BBA-dependent apoptosis in infected cells.

**Title:** Estimating the Economic Burden of Canine Rabies in Vietnam: A Ten-Year Analysis (2005-2014)

**Research Question:** What is the economic impact of canine rabies in Vietnam, including direct and indirect costs of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), dog vaccination, and livestock losses, and disability-adjusted life years (DALs)?

**Methods:** We conducted a ten-year analysis (2005-2014) of the economic burden of canine rabies in Vietnam using data from personal interviews, literature, published reports, and primary data collection. We incorporated direct and indirect costs of PEP, dog vaccination, livestock, and DALs into the analysis.

**Findings:** The total economic impact of canine rabies in Vietnam was estimated at $719 million over the ten-year period, with 92% attributed to P-related costs. Canine rabies resulted in 36,560-45,700 DALs and 914 human deaths, with a mortality rate of 0.11 deaths/100,000, lower than reported in Asian countries. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that canine rabies impacts in Vietnam are consistent with those reported in Asia, with large expenditures on P and small investments in vaccination. The most effective control of canine rabies in humans is through veterinary public health campaigns preventing rabies rather than suppressing through P administration.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the significant economic burden of canine rabies in Vietnam, with large expenditures on P and small investments in vaccination. Our findings suggest that coordinated public health campaigns preventing rabies are more effective than suppressing through P administration.

**Title:** Distinct Forms of the Type II Secretion System (TSS) in Bacteria: Structural and Functional Insights into the Secretin-Pilotin Complex

**Research Question:** What are the structural and functional differences between distinct forms of the Type II Secretion System (TSS) in bacteria, specifically the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, and how do they differ in their secretin and pilotin components?

**Methods:** Comparative analysis of the secretin and pilotin components of TSS in Klebsella and Vibrio bacteria, crystal structure determination of the novel pilotin Asp from Vibrio cholera, and phylogenetic analysis of secretin and pilotin sequences.

**Findings:** Three distinct forms of TSS can be distinguished based on the characteristics of their secretin pores. The Klebsella-type and Vibrio-type TSS differ in their pilotin, which mediates transport and assembly into the outer membrane. The crystal structure of Asp from Vibrio cholera shows convergent evolution with Asp, functionally equivalent yet structurally unrelated to pilotins in Klebsella and other bacteria. Asp binds to a specific sequence in Vib-type secretins, enhancing secretin assembly, and homologs of Asp are found in Vibrio and Escherichia Shella with Vib-type TSS.

**Implications:** The correlation between Vib-type secretins, Asp-type pilotins, and AcD/S substrates in diverse bacteria may be due to acquisition of a complete secretin-pilot-substrate unit with the TSS operon. A self-contained system is demonstrated in EPEC and similar organization in Sboyii and pathotypes. Convergent evolution to common function is seen in Asp structure, with no similarity to Pul-Out family proteins. Biochemical analysis shows Asp binds S-domain in Vib-type secretins, distinguishing S-domains Klei-type and Vib-type secretins.

**Conclusions:**

1. Distinct forms of TSS exist based on secretin characteristics, with Kleella and Vib-type differing in pilotin.
2. Asp from Vib cholera shows convergent evolution, functionally equivalent yet structurally unrelated to pilotins.
3. Asp binds specific sequence in Vib-type secretins, enhancing assembly, and homologs found in Vib and Escheria Shella with Vib-type TSS.
4. Acquisition of complete secretin-pilot-substrate unit may explain correlation in diverse bacteria.
5. Convergent evolution to common function seen in Asp, structurally unrelated to Pul-Out family.
6. Biochemical analysis demonstrates Asp binds S-domain in Vib-type secretins, distinguishing S-domains Klei and Vib-type secretins.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Outer Membrane Protein 37 (OL37) in Leptira Pathogenesis: A Novel Insights into Leptiral Binding to Host Tissues

**Research Question:** What is the role of outer membrane protein 37 (OL) in the pathogenesis of leptospi, and how does it interact with host tissues?

**Methods:** We investigated the binding capacity of OL to various host components using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and examined the reactivity of sera from infected hamsters and leptpi patients to recombinant OL.

**Findings:** OL binds to human elastin, aorticin, fibrin, fibrinogen, fibrin fragment, fibronectin, and murine laminin with varying affinities. The binding to human elastin is enhanced by antiser for OL, suggesting involvement of OL in leptiral binding to elastin. OL is recognized by acute and convalescent leptpi sera and Leptira-infected hamster sera. OL is detected in pathogenic Leptira but not saprophytic Leira.

**Implications:** OL is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptira that may promote attachment to host tissues. The strong affinity of OL for elastin facilitates attachment to the inner elastin layer of exposed skin during abrasions, a crucial step in the lifecycle of Leptira.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of OL in the pathogenesis of leptpi and its potential as a target for diagnostic and protective antigens. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the role of OL in virulence and its interaction with host tissues at multiple stages of infection.

**Title:** Neutralizing Antibodies Isolated from HIV-1 Infected Individuals Recognize Epitopes in the Membrane Proximal External (MP) Region of gp41 that are Transiently Exposed during Viral Entry

**Research Question:** How do broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external (MP) region of gp41 that are transiently exposed during viral entry, and what are the implications for antibody-mediated neutralization?

**Methods:** We characterized two broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, 4E and 2F, which bind to viral epitopes in the MP region of gp41, and developed a model to calculate the probability of antibody-mediated neutralization during the pre-fusion intermediate period when epitopes are first exposed. The model predicts that for antibodies to be effective, the time to disable epitope must be shorter than the time the epit remains in the long-lived conformation induced by antibody binding, approximately 5 minutes or less for 4E and 2F.

**Findings:** We investigated the role of avidity in neutralization and found that 2F IgG, but not 4, is more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment, attributed to 2 interacting more stably with the viral membrane. The model elucidated parameters that determine the ability of antibodies to disable epitopes and proposed an extension to analyze neutralization data. The extended model predicts dependencies for neutralization on rate constants that characterize antibody binding, rate of gp41 fusion, and number of gp41 bridging the virus and target at the start of pre-fusion.

**Implications:** Analysis of neutral experiments indicate that only a small number of gp41 must be disabled to prevent fusion, but the model cannot determine the exact number from experiments alone. We present a model that allows to calculate, as a function of serum concentration, the probability of trivalent MP being disabled by polyreactive Abs. We also consider how probability disabling single epitope is related to blocking membrane fusion of HIV-1 and target at the start of pre-fusion stage.

**Conclusions:** The model predicts that for antibody to be effective in neutralizing HIV-1, the time to disable epitope must be shorter than time epit remains in long-lived conformation induced by binding. For 4 and 2, dissociation constants for breakup of long-lived complex, time to disable epit must be about 5 or less. Epitopes by 4 and 2 on gp are displayed on viral membrane after binding HIV to target has occurred and processes result in fusion have begun, stage between pre and post-fusion called pre-fusion has lifetime estimated range seconds to minutes.

**Title:** Long-term Efficacy of Ivermectin Treatment in Controlling Onchercias Infection and Transmission in Hyperendemic Foci in Mali and Senegal

**Background:** Onchocercias, a parasitic disease caused by Onchocerca volulus, is a significant public health problem in Africa. While ivermectin treatment has been effective in controlling the disease, its impact on transmission and elimination in hyperemic foci where vectors are highly efficient was unknown.

**Research Question:** Caniverect treatment interrupt and eliminate Onocerc infection in hyperemic foci in Africa?

**Methods:** A longitudinal study was conducted in three hyperemic foci in Mali and Senegal with 15-17 years of annual six-month iverect treatment to assess residual infection levels and transmission. Skin snip surveys were conducted in 131 villages, examining 29,753 individuals and 492,600 blackflies for Onoc volulus larvae using a DNA probe.

**Findings:** A declining trend in infection and transmission was observed after treatment. In two sites, prevalence and vector infectivity were zero 3-4 years post-treatment. In the third site with high pre-treatment levels, a decline to low transmission was observed 3-5 years post-treatment. All indicators were below elimination thresholds.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the feasibility of Onerc elimination with iverect treatment in some endemic foci Africa. Results inform current Onercias control elimination efforts in Africa.

**Implications:** We recommend iverect projects in areas with high endemic levels proceed with a similar methodology, including epidemiological and entomological evaluations for 3 years post-treatment. Sustained iverect activities have achieved control in most African areas, and Onias is no longer a public health problem in many areas.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Rhinovirus Entry: A Novel Insights into the Role of VP4 in Membrane Permeability

**Research Question:** How does the non-enveloped rhinovirus, a member of the picornavirus family, deliver its genome across the cell membrane without the aid of membrane fusion, and what is the role of the myristoylated capsid protein VP4 in this process?

**Methods:** We generated recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged human rhinovirus VP4 and investigated its ability to induce membrane permeability in liposome models using dextran-exclusion studies, chemical crosslinking, and electron microscopy.

**Findings:** Our results show that recombinant VP4 forms a multimer membrane pore with a channel size consistent with the transfer of single-stranded RNA, and its permeability is influenced by pH, comparable to that induced by infectious virions.

**Implications:** These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the involvement of VP in cell entry and a model for exploration of VP as a novel antiviral target for the picorn family.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that VP forms a multimer, size-selective membrane pore with dimensions consistent with transport of viral RNA, suggesting a novel mechanism for VP-mediated membrane permeability during picorn entry. Native VP is myristoylated at its N-termin, a feature of proteins with membrane binding properties. These findings support previous studies implicating VP in viral penetration and permeability, and suggest VP as an antiral target for this family of viruses.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Lipid A Modifications in Francisella tularens (Ft) Virulence and Immunity

**Research Question:** What is the role of lipid A modifications in Francisella tularens (Ft) virulence and immunity, and how do these modifications impact the host immune response to infection?

**Methods:** We identified three enzymes required for lipid A modifications in Francisella novicida (Fn), a pathogen of mice, specifically the presence of mannose (mF1), galactamine (m2), or both carbohydrates (mK). Mutants lacking galactamine (m2) or galosamine/mannose (mK) addition to lipid A were attenuated in mice by both pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. Aerosolization of mutants m2 and mK provided protection against challenge with wild-type (WT) Fn, whereas subcut administration only mK provided protection from challenge Fn.

**Findings:** Infection of alveolar macrophage line by mK mutant induced higher levels of tumor necrosis-α (TN-α) and macrophage inhibitory-2 (M-2) compared to infection with WT Fn. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (Bø) from Toll receptor (TLR) and TLR knockout mice infected with mK produced higher amounts of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and M-2 than Bø infected with Fn. However, production IL-6 and M-2 was undetectable in Bø from MyD−− mice infected either strain. My− mice were susceptible to m mutant infection.

**Implications:** We hypothesize that the ability of m mutant to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemine production and innate responses mediated by MyD signaling may be responsible for attenuation, leading to induction of immunity by this mutant. Activation of innate system and induction of pro-inflammatory via My-mediated pathway were essential for clearance m and possibly protection.

**Conclusion:** Lipid A modifications play a crucial role in Francisella virulence and protective immunity, and may aid in the development of effective Francisella vaccine. Three genes are highly homologous among sequenced Francisella genomes, suggesting conserved function. Mutants m2 and m were attenuated in mice by pulmonary and subaneous routes. Francisella LPS and lipid molecules lack immunostimulatory activity, recognized by TLR or TLR, and display little endotoxic properties in galos-treated mice.

**Title:** The Role of Ribosome-associated GTPase (RA-GTP) in Ribosome Assembly and RNA Processing in Staphylococcus aureus

**Research Question:** What is the function of the ribosome-associated GTPase (RA-GTP) Era in ribosome assembly and RNA processing in Staphlococcus aureus, and how does it interact with other enzymes involved in these processes?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Era, a conserved RA-GTP enzyme, in ribosome assembly and RNA processing in S. aureus using protein-protein interaction studies, RNA analysis, and growth assays.

**Findings:** We found that Era is not essential for S. aureus growth, but important for 30S ribosomal subunit assembly. Era interacts with the 16S rRNA endonuclease Y and DEAD-box helicase C, and both are required for rRNA processing and growth at suboptimal temperatures. Era and C also interact with the (p)ppG synthase Rel, positively impacting Era GTP activity but negatively C helic activity.

**Implications:** We propose that Era, in its GTP-bound form, acts as a hub on the ribosome, directing enzymes involved in RNA processing and ribosome assembly to their site. This activity is impeded by components of the stringent response, contributing to the slowed growth phenotype synonymous with this stress pathway.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that Era plays a crucial role in ribosome assembly and RNA processing in S. aure, interacting with enzymes involved in these processes. The stringent response can impact RA-Gase function through interactions with Era and C. We propose a model where Era acts as a guide for RNA/ribosome maturation enzymes to their substrates.

**Title:** Nitric Oxide Synthase Deficiency Enhances Lethal Toxin-Induced Vascular Insufficiency in Mice

**Research Question:** We investigated the role of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the pathogenesis of lethal toxin (LT)-induced vascular insufficiency in mice.

**Methods:** We used knockout mice deficient in NOS (N−/−) and wild-type (WT) mice to study the effects of LT on cardiovascular function and histopathology.

**Findings:** NOS−/ mice were strikingly sensitive to LT, with increased mortality and histopathological changes in the heart, including endothelial necrosis, interiber edema, and myofibril degeneration. In contrast, iOS−/ and eOS− mice showed no increased sensitivity to LT. Pharmacological inhibition of N with 7-nitindazole in WT mice replicated the increased sensitivity of N−/ mice. Histological analyses revealed LT-induced changes in heart morphology of N/− mice, but not WT. Electron microscopy showed pathological changes in both N/ and WT mice, varying in severity and timing. Biomarkers of cardiac injury (myoglobin, cardiac troponin, and fatty acid binding protein) were elevated in LT-treated mice rapidly.

**Implications:** Our results suggest a protective role for N against LT-mediated cardiac damage and indicate the heart as an early target of LT in mice.

**Conclusions:** NOS deficiency enhances LT-induced vascular insufficiency in mice, independent of macrophage sensitivity or cytokine responses. Pharmacological inhibition of N in WT mice replicated the increased sensitivity of N− mice. Histopathological and electron microscopy analyses revealed pathological changes in both N− and WT mice, varying in severity and timing. Biomarkers of cardiac injury were elevated in LT-treated mice. Cardioprotective therapy and allopurin had no beneficial effects, but nitric scavenger carbox-PT showed some protection. Echocardiography indicated reduced ejection fraction in both N− and WT mice, indicative of decreased contractile function.

**Title:** CRISPR-Cas-Mediated Gene Disruptions in Parasitic Nematodes: A Breakthrough in Understanding of Parasitic Nemat Biology

**Research Question:** Despite the prevalence of parasitic nematodes infecting over 1 billion people worldwide, our understanding of their biology has been hindered by the lack of genetic tools for intervention. Specifically, targeted gene disruptions and mutant phenotypes in parasitic nematodes have not been achievable.

**Methods:** We developed a method for introducing CRISPR-C9-mediated gene disruptions in the human parasitic worm Strongyloides stercalis. We targeted the S. steralis twitchin unc-22 gene, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects. S-22 mutations were resolved by homology-directed repair when a template was provided. Omission of repair resulted in deletions at the locus. S-22 mutations were heritable, passed through host and recovered mutant progeny.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate the applicability of CRPR-C9 to parasitic nematodes, enabling studies of gene function in medically relevant but previously intractable parasites.

**Implications:** This breakthrough opens avenues for investigation of parasitic nemat biology, disease mechanisms, and development of novel therapeutic strategies.

**Conclusions:** We report the first targeted gene disruptions in a parasitic nemat resulting in mutant phenotype. Exploiting the life cycle of the human parasitic worm S. steral to deliver CRPR-C9 constructs targeting S-22 into free-living adults, characterized S-22 mutations in L progeny (Fig 1).

**Title:** Modeling the Effects of Ribosome Drop on Translation Efficiency and Ribosome Density: A Novel Insights into Translational Regulation

**Research Question:** How does ribosome drop affect translational accuracy and nutrient responses during protein synthesis, particularly under conditions of amino acid starvation or aminoacyl-tRNA depletion due to high recombinant protein expression?

**Methods:** We developed a mathematical model to describe the effects of ribosome drop on ribosome density along mRNA and concomitant protein synthesis. Our results show that ribosome premature termination leads to non-intuitive ribosome profiles, such as increased rib density from 5' to 3' end.

**Findings:** Our model predicts that ribosome drop effects on translation are mRNA-specific and quantify resilience to drop, showing mRNAs with ribosomes are less affected than those without. Moreover, among mRN without ribosomes, resilience to drop correlates with elongation rate; fast codons are less affected. This is consistent with genome-wide analysis of S. cerevisiae, revealing mRN coding proteins involved in translation machinery, highly biased fast codons, resilient to ribosome drop. Under physiological conditions, mRN coding regulatory stress proteins less resilient to ribosome drop.

**Implications:** Our model allows analysis of translational efficiency individual mRN accounting for ribosome behaviors and mRNA variations in rib density from ribosome studies. Importantly, it predicts mRN sustaining rib queues for high initiation rates less affected by rib drop, and those without queues, higher rates more resilient to drop.

**Conclusions:** Ribosome drop plays a crucial role in translational regulation, particularly under stress conditions. Our model provides a framework to analyze effects rib drop on translation and rib density, crucial for interpreting ribosome data and estimating translation rates. Analysis of rib profiling data shows rib drop significant under physiological conditions, especially under stress, highlighting the need for a theoretical framework. Our results suggest resilience to rib drop mRN might change due redistribution translational resources, affecting initiation. Resilience to rib drop may play a role in gene regulation. Future work will analyze rib data at single gene level and compare profiles with predictions. Our model addresses open problems in translation, such as anti-correlation rib density mRNA length and effects high recombin protein production.

**Title:** Assessing the Feasibility of Interrupting Soil-Transmitted Helminth (STH) Transmission using Mass Drug Administration (DA) Strategies: A Simulation Study of the DeW3 Trial

**Research Question:** Can transmission of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections be interrupted using mass administration (DA) strategies, and if so, at what time point can interruption be reliably assessed?

**Methods:** A stochastic individual-based simulation model was employed to simulate the DeW3 community-randomized trial, comparing a control arm with annual treatment of children with DA and an intervention arm with community-wide bi-annual DA. Simulations were run for Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm (Necator american) at six months after the last round of DA, and the impact of DA coverage on the likelihood of bounce or elimination was evaluated.

**Findings:** Models suggest that clusters should be assessed for interruption after two years of surveillance, unless interruption can be ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage. A range of homogeneous prevalence estimates following high DA across clusters do not allow discrimination between bounce or interruption within 24 months of DA cessation.

**Implications:** If interruption is not achieved, infections can quickly bounce back to pre-treatment levels. Determining a breakpoint at early stages will reduce continuous monitoring efforts in settings where interruption is unlikely and avoid bounce to pre-treatment worm burdens during no-treatment.

**Conclusions:** The feasibility of interrupting ST transmission using DA remains uncertain due to challenges in sustaining high coverage across communities. The De3 trial aims to test this, with three years of treatment followed by two years surveillance. This study investigates whether interruption can be defined at earlier points. The results suggest that clusters should be assessed after two years, unless interruption can be ruled out through low coverage.

**Title:** Protective Immunity against Cholera is Serogroup-Specific: Evaluation of a Conjugate Vaccine Containing O-Specific Polysacchar (OSP) and Recombinant Tetanus Toxoid Fragment (Tc)

**Research Question:** Can a conjugate vaccine containing O-specific polysacchar (OSP) of Vibrio cholera and recombinant tetanus toxoid fragment (Tc) induce protective immunity against cholera in mice?

**Methods:** Mice were immunized intramuscularly on days 0, 21, and 42 with OSP:Tc or OSP only, with or without LT, a non-toxic immunoadjuvant derived from heat labile toxin Escherichia coli. Serum IgG, IgM, and IgA responses to OSP and LPS were detected by ELISA.

**Findings:** Significant IgG responses to OSP were detected following single immunization in mice receiving OSP:Tc with or without adjuvant. Anti-LPS Ig responses were detected following second immunization in these cohorts. No OSP or LPS Ig responses were detected in animals receiving unjugated OSP or without adju, or immunju alone. Responses were highest in immun with adjuvant. IgM responses were detected in OSP:Tc with or without adju, and unconjug OSP. LPS and vibriodal responses were in all cohorts except immunju alone. No IgA OSP or L responses in any group. Administration OSP:Tc adju induced memory cell responses OSP and 95% efficacy in mouse lethality cholera model.

**Implications:** A conjugate vaccine containing OSP and Tc is protectively immunogenic in mice. Development a cholera conjugate vaccine could induce long-term immunity, especially in young who poorly respond polyschar antigens.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates a cholera conjugate vaccine containing OSP from V cholera is immunogenic and induces OSP memory cell responses in mice. Protective immunity cholera serogroup is largely determined by O-specific polyschar (OSP) of lipopolyschar (L). OSP is poorly immunogenic, especially in young children. A conjug vaccine containing OSP and Tc could be used to induce long-term immunity, especially in young who poorly respond polyschar antigens.

**Title:** Fungal-Bacterial Interactions Modulate Bacterial Virulence in the Gut: A Novel Insights from a Mouse Model of Gastrointestinal Colonization

**Research Question:** How do fungal-bacterial interactions influence bacterial virulence in the gut, and what are the underlying mechanisms?

**Methods:** We used a neutropenic mouse model of gastrointestinal colonization to investigate interactions between Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

**Findings:** Candida albicans inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence by suppressing pyelin and pyoverine gene expression, critical for iron acquisition and virulence. Deletion of pyelin and pyd genes attenuates P aerugin virulence. Heat-killed C albicans has no effect on P aerugin, whereas C albicans secreted proteins suppress P aer pyoverine and pyd expression and inhibit aer vir in mice. Suppression of pyelin and pyd genes has no effect on aer ability to colonize GI tract, but decreases aer cytotoxic effect on colonocytes. Iron supplementation restores aer vir in aer and alb colonized mice.

**Implications:** Our findings provide insight into how fungal-bacterial interactions modulate bacterial virulence in the gut, highlighting a novel mechanism of fungal inhibition of bacterial effectors critical for virulence but not colonization. This validates the use of mammalian system to explore complexities of polymicrobial polyking infections to identify therapeutic targets preventing disease.

**Conclusions:** Fungal-bacterial interactions play a crucial role in modulating bacterial virulence in the gut, with Candida albicans inhibiting Pseudomonas aerugin virulence through suppression of pyelin and pyine expression. Deletion of py and py genes attenuates aer vir, while heat-killed alb has no effect, but alb secreted proteins suppress py and inhibit vir. Suppression of py and py has no effect on colonization but decreases cytotoxic effect on colonocytes. Iron supplementation restores vir in aer and alb colonized mice. These findings highlight the importance of fungal-bacterial interactions in modulating bacterial virulence and suggest potential therapeutic targets for preventing disease.

**Title:** Delayed Reversion of Escape Mutant Virus to Wild-Type Virus in HIV and SIV Infection: Implications for Viral Load and Pathogenicity

**Research Question:** What is the relationship between the timing of reversion of escape mutant (EM) virus to wild-type (WT) virus in HIV and SIV infection and viral load, and pathogenicity?

**Methods:** We investigated the reversion of EM to WT virus in SIV and SHIV-infected maca using a sensitive PCR assay. Infection mixes of EM and WT virus containing ≥10% WT resulted in rapid outgrowth of WT virus at S Gag CD8 cell epitopes within 7 days of infection. In contrast, biologically passaged SHmn viruses with smaller proportions of WT or pure EM demonstrated delayed or slow reversion, associated with lower viral loads.

**Findings:** The diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion to WT, which predicts the outcome of infection. Delayed reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 cell escape mutations suggests opportunities to reduce pathogenicity of HIV during early infection.

**Implications:** Reduced replicative capacity of EM virus leads to reversion from EM to WT in HIV-infected humans and S-infected maca following transmission to naïve hosts lacking MHC alleles recognizing the epitope. Lack of reversion at key G CD8 cell epitopes is associated with lower viral loads in humans.

**Conclusions:** The timing of reversion of EM to WT virus in HIV and SIV infection has significant implications for viral load and pathogenic. Delayed reversion is associated with lower viral loads and potentially less pathogenic infections. The diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion, which predicts the outcome of infection.

**Title:** Adaptive Evolution of Cadmium Resistance in Yeast Strains from Evolution Canyon, Israel: A Study of the Molecular Mechanisms and Implications**

**Research Question:** How do yeast strains from Evolution Canyon, Israel, exhibit high tolerance to cadmium, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms driving this adaptation?

**Methods:** We analyzed a set of yeast strains from Evolution, Israel, and found that cadmium resistance is primarily caused by enhanced function of the metal efflux pump PCA1. Molecular analyses revealed that mutations in the promoter region are responsible for the enhancement, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect. Reconstruction experiments showed that single nucleotide substitutions in the PCA promoter quantitatively increase its activity and enhance cells' cadmium resistance.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the critical nucleotides in EC strains are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other species, suggesting they represent an ancestral type. However, these nucleides diverged in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, giving cells advantages under conditions where cadmium is low or absent.

**Implications:** Our study provides a rare example of selective sweep in yeast populations driven by trade-off between metal resistance and fitness. We propose that cad-sensitive strains arrived in Evolution more recently and have not adapted to the environment. An in-depth study combining genomics and distribution of EC strains will address this issue.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of PCA1 in cadmium efflux and its adaptation in yeast evolution. We show that PCA has experienced rounds of selective adaptation, and a weak allele spread to S. cerevis populations due to trade-off between metal resistance and fitness under cad conditions. S. cerevis strains are 20-fold more sensitive to cadmium, likely due to regulatory fine-tuning to maintain cadmium efflux activity without compromising fitness under normal conditions. This optimized PCA might explain its efficient spread to S. cere populations.

**Title:** Elucidating Oncogenic Pathways in Gastric Cancer: A Novel Approach to Stratification and Survival Prediction

**Background:** Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with a high degree of molecular heterogeneity in deregulation of oncogenic pathways. We aimed to identify major oncogenic pathways in GC with significant relationships to patient survival using gene expression signatures.

**Research Question:** Can we devise an in silico strategy to map patterns of oncogenic activation in primary gastric cancers and identify oncogenic pathways deregulated in the majority of GC cases?

**Methods:** We developed an in silico method to map levels of pathway activation in complex tumor profiles and validated pathway-directed classification using proof-of-concept examples from breast cancer. We applied this method to eleven oncogenic pathways implicated in gastric carcinogenesis, including RAS, p53, BRCA1, p21, Wnt/β-caten, EF, SRC, MYC, NF-κ, histone deacetylation (HD), and stem-cell signatures.

**Findings:** We identified three oncogenic pathways (proliferation/stem, NF-κ, and Wnt/β-caten) deregulated in >70% of gastric cancers. Functionally validated these predictions in a panel of gastric cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway showed reproducible and significant differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting pathway interactions play a role in disease behavior. GC can be taxonomized by oncogenic activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups.

**Implications:** Predicting pathway activity by expression permits study of cancer-related pathways simultaneously in primary cancers at scale not achievable by other platforms. This novel approach enables stratification of GC into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups, potentially improving treatment and survival outcomes.

**Conclusion:** Our in silico strategy maps oncogenic activation in primary cancers and identifies deregulated pathways in majority of GC. Functionally validated predictions in gastric cell lines and patient stratification by pathway shows reproducible survival differences, suggesting pathway interactions play a role in disease behavior. Predicting pathway activity by expression enables study of cancer-related pathways simultaneously in primary cancers, a scale not achievable by other platforms. This novel approach enables stratification of GC into biologically and clinically subgroups, potentially improving treatment and survival.

**Title:** Structural Instability of DNA Duplex DNA (SIDD) in Bacterial Genomes: Association with Transcriptional Regulatory Genes and Environmental Responses

**Research Question:** Do structural instability of duplex DNA (SIDD) sites in bacterial genomes correlate with transcriptional regulatory genes and environmental responses?

**Methods:** We analyzed the SIDD profile of the Escherichia coli K12 genome and found that strongly destabilized sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions, known or inferred to contain promoters, but rarely in coding regions. We investigated whether genes in different functional categories have characteristic S properties in their upstream regions.

**Findings:** Strong SIDD sites in E. coli12 are statistically overrepresented in upstream of genes encoding transcription regulators, particularly those responding to physiological and environmental stimuli. If a pathway is controlled by a transcription regulator with a destabilized 5' flank, the genes (operons) in that pathway usually contain strongly destabilized S sites in 5' flanks. This association is observed in 38 of 43 free-living bacteria but only 4 of 18 endosymbion or obligate parasitic bacteria.

**Implications:** S sites in 5' to genes may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes, known to transiently alter superhelicity. We propose S sites are active and necessary in superically mediated mechanisms governing global gene expression in proary in response to physiological or environmental changes.

**Conclusions:** Upstream of genes whose products function in transcription have a significant association with strongest S sites in freeiving bacteria but not endosion and parasitic. Genes in E.12 that respond to physiological stimuli are more likely to have highly destabilized 5' flanks than others, even within regulator family. S sites in E.12 are significantly associated with upstream of genes products in transcription, including activators, repressors, and two-component systems. This association is observed in numerous freeiving bacteria but not obligate paras endosymbion.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of High Mobility Group (HMG) Proteins in Fungal Development and Reproduction: A Systematic Analysis of HMG Genes in Podospora anina

**Research Question:** What is the role of High Mobility Group (H) proteins in fungal development and reproduction, specifically in the filamentous ascomyc Podospora anina, and how do they regulate mating-type genes and fertility?

**Methods:** A systematic deletion analysis of eight uncharacterized HMG genes in P. anina revealed that none were essential for viability, but seven were involved in the sexual cycle. Transcriptional analyses of H-box genes in H-box strains indicated that PaMG is the hub of a network of H-box factors regulating mating-type and mating target genes. Genetic analyses revealed this network also controls fertility genes not regulated by mating transcription factors.

**Findings:**

* PaMG5, an ortholog of Ste from Schizosacomyces pombe, is a pivotal activator of mating genes in P. anina, whereas PaMG is a repressor of several phenomena specific to stationary phase, notably hyph anoses.
* Two H-box display striking features: PaMG and Ste are conserved transcriptional regulators of mating genes, although P. anina and S pom diverged 550 million years ago.
* H-box genes SO9 and its regulator SRY play a role in sex determination in mammals.
* P. anina and S pom mating genes and upstream factor form a module H-box analogous to SRY/SOX, revealing commonality of sex regulation in animals and fungi.

**Implications:**

* This study provides new insights into the role and relationships of H-box in P. anina, revealing a network of H-box upstream FMR and F1 mating-type genes.
* PaMG plays a central role in this network by regulating mating gene transcription.
* Ten of 12 H-box identified in P. an control fertility and development.
* Distribution of H-box genes may be biased to chromosome 1, which contains mating locus.

**Conclusions:**

* This study highlights the critical role of H-box in sexual reproduction in fungi, with 11 of 12 members involved in cycle P. anina.
* PaMG and Ste are conserved transcription regulators of mating genes, although P an and pom diverged 550 years ago.
* H-box genes SO9 and its regulator SRY play role in sex determination in mammals.
* P an and pom mating genes and upstream factor form module H-box analogous SRY/SOX, revealing commonality sex regulation in animals and fungi.

**Title:** Investigating the Persistence of Ebola Virus in Survivors' Body Fluids: A Cohort Study in Sierra Leone during the 2014-2016 Epidemic

**Research Question:** What is the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors' body fluids and the risk of transmission, including sexual transmission, during the 2014-2016 epidemic in Sierra Leone?

**Methods:** An observational cohort study was designed and implemented during the epidemic response in Sierra Leone to determine the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors' body fluids. The study was conducted in two phases: the first phase assessed the persistence of Ebola virus in semen of 100 adult men within five months of initial discussions, and the second phase assessed the persistence in multiple body fluids (semenstrual, vaginal, blood, breast milk, urine, rectal, sweat, saliva, tears) of 120 men and 120 women.

**Findings:** Data from the study informed national and global guidelines in real-time, demonstrating the need to implement semen testing among Ebola disease survivors. The study also accelerated the implementation of such programs in virus-affected countries and informed examining persistence of Zika virus.

**Implications:** Research is a vital component of public health response to a poorly characterized disease. Adequate resources should be made available to answer critical questions to better inform response efforts.

**Conclusions:** The Sierra Ebola Virus Persistence Study was able to commence enrollment within five months of protocol discussions and publish results within 10 months of discussions, despite difficult circumstances during the epidemic. This led to sustained interest from the community and health authorities for understanding EBO persistence after recovery from acute infection. The study demonstrated the importance of strong community engagement in implementing research during an epidemic.

**Title:** Deciphering the Chemical Gradients in Bacterial Chemotaxis: A Multidisciplinary Approach to Understanding

**Research Question:** How do chemotactic Escheria coli cells perceive and respond to chemical gradients in their natural environment, and what are the statistical properties of the stimuli they typically encounter?

**Methods:** We employed a multidisciplinary approach combining fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, information theory, and simulations to investigate the chemotactic sensory system of Escheria coli. We analyzed dose-response curves from in vivo FRET measurements and swimming trajectories of bacteria to predict the chemical gradients cells encounter in their habitat.

**Findings:** Our results show that maximizing mutual information implies maximizing the alignment of cell trajectories with the chemactic index and velocity, indicating that cells swim up the gradient. We found that chemactic E. coli typically encounter exponential gradients in their natural habitat, as their pathway has evolved to maintain perception in these. The Weber-Fech law, which focuses on perception changes in concentration as bearers of information, does not predict the distribution of gradients, but we quantify this view using information theory and simulations.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible microenvironments, such as the human intestine. The chemotaxis system enables bacteria to detect and migrate in chemical gradients of nutrients and toxins, and our model connects phenomenological laws with information theory at the molecular level. Unlike other sensory systems, it is relatively simple with few components and well understood at the molecular level.

**Conclusions:** The chemotactic sensory system has evolved to respond to input of certain statistical properties and transmit information through biochemical pathways. Our results suggest that chemactic E. coli typically encounter exponential gradients in their habitat, as their pathway has evolved to maintain perception in these. The Weber-Fech law does not predict the distribution of gradients, but we quantify this using information theory and simulations. Our study provides a first step towards understanding the chemical environment of chemactic bacteria in terms of distributions, matching statistical properties of stimuli and cellular responses. The chemaxis system enables bacteria to detect and migrate in gradients of nutrients and toxins, and our model connects phenomenological laws with information at the molecular level.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mystery of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Lifespan: A New Insights from Reliability Theory and Computational Modeling

**Research Question:** What controls the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the same animal, exposed to the same environment?

**Background:** Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are functionally defined by their multipotency and self-renew capacity. Due to their self-renew capacity, Hs were thought to have an indefinite lifespan. However, increasing evidence suggests that genetically identical Hs differ in lifespan, and the lifespan of H is predetermined and H-intrinsic. Lifespan is defined as the time H gives rise to mature blood cells.

**Methods:** We employed clonal repulation experiments and computational-mathematic modeling to investigate small-scale molecular failures at the H population level. We found that the best fit of experimental data provided a model where repulation kinetics of H are largely anti-persistent, mean-reverting processes. Failure rates increase during population division events are counteracted by repair processes, leading to a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior.

**Findings:** In the long-run, a crossover occurs due to an increase in mean failure rate self-renew, leading to clonal extinction. This suggests the capacity of Hs is self-limit. Furthermore, we show that lifespan each H depends on amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in failure kinetics. Short and longer-lived Hs differ in pre-program ability to dissipate perturbations.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that lifespan Hs are determined by pre-programmed differences in repair capacity. This has implications for understanding aging in Hs and other non-homogenous, hierarchically organized cell systems.

**Conclusion:** Reliability theory provides a new framework for understanding the diversity of lifans Hs. Our approach does not depend on particular failure and repair mechanisms, opening avenues for longitudinal data interpretation.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Mechanism of Antibody-Dependent Macrophage Activation against Intestinal Helmin Infections

**Research Question:** How do antibodies contribute to protective immunity against intestinal helmin infections, and what are the underlying mechanisms of their interaction with macrophages?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of antibodies in mediating immunity against the murine parasite Heligomosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hp) using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. We generated mice lacking antibodies (J−/−) or activating Fc receptors (cγ/−) and challenged them with Hp, and analyzed tissue damage, larval motility, and macrophage activation.

**Findings:** Mice lacking antibodies harbored highly motile larvae, developed extensive tissue damage, and accumulated Arginase-1 expressing macrophages around the larvae. In contrast, Hp-specific antibodies induced Fcγ and complement-dependent adherence of macroph to larvae in vitro, resulting in complete larval immobilization. Moreover, antibodies reprogrammed macroph to express wound-healing genes, including Arginase, and Argase product Lornine directly impaired larval motility. Antibody-induced Argase expression in vitro and in vivo occurred independently of IL-4α signaling.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel IL-α-independent mechanism of macroage activation that is antibody-dependent, which mediates anti-helmin immunity and prevents tissue disruption caused by migrating larvae. This mechanism is distinct from the previously described IL-α-dependent alternative activation of macroages. We propose the term "helmin-antib-activated macrophages" (HAM) to describe this novel subtype of alternatively activated macro.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates a novel effector function of antibodies in activating macro to modulate the expression of genes associated with the alternatively activated phenotype. We show that antibodies trap helmin larvae and prevent parasite-induced tissue damage, and reprogram macro to express wound-healing genes. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized component of macro regulation during type 2 immune responses and provide new insights into the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity against intestinal helmin.

**Title:** Visualizing Chromosome Dynamics during Homologous Recombination: A New Insights into the Early Steps of Double Strand Break Repair

**Research Question:** How does the process of homologous recombination (HR) repair double strand breaks (DSB) in chromosomes, and what are the dynamics of chromatin resection during this process?

**Methods:** We developed a novel, non-invasive method called ParBINT, which uses oligomerization rather than multiplicity to form visible foci, allowing for real-time analysis of resection in living cells. We applied it to the HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III.

**Findings:** Monitoring chromatin dynamics next to a DSB revealed transient confinement of the damaged region during early resection, consistent with the need to keep ends in contact. Resection in y70 mutant began ∼10 min earlier than wild type, defining the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. We also observed a severe reduction in mobility of broken ends accompanying initial resection.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics and mechanism of resection, and the ParINT system will be applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome organization and function in normal and pathological contexts.

**Conclusions:** Double strand breaks are a major threat to genome integrity, and HR is the most accurate way to repair them. However, the early steps of resection have been poorly understood. Our study reveals transient confinement of chromatin during early re, and a distinct phase of confinement of chromatin neighboring DSB. The ParINT system allows direct measurements in single cells without interfering with the process, making it widely applicable to study chromosome dynamics beyond repair, such as gene expression and replication.

**Key points:**

* HR is the most accurate way to repair DSB, but early steps of resection have been poorly understood
* ParINT allows real-time analysis of re in living cells without interfering with process
* Chromatin confinement during early re consistent with need to keep ends in contact
* Resection in y70 mutant ∼10 min earlier than wild, defining commitment to homology repair
* Reduction in mobility of broken ends accompanies initial re
* ParINT applicable to fine-scale analysis genome organization and function in normal and pathological contexts

**Title:** Estimating the Frequency and Timing of Trypanosoma cruzi Reinfections in Humans: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** What is the frequency and timing of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) reinfections in humans, particularly during the acute and chronic stages of the disease, and how do these reinfections impact the risk of chronic manifestations?

**Methods:** We developed stochastic agent-based models to estimate the rate of reinfection in humans and assess the frequency of reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease, according to alternative hypotheses on the adaptive immune response following primary infection. Using a hybrid algorithm, the models were fitted to epidemiological data from Argentinean rural villages with mixed T. cruz infections in 56% of humans.

**Findings:** The model predicted 0.032 (0.008-0.042) annual reinfections per individual, with 98.4% occurring in the chronic phase. Parasites escaped the adaptive response after primary infection in at least 20% of re-infection events. Annual reinfection rates during the chronic stage were 14% (4-18%) and 60 (21-70) after 5 and 30 years, with individuals reinfected 1-3 times.

**Implications:** These estimates are crucial for vaccine development and understanding the higher risk of chronic manifestations by infected living in endemic areas.

**Conclusions:** Our agent-based modeling approach, accounting for multiple T. cruzi genotypes, provides the first estimates of frequency and timing of reinfections from epidemiological data. Reinfections can cause mixed infections, with different genotypes. The predicted rates of mixed-infections compared the observed to infer the rate reinfection and discriminate hypotheses on host response relevance. This conceptual framework infers the rate rein and timing parasites evade immune persistence in humans.

**Title:** Differential Pre-existing Immune Responses to Dengue Virus (DENV-1) Infection Predict Clinical Outcomes in a Cohort of Thai School-Aged Children

**Research Question:** Can pre-existing immune responses to Dengue virus (DENV-1) infection predict the clinical outcome of subsequent infection in a cohort of Thai school-aged children?

**Methods:** Blood samples were collected from a cohort of Thai school-aged children who experienced subclinical DENV infection or developed deng illness. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) prior to infection were stimulated in vitro with DENV and secretion of 30 cytokines was measured using multiplex bead array. Significant differences were found in cytokine production based on the type of D used for stimulation and occurrence of illness.

**Findings:** Secretion of IL-15 and MCP-1 was significantly higher by PBMC of subjects who developed symptomatic DENV infection. In addition, IL-6 was produced by PB from all who developed symptomatic infection versus 59% who had subclinical. Secretion of IL-12, IL-2, MIP-α, RANT, GM-CSF, and TNα was significantly lower by PB from symptomatic subjects.

**Implications:** These data demonstrate significant differences in pre-existing responses to DENV associated with clinical outcome of infection. The finding higher levels of cytokines in symptomatic subjects and lower levels in subclinical supports existence of both protective and pathologic immune profiles. Clinical-immunological correlations in natural D infection may be useful for evaluating responses to deng vaccines.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of pre-existing immune responses in predicting clinical outcomes of DENV infection. Higher levels of IL-15 and MCP-1 in symptomatic subjects and IL-6 in subclinical suggest potential role in disease pathogenesis. Lower levels of IL-12, IL-2, MIP-α, R, ANT, GMF, and TNα in symptomatic subjects indicate potential protective profile. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore mechanisms underlying immune responses.

**Title:** Dynamics of Hedgehog Signaling in the Drosila Wing Disc: A Novel Insights into Pattern Formation of Gene Expression

**Research Question:** How does the dynamics of Hedgehog (H) signaling contribute to the patterning of gene expression in the Drosila wing disc, and what is the role of the H gradient in specifying distinct domains of gene expression?

**Methods:** We employed mathematical modeling and experimental approaches to investigate the dynamics of H signaling in the Dila wing disc. Numerical simulations of Equations 1-5 were used to examine the establishment of the H gradient, and in vivo experiments were conducted to examine the temporal expression of H target genes.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the interpretation of H signaling depends on the history of exposure to H and that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Mathematical modeling predicts that only two domains can be defined in response to H, suggesting that boundaries of or more gene patterns cannot be specified by a static H gradient. Computer simulations suggest a "overshoot" of the H gradient, a transient in which H profile is expanded compared to H-state. In vivo examination of H target expression reveals patterns expand initially and refine, providing evidence for the overshoot. The H gene architecture suggests overshoot results from H-dependent upregulation of Patched (Ptc). Altering the network such that P is no longer upregulated in response to H-signaling activation, patterns of expression, distinct in wild-type discs, now overlap.

**Implications:** Our findings support a model in which H gradient dynamics, resulting from P upregulation, play an instructional role in establishment of patterns of expression. This challenges the prevailing view of H as a classical morphogen and highlights the importance of dynamics in patterning.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the role of H in Dila wing patterning and highlights the significance of gradient dynamics in specifying distinct domains of gene expression. Our results suggest a new model of pattern formation, which takes into consideration gradient to explain H-dependent patterning of the disc.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Ethanol Anesthetics' Influence on the Nervous System: Identification of a Novel Mutation in the Mouse Homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans unc-79 Gene

**Research Question:** The mechanisms by which ethanol and inhaled anesthetics influence the nervous system are poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the positional cloning and characterization of a new mutation isolated in N-ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis for animals with enhanced locomotor activity.

**Methods:** We conducted an ENU mutagenesis screen in mice and identified a novel allele, Lightweight (Lwt), which disrupts the homolog of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. eleg) unc-79 gene. Lwt/L homozygotes were perinatal lethal, while Lightweight heterozygotes were dramatically hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure.

**Findings:** Experiments in C. elegans demonstrated conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants, extending this observation to related unc-80 and nca-1;n-2 mutants. Lightweight heterozyotes exhibited an altered response to anesthetic isoflurane, reminiscent of unc invertebrate mutant phenotypes. Consistent with initial results, heterozygotes were mildly active in a novel environment and smaller than wild-type animals. Additionally, heterozygotes exhibited increased food consumption with lean body composition. Notably, heterozyotes voluntarily consumed more ethanol than wild-type littermates.

**Implications:** The hypersensitivity and increased consumption of ethanol in heterozygous mice combined with observed hypersensitivity in C. elegans unc-79, unc-80, and n-2 mutants suggest a conserved pathway influencing alcohol-related behaviors in humans.

**Conclusions:** Whole-genome sequencing confirmed the absence of confounding mutations in the 1.4 Mb interval. Alterations observed in heterozyotes response to ethanol and anesthetics were qualitatively similar to those reported in C. elegans and Drosophila; however, differences existed. The dominant phenotype of Lightweight resulted from a nonsense mutation in the mouse homolog of C. eleg unc-79. Heterozyotes were mildly active and altered to ethanol inhaled anesthetics, consistent with conserved function of mammalian unc-79 product.

**Title:** Elucidating the Anopheles gambiae Immune Response against Plasmodium falciparum: Unveiling the Imd Pathway as a Promising Target for Malaria Control

**Research Question:** What are the key components of the Anopheles gambia immune response against Plasium falcum, the etiological agent of human malaria, and how can they be exploited to control malaria transmission?

**Methods:** We employed RNA interference to silence Cas, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, and overexpress REL2, an Imd-controlled NF-kappaB transcription factor, to confer a resistant phenotype on A. gambia mosquitoes. We identified genes participating in the anti-Plmod signaling regulated by Cas, which represent potential targets for pathway overactivation.

**Findings:**

* The Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, with reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oysts.
* Cas silencing alone induces a robust anti-falcum response in the absence of gut microbiota.
* Imd components TEP, APL, and LR1 are integral to parasite intensity defense, highlighting the relevance of laboratory versus natural infection models.

**Implications:** Our results highlight physiological considerations for I pathway manipulation in A. gambia to limit malaria transmission and reveal nuances in I-directed response against P. falcum.

**Conclusions:** The Anophe g Imd pathway is a promising target for malaria control, with Cas, I, FADD, CAS1, and REL as key players. We propose a model of the A. g I pathway in context P. falcum infection and demonstrate the contribution of specific Imd components in anti-Plmod defense. The I pathway is uniquely potent against P. falcum, with TEP, FBN, and LR7 as major players in Plmod killing in Cas-sil mosquitoes. Strong infection phenotypes by silencing multiple I members suggest this module is major in anti-falc defense.

**Title:** Investigating the Anti-Fibrotic Potential of Bone Marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (BMMs) in a Model of Pulmonary Fibrosis Induced by Paracidioides brasiliensis

**Research Question:** Can bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMs) exert an anti-frotic effect in a model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by Paracoides brasili infection?

**Methods:** BAL/c mice were inoculated with 1.5x106 P. brasili yeasts via intranasal infection, followed by intravenous administration of 1x106 BMs at 8 weeks post-infection. An additional group was treated with itraconazole (ITC) two weeks prior to BMS administration. Animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks post-infection. Histological examination, fibrocy counts, soluble collagen, and fibrosis-related gene expression in lungs were evaluated. Humanroblasts were treated with homogen lung supernatants (HLS) to determine collagen expression.

**Findings:** Histological analysis showed increased granulomatous inflammatory areas in BMS-treated mice. Significant increases in fibcy count, soluble collagen-3, T-β, MMP-8, and MMP-15 expression were observed in those mice. Combined BMS/ITC therapy decreased TIM-1 and MMP-13 expression. Humanroblasts stimulated with HLS from infected BMS-transplanted mice showed higher collagen expression.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that late infusion of BMs into infected with P. bras does not have anti-frot effect, possibly due to interaction with fungus promoting collagen and tissue remodeling.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate an exacerbating effect of BMS therapy on pulmonaryrosis induced by P. bras infection. We hypothesize this could be triggered by interaction with P compounds or inflammatory environment induced by process. Combined IT/BMS showed promising results, synergistically reducing TIM-1 and MMP-13.

**Title:** Seasonal Dynamics of Phlebotine Vectors of Leishmania infant in the Mediterranean Region: Implications for Leishiasis Transmission

**Research Question:** What are the seasonal patterns of phbotine vectors of Leishmania infant in the Mediterranean region, and how do they impact leishis transmission?

**Methods:** In 2011-2013, a consortium of partners from eight Mediterranean countries conducted entomological investigations at sites where L. infant transmission was reported. A common protocol for fly collection included monthly captures by CDC traps and sticky traps. Collections were replicated for over one season to reduce weather effects. Data from 99,000 specimens were analyzed, resulting in the description of seasonal dynamics of 56,000 sand flies belonging to L. infant vector species.

**Findings:** Time of fly appearance/disappearance differed between sites, and densities varied in each. Significant correlations were found between latitude/annual temperature and first fly appearance (April-June) and density trend (May-Sept). A 3-modal trend for P. tobi in Cyprus represents a novel finding for L. infant vector. Adults ended activity mid-November, without correlation with latitude/annual temperature. Period of exposure L infant in Mediterranean, inferred from adult densities, was a bell-shaped curve with peak July-Sept, and May-Oct for 99% values. No risk leishias transmission occurred Dec-March. Nocturnal activity peaked 11-2 am, with annual variations.

**Implications:** A common pattern of nocturnal activity was found, peaking between 11-2 am. Annual collections provided homogeneous patterns of behavior, proposing sentinel areas for future monitoring. Higher risk L infant transmission was identified June-Oct (97% density), but not equally distributed, with waves occurring earlier and frequent in southern territories.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a robust baseline for surveillance on fly dynamics that may impact leishias transmission in the future. Our findings confirm temperature is a major determinant for activity of leishias vectors. The period of adult activity is typically seasonal, with diapause in cold months. Nocturnal activity is generated by circadian clock, which may not be influenced by global temperature rise. Our study complements predictions of leishias risk with sand activity and abundance.

**Title:** Obligate Intracellular Bacterium Orientia tsutsamushi Induces Monocyte Polarization and Type I Interferon Response in Human Monocytes: Implications for Scrub Typhus Pathogenesis**

**Research Question:** What is the transcriptional response of human monocytes to Orientia tsutsamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, a life-threatening disease in the Asia-Pacific region?

**Methods:** We isolated monocytes from healthy donors and exposed them to Orientia tsamushi in vitro. We used microarray analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. We also isolated mononuclear cells from patients with scrubus and compared them to healthy controls.

**Findings:** Orientia tsam upregulated more than 4,500 genes in monocytes, including interferon-stimulated genes and M1 macrophage polarization. It induced apoptosis-related genes and cell death in small percentage of monocytes. Type I interferon response and M-associated cytokines were indispensable. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of 613 genes in patients with scrubus, including interfer-related and M1 features.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that monocytes are polarized in vitro and ex vivo following Orientia tsam exposure. Interferon activation of monocytes and subsequent M1 polarization are critical in scrubus pathogenesis. This may provide new tools for scrubus diagnosis.

**Conclusion:** Orientia tsam induces M1 phenotype and type I IF response in monocytes. Type I and II IF and M signature found in PBs from patients with scrubus, suggesting association with inflammatory complications. Activated monocytes play major role in pathogen dissemination. Orientia upregulates genes in polarized responses, including IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, GM-CSF, and CCL20. Monocytes with live Orientia produced IF-β, while heat-killed unable. Only live Orientia induced sustained IF response. Approximately 15% of upregulated genes were cytokines or chemokines. Orientia upregulates type IF pathway and apoptosis genes. Our study highlights IF-mediated monocyte role in scrubus pathogenesis.

**Title:** Deciphering the Neural Mechanisms of Route Learning in Ants: A Spiking Model of Mushroom Body Circuitry for Visual Navigation

**Research Question:** How do ants, like other animals, implement visual memory to navigate through complex environments, and what is the role of the mushroom body in this process?

**Methods:** We adapted a spiking model of the mushroom body circuit, originally developed for fruit fly olfactory learning, to account for the ability of desert ants to rapidly learn visual routes through natural environments. We used realistic stimuli derived from field experiments, including visual cues, to explore the feasibility of this approach.

**Findings:** Our simulations demonstrate that the mushroom body can store hundreds of independent images, leveraging key principles of one-shot learning and sparse codes. We show that the neural architecture of the mushroom body can plausibly form the substrate for the familiarity algorithm proposed by Badde et al. (2011) for route following.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that the mushroom body, extensively studied in olfactory learning, can also support complex visual tasks like route navigation. The model, developed for simple olfactory learning in flies, required minimal modification to perform the more complex task of navigation under realistic conditions. Ants and other insects, like bees, have enlarged mushroom bodies compared to flies.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide evidence that the mushroom body can implement the familiarity algorithm for route following. The model learns 80-route images, reconstructed from ant viewpoints in natural habitats and distinguishes them from similar images off-route. The network, developed for simple olfactory learning, required no significant modification to perform the more complex task of navigation under realistic conditions.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Pathogen-Triggered Leaf Abscission in Arabidopsis thaliana: A Novel Insights into Plant Innate Immunity and Defense

**Research Question:** How do plants utilize innate immunity to protect themselves from disease, and what are the unique mechanisms involved in pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis thaliana?

**Methods:** We developed a system to study pathogen-triggered abission in Arabidopsis thalian leaves infected with Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterial pathogen lacking a functional type III secretion system. We analyzed the role of HAESA/HA-like, INFRESCIENCE DEFICIENT ABSCISION, and NEVERED in pathogen-trigger abission, and investigated the involvement of phytoalexin deficient 4, disease susceptibility 1, salicylic acid-deficient 2, and senescence gene 101 in bacterial defense and sallic acid signaling.

**Findings:** Our results show that pathogen-trigger abission is a novel form of immunity triggered by effectors, and that HA/HA-like, INFREIENCE DEFSC, and NEVER are required for pathogen abission to occur. Phytoxin deficient, disease 1, sallic acid-deficient 2, and senescence gene 101 mutations necessary for bacterial defense and sallic signaling, and NahG transgenic plants with low sallic acid fail to abise caul leaves normally. Bacteria contacting abission zones trigger a strong abission response, and long-distance signals are sent from dist infected tissue to abission, alerting abission of danger. We propose a threshold regulating caul defense model where minor infections are handled by limiting bacterial growth, but when infection is out of control, caul leaves are shed.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that sallic acid regulates both pathogen and drought-trigger abission, and that disparate pathways regulating defense and abission are connected. This study defines a new system for studying pathogen-trigger abission in Arabid and begins to explain the genetics governing pathogen abission. The abission pathway is required for all forms of inducible abission in Arabid. This work builds on previous research showing Arabid caul leaves can be shed in response to drought, and shows Arab uses abission as a defense mechanism against bacterial infection.

**Conclusions:** The abission response is robust and can be triggered by disease or ET. We found that previously pathways regulating defense and abission are connected, and that a number of defense components are necessary for pathogen abission. Salic acid is necessary for full pathogen abission and drought abission. Future research opportunities exist to cross-reference defense and abission fields. Salic production or signaling is required for pathogen abission to occur, and transgenic overexpressing Nah are blocked in abission.

**Title:** Dendritic Computation of Motion Direction Selectivity in Starburst Amacrine Cells: A Novel Insights into the Role of Voltage-Gated Channels and Dendritic Voltage Gradient**

**Research Question:** How do starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina compute direction selectivity (DS) in response to visual stimuli, and what are the underlying mechanisms involved in this process?

**Methods:** We used somatic whole-cell recordings and Fourier analysis to measure electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular visual stimuli in starburst amacrine cells (SACs). We also employed two-photon microscopy to monitor Ca2+ changes in dendrites evoked by voltage steps and compartment modeling to investigate the role of voltage-gated channels and dendritic voltage gradient in DS.

**Findings:** Our results show that fundamental and especially harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli, indicating nonlinearity in the relationship between harmonic amplitudes and potential. The presence of harmonics persisted in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory interactions are not essential. Two-photon microscopy revealed that distal dendrites are tonically depolarized relative to soma, due to tonic glutamgic synaptic input and high-voltage-activated Ca+ channels at rest. Compartment modeling suggests that dendritic DS in SACs can be computed by dendrites relying on voltageated channels and dendritic voltage gradient, providing spatial asymmetry for direction discrimination.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that DS in SACs can be generated by dend-intrinsic mechanisms, independent of lateral inhibitory interactions, relying on voltage-gated channels and dendritic voltage gradient. The presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists did not affect DS in SACs when stimuli were confined to the dendritic field, suggesting that lateral inhibitory interactions are not necessary for DS. The persistence of DS in SACs in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists indicates that SACs can generate DS signals without lateral inhibitory interactions. Our data suggest that voltage-gated channels, probably Ca+ channels, and dendritic voltage gradient are involved in DS in SACs.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of DS in SACs, highlighting the role of voltageated channels and dendritic voltage in generating direction selectivity. The peculiar dendritic morphology of SACs and low impedance at soma enable electrical isolation of sectors, necessary for local processing. Our findings have implications for understanding visual processing in the retina and the role of SACs in motion detection.

**Title:** Mechanistic Determinants of Infective Dose and Virulence in Human Pathogens: A Comparative Analysis of Locally and Distantly Acting Molecules

**Research Question:** Do pathogens that use locally acting molecules require a lower infective dose than those that use distantly acting molecules, and are distantly acting pathogens more virulent due to a larger inoculum size causing more harm to host cells?

**Methods:** We analyzed data from 43 human pathogens across diverse taxonomic groups, including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses to test these predictions.

**Findings:** Contrary to predictions, locally acting pathogens had lower infective doses but were not more virulent than distantly acting pathogens. Instead, virulence was negatively correlated with infect dose and higher in pathogens infecting skin compared to ingested or inhaled.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of mechanistic details in explaining variation in parasite traits such as infect dose and virulence. We found that distantly acting pathogens had higher infect doses but not virulence, contrary to anecdotal data. Virulence was negatively related to infect dose, and pathogens infecting skin resulted in higher case rates than ingested or inhaled.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of MicroRNAs in Schistosoma mansoni Development: A Novel Insights into Post-transcriptional Regulation and Sexual Maturation

**Research Question:** What is the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the developmental processes of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic helmin causing schistosomiasis affecting 200 million people worldwide?

**Methods:** We employed the "unawaremiRNA" bioinformatics tool to analyze 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of differentially expressed transcripts between juvenile and adult stages of S. mansoni. We identified the miR-277/498 family as significantly enriched in transition from juvenile to adult worms and described a novel miRNA, sm-mi-498, proximal to smi-277, suggesting a miRNA cluster. We proposed hairpin folds for both miRNAs compatible with miRNA pathway.

**Findings:** Expression of smi-277/498 miRNAs were upregulated in adults, while predicted targets characterized significant downregulation in adult worms, but remained undisturbed in immature females. smi-498 was expressed in tegument cells proximal to oesophagus and distributed throughout male body. Our results indicate smi-277/498 play dominant role in post-transcriptional regulation during juvenile development and suggest important role in sexual maturation of schistosomes.

**Implications:** This study provides solid evidence for the role of miRN in intra-malian development of S. mansoni and identifies a group of genes regulated by mi-277. The high quality of S. mans genome allowed us to query 3-UT regions for miRN target sites conserved across Schistoma species. Incorporating expression, we conclude smi-277 and sm-498 may be primordial miRN driving transcriptional regulation changes underlying development and maturation.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of miRN in S. mansoni development, particularly in post-transcriptional regulation and sexual maturation. Our results suggest mi-277/498 may play a crucial role in regulating gene expression changes during juvenile development and maturation. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the function of these miRN in S. mansoni and their potential as therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis treatment.

**Title:** Longitudinal Surveillance of SARS-Related Coronaviruses in Horseshoe Bats in Yunn Province, China Reveals High Genetic Diversity and Recombination Events

**Research Question:** What is the genetic diversity and evolutionary history of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARS-Co) in horsesh bats in Yunn Province, China, and do these viruses represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV?

**Methods:** We conducted a 5-year longitudinal surveillance of SARS-Co in a cave inhabited by multiple horsesh bat species in Yunn Province, China. Full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered S-CoV strains were sequenced and compared with previous findings, revealing high diversity in gene OR3 and OR8 regions. Recombination analysis showed frequent events within gene and around OR8 between S-Co.

**Findings:** Strains with high genetic similarity to S-Co in hyperviable N-terminal (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S gene OR3 and OR8 were found in this cave. Additionally, we discovered S-Co highly similar to S-Co in OR3 and split OR8. S-Co from this cave were closely related to-Co in non-structural genes OR1 and 1 compared to those elsewhere. Recombination analysis showed evidence of frequent events within gene and around OR8 between S-Co.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that direct progenitor S-Co may have originated after recombination events between precursors S-Co. Cell studies demonstrated three identified S-Co with different protein sequences all use human ACE as receptor, highlighting close relationship in cave-Co. This work provides insights into origin and evolution S-Co and highlights necessity preparedness for emergence S-like diseases.

**Conclusion:** Our study reveals high genetic diversity and recombination events in S-Co in hors bats Yunn, suggesting that direct progenitor S-Co may have originated from sequential recombination between precursors. These findings have implications for understanding S-Co evolution and preparedness for future emergence S-like diseases.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Density-Dependent Fecundity on the Faecal Egg Reduction Test (FECRT) in Detecting Drug Efficacy and Resistance in Soil-Transmitted Helminth (STH) Infections

**Research Question:** Can the faecal egg reduction test (FECRT) accurately detect drug efficacy and resistance in soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, considering the phenomenon of density-dependent fecundity, where worms increase egg output in response to relaxation of density constraints post-treatment?

**Methods:** We examined the impact of density-dependent fecundity on FRT data using recent evidence from canine hookworm studies and an early American dataset describing the relationship between egg output and infection levels. We analyzed the degree to which egg output increased with the extent of worm reduction by treatment in dogs harboring two isolates with different drug resistance levels.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the relaxation of density-dependent fecund constraints amplifies egg counts from worms remaining post-treatment, potentially underestimating drug efficacy in FRT. The degree of underestimation depends on the ability of worms to increase output, which is constrained prior to treatment, and varies among individuals. This phenomenon may distort FRT data, making it challenging to identify drug changes in efficacy, i.e., resistance development.

**Implications:** Density-dependent fecund highlights the need for new resistance monitoring methods examining direct drug effects on isolated worms in vitro or phenotypic assays or genotypic changes. Omitting cases with heaviest infections from FRT may ensure consistent underestimation and improve relative efficacy measurements.

**Conclusions:** The FRT, currently considered the most useful technique for detecting resistance in STH, may be impacted by density-dependent fecund, making it difficult to identify drug efficacy changes amidst dynamic worm reproductive biology. Our findings emphasize the importance of developing alternative methods to detect resistance, such as in vitro or genotypic assays.

**Title:** Epithelial Heparan Sulfate Synthase 1 Regulates Branching Morphogenesis in the Mammalian Lung through Modulation of SHH Signaling

**Research Question:** How do epithelial Hepar sulfate (HS) molecules regulate branching morphogenesis in the mammalian lung, and what is the role of SH signaling in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of epithelial HS synthase 1 (Ext1) in lung development by deleting it in epithelial cells and analyzing lung morphology, gene expression, and signaling.

**Findings:** Epithelial deletion of Ext1 resulted in expanded tips, reduced branching, and mesenchymal defects, associated with increased FGF10 expression and FGF activity. SH signaling was reduced in mutant lungs, suggesting a non-autonomous mechanism. Reactivating SH in mutant lungs rescued tip dilation and attenuated F signaling. Importantly, biologically active SH proteins were reduced in Ext mutant epithelium and wild-type mesenchym cells.

**Implications:** Our study highlights epith HS as a key player in dictating SH signaling for lung morphogenesis. Reduced SH activity in mutant leads to expanded F10 expression, contributing to dilated tips. Production of biologically active SH was reduced after loss of HS in epithelium.

**Conclusions:** Epithelial HS is crucial for SH-producing epithelial cells to maintain SH activity, and is important in lung morphogenesis. Our data show epith deletion of HS causes branching defects, including enlarged tip size, decreased branching, and F10 expression. Further, SH signaling was reduced in mutant, highlighting requirement for HS in SH-F10 cascade. Prior studies have examined HS function in lung morph. Our study reveals critical role of HS in epithelial-mesymal interaction during branching by controlling SH-F10 signaling.

**Title:** Optimizing Paired-End Sequencing for Genome-Wide Detection of Rearrangements and Fusion Genes in Cancer Genomes

**Research Question:** How much sequencing is required to detect rearrangement breakpoints and localize them precisely using paired-end sequencing, and how does the distribution of gene lengths and sequencing parameters impact fusion detection in the presence of errors?

**Background:** Paired-end sequencing is emerging as a key technique for assessing genome-wide rearrangements and structural variation, particularly for detecting copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions and translocations common in cancer, which produce novel fusion genes.

**Methods:** We theoretically and empirically derived a formula for the probability of a fusion existing in a genome given a collection of paired sequences, and computed fusion probabilities in breast cancer samples with a small number of large fragments. We evaluated the impact of gene distribution lengths and sequencing parameters on breakpoint detection, localization, and fusion detection in the presence of errors.

**Findings:** We found that fusion detection depends on the distribution of gene lengths and sequencing parameters, and derived formulae elucidate the trade-offs in experimental design for current and next-generation technologies. Larger clones are more reliable for studies across multiple samples with limited paired reads. Errors in paired sequencing lead to incorrect fusion predictions or false positives.

**Implications:** Paired-end sequencing will enable systematic analysis of all genomic events leading to cancer, shedding light on genetic and genomic basis of cancer. Maximizing fusion detection probability with least sequencing is crucial, considering factors including number and length of sequenced clones, fused genes, and localization errors.

**Conclusions:** Our results will inform future sequencing efforts, particularly large-scale cancer studies enabled by next-generation technologies. Paired-end sequencing will provide reliable and precise detection of fusion genes, permitting systematic analysis of all genomic events leading to cancer.

**Title:** A Mathematical Modeling of Chemotaxis: Unveiling the Interplay of Motility, Gradient Sensing, and Polarization through Reaction-Diffusion Equations and Mechanical Simulations

**Research Question:** How do the separable processes of motility, gradient sensing, and polarization contribute to the chemotactic behavior of cells, and can they be modeled using reaction-diff equations and mechanical simulations?

**Methods:** We developed a mathematical model that incorporates three modules: an excitable network for motility, a local excitation-inhibition module for gradient sensing, and a polarization module linked to the cytoskeleton. We implemented these modules using reaction-diff equations and simulated cellular morphology changes using a mechanical model of the cortex in the level framework.

**Findings:** Our simulations demonstrated that the excitable network mediates random migration responses to uniform stimuli, while the local excitation-inhibition module biases directionality. The polarization module enables cells to persistently move towards stimuli and acquire distinct sensitivity between front and back. By varying feedback loop strengths, we obtained behaviors mirroring genetically altered cell lines.

**Implications:** Our model suggests that chemaxis is not solely dependent on adaptation, as cells without adaptation perform less efficient chemaxis. However, adaptation is not required for chemaxis, as shown in simulations without adaptation. The model captures experimentally observed features of spontaneous and chemoattract-induced events, illustrating the complexity of chemactic machinery.

**Conclusion:** Chemaxis is a fundamental property of single and multicellular organisms, involving the coordinated action of motility, sensing, and polarization. Our model provides a framework for understanding the interplay of these processes, highlighting the role of excitable networks, local excitation-inhibition, and cytoskeleton in chemaxis. The results demonstrate the complexity and sophistication of chemactic machinery, with redundancy at the biochemical level. This study contributes to the understanding of chemaxis, a crucial for various biological processes, including development, wound healing, and immune response.

**Title:** Essential Role of Tudor Domain 6 (TD6) in Spliceosome Maturation and mRNA Splicing during Meiotic Prophase Spermatogenesis

**Research Question:** What is the function of Tudor Domain 6 (TD) in the maturation of spliceosomes and mRNA splicing during meiotic prophase spermatogenesis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of TD6 in meiotic prophase spermatocytes using mass spectrometric analysis, immunostaining, and transcriptome analysis.

**Findings:** We found that TD6 interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase PR5 (PRMT5) and spliceosomal protein Sm in an arginine-dependent manner. TD6 deficiency impairs assembly of spliceosomes, leading to 3.5-fold increased levels of U snRNAs in the nucleus. Transcriptome analysis revealed high numbers of splicing defects, including aberrant intron and exon usage and aberrant splice junctions.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates a novel function of TD in spliceosome maturation and mRNAlicing in prophase spermatocytes, adding to its roles in later stages of spermatogenesis.

**Conclusions:** TD plays a central role in the regulation of spliceosome maturation and mRNAlicing during meiotic prophase spermatogenesis, ensuring proper splicing events, including those specific to spermatogenesis, are carried out.

**Title:** Bayesian Modeling of Bacterial Colonization Dynamics: A Probabilistic Estimation of Strain Acquisition and Clearance

**Research Question:** How can we accurately determine whether bacterial isolates from different time points represent the same or distinct colonization events, enabling the estimation of acquisition and clearance rates of colonizing populations?

**Methods:** We developed a fully Bayesian model using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) to estimate probabilities of two strains being the same, accounting for within-host population variation, time intervals between measurements, and uncertainty in acquisition and clearance rates.

**Findings:** Our method outperforms previous heuristic approaches relying on fixed genetic distance thresholds, providing robust and accurate estimates of strain relationships between isolates. We validated with simulations and applied to a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a longitudinal study.

**Implications:** Understanding colonization dynamics is crucial for host health, as colonizing bacteria can serve as reservoirs for transmission and invasive strains emergence. Accurate estimation of acquisition and clearance rates is essential for interventions and transmission modeling. Our model addresses limitations of previous methods, providing probabilistic estimates of relevant quantities.

**Conclusions:** We present a novel Bayesian model for analyzing clearance and acquisition of bacterial colonization, which does not rely on heuristic distance thresholds. Our approach enables accurate estimation of strain relationships, acquisition, and clearance from sampled genomes over time. The study of colonization is based on inferring whether samples represent same or distinct events, permitting calculation of rates and clearance. Whole-genome sequencing provides genetic distance between isolates, used to infer relationships. However, this approach often inadequate for diversity within-host population, time intervals, and uncertainty. Our method models within-host variation using genetic simulation, and inference using ABC and MCM.

**Title:** Unifying the Mechanism of Auxin Transport in Plant Development: A Computational Modeling of Flux-Based Hypothesis

**Research Question:** How do auxin transporters create local maxima and minima in the plant, leading to organ initiation and patterning?

**Methods:** We used a computational simulation tool to test the flux-based hypothesis, where auxin transporters amplify and stabilize existing fluxes, which can be initiated by diffusion, to explain auxin transport at the shoot apical meristem.

**Findings:** Our results show that the flux-based hypothesis can explain auxin transport at the shoot meristem, providing a unifying concept for control of auxin distribution in the plant.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the flux-based hypothesis is a potential unifying mechanism for auxin transport throughout the plant, supporting the idea that both canalization and shoot apical hypotheses correspond to different states of the same sensing mechanism.

**Conclusions:** The flux-based hypothesis provides a coherent explanation for auxin transport at the shoot meristem, unifying the control of auxin distribution in the plant. Further experiments are required to distinguish between flux-based and other hypotheses.

**Title:** Discovery of Diagnostic Biomarkers for Visceral Leishmaniasis: A Systematic Approach Combining Genomics, Bioinformatics, and Wet Lab Experiments

**Research Question:** Can we develop improved point-of-care diagnostic tests for visceral leishmanias (VL) using a systematic approach combining genomics, bioinformatics, and wet lab experiments to identify novel biomarkers?

**Methods:** We employed comparative genomics and in silico tools to reduce the number of L. donani protein candidates recognized by IgG, which has been shown to be a potential indicator of post-therapeutic relapse in VL, using RDTs sensitized with L. donani crude antigen (CLA). L. don antigens recognized by IgG were profiled using western blots. Briefly, cytosolic proteins from L. donani (MH/IN/80/8) whole lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose (NC) and immunoassayed with sera from patients.

**Findings:** Immunoblot revealed L. donani bands detected by IgG from VL patients. Confident of these antigens by mass spectrometry (MS), we searched for evidence of constitutive expression and presence of antigenic domains accessible to B-cells. Selected candidates had linear epitopes mapped in silico. High-scoring predicted epitopes from shortlisted were screened in peptide arrays. The most promising was tested in RDT prototypes VL and nonendemic healthy (NE) patient sera. Over 90% of proteins from immunoblot did not satisfy criteria were excluded downstream epit mapping. Screening predicted epitopes from shortlisted identified most reactive for IgG 84% (95 CI 60-97) with Sudan VL sera RDT prototypes. None from NEs were positive.

**Implications:** Our systematic approach combining genomics, bioinformatics, and wet experiments identified a novel biomarker for VL diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity. This proof-of-concept strategy can be applied to develop more robust IgRDTs for monitoring clinical status in VL.

**Conclusions:** The availability of high-quality genome sequences and bioinformatic tools enabled us to reduce the number of L. donani protein candidates recognized by IgG. We identified a peptide specifically recognized by Ig in arrays, which was also tested in prototype RDT with patient and NE sera, showing promising results. This systematic approach can be applied to develop more robust IgRDT for VL diagnosis.

**Title:** Incidence of Caseating Granulomas in Cutaneous Leishmaniasis: A Multicenterial Cohort Study

**Research Question:** What is the incidence of caseating granulomas in cutaneous leishmanias (CL) and how do they differ from other granuloma types in terms of geographical distribution, histology, and healing time to resolution?

**Methods:** A multicenter cohort study of 317 patients with CL from Syria (157), Pakistan (66), Lebanon (47), Saudi Arabia (43), Ethiopia (2), and Iran (2) was conducted. Clinical data on age, sex, disease duration, lesion type, and geographic and anatomic location, and microscopic data on presence and type of granuloma, Ridley's parasitic index (PI) and pattern (RP) were documented. Microorganisms were evaluated using special stains (GMS, PAS, AFB, and Gram) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for TB and CL. All cases were confirmed by PCR followed by restriction length polymorphism analysis for molecular speciation and negative for other organisms.

**Findings:** Granulomas were identified in 195 (61.5%) of CL cases, divided into caseating (25.2%), suppurative (4.6%), and tuberculoid necrosis (70.2%). Caseating and tuboid granuloma groups differed significantly in terms of geographical distribution, with more cases in Saudi Arabia (p<0.0001). Histologically, both groups differed in distribution of RP (p<0.000) with RP3 in caseating granulomas (31% vs 15%) and RP5 in tuboid granuloma (38 vs 19%). Time to healing (RP) was shorter in tuboid vs case (4.0 vs 6.2 months). Parasitic index, species, and other variables did not differ between granuloma groups.

**Implications:** This study documents an 18.2% incidence of caseating granulomas in CL, suggesting CL should be part of differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions. Cases with caseating granulomas showed slower healing, no association with species, possibly due to worse immune response or more aggressive leish strains.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of considering CL in differential diagnosis for caseating granulomas in endemic regions, especially in regions included in this cohort, also endemic for TB.

**Title:** Identification of Zinc Finger Transcription Factor Zfp69 as a Candidate Gene for the Diabetogenic Effect of QTL Nidd/SJ in Mouse Models of Obesity-Associated Diabetes

**Research Question:** What is the genetic basis of the diabetogenic effect of QTL Nidd/SJ in mouse models of obesity-associated diabetes?

**Methods:** We employed interval-specific congenic introgression of SJ into diabetes-resistant C57/BL/6 and subsequent cross with NZO to identify a critical interval on distal chromosome 4 (2.1 Mb) conferring the diabetic phenotype. We analyzed 10 genes in the interval by sequencing, qRT-PCR, and RACE-PCR, revealing a striking allelic variance of Zfp encoding zinc finger transcription factor 69.

**Findings:** In NZ and C57/6, a retrotranson IAP1 in intron 3 disrupted the gene formation of a truncated mRNA lacking the coding for KR (Krüpp-associated) and Znf2 domains Zfp, whereas diogenic SJ, NON, and B alleles generated a normal mRNA. The diogenic ZfpSJ allele produced hyperglycemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma triglyceride levels. The human orthologue Zfp, Z642, was significantly increased in adipose tissue from patients with type 2 diabetes.

**Implications:** Zfp is the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of N/SJ, and retrotranson I1 contributes to genetic heterogeneity of strains. Expression of transcription in adipose tissue may play a role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

**Conclusions:** Positional cloning of diabetes genes may provide insights into pathogenesis of obesity-associated diabetes. We previously identified QTL Nidd on dist chromosome 4 that aggravated and accelerated diabetes in outcross of NZ with SJ. This Q exhibited high scores for trait glucose and reproducibly doubled prevalence in NZxSJ backcross. The data identify Zfp as likely candidate for diogenic effect of QTL Nidd, which aggravates and accelerates obesity-associated diabetes in NZ and enhances hyperglyemia in B6/ob mice.

**Title:** Predicting Mammalian Cell Differentiation: An Integrated Model of Regulatory and Signalling Pathways in the Vertebrate Hematopoietic System

**Research Question:** Despite the understanding of specific signals and transcription factors, predicting mammalian cell differentiation remains a daunting challenge. The vertebrate hematopoietic system, with its complex branching pathways and cell types, presents a compelling case study.

**Methods:** We propose an integrated model of regulatory and signalling pathways controlling cell differentiation. Due to the size and complexity of the network, we employ an original reduction approach with a stable identification algorithm. To assess effects of heterogeneous environments on cell differentiation, we perform systematic simulations considering prototypic environments.

**Findings:** We identify stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th, and Treg subtypes, coexisting with transient hybrid types co-expressing combinations of Th, Th, Treg, and Th17 markers in environment-dependent fashion. Our analysis highlights the nature of these types and relationships with canonical subtypes.

**Implications:** Our model can explore novel pathways in silico, assuming cross-inhibiting master factors generate canonical subtypes, precluding cell plasticity.

**Conclusions:**

Our integrated model provides a comprehensive understanding of regulatory and signalling pathways controlling Th differentiation. Using a qualitative formalism, we perform dynamical analyses on available qualitative data. The model reduction approach allows us to cope with the size and complexity of the network, while the stable identification algorithm assesses the effects of heterogeneous environments on cell differentiation. We identify stable states corresponding to canonical Th, Th, Th, and Treg subtypes, coexisting with transient hybrid types coexpressing combinations of Th, Th, T, and Th markers in environment-dependent fashion. Our analysis highlights the nature of these types and their relationships with canonical subtypes. The model can be used to explore novel pathways in silico, assuming crosshibiting master factors generate canonical subtypes, precluding cell plasticity.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Transcription Factor Binding: A Thermodynamic Modeling of Early Embryonic Anterior Patterning in Drosila

**Research Question:** How do transcription factors drive complex patterns of gene expression during animal development by binding to thousands of genomic regions, with quantitative differences in binding across regions mediating their activity?

**Methods:** We employed a thermodynamic model of transcription factor binding to evaluate the contribution of biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of early embryonic-posterior patterning in Drosila melanogaster. Predictions based on DNA and protein affinities alone achieved a correlation of ∼0.4 with experimental measurements in vivo. Incorporating cooperativity and competition among factors, and accounting for patterning by binding in every nucleus, had little effect on accuracy. A major source of error was prediction of events not occurring in vivo, hypothesized to reflect reduced chromatin accessibility.

**Findings:** Incorporating experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility into our model effectively predicted binding to regions of open chromatin, dramatically improving predictions to correlation 0.6-0.9 for various factors across target genes. Our results show that in open chromatin, binding can be predicted exclusively by sequence of individual factors, with minimal role interactions.

**Implications:** A combination of experimentally determined chromatin data and simple models of transcription binding may predict the landscape of any transcription factor with precision.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a practical method for predicting transcription factor binding and a platform to understand forces shaping quantitative variation in binding individual to regions of chromatin. We applied the model to predict genome-wide binding across 4,251 genes with expression data, finding a strong relation between model's ability to predict binding and gene expression level.

**Title:** Regulation of Cell Proliferation by Daughterless and Extramacchaetea in Drosophila Epithelial Cells

**Research Question:** How do the basic helix-loop helix (bHL) transcription factors, specifically Daughterless (Da) and Extramacchaetea (Em), regulate cell proliferation in Drosila epithelial cells, and what is the underlying mechanism of this regulatory activity?

**Methods:** We employed genetic analysis to investigate the role of Da and Em in controlling the G2/M transition and cell proliferation inros epithelial cells of the imaginal discs.

**Findings:** Our results show that Em is required to downregulate Da, which in turn triggers mitosis via transcriptional activation of the universally conserved cell cycle component Cdc25. Ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced levels of Em or high levels of Da is sufficient to rescue proliferative defects in mutant cells. Moreover, we present evidence that Da acts as a transcriptional repressor of string.

**Implications:** This study defines a mechanism through which Em controls cell proliferation by regulating the activity of Da, which transcriptionally represses string. Our findings provide new insights into the role of proteins in cell cycle regulation, specifically inrosila, and highlight the importance of understanding these factors in physiological and pathological conditions, such as cancer.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel mechanism by which Da and Em regulate cell cycle progression inrosila epithelial cells. Our model suggests that Em is required to downregulate Da, which in turn triggers mitosis via transcriptional activation of Cdc25, a universally conserved cell cycle component. These findings have implications for understanding the balance between proliferation and differentiation in the nervous system and other cell types.

**Title:** Elucidating Signaling Networks through Reversible Phosphorylation: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Phosphoproteome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

**Research Question:** How do reversible phosphorylation events contribute to signaling networks regulating cell growth and development in Saccharomy cerevisiae, and what are the key proteins involved in these pathways?

**Methods:** We employed Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell (SILAC) technique to generate phosphoprote data from interventional kinase-dead mutants in Saccharomy cerevisiae. Our pipeline consisted of phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation analysis, and causal discovery to identify key proteins, protein interactions, and signaling networks.

**Findings:** We identified 5 high-confidence proteins from meta-analysis and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis, including P2 and Hsp42, involved in stress responses, with 9 having direct or indirect involvement in filamentous growth. Four predicted proteins, N1, P2, P12, and R2, showed differential growth in phenotypic experiments, validating our approach.

**Implications:** This pipeline presents a systematic method for discovering signaling networks using phosphrote data, suggesting candidate proteins for further investigation. We anticipate its applicability to other interventional studies via different platforms.

**Conclusions:** Reversible phosphorylation plays a crucial role in signaling networks regulating growth and development in Sacomyces cerevisiae. Our comprehensive analysis revealed key proteins involved in stress responses and filamentous growth, providing new insights into signaling pathways. The phosphrote pipeline offers a valuable tool for elucidating mechanisms underlying biological processes.

**Title:** Revisiting the Regulation of the Drosophila X Chromosome in the Male Germline: New Insights into Dosage Compensation and Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation

**Research Question:** How is the Drosila X chromosome regulated in the male germline, and what are the mechanisms underlying the reduced expression of X-linked genes in Dophila testes?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of microarray analysis, RNA-seq, and transgene reporter assays to investigate the regulation of the Dila X chromosome in the male germl. First, we estimated X-wide dosage compensation in somatic tissues using microarrays to assess gene expression in thorax dissected adult males and females. Next, we analyzed microarray data from meiosis-stage spermatocytes to determine if X chromosome inactivation occurs during meiosis. We also used transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis promoters to examine chromosomal differences in expression.

**Findings:** Contrary to previous reports, we found that X-wide dosage compensation is absent in most Dila male germl. Microarray analysis revealed no evidence for X-specific inactivation during meiosis. However, we confirmed that expression of transgenes driven by autosomal spermat-specific promoters is reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus autosomes, but this difference is established premeiotic and persists in meiotic cells. The magnitude of X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by dosage, suggesting a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from X during spermatogenesis inila.

**Implications:** These findings resolve conflicting reports on patterns of X regulation in theila germl and have implications for genome evolution and speciation inila. The absence of dosage compensation and lack of meiotic inactivation suggest that X-linked genes inila testes are subject to a unique regulatory mechanism. Our results highlight the complexity of X regulation in theila germl and underscore the need for further investigation.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into the regulation of theila X chromosome in the male germl, challenging previous understanding of dosage compensation and meiotic inactivation. Our findings suggest that X-linked genes inila test are subject to a novel regulatory mechanism, distinct from dosage compensation and meiotic inactivation. Further research is needed to elucidate this mechanism and its implications for genome evolution and speciation inila.

**Title:** Early Dynamics of Citrobacterium Colonization and Epithelial Attachment/Effacement Lesion Formation in a Mouse Model of Enteropathogenic E. coli Infection

**Research Question:** We investigated the early events of Citrobacterium colonization and epithelial attachment and effacement (A/E) lesion formation in a mouse model of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infection, focusing on the role of clonal growth, local spread, and immune response in determining disease severity.

**Methods:** Wild-type mice were infected with Citrobacterium, and colonic epithelial A/E lesions were analyzed at various time points post-infection.

**Findings:** We found that colonic epithelial A/E lesions are clonal populations, dependent on clonal growth, and established within the first 18 hours of infection. Mechanistically, resistance to A/E lesion formation is mediated by TLR4/MyD88/Tr-dependent signaling, induced by virulent Citacterium in a virulence-dependent manner.

**Implications:** Our data demonstrate that establishment of Citacter pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to a short window, determining disease geography and severity.

**Conclusions:** The development of colonic Citacter A pathogenesis is critically dependent on early host-bacteria interactions, with A lesions originating from single-bacterial epithelial events within the first 18 hours of infection. Initiation of colonic Cit microcolonies is limited to an early stage, triggering local immune response protecting epith from de novo A lesion by luminal bacteria, determining disease outcome. Epithelial-adherent Cit population is derived from a small founder bacterium, subject to bottleneck.

**Title:** Estimating Population Overlap from Incomplete Samples: A Bayesian Approach to Quantifying Uncertainty in β-Diversity

**Research Question:** How can we rigorously estimate the overlap between two populations from incomplete samples when the total number of objects, species, or genes, in each population is known, a special case of the general β-diversity problem relevant in ecology and genomic epidemiology of malaria?

**Methods:** We derive and validate a Bayesian method to estimate population overlap from incomplete samples, taking into account subsampling rates and producing unbiased Bayes-optimal estimates. This method provides a framework for computing uncertainty estimates and can be used in planning by quantifying the trade-off between sampling effort and uncertainty.

**Findings:** Our Bayesian approach to β-divers under assumptions contrasts the majority of indices, coefficients, and metrics, which remain non-probabilistic. The method places estimation of overlap between fixed repertoires or populations from incomplete samples on statistical ground. While indices for presence-absence data exist, they treat counts as complete, leading to bias. Notable exceptions require species data compute.

**Implications:** Our method estimates repertoire overlap using Bayesian inference. Larger-genome datasets can be incorporated as prior the distribution of repertoire sizes, improving estimates. This opens analysis Plasmod spp. multig antigen families such as rif and stevor, or general β-divers in multig families in population sizes fixed or size have sampled.

**Conclusions:** We introduce a method estimates repertoire overlap using Bayesian inference. The method takes account subsampling and produces unbiased Bayes-opt estimates of overlap. Provides a framework computing uncertainty estimates and can used planning quantifying trade sampling effort uncertainty. This manuscript places estimation overlap fixed reperto or populations from incomplete firm statistical. Our approach β-div under assumptions contrasts indices, coefficients, metrics, remain-prob.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Catalytic Regulation in Eukary Protein Kinases: A Conserved Electrostatic and Hydrophobic Interactions Govern Active State Dynamics

**Research Question:** How do intramolecular interactions regulate the active state of eukary kinases, and what is the role of the conserved β-lysine in phosphoryl transfer?

**Methods:** Using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a model, we employed a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques to investigate the conserved electrostatic and hydroph interactions governing the active state.

**Findings:** We identified a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydroph interactions that harmoniously regulate the active state, including a salt bridge between lysine from the β-strand and glutamate from α-helix, as well as electrostatic interaction between phosphorylated loop and α-helix and ensemble of hydroph residues of Regulatory Shell. Contrary to previous assumptions, our results show that the cons β-lys is not required for phosphoryl transfer but essential for active state mechanics.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of catalytic regulation in eary kinases, highlighting the importance of conserved electrostatic and hydro interactions in governing the active state. The βlys, previously thought to be essential for phosphoryl transfer, is revealed to be a structural sensor that facilitates active mechanics by coordinating the transition of β region with α-helix.

**Conclusions:**

1. The conserved electrostatic and hydro interactions play a crucial role in regulating the active state of eary kinases.
2. The βlys is not required for phosphoryl transfer but is essential for active mechanics, acting as a structural sensor that coordinates the transition of β region with α-helix.
3. Breaking the β-α salt bridge destabilizes the active conformation and impairs catalytic activity.
4. Restoring the β-α interaction can partially rescue catalytic activity by repositioning the lysine onto loop.
5. The βlys is not required for phosphoryl transfer, but its presence is necessary for the active state to attain a productive conformation.

These findings have significant implications for understanding the regulation of euk kinases and their role in various biological processes. The conserved electro and hydro interactions provide a new perspective on the mechanisms of catalytic regulation, highlighting the importance of βlys as a structural sensor that facilitates active mechanics. This research contributes to the understanding of euk kinases and their role in cellular functions, with potential applications in developing targeted therapies for diseases related to e kinase dysregulation.

**Title:** Evaluating the Effectiveness of School-Based and Community Surveys for Post-Massessing Lymphatic Filariasis Transmission after Mass Drug Administration in American Samoa

**Research Question:** This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-massessing lymphatic filariasis (LF) transmission after mass drug administration (MDA) in American Samoa: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 years and a community survey of individuals ≥8 years.

**Methods:** In 2016, we conducted a systematic school-based survey in 29 elementary schools and a cluster survey in 28 villages on two main islands of American. We collected data on demographics and risk factors for infection using questionnaires and geo-locations of schools and households. Blood samples were tested for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using Alere Filariasis Strip. Those positive were prepared for microscopic examination microfilar and treatment.

**Findings:** The school survey (n=114) identified 9 antigen-positive children with an adjusted FA prevalence of 0.7% (95 CI: 0.3-1.8). The community survey (n= 7,711) identified 102 antigen-positive individuals with an adjusted FA of 6.2% (95 CI 4.5-8.6). Adjusted village prevalence ranged 0-47.1. FA increased with age and was higher in males. Of 86 antigen community members, 25.6% were microilar.

**Implications:** The school survey had limited sensitivity (0-23.8%) and negative predictive value (25-83.3%) but high specificity (83.3-100%) and positive value (0-100%) for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community survey identified antigen individuals of all ages and foci of high prevalence. Both confirmed recrudence of LF transmission.

**Conclusions:** Our findings raise concerns about the suitability of school-based TAS for post-M surveillance not only in American but globally. The community survey, although operationally challenging, identified antigen individuals of all ages and foci of high prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudence of LF transmission.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Oocyte Signaling Molecules in Sex Determination and Maintenance in Zebrafish

**Research Question:** How do oocyte-derived signaling molecules regulate sex determination and maintenance in zebraf?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of two oocyte-expressed molecules, Gdf9 and Bmp, in sex determination and maintenance in zraf by generating mutations in these genes and analyzing the phenotypes of mutant females.

**Findings:** Females deficient in Bmp exhibit normal development but undergo sex reversal during the mid-to-late juvenile stage, becoming fertile males. Mutations in aromatase cypa1 show that estrogen production is necessary for female development, and the function of Bmp in sex maintenance is linked to regulation of estrogen biosynthesis via development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte.

**Implications:** Our results provide first mechanistic insights into oocyte regulation of sex maintenance in zraf. We propose that oocyte-gonad interaction stabilizes cypa1 expression, leading to estrogen production by the somad. Consistent with this, the somad expresses probable receptors for Bmp. This model suggests cypa functions as a toggle to determine female vs male in zraf.

**Conclusions:** Our study identifies two genes, cypa and Bmp, required for normal sexual development and maintenance of the female state. These genes establish a genetic pathway for female development and maintenance in zraf likely conserved in other species. Both Gdf and B are expressed in zraf oocytes as early as 22dp, making them candidates for o-derived sex and sex differentiation signal in zraf. Our findings provide a framework for understanding sex determination and maintenance in zraf, with implications for conservation in other fish species.

**Title:** Deciphering the Complexity of Hox Gene Regulation: Unveiling the Role of Combinatorial Interactions with Transcription Factors in Spatio-Temporal Gene Expression

**Research Question:** How do Hox proteins achieve high-regulatory specificity in controlling morphogen diversity along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals?

**Methods:** We investigated the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (pr) by the Hox protein Deformed (D) in Drosophila and identified a combinatorial interaction with eight functionally diverse transcription regulators on a minimal enhancer.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that eight transcription regulators (Apt, G, cm, ms, En, Sl1, Br, Doc, and Disco) are required in addition to Hox D to properly regulate pr expression in a subset cells of the maxillary segment. This suggests that context-dependent combinations of Hox proteins and transcription factors on small modular H response elements (HREs) are responsible for spatio-temporal expression of H targets.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that a large number of transcription factors are directly involved in H target regulation in vivo, challenging the notion that H proteins act alone achieve high-reg specificity.

**Conclusions:** Proper spatio-temporal H gene regulation is achieved by the combined action of multiple regulators: H proteins and structurally diverse transcription factors. Our study highlights the complexity of H gene regulation and underscores the importance of combinatorial interactions between H proteins and transcription factors in achieving precise spatio-temporal gene expression. These findings have significant implications for understanding morphogenesis, as H proteins regulate a large number of downstream genes, including those with broad effects on morphology and terminal differentiation.

**Title:** Unveiling the Genetic Requirements for Autoactivation of the NB-LRR Protein ADR-L2 in Plant Defense Responses to Pathogen Attack

**Research Question:** How does the NB-LRR protein ADR-L2 function in plant defense against pathogen attack, and what are the genetic requirements for its autoactivation?

**Methods:** We generated an autoactive mutant ADR-L2D484, an Arabidopsis coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR protein A1, and analyzed its function in defense responses. We used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to define the requirements for ADR-L2 activity.

**Findings:** ADR-L2 functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in defense and can act as a "helper" to transduce specific microbial signals from sensor NB-LRs. Its helper activity does not require an intact P-loop. ADR-L and two closely related members of this NB-L family are required for unregulated cell death in l1 mutant. We demonstrate that, in this context, A-L function is P-dependent. Expression of A-LD484 leads to dwarf plants with increased resistance and constitutive high SA levels. Morphology also requires intact P, suggesting these phenotypes reflect activation of NB protein. We used A-L484 to define requirements for signaling. Signaling from A484 does not require NAD oxidase and is negatively regulated by E1 and At1. Transcription regulation of A484 is correlated with phenotypic outputs; these are SA-dependent and -independent.

**Implications:** The genetic requirements for A484 activity resemble those regulate SA-dependent signal amplification of defense and death signaling observed in absence LSD. Importantly, A autoactivation is controlled by E and SA separable but linked pathways. These data propose a model for SA-dependent regulation, which includes A-L, surprisingly.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals the genetic requirements for autoactivation of the NB-L protein A-L in plant defense against pathogen attack. A-L functions upstream SA in defense and can act as a helper to transduce specific signals from sensor-LRs. Its helper activity does not require an intact P. A-L and two related members are required for unregulated death in mutant. We demonstrate that, in this context, A function is P-dependent. Expression of A-L484 leads to dwarf plants with increased resistance and constitutive SA. Morphology also requires intact, suggesting these phenotypes reflect activation of protein. We used A484 to define requirements for signaling. Signaling from A does not require NADase and is regulated by E and At. Transcription of A is correlated with phenotypic outputs; these are SA-dependent and -independent.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of SUVH9, ID2, and SWI/SNF Chromatin-Remodeling Complex in Mediated Transcriptional Silencing through MOR6 in Arabidopsis

**Research Question:** How do SUV9, ID2, and the SW/SNF chromatin-remodel complex interact with MOR6 to mediate transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis, and what is the relationship between DNA methylation and heterochrom condensation in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to investigate the interactions between SUV9, ID2, and the SW/SNF chrom-remodel complex with MOR6 in Arabidopsis. We analyzed the effects of mutations in SUV, ID, and SW/S on transcriptional silencing at MOR6 target loci and examined the relationship between DNA methylation and heteroch condensation.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that SUV and SUV9 can act in the same pathway as MOR6 or synergistically with MOR6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. ID2 interacts with MOR6 and mediates silencing a subset of MOR6 target loci. We also found that other Rd components, including Pol IV, V, R2, and DRM2, are required for transcription silencing at subset MOR6 loci. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SW/S chrom-remodel components SW3, SW3, and SWD interact with MOR6 as well as SUV9 and mediate transcription silencing. These findings suggest that Rd components are involved not only in DNA methylation but also in MOR6-mediated heteroch condensation.

**Implications:** Our study reveals that DNA methylation is linked to heteroch condensation and enhances transcription silencing at methyl genomic regions. The interaction between SUV9 and MOR6 suggests that binding of SUV to methylated DNA may be required for recruitment of MOR to chromatin. MOR interacts with ID2 and the SW/S complex to mediate heteroch condensation. These components work together to mediate the link between methylation and heteroch cond, thus enhancing silencing at methyl genomic regions. We also demonstrate that MOR functions in silencing loci targeted by Rd components.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms of transcription silencing in Arabid and highlights the role of SUV, ID, and SW/S chrom-rem complex in MOR-mediated silencing. We show that Rd components are not only involved in methylation but also in MOR6-mediated heter condensation. Our findings have implications for understanding epigenetic regulation in plant development and disease.

**Title:** Compromised Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp) Function Reveals Cryptic Phenotypes in Flies and Plants: Implications for Developmental Anomalies in Vertebrates

**Research Question:** This study investigates the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp) in modulating phenotypic variation and developmental anomalies in vertebrates, using zebraf as a model organism.

**Methods:** We examined the effects of Hsp inhibition on phenotypes in wild-type and mutant zraf strains, including those with recessive eye phenotypes caused by paxb and su mutations, and previously unobserved structural malations reminiscent of anophthalmia, microphthalm, and nanthalmia.

**Findings:** Hsp inhibition did not induce a heat shock response or perturb phenotype in wild-type strains, but increased the severity of recessive eye phenotype in caused by paxb mutation, decreased that caused by su mutation, and uncovered a new spectrum of severe eye malations. Inbreeding offspring from unaffected parents led to elevated malformation frequencies, indicating oligogenic nature of this phenotype. Unlike Drosila, Hsp inhibition decreased developmental stability in zraf, indicated by increased presentation of anphthalm, microphthalm, and nanthalm phenotypes. Analysis of paxb mutation suggests a mechanism for buffering by Hsp.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that mild perturbation of Hsp function at critical developmental stages may underpin variable penetrance and expressivity of developmental anomalies, where genotype-environment interaction plays a major role. This study highlights the importance of understanding molecular events altering balance between cryptic and overt phenotypes.

**Conclusions:** Compromised Hsp function may alter severity or penetrance of certain traits without affecting overall development, as seen in previously in Drosila. In contrast, Hsp can buffer stochastic processes in plant development, but not in vertebrates, where recessive characters do not become dominant. Our results imply that Hsp plays a critical role in maintaining trait thresholds in vertebrates, unlike plants and flies.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of N-terminal Acetylation in Biological Processes: A Novel Insights from Drosophila melanogaster

**Research Question:** What are the principles of N-terminal acetylation and how can they be used to study the functional relevance of N-terminal acylation in cells and organisms?

**Methods:** We analyzed the amino-terminal peptides from Drosila melanogaster K167 cells using shotgun proteomics and COFRIC enrichment, detecting over 1,200 mature N-termini. We applied the X rule to genetically engineer proteins to study the biological relevance of N-terminal acylation.

**Findings:** N-terminal acylation is a common in insects, occurring with similar frequency to humans, and follows the same sequence and cleavage requirements as in eukaryotes. We refer to this as the X rule, which can be used to study N-terminal acylation in all species.

**Implications:** The X rule provides a straightforward strategy to systematically investigate the functional relevance of N-terminal acylation in cells and organisms. Since it is conserved in lower and higher eukotes, it can be applied to study N-terminal acylation in all species.

**Conclusions:** N-terminal acylation promotes various biological functions that cannot be predicted from primary sequence. A method to generate and express proteins differing in N-terminal acylation is needed to investigate consequences of presence or absence of N acetyl group. We present a compilation of mature Ntermin from D melanogaster, showing N-terminal acylation is common and sequence requirements for cleavage and acylation similar to earyotes. The X rule can be used to study N acylation in all species, providing a novel approach to investigate functional relevance of N-terminal acylation in cells and organisms.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of RNA Polymerase III Termination and Its Impact on tRNA Production during Cellular Proliferation and Cancer

**Research Question:** Understanding the mechanisms of RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) termination is crucial for efficient tRNA production, particularly during cellular proliferation and cancer. However, the link between termination and high transcription output remains unclear.

**Methods:** We employed a tRNA-mediated suppression system to screen for Rpc1 mutants with gain- and loss-of-termination phenotypes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe). 122 mutations were mapped to a solved 3.9 Å structure of yeast RN III elongation complex (EC); they cluster in the active bridge helix and loop, as well as the pore and funnel, indicating involvement of the cleavage domain of C subunit in termination.

**Findings:** Purified RN III from a readthrough (RT) mutant exhibited increased elongation rate, supporting a kinetic model where elongation is inversely related to termination. Mutants exhibited correlations in vitro and in vivo, and surprisingly, amounts of transcription in vivo. Assessing in vivo can be confounded by parameters, we used a tRNA with a processing defect and strong terminator, ruling out differences in RNA decay. Data indicate mutants synthesize more RNA than wild-type cells, which can be accounted for by increased elongation. Increased activity appears unrelated to RN III repressor M1.

**Implications:** Our results show mobile elements of RN III center, including C, are determinants of termination, and some activate III for transcription. Similar mutations in cancer suggest an unforeseen mechanism III activation in disease.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the mechanisms of RN III termination and its impact on tRNA production during cellular proliferation and cancer. The kinetic model suggests that elongation inversely correlates with termination, and mutants synthesize more RNA than wild-type cells. These findings have implications for understanding RN III regulation and its role in cancer.

**Title:** Predicting SH2-Mediated Protein-Protein Interactions using Structure-Based Approach: A Novel Insights into the Role of SH Domains in Signaling

**Research Question:** Can we develop a computational method to predict SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions using the structure of SH-phosphope complexes and the FoldX algorithm, and evaluate its performance against experimentally derived consensus and substitution matrices?

**Methods:** We employed the FoldX algorithm to predict in vitro and in vivo SH2-phosphope binding and protein interactions for a set of human SH domains with known secondary structure and phosphorylation state. We validated predictions using literature-derived SH interactions and probabilistic scores from naive Bayes integration of coexpression, conservation, interaction in other species, shared partners, and functions.

**Findings:** Our approach performed similarly to experimentally derived consensus and substitution matrices in predicting in vitro and in vivo targets of SH domains. We predicted a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH domains with structure and phosphorylation state. FoldX also predicted in vitro binding thermodynamics of protein-phosphope complexes for nine SH domains, demonstrating its applicability for genome-wide predictions.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that structure-based prediction of SH-mediated protein interactions should account for both biophysics and biology of SH domains. We annotated predicted in vivo interactions for nine SH domain-containing proteins with supporting information, providing a resource for experimental testing.

**Conclusions:** FoldX performs as well as experimentally consensus or position-specific matrices in predicting in vitro SH-phope binding and in vivo SH-mediated protein interactions. Combining phosphorylation and secondary structure, Fold gives accurate predictions of protein interactions. Our method provides an alternative to peptide library experiments for predicting SH-mediated protein interactions. Structure-based methods have been used to predict in vitro specificity of SH domains, but not in vivo interactions. We propose FoldX as a useful tool for predicting SH-mediated protein interactions on a genomic scale.

**Title:** Identification of Cyclophilin 40 as a Novel Disaggregase for Amyloidogenic Proteins: Implications for Tauopathies and Neurodegenerative Disorders**

**Research Question:** Can a cis-peptid-proly isomerase (Pase) cyclophil 40 (Cy40) dissolve amyloids in vitro and ameliorate tau accumulation in a mouse model of tauopathy, preserving neuronal health and cognition?

**Methods:** We investigated the ability of Cy40 to interact with and disaggregate amyloid proteins in vitro and in a mouse model of tauopathy. We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the interaction sites of Cy40 with tau and other aggregating proteins. We also examined the effect of Cy40 on tau oligomers and fibrils using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

**Findings:** We found that Cy40, a Pase, dissolves amyloids in vitro and reduces tau oligomers and fibrils in a mouse model of tauopathy, preserving neuronal health and cognition. NMR revealed that Cy40 interacts with tau at proline-rich sites. Cy40 also disaggregates other aggregating proteins containing prolines. Moreover, Cy40 lacking Pase activity prevents disaggregation in vitro. We discovered a unique property of Cy40 that permits disaggregation to occur in an energy-independent manner.

**Implications:** This study identifies a novel disagase, Cy40, for the first time demonstrating its capacity to dissolve intracellular amyloids. The procognitive effects of Cy40 overexpression in tauopathic brain suggest strategies to induce or deliver disagases to the central nervous system could halt or rescue cognitive deficits associated with neuroto amyloids. We hypothesize two mechanisms for amyloid disaggregation by Cy40 based on structural data.

**Conclusions:** Our results implicate Cy40 as a potential therapeutic for tauopathies and amyogenic disorders. FK51 and FK52, despite robust Pase activity, did not lower amyloid, possibly due to differential binding between tau and Pases. We characterized tau species following incubation with Cy40, which altered morphology and reduced size of fibrils observed by TEM. This study describes the first Pase disaggregating neurode amyloids, such as tau and α-syn. Disaggregation is dependent on Pase activity of Cy40 and ATP-independent. Distinct properties of Cy40 enable this process and may be unique to Cy40 among Pases.

**Title:** Heterocyst Differentiation in Cyanobacteria: A Systems Biology Approach to Understanding the Emergence of Multicellular Patterns**

**Research Question:** Despite extensive studies on the evolution and sustenance of heteroc patterns in cyanobacteria, the underlying genetic circuitry governing single cyanobacter behavior under nitrogen deprivation remains unclear. This study aims to bridge the gap between macroscopic and microscopic processes by exploring heteroc differentiation under the paradigm of systems biology.

**Methods:** We formulated the dynamical ingredients of the genetic circuit of a single cyanacter into a set of differential equations describing the evolution of molecular concentrations. This allowed us to study the behavior of a cyanacter under external conditions, emulating nitrogen deprivation, and simulate cyanob filaments by coupling their respective circuits via molecular diffusion.

**Findings:** Our results show that including diffusion and noisy conditions in the model reproduces the main features of formation and sustainment of heteroc patterns in cyanobacteria observed experimentally. The model captures the development of heteroc patterns and their maintenance by combining diffusion of nitrogen along the filament with dynamical properties of the genetic circuit of each cyanacter.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of diffusion and noise in the onset of differentiation, enabling the development of characteristic heteroc patterns for a wide range of parameters. Cyanobacteria exhibit an efficient response to noisy conditions characteristic of the natural environment. Our model provides a framework for understanding the emergence of multicellular patterns in cyanobacteria.

**Conclusions:** This work bridges the gap between experimental and theoretical understanding of heteroc in cyanobacteria by incorporating recent results on the genetic network into the machinery of systems biology. Our model captures the main features of heteroc formation and sustainment, demonstrating the role of diffusion and noise in the onset of differentiation. This study contributes to the understanding of cell behavior under external conditions and the development of multicellular patterns in cyanobacteria.

**Title:** Exploring the Association between People's Perceptions of Onchocercias and Adherence to Ivermect in Cameroon: A Cross-Sectional Survey in Three Districts with Persistent Onchiasis Prevalence

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the association between people's perceptions of the Community Directed Treatment with Iverm (DTI) program, beliefs about onchiasis, and adherence to iver in three districts in Cameroon with persistent onias prevalence.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three health districts with high onias prevalence. Participants were randomly selected from 30 clusters per district. Adherence to iver was compared between Bang, Bafia, and Yassi.

**Findings:** Adherence to iver was comparable between Bang and Bafia (55.0% and 48.8%, respectively, p>0.05) and lower in Yassi (40.7%). Among factors related to program and disease representations, perceptions of the program were most determinant of adherence toiver. People with a "positive" opinion ofiver distribution were less compliant than those with a positive about campaigns (40% vs 55 in Bang, 48 vs 62 in Bafia, p0.01) as well as those with negative appreciation of community distributors' commitment (22 vs 53 in Bang, 33 vs 59 inafia, 27 vs 47 Yassi p0.01). Common misconceptions about onias transmission were lack of hygiene in Bafia and Yassi. Bang believed onias due high sugar consumption (31 vs less 5 inafia and Yassi p.001).

**Implications:** There are frequent misconceptions aboutias transmission in Cameroon. Perceptions ofiver distribution are strongly associated with adherence. In addition to education and sensitization onias during CDT implementation, local authorities should strive to involve communities and encourage distributors' work.

**Conclusion:** Despite 15 years of CDT, onias prevalence remains high in Cameroon. Misconceptions aboutias transmission andiver efficacy persist. Strong association between belief and adherence highlights need for further study. Perceptions of CDT program (commitment,iver organization, and effectiveness) have stronger association with adherence. In addition to education and sensitization, local authorities should emphasize CDT implementation with community ownership and good work.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Epigenetic Alterations and Disease Biomarkers: A Genome-Wide Association and Epigenome-Wide Studies

**Research Question:** Do epigenetic alterations directly contribute to the pathogenesis of disease, or are they merely a reflection of underlying genetic and environmental factors?

**Methods:** We conducted an epigen-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and protein biomarkers for cancer and cardiovascular disease. We analyzed 121 biomarkers in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 genomic positions and over 10 million SNPs in 698-103 samples.

**Findings:** We identified 124 loci (Bonferr adjusted P < 0.05) with effect sizes up 0.22 units change per 1% DNA methylation and up 4 units per copy allele in EWAS and GWAS. Most GW loci were cis-regulatory, while EWAS loci were trans. Eleven EWAS loci associated with multiple biomarkers, including NLR5 with CXCL, CX9, IL-12, and IL-18. EW signals overlapped with GWAS were driven by genetic variants, while EW signals were confounded by smoking. Cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers affected DNA methylation, but not vice versa.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that epigenetic alterations are not directly causal in disease pathogenesis, but rather reflect underlying genetic, environmental, or secondary effects of disease.

**Conclusion:** Epigen-wide association studies have identified associations between epigen modifications and disease, but it is unclear if epigen variation is causal. We found that SNPs in GW explained some biomarker heritability, but not DNA methylation. Cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers affected DNA methylation, but not vice versa. Many EW hits likely reflect unmeasured factors, such as immune disorders or infections. Our results indicate DNA methylation has limited effect on biomarkers, reflecting genetic, environmental, or secondary effects of disease.

**Title:** Varicella Zoster Virus Impairs Natural Killer Cell Function through a Novel Mechanism of Immune Evasion**

**Research Question:** How does Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) affect the function of Natural Killer (NK) cells, a crucial component of the anti-viral immune response, during infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the impact of VV on NK cell function in vitro, examining cytotoxic and cytokine responses, surface receptor expression, and signaling pathways.

**Findings:** VV potently impairs NK cell ability to respond to target stimulation, leading to loss of cytotoxic and cytokine responses. Not only V-infected NK cells, but also V-negative NK cells exposed to VV in culture were inhibited. This impairment was dependent on direct contact between NK and V-infected cells. Profiling revealed stable receptor expression, yet inhibited cells still released cytotoxic granules when signaling was bypassed. Examination of degranulation cascade components showed perturbation following VV co-culture. Additionally, IF-γ and TNF production were repressed by VV co-culture, most strongly in V-infected NK.

**Implications:** VV employs a novel strategy to evade the immune response by paralyzing NK cells, rendering them unresponsive to target stimulation. Unlike HSV-1, VV differentially targets cytokine production. Our findings contribute to understanding of pathogen inhibition of NK function and reveal a previously unreported mechanism of VV immune evasion.

**Conclusions:** VV-infected cells maintain surface receptor expression and can degranulate when signaling is bypassed, suggesting V interferes with upstream signaling. Limited activation of NK response to V-infected cells suggests modulation of surface expression to reduce NK detection. The lack of inhibition with inoculum indicates active, functionally intact V is required to mediate effect. We identified a novel strategy employed by V to powerfully inhibit NK function. Co-culture with V-infected epithelial inoculum renders NK unresponsive, abrogating cytokine production and degranulation, correlating with reduced target lysis.

**Title:** Investigating the Neural Mechanisms of Apparent Motion: A Novel Insights into the Effects of Alternating Stimuli on Visual Perception

**Research Question:** How do alternating stimuli presented at different locations evoke the perception of a stimulus moving between two locations, and what are the neural mechanisms underlying this apparent motion (AM)?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of AM on the detection of gratings presented along the path, using a V-like population model of early visual processing based on a contrast normalization model.

**Findings:** Our results show that AM has a distinct effect on the detection of targets, limiting performance at high contrast levels. Masking is strongest when the target is identical to the orientation of the inducers. We found that AM-related activation in early cortex is too small to cause masking or be perceived motion. Our model predicts suppression of early responses during AM, consistent with predictive coding framework.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a hitherto unnoticed aspect of AM, an upper bound on detection performance. We identified orientation-tuned responses in early cortex as major cause of masking. This suppression may be explained by predictive models of processing, proposing higher-level motion predictions "explain" lower-level responses expected input.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that AM does not necessarily imply V activation. An alternative view of AM can be provided by predictive account of processing. AM stimuli provide predictable context. A presented on path can be predictable (1) match features of moving and (2) time place consistent perceived. Predictive models responses along path suppressed early areas V, only when predictable. Our study examined neural effects AM on low-level processing. We found AM impairs detection target on path when matches inducers orientation. Previous study reported masking performance single intensity [13]. Reduction maximum, key aspect AM, not linked uncertainty [36]. Exponent value inconsistent claim front-end captures V neurons. Population model V capture results, but cannot rule possibility AM effects other early cortex.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanism of HTLV-1 Tax-Induced IKK Activation: Unveiling the Role of Tax as an E3 Ubiquitin Ligase in NF-κB Activation

**Research Question:** The molecular mechanism by which the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax activates the IK-NF-κ pathway, leading to CD4+ T cell transformation and proliferation, remains poorly understood.

**Methods:** We employed an in vitro cell-free system to reconstitute Tax-stimulated IK activation to dissect the essential components and biochemical mechanism of IK activation by Tax.

**Findings:** Our studies revealed that Tax, a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, assembles mixed-link polyubitin chains with Ubc2, Ubc5, or U7, which directly activate IK by binding to the NEM subunit of IK.

**Implications:** Our findings clarify the biochemical function of Tax in IK activation, utilizing minimal ubiquitination components for NF-κ activation, resolving controversy on HTL-1-induced IK-NF-κ activation, and shedding light on hijacked cellular factors by HT-1, and potential therapeutics for ATL and TSPAM.

**Conclusions:** Tax, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, catalyzes polyubiquitin assembly for IK activation, elucidating the molecular mechanism of HT-1 IK-NF activation. Our in vitro system captured primary IK events induced by Tax, revealing biochemical function and mechanism of Tax in IK activation.

**Title:** Quantifying the Relationship between Propagule Pressure and Alien Species Establishment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

**Research Question:** Does the number of individuals introduced individuals (propagule pressure) influence the success of alien species establishment, and how does this relationship vary across different taxonomic groups and ecological contexts?

**Methods:** We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies examining the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment across a broad range of taxa, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants, long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. Using Bayesian meta-analytical methods, we estimated the overall effect of propagule pressure on establishment and tested for heterogeneity in this relationship.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed a positive effect of propagule pressure on establishment in all tested hypotheses, with success most critically dependent on propagule pressures between 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was primarily associated with analytical approaches, with larger effect sizes observed in animal introductions compared to plant introductions. No variation was accounted for by study scale (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy).

**Implications:** This study provides the first quantitative review of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien establishment, highlighting the importance of propag pressure in species success. Our findings suggest that propag pressure is a key determinant of establishment, particularly in the range of 10-100 individuals, and that analytical approaches may influence effect size. These results have implications for management and conservation of invasive species.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate remarkable consistency in the form of relationship between propag pressure and alien establishment across diverse taxa and ecological contexts. This study highlights the need for consideration of propag pressure in management and conservation efforts, particularly in the range of 10-100 individuals. Future research should investigate sources of heterogeneity in effect and its influence on relationships.

**Title:** Interleukin-17 (IL-17) Modulates mRNA Decay of Pro-inflammatory Mediators through a Novel Ribonucleoprotein Complex with MicroRNA-16 (miR16) and AU-Binding Proteins (AUBs)

**Research Question:** How does Interleukin-17 (IL-17) regulate the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by modulating the decay of mRNAs encoding these mediators?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between IL-17, microRNA-16 (mi16), and AU-binding proteins (AUBs) in the regulation of mRNA decay of pro-inflammatory mediators.

**Findings:** IL-17 enhances the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by attenuating the decay of mRNAs encoding these mediators through a novel ribonucleoprotein complex with mi16 and Aps. This complex leads to the degradation of target mRNAs. Notably, IL-17 attenuates mi16 expression and promotes the binding of stabilizing Aps over destabilizing Aps, reducing mRNA decay. Our data indicate that mi16 independently directs the competition between degrading and stabilizing Aps for mRNAs. Aps affect about 8% of the human transcriptome, and mi16 is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting IL-17 may affect other cellular processes beyond inflammation.

**Implications:** IL-17 modulates the interaction between Aps, mi16, and target mRN through specific sequences and structural restraints. IL-17 exerts its function by changing mi and Aps contribution. IL-17 also attenuates mRNA degradation in epithelial and fibroblast cells in combination with TN-α, leading to hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators.

**Conclusions:** Modulation of Ap-mi16 regulation of expression by IL-17 depends on specific target mRN, mi16 usage, and differential Aps participation. IL-8, IL-6, and G-CSF mRNAs are degraded by the Ap-mi16 pathway. IL-17 inhibits mi16 binding and promotes A-1 binding, stabilizing IL-8 mRNA. Various Aps compete for target mRN binding, balance regulated by IL- via mi16. IL-17 inhibition of mi16 and mi using LNA results in attenuated mRNA degradation. Enhancing mi16 expression promotes mRNA degradation.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma rhodesense Infections in Cattle and Human Populations in Kaberido and Dokolo Districts, Uganda

**Research Question:** This study aimed to examine the relationship between Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) and Trypanosoma rhodesense (T. rhodes) infections in cattle and human populations in Kaber and Dokolo districts, Uganda, with a focus on understanding the role of cattle as reservoirs of human infective T. rhodesense.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in villages with reported cases of sleeping sickness in the six months prior to sample collection and those with no reported cases. Blood samples were collected from cattle and analyzed for T. brucei and T. rhodes.

**Findings:** The study found a significant association between village sleeping sickness status and T. brucei infection in cattle (OR: 2.94, 95%CI: 1.38-6.24), with higher odds of infection in case villages than non-case villages. Cattle age had a significant effect on likelihood of T bruce infection, with cattle 18-36 months (OR:3.51, 95CI:1.63-7.51) and over 36 months (OR:4.20,95:2.08-8.67) having higher odds than under 18 months. Village sleeping sickness status also affected detection of T. rh in cattle, with higher likelihood in case villages (OR:25,95:1.2-520.71). A higher average T bruce prevalence (>16.3) in a herd was associated with higher likelihood of T rh detection (OR:25,95:1-520.71).

**Implications:** The study suggests a strong association between high T bruce levels in a herd and likelihood of detecting T rh and village status as a sleeping case. This could provide a means of determining risk at parish level in endemic districts in Uganda. A high level of T br and infect T rh in cattle in villages with reported cases may indicate risk to human population and permit appraisal of disease spreading to neighboring districts.

**Conclusion:** Establishing the reservoir of human infect T rh in cattle provides an indicator of risk to human population and appraisal of disease spreading to neighboring districts. The study found a significant association between village sleeping status and T bruce and rh infections, with low prevalence of infect T rh in Kaber and Dokolo possibly due to recent introduction.

**Title:** The MOF-containing NSL Complex Regulates Housekeeping Genes in Drosophila by Modulating RNA Polymerase II Transcription Initiation

**Research Question:** How does the MO-containing NS complex regulate gene expression in Dophila?

**Methods:** We performed a comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis of four NS complex members (NS1, NS3, MBD2, and CR2) throughout the Doph melanogaster genome and found that 85.5% of NS-bound genes are constitutively expressed across cell types. We also analyzed histone modifications H4ac, H3me, Hme, and Hac in promoter regions of NS-targeted genes and observed well-defined nucleosome-free regions and broad transcription initiation patterns. Additionally, we performed ChIP-seq of RNA polymerase II (II) in NS1 and NS3-depleted cells and demonstrated that NS proteins are required for efficient recruitment of II to NS-target promoters.

**Findings:** Our results show that the MO-containing NS complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes in flies by modulating RNA II transcription initiation. We found that NS-bound genes exhibit elevated levels of H3me, Hac, and Hac and a distinctive nucleosome-free region (NFR) as well as dispersed initiation patterns. Moreover, genes that undergo most loss of II upon NS knockdown tend to be enriched in Replication-related (RE) elements.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the MO-containing NS complex plays a crucial role in regulating housekeeping genes in Doph by modulating RNA II transcription initiation. The NS complex preferentially targets constitutively expressed genes, also known as housekeeping genes, and is required for optimal recruitment of the pre-initiation complex to these genes. This study provides insights into the mechanism of action of the NS complex, which is conserved from Doph to mammals, and has implications for understanding transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes and its evolutionary plasticity.

**Conclusions:** The MO-containing NS complex is a major regulator of housekeeping genes in Doph by modulating RNA II transcription initiation. The complex preferentially targets constitut expressed genes and is required for optimal recruitment of the pre-initiation complex to these genes. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of action of the complex and has implications for understanding transcriptional regulation in higher eukotes and its evolutionary plasticity.

**Title:** Modeling Facioscapulohum Dystrophy (FD) using Transgenic Mice: A Novel Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Strategies

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying Facioscapohum dystrophy (FD), a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by epigenetic repression of D4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX, a germline transcription factor, and can we develop a transgenic mouse model to study the disease and test therapeutic interventions?

**Methods:** We generated transgenic mice carrying D4 arrays from a pathogenic FD1 allele and a control allele, recapitulating epigenetic and D4 expression seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high D4 expression in germl, incomplete epigen repression in somatic tissue, and FD-specific variegated D4 expression in sporadic muscle associated with D4 chromatin relaxation.

**Findings:** Our data suggest somatic epigen silencing of D4 is conserved and contracted4 arrays are less efficiently silenced, leading to variegated D4 expression in muscle nuclei. ChIP and DNA methylation analyses indicate chrom relaxation of D4 repeats in D4-2.5 compared to D-12.5 mice, concord with observed D4 expression, modeling the difference between FD patients and controls. In muscle, D4 activates germl and stem programs while suppressing innate response genes.

**Implications:** Our transgenic mice represent a valuable model for FD and will be useful to study molecular mechanisms and test therapeutic strategies. The detrimental effects of D4 expression in muscle can be reversed by RNA interference, and our model may serve therapeutic studies targeting D4 expression in muscle. The FD somatic derepression of4 has been associated with changes D4 chrom structure, characterized decreased methylation and lower Ch, suggesting a locus-intrinsic property of the4 repeat regulation conserved between mouse and human.

**Conclusions:** Our transgenic mice recapitulate key features of FD, including epigenetic and D4 expression, variegated D4 in muscle, and chrom relaxation of D4 repeats. This model will facilitate understanding the complex etiology of FD, including epigen silencing by D contraction and heterozygous mutations in chromatin modifier SMCH1, and test therapeutic interventions targeting D4 expression in muscle. The somatic derepression of4 has been associated with changes D chrom structure, characterized decreased methylation and lower, suggesting a locus-intrinsic property of the repeat regulation conserved between mouse and human.

**Title:** Understanding the Structural Basis of Cross-Strain Inhibition of Malaria Vaccine Candidate Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) and Development of a Broadly Protective Vaccine

**Research Question:** Can a mixed vaccine containing diverse AMA1 allelic proteins induce broadly inhibitory antibodies against Plasmodium falcum strains, and what is the structural basis of this cross-strain inhibition?

**Methods:** A mixed vaccine, Quax or Q, containing four diverse AMA1 allelic proteins (3D, F, VO, HB, and Wm) was used to elicit polyclonal antibodies in rabbits, which inhibited the invasion of four vaccine and non-vaccine strains of P. falciparum. Polyclonal anti-Q antibodies were compared to strain-specific monoval 3D AMA vaccine, revealing higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies associated with conserved domain-3 and reduced domain-2 responses.

**Findings:** Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (m) raised against Q reacted with a cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough domain-1, mapped to conserved face of AMA1 and encompassing the 1-loop. mbs to the 1-loop (10, 4, 8, and 11) were ~10-fold more potent than previously AMA-inhib m and mode of action was inhibition of AMA binding to ligand R2. Unlike epitope of previously 3D-specific m, 9, the 1-loop inhibitory was partially conserved across strains. Novel m, 10, bound to domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked proteolytic processing of AMA. m 10 was weakly inhibitory but synergized with previously, strain-transending m, 2, which binds to hydroobic on conserved and inhibits R2 binding AMA.

**Implications:** Novel susceptible regions and epitopes identified can form the basis for improving antigen breadth and inhibitory response AMA vaccines. Vaccination with diverse proteins could provide universal coverage by redirecting response to conserved epitopes.

**Conclusions:** Understanding the structural basis of cross-strain inhibition is required for developing second-generation AMA vaccines. Mixed vaccine Quax Q induced broadly inhibitory antibodies against P. falcum strains, with higher levels of cross-reactive antibodies and conserved inhibitory epitopes on AMA1. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies reacted with cross-reactive epitope at hydroobic domain-1, mapped to conserved face AMA and encompassing 1-loop. mbs to 1-loop (10, 4, 8, 11) were ~10 more potent than previously AMA-inhib m and mode of action was inhibition AMA binding ligand R2.

**Title:** Temporal Regulation of Mitotic Spindle Displacement in Asymmetric Cell Division

**Research Question:** How is the timing of mitotic spindle displacement regulated in asymmetric cell division?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of quantitative measurements, genetic, and pharmacological techniques to investigate the relationship between anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) in regulating mitotic spindle displacement in Caenorhabditis elegans zygote.

**Findings:** We found that mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time after chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate. Reducing the function of proteasome, APC, or C20/Fizzy delayed spindle displacement, while inactivating CD in metaphase caused the spindle to displace early. Experimentally unlinking spindle from this mechanism resulted in premature displacement of incompletely assembled mitotic components.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that the APC-dependent regulation of CD activity serves as a previously unrecognized timer for mitotic spindle displacement. This regulation of CD activity results in a 60-90 delay in spindle displacement, allowing spindle assembly to complete before cortical forces pull spindle away from the center of the cell.

**Conclusions:** We conclude that in this system, asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle is delayed until APC inactivates CD, ensuring the spindle does not begin to move until fully assembled. This is the first demonstration of mitotic timing spindle displacement in asymmetric division of an animal cell. We speculate that this link between cell cycle and asymmetric division may be evolutionarily conserved, as mitotic spindle displaced at similar stage of mitosis in diverse systems.

**Title:** Unveiling the Genetic Basis of High-Altitude Adaptation: A Genome-Wide Scan Identifies Selection-Nominated Genes and Regions in Andean and Tibetan Populations

**Research Question:** What are the genetic mechanisms underlying the physiological adaptations to high-altitude hypoxia in Andean and Tibetan populations?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genes and regions showing evidence of adaptation to high-altitude in Andean and Tibetan populations. We examined each chromosome for genomic regions with unknown functions related to altitude phenotypes and targeted genes involved in oxygen sensing and metabolism.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed distinct patterns of genetic adaptation in Andean and Tibetan populations, with evidence of positive selection in different genes and regions. Notably, the gene EGLN1 (PH2), crucial for cellular oxygen sensing, showed selection in both populations, but with varying patterns of variation. Key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes were implicated in high-altitude adaptation in Andeans, while different chromosomal regions showed putative response to selection in Tibetans.

**Implications:** These findings suggest a genetic basis for high-altitude adaptation and provide a foundation for future genotype-phenotype studies to confirm the role of selection-nominated genes and regions in high-altitude adaptation. By comparing two populations adapted to high-altitude, we gain insight into genetic mechanisms and evolutionary architecture of adaptation, contributing to understanding human phenotypic diversity.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies selection-nominated genes and regions in Andean and Tibetan populations, providing a step towards understanding the genotype-phenotype relationship and functional significance of EPAS variation. The HIF pathway, RAS, and globin family genes were enriched for selection in high-altitude populations, supporting their role in physiological responses to hypoxia. High-altitude hypox, caused by decreased barometric pressure, cannot be overcome by cultural buffers, necessitating physiological or genetic adaptation. The Andean and Tibetan populations, residing at high-altitude for millennia, exhibit unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations.

**Title:** Inverted Repeats Induce Genomic Instability by Channeling Double-Strand Break Repair into Break-Induced Replication Pathway

**Research Question:** How do inverted repeats (IR) near double-strand breaks (DSBs) influence the choice of repair pathway and outcome, leading to genomic instability?

**Methods:** We investigated the effect of IR on DSB repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. IR were placed near DSBs in a plasmid, and repair was analyzed by PCR, sequencing, and microscopy.

**Findings:** IR near DSB channel repair into break-induced replication (BIR) pathway, leading to genomic instability. IR form unusual DNA structures when present in single-strand (ss) DNA formed by D resection. We identified two types of structures: intermolecular single-strand annealing (SSA) leading to inverted dimers, and intramolecular SSA leading to fold-back (FB) structures. Both interfere with accurate DSB repair by conversion and channel DSB into BIR, promoting destabilization. Different protein complexes process FB with short (12-b) versus long (1-k) ss loops: MR-Sae2 and Rad1-Rad10, respectively.

**Implications:** Our studies uncover mechanisms of genomic destabilization resulting from re-routing DSB into unusual pathways by IR. Given the abundance of IR in human genome, our findings contribute to understanding IR-mediated destabilization associated with disease.

**Conclusions:** IR near DSB influence choice of repair pathway and outcome, leading to genomic instability. IR form unusual structures that interfere with accurate DSB repair and promote BIR. Different protein complexes process FB with short versus long loops. Our results have implications for understanding genomic instability in human disease.

**Title:** Investigating Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Infections in Drosophila melanogaster: A Novel Insights into Host-Pathogen Interactions and Biofilm Formation

**Research Question:** This study aimed to develop an animal model for in vivo study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections in Drosila melanogaster and investigate host-pathogen interactions during biofilm formation.

**Methods:** Drosila were orally infected with Pseudomon aerugin strain PA1, and biofilms were localized and visualized in the crop 24 hours post-infection. Biofilms exhibited a characteristic structure and extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysaccharide. Pseud aerugin cells from biofilms showed increased antibiotic resistance compared to planktonic cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on the expression of exopolyschar genes, as pel:: mutant failed to form biofilms.

**Findings:** The pel:: mutant was more virulent than PA1, while hyperfilm strain PA3 demonstrated less virulence than PA1, as indicated by survival of infected flies at 14 postinfection. Bio formation by PA1 and PA3 in the crop was associated with induction of dipteric, cecin A andros antimicrobial peptide expression 24 postin. In contrast, infection with non-bioforming pel:: resulted in decreased AMP expression in fly.

**Implications:** These results provide novel insights into host-pathogen interactions during Pseud aerugin oral infection Dila and highlight the use of Dila as a model for studying Pseud aerugin biofilms in vivo. Biofilm infections account for 65% of bacterial infections, yet little is known about bacterial and host factors in bio pathogenesis. This study demonstrates oral infection of Dila by Pseud PA1 resulted in bio formation in Dila crop, retaining characteristics of in vitro biofilms, including DNA and EPS, and increased antibiotic resistance.

**Conclusions:** These findings suggest Pel may play a crucial role in oral Dila infection, as it is highly expressed, and highlight the importance of EPS as bio matrix for establishment and maintenance in vivo, in addition to attachment and maturation in vitro. Pseud aerugin strains were monitored for virulence in Dila, with non-bioforming pel:: mutant more virulent than PA1, having increased Dila killing rate. This study provides a novel P aerugin biofilm model for studying bacterial and host response during infection.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genomic Mechanisms of Vasopressin-Mediated Behaviors: The Role of Vasopressin Receptor 1 Gene (Avpr1) in Species-Specific Expression Patterns

**Research Question:** The vasopress receptor 1 gene (Av1) exhibits remarkable diversity in expression patterns within and between species, influencing vasopress-mediated behaviors. However, the genomic mechanisms underlying these differences are poorly understood.

**Methods:** Using homologous recombination in mice, we investigated the contribution of the proximal 5' flanking region and polymorphic microsatellite element within the Av1 gene to vasopress receptor 1 (V1R) distribution and behavior.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that the proximal 5' flanking sequences modestly contribute to species-specific V1R distribution and confirm that variation in V1R impacts stress-coping in the forced swim test. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Av1 microsatellite contributes to Av1 expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring inter- and intra-species differences in central V1 patterns.

**Implications:** This is the first evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes contribute to diversity in brain expression, providing a mechanism for generating diversity at both individual and species levels. However, our results suggest that species-specific patterns are mediated by elements outside the immediate 5' flanking region of the gene.

**Conclusions:** The Av1 is an ideal locus for exploring genomic mechanisms contributing to diversity in brain expression and behavior relevant to human behavior. Specifically, Av provides an opportunity to explore the contribution of species-specific elements in the 5 flanking region and polymorphic elements in generating species and individual variation in gene expression. Unstable polymorphic repetitive elements have been proposed to enhance evolv traits by increasing gene expression, and Av1 provides an opportunity to explore these mechanisms of expression divergence.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Genome Instability Mediated by mR Biogenesis and Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (A) in Yeast and Mammalian Cells

**Research Question:** How do mR biogenesis and Activation-Induced Cyt Deaminase (A) (AID) contribute to genome instability in yeast and mammalian cells, leading to chromosomal translocations and rearrangements?

**Methods:** We developed a chromosomal system based on segments of mammalian immunoglobulin and c-MYC sequences in yeast to analyze chromosomal rearrangements in wild-type and THO mutants, a conserved complex involved in mNP biogenesis.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that A induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immunoglobulin and c-M sequences in TH mutants, leading to chromosomal translocations via Non-homous Joining (NHE). A-induced translocations were enhanced in TH null mutants, consistent with the idea that A-mediated DS depend on-loop formation. Our data suggest that A-deamination of cytosines in sequences are channeled by Ung1 activity into DS, as in mammalian cells, which are repaired by NHE.

**Implications:** This study provides new insights into the role of m bi in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of A-mediated genome instability, and shows that urac residues produced by A-deamination are processed into DS and chromosomal rearrangements by conserved DNA repair functions from yeast to mammalian cells.

**Conclusions:** Our yeast system provides a validated assay to study mechanisms mediated by A leading to DS at regions and c-M oncogene, such as those occurring in cells responsible for switching or translocations associated with Burk's lymphomas, opening perspectives in understanding A-mediated rearrangements. We propose a model where R-lo initiate instability via DS, which are processed by conserved repair functions in yeast and mammalian cells.

**Key findings:**

* A induces DS in immunoglob and c sequences in TH mutants, leading to chromosomal translocations via NHE
* A-induced translocations enhanced in TH mutants, consistent with A-mediated DS depend on-loop
* A-deamination of cytos in sequences channe by Ung1 into DS, as in mammalian cells, repaired by N
* yeast and mammalian cells have conserved factors and pathways to channel A-mediated lesions into DS for NHE-dependent rearrangements
* Our system provides assay to study mechanisms by A leading DS at regions and c-M oncogene, such as in cells for switching or trans associated Burk's lymphomas

**Title:** Chromosome Partitioning in Asymmetrically Dividing Escherichia coli: Unveiling the Role of DNA Translocase Fts

**Research Question:** How do Escheria coli cells coordinate chromosome partitioning during asymmetric cell division when the cell division plane is not properly localized?

**Methods:** We employed quantitative time-lapse imaging to investigate the dynamics of chromosome partitioning in E. coli cells with misplaced cell division planes. Cells were grown in M9 glycer medium, where replication is expected to initiate after cell birth, ensuring fully replicated chromosomes are present at division.

**Findings:** Our results show that DNA transase Fts can pump up to 80% (3.7 Mb) of the chromosome between daughters at an average rate of 1700±800 bp/s, with rare pauses and no reversals at experimental scales of minutes. The majority of DNA movement occurs at late stages of cell division when division protein ZipA has dissociated from septum and sept has closed to a narrow channel diameter smaller than microscope resolution (~250 nm). Data suggest constriction is necessary for effective translocation by Fts.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that E. coli can reposition chromosomes when division plane is not localized, contradicting the accepted view that accurate positioning is essential for viability. Translocation occurs at late stages division, when sept is closed, and constriction is present, indicating timing may be determined by Fts ability to bind DNA when sept is not closed. Work also implies DNA constriction realizes a cell-cycle checkpoint preventing daughters from separating.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals E. coli's ability to partition chromosomes during asymmetric division, even when division plane is misplaced, and highlights the role of DNA transase F in this process. These findings have implications for understanding bacterial cell division and chromosome dynamics, particularly in cases where division is not properly localized.

**Title:** Optimal Epitope Selection for Vaccine Design using Integer Linear Programming: A Novel Approach to Enhance Immunogenicity and Personalized Vaccines

**Research Question:** How can we develop a mathematical framework to optimize epitope selection for vaccine design, ensuring broad and potent immune response, while addressing regulatory, economic, and practical constraints?

**Methods:** We propose a novel integer linear programming (IL) approach to formulate and solve the epitope selection problem. Given a set of candidate peptides, MHC alleles, and immunogenic information, our framework identifies the optimal set of epitopes eliciting the highest overall immunogenicity.

**Findings:** Our IL approach outperforms a greedy strategy and evolutionary algorithm with runtimes of seconds for typical problem sizes. We demonstrate how immunological requirements, such as coverage of epitopes per antigen, MHC alleles, and avoidance of high-mutation epitopes, can be translated into constraints within the IL framework.

**Implications:** This work presents the first provably optimal epitope framework for vaccine design. Our IL formulation is flexible to account for various problem variants, including personalized vaccines. The solution yields an optimal set of epitopes displaying highest immunogenicity, meeting pre-defined requirements.

**Conclusions:** We suggest a mathematical framework for epitope selection, not a single optimal strategy, allowing various definitions of a good vaccine. For a chosen definition, the algorithm yields a provably optimal combination of epitopes. Our goal is to maximize immunogenicity while constraining solutions to sets satisfying requirements. This can be formulated as an IL program. IL deals with optimization of linear functions subject to linear constraints. An IL is a program with integral unknowns.

**Title:** The Role of Interleukin-7 (IL-7) in HIV-1 Transmission through the Cervico-Vaginal Mucosa: A Novel Insights into the Mechanisms of Male-to-Female Transmission

**Research Question:** Does Interleukin-7 (IL-7), a cytokine present in semen, enhance HIV-1 replication in the cervico-vaginal mucosa, facilitating male-to-female transmission?

**Methods:** We investigated the effect of IL-7 on HIV-1 replication in human cervico-vaginal and lymphoid tissues ex vivo, simulating the in vivo situation by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vag tissue in combination with IL-7 concentrations comparable to those in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals.

**Findings:** IL-7 significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication in cervico-vag tissues and lymphoid explants. Analysis of infected cells showed IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell apoptosis, as evidenced by decrease in apoptotic marker APO2.7 and increase in anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. IL-7 also increased cycling CD4 T cells, as shown by Ki-67 staining. High IL-7 levels in semen may facilitate survival of HIV-1-infected cells in cervicoag mucosa, promoting local infection expansion and dissemination.

**Implications:** Our study is the first to address IL-7 role in HIV-1 male-to-female transmission, demonstrating that cervico-vag and lymph tissues exposed to IL-7 facilitate HIV-1 infection. High IL-7 in semen may make female genital mucosa more susceptible to HIV-1 acquisition. IL-25 ng/mL increased HIV-1-infected CD4 cells in lymphoid tissues 4.1 and 7.7 fold, respectively, on day 9 post-infection.

**Conclusions:** IL-7 plays a crucial role in HIV-1 transmission through the cervico-vag mucosa, facilitating male-to-female transmission. High IL-7 levels in semen may render female genital tract more susceptible to HIV-1. Our findings have implications for HIV prevention and treatment strategies targeting IL-7 in male-to-female transmission.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of RNA Interference (RNAi) Pathways in Controlling Arbovirus Infections in Aedes aegypt Mosquitoes

**Research Question:** How do RNA interference (RNA) pathways, specifically the PI-interacting (piRNA) and exogenous interfering (exi)RNA pathways, contribute to the antiviral response in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes against Zika virus (ZIK)?

**Methods:** We investigated the production of virus-specific small interfering (si) RNAs and PI-interacting (pi) RNAs in Aedes aegpt cells infected with ZIK and analyzed their loading into the exiRNA effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2) and PIWI proteins. We also examined the effect of silencing Ago2 and PIWI proteins on ZIK replication.

**Findings:** Our results show that ZIK induces the production of virus-specific siRNAs and piRNAs, although piRNAs lack the characteristic signature of small RNAs. siRNAs were loaded into Ago2, but silencing this protein did not enhance virus replication. Enhanced ZIK replication was observed in Ago2-knockout cells, indicating an antiral role of the exRNA pathway. ZIK-specific piRNA small RNAs were detected, but lacked the piRNA ping-pong motif and bound Ago3, not Pi5 or Pi6. Silencing PI proteins showed that knockdown of Ago, Pi5, or Pi6 did not enhance ZIK replication, while Pi4 displayed antiral activity.

**Implications:** Our findings elucidate ZIK-mosquito RNA interactions, crucial for understanding its spread in Aedes aegpt cells. The exRNA pathway is a key antiral mechanism in Aedes aegpt against ZIK, contrasting with previous studies on Drosophila melanogaster. ZIK capsid protein amplifies reporter virus replication, unlike yellow fever protein, which inhibits exRNA.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of RNAi pathways in controlling arboirus infections in Aedes aegpt mosquitoes. The exRNA pathway plays a crucial role in antiral response against ZIK, while Pi4 displays antiral activity. These findings provide insights into ZIK-mosquito interactions, essential for understanding its spread in A aegypt cells.

**Title:** Species-Specific Clinical Manifestations of Sporotrichosis: A Cross-Sectional Study of Sporothrix Isolates in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the association between Sporoth species and clinical manifestations of sporrichosis in an endemic area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted on Sporrix isolates from 50 patients with different clinical manifestations. Phenotypic and genotypic methods were used to analyze the isolates.

**Findings:** Data revealed distinct clinical and therapeutic responses between Sporrix brasili (n=45) and S. schckii sensu stricto (n=5). S. brasili was associated with disseminated cutaneous infection, hypersensitivity, and mucosal infection, whereas S. schii presented less severe and localized disease. S. bras-infected patients required shorter itraconazole duration (16 weeks) compared to S. schii (24).

**Implications:** Sporrix species are linked to different manifestations of sporrichosis, and S. brasili is effectively treated with itraconazole.

**Conclusion:** This is the first study demonstrating association between genotyp identification Sporrix and clinical aspects of sporrich. Given recent changes in nomenclature and taxonomy Sporrix, it is crucial to understand clinical implications. The majority of isolates were identified as S. schii. This study adds to knowledge on S. bras and supports careful speciation of Sporrix to guide care. S. bras has been reported in Brazilian states other than Rio Janeiro, but frequency is lower than S. schii. S. bras caused typical forms of sporrich (lymphocutaneous and cutaneous), except 1 case disseminated. Clinical presentations of sporrich by Sporrix are variable and poorly understood. This study shows direct association between unusual presentations human sporrich with S. bras. Although S. bras caused typical manifestations fixed and lymphocutaneous sporrich, 10 patients hypersensitivity and 7 disseminated were infected S.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Extent of Transcriptional Activity in the Mammalian Genome: A Comparative Analysis of RNA-Seq and Tiling Data

**Research Question:** Recent studies have suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed cannot be accounted for by annotated genes, but the nature and quantity of these transcripts remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in Poly+ RNA from human and mouse tissues using single-end and paired RNA-Seq and tiling.

**Methods:** We analyzed data from RNASeq and tiling arrays to identify transcribed regions (seqags) outside exons and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in human and mouse tissues.

**Findings:** RNASeq identified many seqags outside known exons and ncRNAs, most of which are introns, suggesting they are fragments of pre-mRNAs. Chromosomal locations of intergenic seqags in RNASeq are near genes, consistent with alternative splicing and polyadenylation usage, promoter-terminator transcripts, or new exons. Reads bridging splice sites identified 5,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes. Remaining seqags correspond to single reads with characteristics of random sampling from low background or several small transcripts (median = 111 bp) present at higher levels, displaying sequence conservation and originating from open chromatin.

**Implications:** While there are bona fide intergenic transcripts, their number is generally low compared to exons, and genome not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that intergenic and intronic seqags have low sequence coverage, exemplified by 70-80% of transcribed in these regions detected by RNASeq in one sample, consistent with random placement. Comparison between tiling and RNASeq data from same tissues shows tiling ill-suited to detect expressed at low levels. Fraction of non-exonic in RNASeq associated with genes includes thousands of alternative exons and hundreds promoters. We found increased coverage of seq in intergenic regions correlated with neighboring gene transcripts. Genome-wide analysis revealed 2,789 uncharacterized fragments with no overlap known exons, 1,259 in intergenic. Intergenic regions transcribed above background consist of coding and noncoding transcripts.

**Title:** Enhancing Thermostability of the Flavin Mononucleotide Fluorescent Protein (FP) through a Combined Computational and Experimental Approach

**Research Question:** Can a novel computational and experimental method be developed to increase the thermostability of the flavinonucleotide fluorescent protein Bacillus subtilis YLO domain, enabling its application in thermophilic systems?

**Methods:** A five-step approach was employed: (1) single mutant screening to identify thermost candidates, (2) experimental confirmation of positive selections, (3) computational redesign of thermost regions, (4) experimental evaluation, and (5) multiple combination of mutations.

**Findings:** The method is effective and can be applied to other proteins where conventional methods fail, providing a new tool to improve thermostability. Eight thermost sites were identified, with five at the dimer interface (V25, 107, 109, 120, and 124), suggesting stronger interactions between subunits increase therability. Mutant V120 has the highest thermost (54.2°C), 11.

**Implications:** Thermost proteins are desirable for studying anaerobic microorganisms, especially thermophilic ones. The success rate of 62% highlights the effectiveness of screening. A dozen mutants have higher than WT, offering opportunities to further improve therability by combining mutations. Two factors were considered: Δ melting temperature with WT and distance between mutants.

**Conclusions:** The combined computational and experimental method adds a new tool to enhance therability, useful when conventional methods (e.g., directed evolution) fail. This approach can be applied to other proteins where conventional methods have difficulties, providing a new avenue to improve therability.

**Title:** Molecular Characterization of Leishmania and Wolbach Infection in Sand Flies of the Genus Lutzia in the Isthmus of Panama

**Research Question:** What are the species of sand flies in the genus Lutzia present in the Isth of Panama, and how are they infected with Leishmania and Wolbach, and what are the implications for disease transmission to humans and other mammals?

**Methods:** We collected and sorted sand flies from the understory of Barro Island, Republic of Panama, and used DNA sequencing to determine diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Phleominae. We used CO1 and ITS-1 primers to detect Leish DNA and Wolbach in sand species.

**Findings:** We identified two cryptic species, Lu. sp. vespilion and Lu. gzi, and detected Leish DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapi, 26.3% Lu. gzi, and 0% other sand species. ITS-1 sequence obtained from Leish infecting Lu. trapi and Lu. gzi was 93% similar to Leish viannia in GenBank, previously unknown in Panama but recognized as cutaneous leish vector. Distinct Wolbach strains in three sand species, including Lu. trapi, co-occurred with Leish.

**Implications:** Two species, Lu. trap and Lu. gzi, carry Leish at high frequency and are likely vectors of leish to humans or mammals. Leish identified as Le. naiff, known to cause cutaneous in South America, but not reported in Panama, may have expanded range or introduced. Occurrence of Leish and Wolia in Lu. trap identifies vector as target for Wolia population control.

**Conclusion:** This study clarifies species and Leish infection status of sand flies in Isth Panama using molecular techniques, highlighting Lu. trap and Lu g as potential vectors of leish to humans and other mammals. Leish and Wol infection in Lu trap opens possibility for Wolia control.

**Title:** Unraveling the Molecular Mechanisms of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Reactivation: The Role of ERK-Mediated Stress Kinase (MS) and CREB in Chromatin Remodeling**

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs), and how do ERK-mediated stress kinase (MS) and CRE binding to the major early promoter (IE) contribute to this process?

**Methods:** We employed in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of MS and CRE in HCM reactivation. Biochemical studies on the c-fos promoter showed that chromatin bound to c-fos is resistant to MS-mediated phosphorylation, whereas CRE binding to MS promotes histone phosphorylation. We utilized adenovirus vectors to transfect primary DCs with siRNAs targeting MS to assess the effects on HCM reactivation.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that MS-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required for histone deacetylation and subsequent HCM exit from latency. CRE binding to theIE provides a target for MS recruitment, initiating chromatin remodeling at theIE required for reactivation. Importantly, inhibition of this interaction between CRE and MS could provide a therapeutic strategy for intervention.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of CRE in HCM reactivation, promoting chromatin modifications conducive to viral expression and acting as a classical transcription factor. The interaction between MS and CRE at theIE is crucial for regulating gene expression of a clinically significant pathogen. Furthermore, histone phosphorylation is associated with "rapid response" genes, promoting hyperacetylation in a MAP and MS-dependent manner, influencing H reactivation.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms of HCM reactivation in DCs, underscoring the role of MS and CRE in chromatin remodeling at theIE. Our findings provide evidence for a functional interaction between MS and CRE at theIE, essential for controlling gene expression of a clinically relevant pathogen. Inhibition of this interaction may offer a therapeutic strategy for HCM reactivation.

**Title:** Essential Role of NOL1 in Vertebrate Ribosome Biogenesis and Craniofacial Development

**Research Question:** What is the role of NOL1 in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression and function of NOL in the developing cranial neural crest (CNC) of amphibians and mammals, using Xenopus as a model organism. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown NOL in Xenopus and analyzed the effects on pre-rRNA transcription, processing, apoptosis, and craniofac cartilage development.

**Findings:** NOL is strongly expressed in the developing NC of both amphibians and mammals. Knockdown of NOL in Xenopus resulted in impaired pre-r transcription, increased apoptosis, and abnormal cranfac cartilage development. Inhibition of p53 rescued the cranfacial phenotype but not the ribosome biogenesis defect, indicating an evolutionarily conserved mechanism controlling ribosome-impaired cranfac cells. Excessive activation of this mechanism impaired cranfac development.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel requirement for NOL in cranfac development, the first model of a ribosopathy, and provide insight into the clinically important relationship between ribosome biogenesis proteins and cranfac cell survival.

**Conclusions:** NOL plays a critical role in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis and cranfac development. NOL is required for optimal pre-r transcription and processing in Xenopus, and its knockdown results in nucleolar stress, p53 stabilization, and cranfac phenotype. NOL expression is tightly linked to CNC, where it is necessary for differentiation and development of cranfac cartilage, but not associated with defects in other cell populations. Our results suggest differential ribosomal requirements during embryonic development.

**Title:** Identification of Immunodominant Antigens and Serodiagnostic Markers for Leptospirosis using a Protein Microarray Approach

**Research Question:** Leptpirosis, a zoonotic disease, poses a significant diagnostic challenge due to the lack of efficient laboratory tests, particularly during the early stages of illness when antibiotic therapy is effective. This study aimed to identify novel targets for diagnostic markers by constructing a protein microarray comprising 61% of Leptira interrogans proteome and investigating IgG response from 274 individuals, including acute-phase, convalescent, and healthy subjects from regions with endemic, high, and no transmission leptpi.

**Methods:** A microarray comprising 2,421 proteins, 61% of proteome L. interrogansovar Copenhagen was constructed to examine Ig response to leptpi. Nitrocellulose blot assay validated the accuracy of microarray results.

**Findings:** 16 antigens discriminated between acute cases and healthy individuals from regions with high transmission leptpi, and 18 antigens distinguished convales cases. Some identified antigens, such as Lip32, non-identical domains Lig, Gro, and Lo22, are known to be recognized by sera from patients, validating the serodiagnostic approach. Novel antigens, including hypothetical LIC15, showed sensitivity and specificity for both acute and convalescent patients.

**Implications:** This study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antig associated with naturally acquired leptiral infection and novel serodi leptiral antigens recognized by sera leptpi cases. Identified antigens have potential in developing new tests and improving available assays for diagnosing neglected disease. Further research is needed to assess utility in deployable platforms.

**Conclusions:** Characterization of serological response to Lept exposure and infection on proteome with microarrays has not been done. This study evaluated feasibility for leptpi by identifying subset prote likely immunoreactive. Criteria selected proteins included 2,241 ORFs, corresponding 61 Leptira proteome. A microarray for L.ansar Copenhagen discovered 24 differentially reactive antigens, which can improve accuracy rapid tests in resource-limited settings.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Melanization in Mosquito Immunity Against Entomopathogenic Fungi: A Study on Anopheles gambiae and Beauveria bassiana Interaction

**Research Question:** How does melanization, a potent effector mechanism in arthropods, contribute to mosquito defense against entomogenic fungi, specifically Beauveria bassiana, in Anopheles gambia?

**Methods:** We employed in vivo genetic analysis and confocal microscopy to monitor fungal growth in mosquitoes injected with B. bass conidia and silenced TEP1 and CL8, key regulators of melanization in A. gambiae.

**Findings:** Melan formed on all fungal stages, including conidia, germ tubes, and hyphae, but rarely aborted growth and mycelium continued despite melanization. Silencing T1 and CL8 abolished melan on hypha but not germinating conidia or tubes. A layer of hemocytes surrounded germinating conidia but not hypha, suggesting melan of early stages is cell-mediated while late is humoral dependent on T1 and CL8. Microscopic analysis revealed association of T1 with hypha surfaces and requirement of both T and CL8 for phenoloxidase recruitment. Fungal proliferation was rapid in T and CL8 knockdown mosquitoes with increased sensitivity to natural B infections.

**Implications:** Melan response significantly retards B growth and dissemination, a finding that may be exploited to design transgenic fungi with potent bio-control activities against mosquitoes.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the role of melan in A. gambiae anti-fungal defense against B. bassiana, demonstrating its importance in retarding fungal growth and dissemination. Our findings suggest that melanization is a critical component of mosquito immunity against entopathogenic fungi, highlighting its potential as a target for developing novel control strategies against mosquito-borne diseases.

**Title:** Investigating the Efficacy of Mammalian Dengue Virus Host Factors Inhibitors in Blocking Dengue Virus Infection in the Mosquito Vector Aedes aegypt

**Research Question:** Can mammalian dengue virus (DENV) host factors (DHF) that are essential for the completion of infection in the mosquito and vertebrate host be targeted to block transmission? Specifically, can known mammalian DENV inhibitors influence infection in the arthropod vector Aedes aegypt?

**Methods:** We evaluated the potency of four putative DENV inhibitors, bafilomycin (BAF), myopholic acid (M), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxojirimycin (DN), in blocking DENV infection in the mosquito midgut using various treatment methods, including injection, ingestion by sugar feeding or blood, and silencing target genes by RNA interference (RNAi).

**Findings:** Injection of BAF (5µM) and M (25µ) prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited DENV titers in the midut at 7 days post-infection by 56% and 60, and in the salivary at 14 post-infection by 90 and 83, respectively, while treatment with CAS or DN did not affect susceptibility to virus. Ingestion B and M through sugar or blood meal resulted in various degrees of virus inhibition. RNA-mediated silencing several vPase subunit and IMP genes resulted in reduced DENV, indicating B- and M-mediated inhibition in mosquitoes likely occurred through inhibition of DENVFs.

**Implications:** This study provides proof-of-principle that chemical or RNA-mediated depletion of DENV vPase and IMP can suppress D infection in adult Aegypt mosquitoes, which may translate to reduction in D transmission.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that mammalian DENV inhibitors can block D infection in the mosquito vector Aegypt, highlighting the potential for targeting DENVFs as a strategy to reduce transmission. The route and timing of B and M administration was essential, treatment exposure to virus diminished antiviral effect. These findings suggest that vPase and IMP are druggable targets for DENV in Aegpt, warranting further investigation.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Cell Volume in Neuronal Dynamics: A Novel Insights into Seizure, Spreading Depression, and Anoxic Depolarization

**Research Question:** How does cell volume affect neuronal dynamics, particularly in the context of pathological states such as seizure, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization?

**Methods:** We incorporated cell swelling, ion concentrations, and oxygen supply into Hodgkin-Hux-type spiking dynamics to investigate the transition between seizure and spreading states in response to changes in osmotic pressure. We used volume as an order parameter to reveal a dynamical definition of the experimentally described ceiling separating seizure from spreading, and a second ceiling demarcating spreading from anoxic depolar.

**Findings:** Our model highlights the neuroprotective role of glial buffering against seizures and spreading, and provides novel insights into anoxic depolar and cell swelling during ischemia. We demonstrate the feasibility of a unified framework for a range of neuronal behaviors relevant to understanding and developing interventions for pathological states.

**Implications:** Our results show that dynamics of seizures, spreading, depression, and anoxicolar lie along a continuum of membrane repertoire that can be understood by considering ion concentrations, homeostasis, and swelling response to osmotic pressure. This framework has substantial implications for understanding and developing universal strategies for pathological states involving excessive neuronal depolarization, such as epileptic seizure, spreading depression, and anoxic depolar during ischemia.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that cell volume acts as a bifurcation parameter, influencing neuronal behavior in response to osmotic-induced swelling states. We provide a novel understanding of how brain cells respond to changes in osmolality, affecting susceptibility to epileiform activity and electrical signals. Our findings suggest a unified framework for a wide range of neuronal behaviors, crucial for understanding and developing interventions for pathological conditions such as trauma, ischemia, hypoxia, seizures, and spreading depression.

**Title:** Activation of the NLRP Inflamome and IL-1β Signaling in Response to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Infection in Murine Dendritic Cells and Macrophages

**Research Question:** How does the NLR inflamome and IL-1 signaling pathway contribute to the host defense against Paracidioides brasiliensis, the etiologic agent of paracidiomycosis, a prevalent in Latin America?

**Methods:** Murine bone-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and macrophages (BMs) were infected with P. brasiliensis yeast cells. IL-1β production was measured by ELISA. The role of Syk, caspase-1, and NLR family member NLR3 in IL-1 production was assessed using inhibitors and knockout mice. IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) deficient mice were used to evaluate IL-1 signaling in macrophage fungic activity.

**Findings:** P. brasili infection activated the NLR inflamome and IL-1 production in BMs via Syk, caspase-1, and NLR3-dependent manner. IL-1 production was abolished in NLR3 knockout mice. IL-1 signaling was essential for macrophage fungicidal activity against P. brasili.

**Implications:** The NLR inflome and IL-1 pathway plays a crucial role in host defense against P. brasili, a primary fungal pathogen. IL-1 signaling activates macrophages to kill P. bras.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that the NLR inflome and IL-1 pathway senses and responds to P. brasili yeast infection and plays an important role in host defense against this fungus. Future studies should investigate IL-1 and NLR inflome components in vivo and how IL-1 activates macrophages for killing activity in vitro.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mystery of Toxoplas gondii's Predilection for Neurons: A Novel Insights into the Host-Pathogen Dynamics of a Ubiquitous Brain Parasite

**Background:** Toxoplas gondii, a common brain-tropic parasite, infects nucleated cells, including astrocytes and neurons in vitro, but primarily resides in neurons in vivo. Recent in vitro data suggest that interferon-γ-stimulated astrocytes, not neurons, clear intracellular parasites, implying neurons are persistently infected due to their inability to clear intracellular parasites.

**Research Question:** Do neurons serve as the primary target cells for Toxoplas infection in vivo, or are they incidentally infected due to astrocyte clearance?

**Methods:** We employed a novel Toxoplas-mouse model capable of marking and tracking host cells interacting with parasites, even transiently, to investigate Tooplas-host interactions in the central nervous system (CNS).

**Findings:** Notably, Tooplas shows a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection, which persists in the setting of IF-γ depletion, resistant to the major mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites, and when parasites are directly injected into the brain. These findings, combined with prior work, suggest neurons are not incidentally infected but Tooplas's primary in vivo target.

**Implications:** Understanding Toop-host dynamics, how pathogens find permissive cells and manipulate them, offers opportunities to develop therapies for currently incurable pathogens. This study addresses how intracellular Toop gondii establishes a persistent brain infection, infecting up to 1/3 of the world's population.

**Conclusions:** Our findings contradict the "astrocyte-killing" model of CNS-Tooplas interactions, indicating Toop primarily interacts with neurons in vivo, persisting in these cells as they predominantly interface with the parasite. Neurons consistently make up the majority of GFP+ parenchymal CNS cells, regardless of infecting strain or time. These results expand our understanding of Toop-host dynamics, crucial for developing therapies against this ubiquitous parasite.

**Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Lamellipodial Motility: A Minimal Models of Actin-Myosin Contractility and Force Balance

**Research Question:** This study aims to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of lamellodial motility, a type of cell movement characterized by the extension and retraction of the cell boundary, through the development of minimal models of actin-myosin contractility and force balance.

**Methods:** A mathematical model of actin-myosin contractility was developed, accounting for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous adhesion. The model generated spatially graded centrip actin flow, which reinforced contraction via myin redistribution and retraction of the lamip boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary countered retraction, and balance of protrusion retraction shaped the lamip.

**Findings:** Analysis revealed that initiation of motility depends on three dimensionless parameters: myosin-dependent contractility, characteristic adhesion length, and actin protrusion rate. When contractility was sufficiently strong, cells broke symmetry and moved steadily along straight or circular trajectories, and motility was sensitive to boundary conditions. Scanning a parameter space showed that contractile motility supported cell turning under conditions with short adhesion lengths and fast protrusion, causing myin accumulation in a small region at the rear, destabilizing axial symmetry.

**Implications:** This study highlights the mechanical nature of minimal lamip motility mechanisms, such as actin growth and myin contraction. Actin growth at the boundary countered retraction, and balance of protrusion re shaped the lamip, feeding back to actin-myin contraction in the bulk. The model showed that mechanical states of the cell depend on three dimensionless parameters representing myin contractility, adhesion, and actin growth. Intuitively, weak myin contractility resulted in uniform spreading and stationary cells, while above a threshold, cells became motile. Mode of motility depended on boundary conditions.

**Conclusions:** The minimal actin-myin contractility model reproduced observed states of simplest motile cells. Mechanical states critically depend on three parameters: myin contractility, adhesion, and actin growth. Positive feedback between myin asymmetry, act flow, and movement is key to stable motility. Simulations showed aspect of moving cells varied between 1-3, in agreement with experimental observations.

**Title:** Assessing Confidence in Protein-Protein Interactions Networks: A Novel Geometric Approach for Noise Reduction and Prediction

**Research Question:** How can we accurately assess the confidence levels of protein-protein interactions (PPI) in large-scale networks and predict novel interactions, given the high levels of noise and incompleteness in current experimental data?

**Methods:** We present a novel technique that leverages geometric graph theory to evaluate the confidence of PIs in networks and predict novel interactions. Our approach utilizes the best-fitting model for P networks, geometric graphs, achieving specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90. We apply our method to the human P network from BioGRID, predicting 251 interactions, a statistically significant fraction of which share common Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

**Findings:** Our technique significantly outperforms existing P network-processing methods in detecting false positives and negatives. We validate a statistically significant portion of predicted interactions in the HPRD and BioGRID databases.

**Implications:** Reducing noise in P networks and assessing interaction confidence is crucial. High-throughput techniques, such as yeast-2-hybrid (YH), tandem purification (T), and mass spectrometry (HMS), produce large amounts of P data, but with high false positive and negative rates. Our method detects both false positives and negatives without requiring multiple P datasets or a prior protein information.

**Conclusions:** Our geometric approach is the first to utilize the best model for P networks, achieving high specificity and sensitivity. We demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting novel interactions in the human P network and validating a significant portion in databases. The Matlab code is available at http://www.kucha.com/Deno.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Sense and Antisense Transcripts in Trinucleotide Expansion Diseases: A Drosophila Model of Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1)

**Research Question:** Do sense and antisense transcripts contribute to the pathogenesis of trinucleotide expansion diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), through the generation of triplet-derived small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target CAG-containing genes?

**Methods:** We established a Drosoph model of DM1 and tested the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG transcripts. We found that co-expression of CTG and CAG repeats led to enhanced toxicity, accompanied by the generation of 21-nt repeat-derived siRNAs that targeted CAG-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA-binding protein (TBP).

**Findings:** Our studies revealed that non-coding, uninterrupted CTG repeats confer length-dependent toxicity in brain and muscle in flies, recapitulating key features of human DM1 disease. We also found that expanded CTG transcripts accumulated in muscle nuclei and affected alternative splicing. To investigate CUG toxicity, we established transgenic flies expressing pure CTG expansions in the 3'UTR of a control protein. These flies recapitulated major features of CUG expansion diseases. Co-expression of CTG and CAG transcripts resulted in enhanced toxicity and generation of repeat-derived siRNAs.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that antisense transcription plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of trinucle expansion diseases. Given that ~70% of genes exhibit antisense transcription, our results suggest that antisense repeat-derived siRNAs may dramatically enhance toxicity in repeat diseases where antisense occurs.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that sense and antisense transcripts contribute to the pathogenesis of trinucle expansion diseases through the generation of triplet-derived siRNAs that target C-containing genes. Our Drosoph model provides a powerful tool to investigate neurological and neurodegenerative diseases relevant to human. These findings have implications for understanding and treating trinucle expansion diseases, such as DM, FAS, SCA, and HDL.

**Title:** Elucidating the Phylogeny and Virulence of the Soft Rot Pathogen Pectobacter sp. SCC3: A Novel Insights into the Biology of a Devastating Bacterial Disease

**Research Question:** What is the phylogenetic classification and virulence of the soft rot pathogen Pobacter sp. SCC3, isolated from a diseased potato stem in Finland in the 1980s, and how does it differ from other soft bacteria?

**Methods:** Genomic, proteomic, and genome comparisons of sequenced soft bacteria revealed that SCC3, previously classified as Pobacter carovorum, is now accurately classified as Pobacter wasiae. Phylogenetic analysis of P. carov strains and P. wasiae strains indicate that P. wasiae has been present in potato fields worldwide. Combination of genomic and in planta experiments identified features that separate SCC3 and P. wasiae from other soft bacteria, including absence of type III secretion system contributing to virulence of other soft species.

**Findings:** Experimentally established virulence determinants include putative transcription regulator SirB, two redundant type VI secretion systems, and horizontally acquired clusters Vic1 and Vic2, containing virulence genes. Genome comparison revealed traits related to life in planta or environmental conditions, such as benzoic acid/salicy acid carbox methyltransferase of eukary origin.

**Implications:** Novel traits found in this work indicate soft bacteria have reservoir of unknown traits utilized in poorly understood stage in planta. Genomic comparison of SCC3 to sequenced Pacter strains, including type P. wasiae, provides basis for investigation virulence distribution and phylog of soft bacteria, potentially other bacteria.

**Conclusions:** This study presents revised phylog, analysis, virulence determinants, and characterization of genomic islands, discussing novel vir strategies throughout lifestyle of Pacter sp. SCC3. SCC3 can be taxonomically classified as P. wasiae, with unique features acquired via horizontal gene transfer.

**Title:** Systemic Alterations of the Mitochondrial Proteome in Response to Mitochondrial Dysfunction: A Network Analysis of Protein Expression Data Reveals Compensatory Mechanisms

**Research Question:** How does the mitochondrial proteome change in response to mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in the absence of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)?

**Methods:** We employed a data-integrative network analysis of proteomics to investigate the systemic alterations of mt-depleted (ρ) mitochondria. We used isotope-coded affinity (IC) tag quantitative analysis to compare protein abundances in mitochondria from normal (ρ+) and mt-depleted (ρ) osteosarcoma cells.

**Findings:** Our results revealed two predominant subnetworks of upregulated and downregulated proteins, exhibiting distinct biological processes. Downregulated modules were involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while upregulated proteins were responsible for mtDNA repair, regulation, and protein transport. Notably, comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data showed that ρ cells attempted to compensate for mt depletion by modulating coordinated expression and transport of proteins.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that protein composition remodels the functional organization of mitochondrial networks in response to dysfunctional states. Human protein networks provide a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions.

**Conclusions:** Mitochondrial dysfunction, caused by mt damage, is involved in many diseases and likely drives aging and apoptosis. Our study elucidates the biological implications of regulatory mechanisms under dysfunctional states. Systematic data-integr analysis evaluates the reliability of proteomics data and identifies functional modules of proteins, valuable to the computational biology community working on expression and proteomics.

**Title:** Predicting In Vivo Kinetics from In Vitro Rates: A Novel Method for Biomolecular Processes

**Research Question:** Can we develop a method to deduce in vivo transition rates from in vitro values for complex biomolecular processes?

**Methods:** We introduce two novel concepts: (1) the kinetic distance, a quantitative measure of similarity between in vitro and in vivo kinetics, and (2) minimization of kinetic distance between in vitro and in vivo processes, constraining deduced rates to reproduce a global property, such as overall in vivo speed.

**Findings:** We apply our method to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression, using a cod-specific Markov model with three pathways for cognate, near-cognate, and non-cognate tRNA. We determine individual in vitro rates, then predict in vivo by minimization and validate with three independent in vivo data: cod-dependent speeds, cod dynamics, and error frequencies. We find good agreement between theory and experiment without adjusting parameters.

**Implications:** The deduced in vivo rates lead to smaller errors than in vitro rates, primarily due to improved tRNA selection. Our method is computationally simple and can be applied to any biomolecular process with detailed in vitro kinetics.

**Conclusions:** We introduce a novel approach to predict in vivo kinetics from in vitro for biomolecular processes. The kinetic distance provides a quantitative measure of similarity between in vitro and in vivo kinetics, interpreted in terms of free energy barriers. Minimization of kinetic distance constrains deduced rates to reproduce a global property, such as overall in vivo speed. Our method demonstrates predictive power with protein synthesis by ribosomes and can be applied to other biomolecular processes with detailed in vitro kinetics.

**Title:** Estimating Short-Term Mutation and Recombination Rates in Helicobacter pylori: Implications for Understanding Bacterial Evolutionary Processes

**Research Question:** Despite the importance of understanding evolutionary processes in bacteria, our current knowledge is limited, particularly regarding short-term rates of mutation and recombination. This study aimed to estimate short-term mutation and recombination rates in Helicobacter pylori by sequencing 39,300 bp in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates, including 34 sequential pairs sampled at intervals 0.25-10.2 years and single isolates from 29 individuals (average age 45) from 10 families.

**Methods:** We used Approximate Bayesian computation to estimate rates of mutation, recombination, mean recombination tract length, and diversity in tracts. The results indicate short-term mutation rate 1.4×10-6 (isolates) to 4.5×10-6 (family) per nucleotide per year, with three times more substitutions introduced by recombination than mutation. Long-term rate over millennia 5-17 lower due to purifying selection of non-synonymous mutations.

**Findings:** Short-term rates vary dramatically between species, spanning several orders of magnitude, e.g., 4×10-9 per nucleotide per year between Escherichia coli and Salmonella within a universal clock for rRNA sequences. However, the validity of this clock for bacterial evolution is questionable. In contrast, our estimates 1.4×10-6 to 4.5×10- per year for H. pylori are robust over decades. Long-term rate for genetic diversity between H. pyl from global sources over 60,000 years shows parallel changes in diversity between bacteria and hosts. Diversity over time, purifying selection of deleterious non-syn mutations occurs in H. pyl, resulting in d/d ratio 0.07 fold lower in housekeeping genes, agreeing with 5-17 difference in rates.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates short-term clock in H. pylori, assuming uniform prior for evolutionary time separating isolates, lower and upper bounds for family isolates. Sequence data deposited in Helobacter pyl Multi Sequence Typing website. A microevolution model describes evolution of genome over period T.

**Conclusions:** This study provides robust estimates of short-term mutation and recombination rates in H. pylori, challenging current understanding of bacterial evolutionary processes. Short-term rates vary between species, highlighting the need for species-specific estimates. Long-term rates are influenced by purifying selection, emphasizing the importance of accounting for this in evolutionary models.

**Title:** Melanopsin-Based Photoreception Contributes to Thalamocortical Visual Pathways: Implications for Visual Perception in the Absence of Rods and Cones

**Research Question:** Do melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) contribute to conventional visual pathways, and if so, what is their role in visual perception in the absence of rods and cones?

**Methods:** We used reporter lines to map melanin projections to the dorsal geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamocortical projection, and recorded light responses in mice lacking rods and cones (rd/rd). We also used chromatic stimuli to isolate melanin-derived responses in mice with intact visual systems.

**Findings:** Melanin projections are more extensive than previously thought, extending to the LGN, and support physiological responses in LG and cortex in mice lacking rods+cones. We found melanin input to ~40% of LG neurons show sustained activation to light, with irradiance-dependent increases in firing rate. Melanin is required for accurate irradiance encoding, as shown in melanin knockout mice.

**Implications:** Our data establish melanin-based photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamortical system, providing irradiance information and supporting visual responses in the absence of rods+con. This identifies RGCs as a potential origin of aspects of perception and may support vision in retinal degeneration.

**Conclusions:** Melanin photoreceptors, despite being rare (~2,000 per retina), make a disproportionate contribution to visual activity. Our data suggest melanin contributes quality information unavailable from rods and cones to the thalamort pathway. In mice with intact retinas, sustained LG neurons encode irradiance over a wide range, but this is impaired in melanin knockout mice. Melan sets the firing rate of 40% thal neurons according to illumination, implicating it in spatial perception. Melan signals in all LG neurons with sustained response identify it as a player in luminance processes. These findings add to evidence that lighting practices should consider melanin photore requirements.

**Title:** Altered Mucosal Humoral Responses in HIV-1 Infected Individuals: Implications for Intestinal Barrier Function and Inflammation

**Research Question:** Does HIV-1 infection lead to a depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells, resulting in altered humoral responses to antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of systemic and mucosal humoral responses to intestinal microbiota in HIV-1-infected individuals, focusing on IgG, IgA, and IgM responses to antigens from Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Intestinal secretions from antiretroviral-treated HIV-1-infected individuals were also examined.

**Findings:**

* Elevated levels of total and antigen-specific IgM in intestinal secretions
* Reduced IgG/Ig and IgA/Ig ratios of antibodies to microbial and food antigens in intestinal secretions
* Reduced Ig levels to antigens from Proteobacteria and Firmutes in plasma
* Negative correlation between CD4+ T cell count and IgA responses to mucosal antigens

**Implications:**

* Reduced competence of mucosal B cells for class switch recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting capacity to react to changing gut antigens
* Decreased availability of microbi-specific Ig and Ig may contribute to translocation of antigens across intestinal barrier and systemic dissemination, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals

**Conclusions:**

* Altered mucosal humoral responses in HIV-1-infected individuals, characterized by elevated IgM and decreased Ig/Ig and Ig/Ig ratios to microbial and food antigens
* Reduced Ig levels to Proteobacteria and Firmutes antigens in plasma
* Negative correlation between CD4 T cell count and Ig responses to mucosal antigens
* Partial or altered function of CD+ TF and T cells may be responsible for dysregulation of mucosal humoral responses, warranting further investigation
* Low interdependence of Ig responses between intestinal and systemic compartments
* Increased IgM and decreased Ig/Ig and Ig/Ig ratios to mucosal antigens in ART-treated HIV-1 individuals, indicative of lack of help for class recombination
* Altered response to environmental antig by shift from IgA to IgM may promote local inflammation and mucosal damage
* HIV-1 individuals with low CD4 T counts exhibit reduced Ig to Proteacteria and Firmutes antigens
* ART-treated HIV-1 individuals display increased IgM to all mucosal antigens and Ig to food and yeast
* Viral controllers exhibit decreased Ig to mucosal antig compared to ART and untreated

**Title:** Emergent Diversity Waves in Ecosystems: A Novel Mechanism of Population Redistribution Driven by Catastrophes

**Research Question:** How do populations in ecosystems respond to episodic collapses of dominant species, leading to redistribution of resources and emergent diversity waves?

**Methods:** We propose a novel model of population dynamics driven by abrupt reduction in size of a single species, freeing resources for others, relevant to communities with strain collapses caused by bacteriophages or infectious diseases. The emergent dynamics is characterized by cyclic 'diversity' waves triggered by collapses of globally dominating populations, with diversity peaking at the beginning and exponentially decreasing afterwards.

**Findings:** Species abundances exhibit bimodal time-aggregated distribution with lower peaks formed by collapsed or newly introduced species and upper peaks that have not yet collapsed. The self-organized peak structure has long-term memory across waves, giving rise to a scale-free tail of time-aggregated distribution with exponent 1.7. Simulations of variants preserve patterns of collapse-driven dynamics, diversity waves, and broad-ag distribution with scale-free for most species.

**Implications:** The classic definition of fitness in terms of long-term growth rate is inappropriate for our model, as growth is exactly zero. Population dynamics in saturated environments is described by neutral community models with addition of deterministic differences in resource utilization. Our model introduces saturated dynamics exposed to episodic collapses, with collapsed replenished by diffusing individuals from other environments.

**Conclusions:** This study presents a general framework for systems driven by redistribution of limiting resources freed by catastrophes. Population dynamics happens on four timescales: shortest, exponential growth repopulating vacated resources during extinction; intermediate, steady state poised at carrying capacity; longer, diversity waves; and longest, emergent property of system. The trade-off between population growth and diversity is inferred. Our model is robust to variations in rules such as diffusion, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hging strategies.

**Key findings:**

* Emergent diversity waves triggered by collapses of globally dominating populations
* Bimodal time-aggregated distribution of species abundances
* Self-organized peak structure with long memory across waves
* Scale-free tail of time-ag distribution with exponent 1.7
* Robustness to variations in model rules
* Classic fitness definition inappropriate for our model
* Neutral community models with deterministic differences in resource utilization
* Saturated dynamics exposed to episodic collapses

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Mechanism of Chemotaxis in Escherichia coli: Fine-Tuning Tumbling Angles for Enhanced Gradient Navigation

**Research Question:** Can the chemotactic movement of Escheria coli be optimized by fine-tuning tumbling angles based on swimming direction, leading to enhanced gradient navigation?

**Methods:** We used computer simulations to investigate the dependence of tumbling angles on the number of flagellar motors and swimming direction in Escheria coli. We extended a previously published hybrid model of chemotactic E. coli to include tumbling angle dependence on the number of CW-rotating motors and validated the results with experimental data from tracking experiments.

**Findings:** Our simulations revealed that tumbling angles depend on swimming direction, with larger angles when swimming up the gradient and smaller when down. Although the difference in tumbling angles is small, it results in a significant enhancement of cellular velocity along the gradient. This fine-tuning of tumbling is mediated by adjustment of tumbling frequency, which underlies the conventional chemactic strategy of E. coli.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate a new level of optimization in E. coli chemaxis, arising from switching of flagellar motors and fine-tuning tumbling angles. This strategy is likely used by other peritously flagellated bacteria, indicating another level of evolutionary development of chemaxis. We suggest that tuning tumbling depending on swimming direction serves as an additional navigation mechanism for E. coli and other peritously flagellated with chemaxis.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of chemaxis in E. coli, where tumbling angles are fine-tuned based on swimming direction, leading to enhanced gradient navigation. This fineuning is mediated by adjustment of tumbling frequency, which underlies the conventional chemactic strategy. Our findings indicate that optimization of the basic mechanism depends on both the effect of tumbling frequency and number of flagella that reverse tumbling. The small difference in tumbling angles up and down the gradient significantly improves chemactic efficiency of E coli. coli. This study highlights the complexity and adaptability of chemaxis in bacteria, with implications for understanding bacterial behavior and evolution.

**Title:** Stat3 Signaling Plays a Crucial Role in Medullary Thymic Epithelial Cell Development and Homeostasis

**Research Question:** What is the role of Stat3 signaling in the development and maintenance of medull thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) and the medullary region of the thymus?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Stat3 signaling in mTE development and medull region homeasis using constitutively active Stat3 transgenic mice and conditional Stat3 knockout (CKO) mice.

**Findings:** Expression of constitutively active Stat3 in the mTE compartment increased mTE cellularity and bypassed the requirement for positive selection signals from thymocytes to form the medull region. Conversely, conditional deletion of Stat3 disrupted medull architecture and reduced mTE cellularity. Stat signaling did not affect mTE proliferation but promoted survival of immature MHCloCDlo mTE precursors. In contrast, alterations in the mTE compartment did not affect thymic cortical epithelial (TE) cellularity or organization.

**Implications:** These results demonstrate that, in addition to NFκB signaling, Stat3 plays an essential role in regulating mTE cellularity and medull region homeasis. Stat activation promotes mTE survival and is crucial for optimal medull development and homeasis. The presence of phosphorylated Stat in immature MHCloCDlo mTE of steady-state thymi from adult controls suggests Stat signaling may be involved in thym homeasis. The contracted mTE compartment in Stat CK thymi likely accounts for lack of autoimmune manifestations.

**Conclusions:** In addition to NFκ signaling, Stat activation is indispensable for medull formation and mTE homeasis. Targeting constitutively active Stat to the mTE compartment increased m cellularity and expanded the thic medulla. Conditional deletion of Stat in mTE reduced cellularity and impaired medull formation. Moreover, Stat activation is required for mTE survival, not proliferation, and may play a role in differentiation. The contrasting outcomes of enforcing or preventing Stat signaling in mTE reveal Stat plays a key role in medull formation and mTE maintenance.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Non-Coding RNAs in Clostridium difficile Pathogenesis: A Genome-Wide Identification and Functional Characterization of Small RNAs

**Research Question:** What is the role of noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) in Clostrid difficile physiology and pathogenesis, and how do they regulate gene expression in this emergent enteropathogen?

**Methods:** We employed an in silico approach to identify 511 sRNA candidates in intergenic and coding regions of C. difficile genome. Parallel RNA-seq and 5-end RNA-seq were used to globally identify C sRNAs and their transcription start sites at three growth conditions: exponential phase, stationary phase, and starvation.

**Findings:** 251 putative sRNAs were identified, including 94 transregulators in intergenic regions, 91-cisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 sRN was confirmed by gene-specific approaches. Some sRN, including antisense involved in C autolytic activity, showed growth-dependent profiles. 16 c-di-G-responsive ribwitches were expressed, and their regulatory role in motility and biofilm formation was demonstrated. Abundant sRN encoded by C CRIS loci may be crucial for C survival in phage-rich gut.

**Implications:** This first genome-wide identification of C sRNAs provides basis for future characterization and molecular mechanisms of sRNA regulation in emergentopath. Discovery of novel sRN emphasizes diversity in Clostridia and importance of RNA-based mechanisms during infection cycle. Presence of functional ribwitches suggests use of 5-cis-R elements for rapid response.

**Conclusions:** This study provides first comprehensive understanding of C difficile sRN and their role in pathogenesis. Identified sRN are unique to C difficile and associated with its physiopathology. Further work is needed to detect and catalogue regulatory RN in other Clostrial species. Conservation of sRN among C difficile strains highlights their importance in bacterium.

**Title:** Hepatitis C Virus Core Protein Downregulates Liver-Specific MicroRNA-122 by Inhibiting Non-Canonical Poly(A) Polymerase Activity

**Research Question:** How does the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein regulate the expression of liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122), a crucial for liver development and metabolism, and viral life cycle?

**Methods:** We employed high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biops and biochemistry assays to investigate the molecular mechanism of mi-122 regulation by HCV infection.

**Findings:** HCV core protein downregulates mi-122 by promoting its destabilization via inhibition of GL-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. Decrease in mi-122 resulted in dysregulation of its functions, including proviral activity for HCV. We found 22-nt prototype mi-122 modified at 3' end by 3'-non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. Remarkably, proportion mi-122 bearing single nucleotide tail ribonucle decreased in liver from patients HCV. Single-nucle-tailed mi-122 displayed increased mi activity and stability over 22-nt prototype mi-122, catalyzed by unique nucleotyl transfer activity of GL-2. HCV protein inhibited GL-2, interaction with GL-2 in cytoplasm responsible for mi- downregulation.

**Implications:** Our results provide new insights into regulatory role HCV protein controlling RNA and mi-122 functions through mi- stability modulation. Inhibition GL-2 by HCV protein affects multiple miRN, including mi-122, decreasing proportion mono-adenyl isomers. Deep sequencing RNAs from liverops revealed among top 50 expressed miRN, six exhibited decrease 3-end adenylated isomers upon H infection.

**Conclusions:** HCV core protein inhibits mi-122 expression by destabilizing GL-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymer. Decrease in mi-122 results dysregulates its functions, including proviral activity H. HCV core protein specifically inhibits GL-2, interaction with GL- in cytoplasm responsible for mi- downregulation. Our results provide new insights into regulatory HCV protein controlling RNA and mi- functions through mi stability modulation.

**Title:** Acquired Immunity to Trypanosomes in African Lions: Implications for Trypanosomiasis Control

**Research Question:** Can acquired immunity to Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T. brucei) infection be observed in wild lions, and if so, what are the implications for trypanosomias control?

**Methods:** We investigated the prevalence of T. brucei infection in African lions in relation to exposure to other Trypanosoma species, including Trypanosoma congolense sensu lato (T. cong) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T. rhodes).

**Findings:** We found a distinct decrease in prevalence of T. bruce infection in lions consistent with acquired immunity following exposure to T. cong, a causative agent of human sleeping sickness. T. rhodes disappears by 6 years of age in response to cross-immunity from other trypanosomes, including non-pathogenic subspecies T. bruce.

**Implications:** These findings suggest novel pathways for vaccinations against trypanosomias, despite the complex antigenic surface proteins of these parasites. Lions are ideal candidates for acquired immunity due to co-infection with multiple trypan species and frequent exposure through tset bites.

**Conclusions:** This is the first epidemiological evidence of acquired immunity to trypan in any species. Acquired immunity against T cong allows lions to clear T. bruce infections by 3-5 years and eliminate T. rhodes by 6 years. Frequent exposure accelerates onset and extent of immunity, thus prevalence should be lowest in high-tse areas, as seen in Fig. 2 for T br in woodlands compared to plains and lower T. rhodes in regions like Uganda where cattle are a major reservoir of human infection.

**Title:** Mechanistic Mathematical Modeling and Sensitivity Analysis of the Coagulation Cascade: Identifying Fragile Mechanisms as Therapeutic Targets

**Research Question:** Can computationally derived points of fragility in mechanistic models of human coagulation cascades be used as a rational basis for therapeutic target selection despite uncertainty?

**Methods:** We employed mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis to explore this hypothesis using a well-studied coagulation cascade model composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, validated with 21 published datasets from different in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin profiles in the presence and absence of anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across trials. Sensitivity coefficients, measuring robustness or fragility of mechanisms, were calculated using Monte Carlo strategy.

**Findings:** In the absence of anticoulants, factor Xa and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found fragile, while IXa and VVIIIa activation and activity were robust. Anti-Xa and thrombin inhibitors, classes of anticoagulants, are FDA-approved for prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and initial treatment deep venous thromosis pulmonary embolism. In vitro and vivo evidence supports prediction IXa robustness.

**Implications:** These results support our hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility in human coag cascades can be used as a basis for target selection despite uncertainty. Despite parametric and structural uncertainty, the model captured bulk thrombin dynamics from TF-Va-initiated coag in presence absence anticoul. Challenges remain before model relevance in vivo: pro- and antiplatelet mechanisms on endothelium should be refined included, and robust IX mechanisms explored in vivo or cell-based assays.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of mechanistic modeling and sensitivity analysis in identifying fragile mechanisms as therapeutic targets in coagulation. The model, developed from literature, is the first to describe all 21 datasets, coupled plate and thrombin activation three antico, with minimal parameter variation. Sensitive elements of coag architecture were determined by OSS, gauging influence on thrombin formation. Large OSS values indicate fragility, small robustness.

**Title:** Investigating the Kinetics of Phage-Bacteria Interactions for Effective Phage Therapy: A Combined Experimental and Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** How do bacteriophages interact with Campylobacterium jejuni, a foodborne pathogen, in vitro, and what are the implications for phage therapy?

**Methods:** We employed a combined experimental and modeling approach to investigate the kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions using a virulent phage against C. jejuni in an in vitro system. Ph-insensitive populations of C. jej arose, the first phage study to test in vitro data for ph-bacteria interactions incorporating ph-insensitive bacteria.

**Findings:** Our results show that a simple model fits the data surprisingly well, confirming the importance of inundation and proliferation thresholds in phage therapy. We estimated thresholds and rate constants directly from time series data, revealing culture-dependent features of ph infectivity worthy of further investigation.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates how empirical insights can be enhanced by kinetic models. Combined in vitro studies are essential for building a meaningful picture of phage properties in vivo.

**Conclusions:** Although simple models may not capture all aspects of ph-bacteria interactions, they should provide accurate predictions, such as inund and proliferation thresholds, for ph therapy design. A theoretical framework for non-linear properties of ph as "self-replic pharmaceuticals" is needed. We tested a PKD model ph-bacteria in vitro for C. jej and a virulent ph, highlighting the necessity of testing models in vitro for understanding PKD theory in vivo. Our results illustrate the importance of threshold-based understanding ph-b interactions for ph therapy, where partially-resistant cells may cause population resurgence.

**Title:** Identification and Functional Characterization of a Toll-Like Receptor in the Snail Biomphalaria glabr that Regulates Schistosoma mansoni Infection

**Research Question:** What is the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the snail Biomalaria glabr's immune response to Schistoma mansoni infection?

**Methods:** We conducted a comparative proteomic analysis of snail surface proteins between susceptible and resistant strains of B. glabr to Sch. mansoni and identified a TLR-like protein, which we named BTL. We used siRNA oligonucleotides to knockdown BTL in resistant snails and challenged them with S. mansoni.

**Findings:** Expression of BTL was significantly increased in resistant snails challenged with S. mansoni, but not in susceptible snails. Knockdown of BTL in resistant snails resulted in increased susceptibility to S. mansoni infection.

**Implications:** Our study provides the first functional characterization of a gastropod TLR and demonstrates that BTL plays a crucial role in regulating S. mansoni infection in B. glabr.

**Conclusions:** BTL is an important snail immune receptor that influences the outcome of S. mansoni infection. This study contributes to understanding the molecular basis of sn-schosome interactions, a key to developing disease prevention and control strategies.

**Title:** Detection of IgG Antibodies against Aedes Mosquito Saliva Proteins as a Biomarker of Human Exposure to Mosquito Bites in French Polynesia

**Research Question:** Can IgG antibodies against Aedes mosquito saliva proteins be used as a biomarker of human exposure to mosquito bites in French Polynes, where Aedes aegypt and Aedes polensis are primary vectors of infectious diseases?

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in Tahiti and Moore islands, where Aedes aegpt and Aedes polensis are present, and a cohort of people from metropolitan France, not exposed to these mosquitoes. ELISA was used to detect and quantify IgG against salivary gland extracts (S) of Aedes aegpt and Aedes polensis in human sera.

**Findings:** 98% and 68% of individuals in Tahiti and Moore islands had IgG against Aedes aeg and Aedesensis S, respectively, while 97% of metropolitan individuals had no Ig against S of either species. Analysis of cohorts from different entomological contexts showed no cross-reactivity between Aedes aeg and Aedes S.

**Implications:** Ig response to saliv gland extracts is a valid biomarker of human exposure to Aedes aeg and Aedes bites. This immuno-epidological tool will enhance understanding of exposure to mosquito bites, identify areas of high disease transmission risk, and evaluate efficacy of vector control strategies in Pacific and tropical settings.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that Ig antibodies against Aedes saliva proteins can be used as biomarker of human exposure to mosquito bites in French Polynes, where Aedes aeg and Aedes are primary vectors of infectious diseases. This immunoepidological tool will facilitate understanding of exposure to mosquito bites, identify areas of high disease transmission, and evaluate efficacy of vector control strategies in Pacific and tropical settings.

**Title:** Metabolic Manipulation of Host Cells by Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A Key to Pathogenic Success**

**Research Question:** How does Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) adapt to the intracellular environment of macrophages, and does this adaptation require interference with the host cell's metabolic machinery?

**Methods:** Temporal profiling of metabolic flux in cells infected with virulent mycobacterial strains revealed that Mtb indeed manipulates host metabolism. Subsequent analysis identified key host reactions targeted by the pathogen, aiming to integrate macrophage survival with mycobacterial sustenance.

**Findings:** Our study demonstrates that Mtb's pathogenicity is linked to its capacity to regulate host cell metabolism, controlled at the level of cell metabolism, impacting disease pathology. Resolution of pathogenic strategies employed by M was aided by a panel of mycobacterial strains with manifold virulence traits. We found that glucose levels contribute to pathogenicity by influencing macrophage apoptosis, revealing an additional facet to the relationship between glycemic status and TB susceptibility.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that metabolic intervention dictates TB pathology, supporting a reevaluation of existing paradigms for understanding M pathogenicity. Highlighting host immunity as a determinant of disease susceptibility, our results may lead to effective vaccine development or description of correlates of protection.

**Conclusions:** M's success as a pathogen stems from facile adaptation to intracellular milieu of macrophages, requiring interference with host metabolic machinery. Temporal profiling of metabolic flux in infected cells with virulent mycobacterial strains confirmed this, identifying key host reactions targeted by the pathogen. Integration of macrophage survival with mycob sustenance was goal of regulation, converging host and pathogen factors in determinants of pathogenicity. Glycemic status of individual impacts innate defense controlling M infection, while virulence of infecting strain contributes to pathology.

**Title:** Crossover and Chiasma Formation Ensure Proper Segregation of Homologous Chromosomes during Meiosis: ZHP-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans Ortholog of the Yeast ZIP3 Gene, is Required for Recombination

**Research Question:** How do homologous chromosomes segregate properly during meiotic division in Caenorhabditis elegans, and what is the role of the ZHP-3 protein in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the localization and function of Z-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the yeast ZIP3 gene, during meiotic recombination. We used a Z-3::GFP transgene to visualize the protein's localization and behavior during meiotic prophase. We also examined the effects of Z-3 mutations on meiotic segregation and chromosome structure.

**Findings:** Z-3 localizes dynamically along the synaptonemal complex (SC) at a key point in meiotic prophase, shifting to asymmetrically on the SC and eventually to foci marking crossover events. The Z-3::G transgene partially complements a null mutation, promoting wild-type levels of recombination but high aneuploidy among progeny, indicating defects in meiotic segregation. The bivalent structure is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting segregation defects result from inability to remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that Z-3 coordinates crossover with SC disassembly and bivalent formation, a conserved role of Zip3/Z-3 in coupling recombination with SC morphogenesis. This contrasts with S. cerevisiae, where ZIP3 couples recombination with SC assembly. We propose that coordination of crossover with SC disassembly and bivalent formation reflects a conserved function of Zip3/Z-3 in coupling recombination with SC morphogenesis.

**Conclusions:** Z- is the first protein to mark crosso in C. elegans, and its localization to sites of recombination during meiosis provides a valuable tool for analyzing meiotic events in this organism. Our study highlights the importance of Z- in ensuring proper segregation of homolog chromosomes during meiosis, and its conserved role in recombination with SC morphogenesis. Further investigation of Z- and SUMO targets on meiotic chromosomes will refine our understanding of chromosome remodeling during reciprocal exchange.

**Title:** Investigating the Eco-Environmental Factors Affecting Aedes albopictus Abundance in Metropolitan and Suburban Areas of Rome, Italy: Implications for Public Health and Control Measures

**Research Question:** What are the eco-climatic and socio-environmental factors affecting Aedes albictus abundance in metropolitan and sub-urban areas of Rome, Italy, and how do these factors shape its microgeographic dynamics?

**Methods:** A longitudinal monitoring study was conducted along a 70-km transect across the most urbanized and densely populated metropolitan area of Rome, Italy, colonized by Aedes albict in 1997. Two fine spatiotemporal datasets were used to analyze the effect of climatic and socioenvironmental variables on Aedes albict abundance: a 20m circular buffer around sticky traps and a 300 circular within sampling sites.

**Findings:** Aedes albict abundance was associated with anthropized habitats in both metropolitan and sub-urban areas, with "green" islands" corresponding to hotspots in metropolitan areas, and bimodal dynamics with a peak in autumn due to heavy rains and permissive temperatures. Vegetation increase in 300m buffer was negatively associated with mosquito abundance in both environments.

**Implications:** The study highlights the importance of prioritizing public control measures in urban areas with high human-mos contact and arbovirus transmission risk, and potential health risks after summer months with high densities.

**Conclusions:** The study provides insights into the complex relationship between landscape composition and Aedes albict abundance in temperate Southern Europe, underscoring the need for targeted control measures to mitigate nuisance and disease transmission.

**Methods:** We generated Mtb mutants lacking genes involved in DIM biosynthesis and demonstrated that DIM participate in receptor-mediated phagocytosis of M and prevention of phagosome acidification. Experiments with cholesterol-depleting drugs abolished differences in phagocyt efficiency and phosome acidification between wild-type and mutant strains. Insertion of a cholesterol probe in living cells showed polarity of membrane hydrophobic core changed upon contact with M, while lateral diffusion was unaffected.

**Findings:** We propose that DIM control invasion of macroph by M by targeting lipid organization in host membrane, modifying its biophysical properties. DIM-induced changes in lipid favor receptor-mediated phocytosis of M and control phosome pH driving bacilli in a protective niche.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate need for DIM in receptor phagocytosis of M, targeting uptake rather than adhesion, and show effect not restricted to specific receptor. Plasma cholesterol involved in bacterial entry and concentration critical for DIM role in phocytosis M. We propose effect mediated by direct modification host plasma membrane. Changes in M plasma membrane composition by cholesterol depletion or nystatin affected phocyt and phosome in similar to DIM elimination from M envelope. Involvement in decrease plasma core following binding mycobacteria.

**Conclusions:** DIM modify host membrane lipid organization, favoring receptor-mediated phagocytosis of M and controlling phosome pH driving bacilli in a protective niche. Further studies on role in phagosomes containing M required, as data indicate WT and mutant accumulated phag with low lysosomal marker CD63. DIM deficiency did not affect ability to replicate in human macro, previously observed murine.

**Title:** Unveiling the Hidden Dynamics of Small Neural Networks: A Novel Analysis of Mesoscopic Neural Circuits with Spontaneous Symmetry-Breaking

**Research Question:** How do small neural networks composed of tens of neurons behave differently from their mean-field approximations, and what are the implications for understanding neural dynamics at intermediate scales?

**Methods:** We developed a systematic analysis of the dynamics of arbitrarily small networks of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing neurons using an analytically tractable approach, numerically determining global bifurcations. We studied local bifurcations of neural activity and found that strong inhibition gives rise to complex dynamics through spontaneous symmetry-breaking, revealing qualitative differences between mesoscopic circuits and mean-field approximations.

**Findings:** Our results show that spontaneous symmetry-breaking enables mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, reducing detrimental effects of noise on information processing. We found qualitative differences with mean-field approximations when systems have strong inhibitory weights, undergoing a pitchfork bifurcation with multiple solutions emerging on new branches, enriching bifurcation diagram complexity.

**Implications:** This work advances mathematical methodology for studying dynamics of networks of few neurons, a lower bound of mesoscopic scale. Our analysis extends previous work by Beer, who studied bifurcations with highly symmetric weights and asymptotic approximations, while most literature focuses on 2-4 neuron networks. We derive exact bifcation manifolds with less constraints on synaptic weights, considering finite-size firing-rate model with excitatory and inhibitory populations.

**Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the importance of spontaneous symmetry-breaking in mesoscopic networks, enabling regulation of functional heterogeneity and reducing noise effects on information processing. This qualitative change in dynamics is a finite-size effect, revealing previously unexplored differences between cortical circuits and mean-field approximations. This work paves the way for understanding neural dynamics at intermediate scales, crucial for understanding brain function and disease.

**Title:** Detection of Viable Leishmania Parasites in Extralesional Sites of Dermal Leishias Patients using Leish 7RNA Amplification

**Research Question:** The clinical and epidemiological significance of Leishmania DNA in extraional sites is obscured by uncertainty whether the DNA derives from viable parasites. To examine the dissemination of Leish during disease and potential human infection transmission, Leish 7RNA was exploited to establish viability and estimate parasite burden in extraional sites of dermal leishias patients.

**Methods:** Monocytes, tonsil swabs, and skin aspirates of 28 cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishias patients were screened by DNA amplification/Southern blot. Positive samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR Leish 7RNA genes transcripts. 7RNA amplification coincided luciferase activity, confirming parasite viability.

**Findings:** Of 22 patients presenting DNA extraional samples, Leish 7RNA genes or transcripts were detected in one or more DNA samples 100% and 73%, respectively. Gene transcript number amplified extraional tissues comparable lesions.7RNA detected 13/19 (68%) monocytes, 5/12 (42%) tonsil sw, 4/11 (36%) normal aspir, and 22/25 (88%) lesions. Viable parasites present extraional sites, including monocytes, tons, and skin dermal leishias patients.

**Implications:** Leish 7RNA is an informative target for clinical and epidemi investigations human leishias. The correlation copy number 7RNA transcripts with dose-dependent parasite viability response Glucime substantiates validity this target marker viability. Although Leish occasionally isolated blood or aspir normal skin patients dermalishias, conventional parasit methods inefficient low sensitivity.

**Conclusion:** Leish viability, parasite burden extraional tissues established amplification 7 genes transcripts. During dermalishias, viable Leish present monocytes, tons, and skin, demonstrating dissemination infection triggering pathogenesis.7RNA amplification revealed presence Leish one extraional tissues 100 (22/22) patients presenting DNA. Ampl transcripts confirmed viability extraional samples 16/ (73) patients.7RNA most detected monocytes 13 (68%), tons sw 5 (42%), healthy aspir 4 (36%).

**Title:** Combinatorial Histone Modifications and Chromatin Binding Proteins Predict DNA Replication Timing in Drosophila

**Research Question:** How do combinations of histone modifications (HMs) and chromatin binding proteins (CBPs) contribute to the regulation of DNA replication timing in Dophila?

**Methods:** We analyzed a comprehensive collection of 95 CBPs and HMs using quantitative models to investigate their combinatorial potential for predicting DNA replication timing in Doph.

**Findings:** Our results show that combinations of CBPs exhibit moderate predictive power for replication, while pairwise interactions between H lead to accurate genome-wide predictions that can be further improved by CB. Independent feature importance analysis led to a simplified, biologically interpretable model of the relationship between chromatin landscape and replication, reaching 80% of full accuracy using 6 terms. Pairwise HMs predict differential replication across cell types.

**Implications:** Our work supports the existence of combinator HM for DNA replication and cell-type independent elements, whose investigation might elucidate the regulatory mode of this fundamental process.

**Conclusions:** Combinations of HMs and their interactions are key to accurate predictions, suggesting combinator HM might contribute to regulation of DNA timing. A genome-wide replication profile was generated by tiling and investigated individual predictive power of 95 chrom features, including 28 HMs and 65 CB in Doph S cells. Results indicate combinations H allow cell-independent description between timing and chrom. We investigated relevance of combinator patterns for replication in Doph using Lasso. Our goal was to predict timing across Doph S genome. We considered 2 unique promoters for learning. Several reported initiation associated with transcription units and common motifs. Proposed as regulatory chrom-templ processes and investigated transcription, this has not been demonstrated for replication. Work by Eaton et al tightened between chrom features and timing showing clusters predictive early activity and changes Doph.

**Title:** Investigating the Spatial Dynamics of Dengue Virus Serotypes 1, 2, and 3 in Brazil: A Phylogeographic and Epidemiological Analysis

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the spatial dynamics of deng virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 in Brazil by applying a phylogeographic framework to complete genome sequences, examining the introduction, establishment, and drivers of deng virus spread in the country.

**Methods:** A total of 178 Brazilian genome sequences were used to determine the factors underlying deng virus dispersal on a nationwide scale using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLM) diffusion model. Candidate predictors of viral spread included geographic distances, air traffic data, Aedes aegypti infestation densities, human densities, and spatial area of each location at a regional level (k=5).

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the introduction of new lineages occurred within 7-10 year intervals. Lineages were most likely imported from the Caribbean to North and Northeast regions of Brazil, then dispersed at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day. Joint analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological, and ecological data suggests aerial transportation of humans/or mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypt infestation or geographical distances determine deng virus spread in Brazil.

**Implications:** Our investigation of deng serotypes 1-3 spatiotemporal dispersal indicates distinct introductions coirculation of ser and genotypes, highlights the impact air fluxes in spread DENV within Brazil, and introduction new lineages followed epizoot amplifications 7-10 cycles. We cannot discern relative transport infected humans or mosquitoes in this model. Results genetic and demographic patterns concur epidemiological data, indicating periodic deng ser-specific peaks incidence coincide introduction line Brazil 7-10 years.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the importance of phyloge approach in understanding deng virus dynamics, highlighting the role aerial transportation humans/or vectors in spread. Our findings have significant implications for public health policy, surveillance, and prevention strategies in tropical/subtropical regions.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Receptive Field Structure in Correlated Activity between Pyramidal Neurons across Parallel Sensory Maps

**Research Question:** How do differences in antagonistic center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across parallel sensory maps influence correlations between activities of electrosens pyram neurons?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of mathematical modeling and in vivo electrophysiological recordings to investigate the effects of RF structure on correlated activity between pyram neurons across three parallel ELL maps.

**Findings:** Contrary to our initial predictions, in vivo recordings revealed identical levels of correlation between pyram neuron activities across all three segments. To explain this surprising result, we incorporated the effects of antagonistic center-surround RF organization into our model. By systematically varying RF size and gain, we found multiple structures gave rise to similar correlations. Incorporating anatomical differences in RF between maps in our model resulted in similar correlation levels.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that RF overlap alone does not determine correlations, which has significant implications for understanding how structure influences neural activity.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to systematically quantify and compare correlations between pyram neurons across all three ELL. Our results demonstrate that RF structure plays a crucial role in correlated activity, contrary to previous studies focusing on spiking nonlinearity. By understanding RF organization in sensory systems with well-characterized structure, we gain insight into how structure influences neural correlations.

**Key Findings:**

* In vivo recordings showed identical levels of correlation between pyram neuron activities across three segments
* Incorporating antagonistic center-surround RF in model resulted in similar correlations
* Multiple RF structures gave rise to identical correlations
* Anatomical differences in RF between maps resulted in similar correlations
* Sign and magnitude of correlations determined by relative positively and negatively correlated inputs

**Significance:** This study contributes to understanding neural code, a long-standing problem in neuroscience. Our findings have implications for understanding how sensory information is encoded and behavior.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Noise Correlations on Population Coding in Neural Systems: Unifying Theorems and Insights

**Research Question:** How do correlations between neurons impact the ability of a population to encode a stimulus in the presence of noise?

**Methods:** We considered a general mathematical setup to investigate how coding performance varies as a function of correlations between neurons, while keeping other aspects of the problem, such as tuning curves and heterogeneity, fixed.

**Findings:**

1. **Sign Rule (SR):** We proved that if correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs to their signal correlations, coding will improve compared to the independent case. This holds for different metrics of performance and arbitrary levels of heterogeneity.
2. **Diversity of Correlations:** We showed that diverse correlation structures can improve coding, violating the SR, as experimentally observed. Optimal structures lie on the boundaries of possible correlations.
3 **Conditions for Good Coding:** Provided a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for performance in noise to be as good as without noise.

**Implications:**

Our results provide insights into the problem of population coding, making no assumptions about shapes or heterogeneity of neural curves or responses. We illustrated two regimes with distinct properties of noise leading to optimal coding. Theorem 1 shows SR holds for pairwise and heterogeneous populations. We identified conditions for chosen correlations to yield performance as good as deterministic responses. For large populations, these conditions are satisfied with high probability, and the set of such matrices is high-dimensional.

**Conclusions:**

Our work unifies the role of noise correlations in population coding, providing theorems and numerical examples with diverse tuning curves. We generalize previous results, proving SR holds for different metrics and levels of heterogeneity. We show diverse correlations can improve coding, violating SR, as observed experimentally. Optimal structures lie on the boundaries of possible correlations. Conditions for good performance in noise are necessary and sufficient, satisfied with high probability for large populations. Our results provide insights into the problem of population coding, making no assumptions about neural curves or responses.

**Title:** Interspecies Interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus Impact Antibiotic Susceptibility in Polymicrobial Infections**

**Research Question:** How does the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aerugin) influence the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aure) to bactericidal antibiotics in polymicrobial infections?

**Methods:** We investigated the impact of P. aerugin on S. aure antibiotic susceptibility using a panel of P. aerugin isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) lung and burn wounds, as well as laboratory strains PA1 and PA14. We measured bactericidal activity of 3 antibiotics against S. aure in the presence of supernatants from 12 P. aerugin isolates and examined how P. aer-secreted exoproducts affect S. aure susceptibility to killing.

**Findings:** We found that P. aerugin alters S. aure susceptibility to bacteridal antibiotics in a variable, strain-dependent manner and identified 3 interactions responsible for antagonizing or potentiating antibiotic activity against S aure. aure. Specifically, P. aerugin Las endopeptase potentiates S aure vancom killing, rhamolids facilitate protonotive-independent vancom uptake, and 2-hepty-4-hydroquin Noxide (HQ) induces multidrug tolerance in S aure through respiratory inhibition and reduction of cellular ATP. Production of each factor varies between isolates corresponds to capacity to alter S aure antibiotic susceptibility.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that antibiotic susceptibility is complex and dependent not only on genotype of pathogen targeted but also on interactions with microorganisms in environment. Considering these interactions will improve treatment of polymicrobial infections.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of deciphering interspecies interactions to improve antibiotic treatment of polymicrobial infections. We demonstrate that vancom treatment of S aure burn infection is potentiated by presence of Las-producing P aerugin population. Our data represent first evidence of P aerugin altering S aure susceptibility in vivo and underscore the need to consider interspecies interactions in treatment of polymicrobial infections.

**Title:** Mechanism of Thrombocytopenia in Dengue Virus Infection: Excessive VWF Binding and Neuraminidase-Mediated Platelet Desial

**Background:** Thrombocytopenia and plate dysfunction are common complications of deng virus (DENV) infection, contributing to bleeding and plasma leakage. The etiology of deng-associated thrombocytopenia is multifactorial, including increased platelet clearance mechanisms such as coagulation protein von Wille factor (VWF) binding and sial acid desylation. However, whether these mechanisms contribute to thrombocytopenia in deng infection is unknown.

**Research Question:** Do excessive VWF binding and neuraminase-mediated platelet desial contribute to thrombocopenia in deng infection?

**Methods:** Two observational studies were conducted in adult patients with deng in Bandung and Jep, Indonesia. In study 1, plasma VWF antigen and active VWF concentrations were measured, and platelet-VWF binding was assessed. In study 2, sialic levels were determined using Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maack amureis lectin II (MAL-II). Neuraminidase activity was assessed in plasma and transferrin.

**Findings:** Patients with deng had higher plasma VWF and active V concentrations, and platelets bound more V to their membrane. Plate-VWF correlated with plate count. Sial levels were reduced in deng patients. Neuraminase activity was not detectable in deng plasma, and desial was not found in transferr. Plate sial was not altered by in vitro exposure to DENV nonstructural 1 or DENV. In contrast, VWF binding to glycoprotein 1 using V-activ protein resulted in neuridase-mediated plate desial.

**Implications:** Excessive V binding to platelets in deng results in neuraminase-mediated plate desial and clearance. Oseltiv, a neuridase inhibitor, may be a treatment option for severe thromocytopenia deng.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates a new mechanism of plate clearance and thromocytopen in deng infection. Release of V by endothelial cells results in excessive V binding to platelets, leading to loss of sial acid. We show for the first time that deng is associated with increased V binding to circulating platelets, inversely related to plate number. We also show that circulating platelets deng have lost sial acid, without increased sialase activity. V binding to platelets is the likely mechanism underlying desial in deng infection.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Bidirectional Promoters in Gene Regulation and Their Association with Cancer

**Research Question:** What is the relationship between bidirectional promoters and cancer, particularly in somatic cancers such as breast and ovarian cancer?

**Methods:** We employed a comprehensive analysis of spliced expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to identify the complete collection of human transcripts under the control of bidirectional promoters. Rigorous screening of spliced data revealed new bidirectional promoters functioning as alternative or novel promoters. We used microarray expression data from 79 human tissues to verify regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters.

**Findings:** We found a significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancer, including substantial genes in breast and ovarian cancer. Repeated use of this structure in the genome suggests regulation of co-expression among groups of genes. Subsets of promoters contain combinations of transcription factor sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS binding sites ER2, FCD, and BR2. Interpreting regulation of genes in co-expression, especially in cancer, is a step toward defining molecular events contributing to disease.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that bidirectional promoters may play a pivotal role in cancer development through misregulation, especially when containing common transcription binding sites. These sites are candidates for a general mechanism explaining regulatory disruptions at bidirectional in cancer. Experimental data confirmed expression of flanking transcripts for 91%, 58%, and 65% of promoters in Genes, mRNA, and EST datasets, respectively. Enrichment of bidirectional with DNA repair genes implies a link to cancer pathways.

**Conclusions:** Our findings indicate an association between bidirectional and somatic cancer, with type relevant to cancer. We examined bid promoters with genes in uter and ovarian cancers. Expression-clustering analysis suggested bid should not be classified as one regulatory network nor divided into thousands of pairs. Intermediate relationships exist between two extremes, as shown in ovarian cancer genes. One or both members of pair had significant with genes regulated by bidirectional promoters.

**Title:** Unveiling the Hidden Diversity of Sex Chromosome Configurations in Diptera: A Whole-Genome Analysis Reveals Extensive Variation in Sex Karyotypes

**Research Question:** What is the extent of sex chromosome variation among Diptera species, and how have sex chromosomes evolved in these insects?

**Methods:** We conducted a whole-genome analysis of 37 species belonging to 22 families of Diptera, including Drosophila melanogaster, to uncover hidden diversity in sex chromosome karyotypes.

**Findings:** We identified over a dozen sex configurations, with the small chromosome repeatedly used as the sex chromosome, reflecting the ancestral karyotype of Diptera. Some species have undifferentiated sex chromosomes, while others replaced the dot as sex chromosome or incorporated up to three chromosomal elements into sex. Transcript analysis shows dosage compensation evolved through upregulation of single X in males, with X chromosomes deficient in genes with male-bi expression.

**Implications:** Our study reveals a striking diversity of sex configurations in Dipt, concealed by superficially similar karyotypes, indicating sex chromosomes have been lost, gained, rearranged, or replaced multiple times in Dipt evolution. Data suggest Dipt ancestrally had homomorphic chromosomes, with the dot becoming sex in crane flies and higher Dipt, or the dot ancestral chromosome reverting to autosomal in mosquitoes and sand flies. Higher Dipt show diverse sex kary.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide a rich resource for studying sex biology in a comparative manner, showing similar forces shaped unique sex chromosomes in diverse taxa. Future studies of high-quality genomes and transcriptomes of species with independently sex chromosomes will reveal mutational routes X chromosomes demasculized.

**Title:** Investigating the Association between Zika Virus (ZIK) Infection and Microcephaly in the United States: A Retrospective Study

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the association between Zika virus (ZIK) infection and microcephaly in the United States by analyzing archived blood samples from mothers who gave birth to babies with microaly and those who gave birth to healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009 and 2012.

**Methods:** Blood samples from six mothers who gave birth to babies with microaly and 12 who gave birth to healthy babies were tested for the presence of ZIK IgM and IgG antibodies using commercially available human ZIK IgM and IgG ELISA kits.

**Findings:** Blood from one mother who delivered a baby with microaly tested positive for ZIK IgM antibody (16.6%) and from three tested positive for ZIK IgG (50%). ZIK showed a trend significance with microaly. ZIg positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those who were negative for ZIg (OR=11.0, 95% CI=0.8-147.9, p=0.083). Similarly, ZIM positive mothers were also more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those who were negative for ZIM (OR=6.8, 95 CI=0.2-195.1).

**Implications:** These findings provide further evidence of a link between Z infection and microaly and suggest the presence of Z cases and microaly in the United States as early as 2009. The study highlights the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of Z infection in pregnant women to prevent microaly.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between Z and microaly in the United States. The results suggest that Z positive mothers are more likely to deliver babies with micro than those who are negative. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the mechanisms underlying the association between Z and micro.

**Title:** Investigating the Transmission of Mycobacterium ulcerans Infection through Water Sources in Endemic Communities in Ghana: A VNTR Typing Study**

**Research Question:** What is the mode of transmission of Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infection, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), in endemic communities in Ghana, and can Variable Number Tand Repeat (VN) typing be used to track infections to specific water sources?

**Methods:** Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four endemic communities in the Ashanti region, Ghana, and VN loci in the A99 genome were used to genotype MU isolates from 14 confirmed BU patients in the same area. Polymorphism was confirmed by sequencing.

**Findings:** MU was present in three types of water bodies, significantly higher in biofilm samples. Four genotypes, W, X, Y, and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples, while other genotypes were only found in water. A mouse with characteristic BU lesion was identified, confirmed as MU infection.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest patients may have been infected from community water bodies, and that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. Transmission could involve routes where humans contact environments, compounded by water acting as vehicles for disseminating strains.

**Conclusions:** VN typing is a useful tool for differentiating MU from other Mycolone producing Mycobacteria (MPM). Deciphering genetic relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates is crucial for determining reservoirs, vectors, and transmission. This study demonstrates that patients may be infected from local water sources, serving as reservoirs and vehicles for MU and MPM dissemination.

**Title:** Global Patterns of Alien Species Richness in Birds: Unveiling the Role of Colonization Pressure and Environmental Drivers

**Research Question:** What drives the global distribution of alien species richness in birds, and how do anthropogenic and environmental factors interact to shape the introduction and persistence of alien species in different regions?

**Methods:** We analyzed a comprehensive database of 27,723 records for 971 alien bird species worldwide, combining information on colonization pressure, abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic variables to identify the determinants of alien species richness.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that colonization pressure is a key driver of alien species richness, with areas of high native species richness resistant to colonization at the global scale. Colonization is largely driven by European (mainly British) colonialism, but recent introductions involve more species and countries, driven by increasing economic activity. Environmental factors also play a role, with native and alien richness positively associated.

**Implications:** Our results highlight the ongoing threats to global environments from species introductions and emphasize the importance of colonization pressure in understanding alien species richness. Regions with high species richness are resistant to colonization, suggesting conservation efforts should focus on preventing introductions.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first global analysis of determinants of alien species richness accounting for colonization pressure, using birds as a model system. Our findings demonstrate that colonization is a major driver of alien species richness, with regions of high species richness resistant to colonization at the global scale. Environmental factors also play a role, with native and alien richness positively associated.

**Title:** Essential Role of Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) in Ribosomal RNA Gene Transcription and Chromatin Structure

**Research Question:** What is the role of Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) in ribosomal RNA (r) gene transcription and chromatin structure?

**Methods:** We used conditional deletion of UBF in mouse embryos and cell cultures to investigate its requirement for r gene transcription and chromatin structure.

**Findings:** UBF is essential for r gene transcription and formation of the pre-initiation complex and active epigenetic state of genes. Loss of UBF prevents formation of SL/TIFB-initiation complex and recruitment of RPI-R3/T1 complex, accompanied by H3K9me3, histone H1, and HPα, but not de novo DNA methylation. Genes retain p-acetyl4 and H2, suggesting r genes can maintain potentially active state. Unexpectedly, r gene activity does not suppress transcription of 5, tRNA or snRNA, nor expression of hundreds mRNA implicated in ribosome biogenesis.

**Implications:** UBF plays a crucial role in r gene transcription and chromatin structure, distinct from other transcription factors. Loss of UBF induces formation of large nuclear structure resembling nucleolar body (NPB) of oocytes and embryos, containing r synthesis and processing factors, but not associated with r loci.

**Conclusions:** UBF is essential for r gene transcription and chromatin structure, required for recruitment of SL to promoter and epigenetic state of genes. Loss of UBF causes transition from active to potentially resting state, not heterochromization. Unexpectedly, r activity does not coordinate gene expression for ribosome biogenesis. Our data support notion that U is required for recruitment SL to promoter in vivo, and U's importance in determining gene activity.

**Title:** Long-Range Signaling by Wingless/Wnt Ligands Directs Cell Proliferation and Fate in Metazoans and Its Overactivation Underlies the Development of Most Colorectal Cancers

**Research Question:** How does Wingless/Wnt signaling regulate cell proliferation and fate in metazoans, and what are the implications of its overactivation in colorectal cancer development?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Wingless/Wnt signaling in the adult Drosophila intestine, where gradients of Wnt activation demarcate major boundaries between compartments. Using a membrane-tether form of Wingless, we tested the requirement for secretion and movement of Wingless in tissue patterning.

**Findings:** Our results show that critical roles of Wingless during intestinal development, including regulation of target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling with Decaplegic pathway, are disrupted by Wing tethering. These findings support the requirement for direct, long-range action of Wingless in patterning.

**Implications:** Our study provides new evidence that long-range Wingless signaling is essential for tissue patterning in the adult intestine, with relevance for development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. In contrast to the larval wing, the adult gut forms through distinct mechanisms during metamorphosis and faces functional demands, including epithelial turnover and regeneration. We focused on Wnt gradients in the intestine that demate major compartments.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies a physiological context where the requirement for direct and long action of Wingless in patter is unambiguous, supporting previous studies in the larval wing. Identification of additional tissues where W movement disrupts signaling may uncover general principles determining contexts for long-range Wnt action. Studies in Dophila may be relevant to mammalian intestine, similarly divided into compartments and dependent on Wnt for regionalization.

**Key Findings:**

* Wingless/Wnt signaling regulates cell proliferation and fate in metazo
* Overactivation of Wingless underlies development of most colorectal cancers
* Secretion and movement of Wingless are dispensable for tissue patter in the larval wing
Long-range action of Wingless is essential for patter in the adult intestine
Disruption of Wingless disrupts target activation, boundary, stem cell proliferation, epithelial specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling with Decapic pathway

**Relevance:** This study provides new insights into the role of Wingless/Wnt signaling in the adult intestine, with implications for development, tissue homeostasis, and W-driven disease.

**Title:** Urokinase Plasminogen Activator (uPA) Contributes to Plasmin Recruitment and Invasive Disease Initiation in Group A Streptococcus (GAS)

**Research Question:** What is the role of urokinase plmin activator (uPA) in the pathogenesis of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally?

**Methods:** We investigated the contribution of uPA to plmin recruitment and invasive disease initiation in vivo using a previously described transgenic mouse model of infection. C57/Black6 and AlbG mice expressing human plmin transgene were more susceptible to invasive disease than u− mice. We assessed the contribution of u to invasive disease by analyzing bacterial dissemination and surface plmin accumulation.

**Findings:** In the absence of host plmin activators, streokinase was required for surface plmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of streokin, activators were sufficient to promote surface plmin acquisition by strain 544 during incubation with plmin or human plasma. GAS mediated a significant increase in activation zym pro-uPA in human plasma. Deletion of u attenuated virulence, correlating with decreased bacterial dissemination and reduced surface plmin accumulation.

**Implications:** These findings have significant implications for understanding GAS pathogenesis and targeting plmin activation in invasive infections. The role of co-operative plmin activation in invasive disease is supported by the attenuation of virulence following deletion of both u and streokin. The presence of other hostmin activators, such as tPA, may explain the residual virulence in u− mice. The ability to access plmin in absence streokin may be relevant at stages of infection where streokin is downregulated or degraded by virulence factors like SpeB.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the first time the contribution of u to plmin recruitment and invasive disease initiation in GAS, highlighting the importance of targeting plmin activation in bacterial infections.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Cag, Cag, and Cag in the Helicobacter pylori Type IV Secretion System and Pilus Formation

**Research Question:** What are the roles of Cag, C, and C in the Helicobacter pylori type IV secretion system (TSS) and pilus formation, and how do they contribute to the bacterium's pathogenicity?

**Methods:** We employed a mass spectrometry-based approach to co-purify C, C, and C, and C, three proteins encoded by the c pathogenic island (PA) and detectable on the bacterial surface. We analyzed their interactions with gastric epithelial cells using scanning electron microscopy and immunog labeling.

**Findings:** C, C, and are required for C translocation of the oncoprotein C into gastric epithelial cells and IL-8 secretion, but are not homologous to TSS components in other species. Scanning microscopy reveals they are involved in pilus formation at the interface between H. pyl and epithelial cells. ΔC and Δ mutant strains fail to form pili, while Δ strain exhibits a hyperiliated phenotype with elongated p. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide in C, C, and is essential for C translocation and IL-8 induction, and motifs in C and C are required for pilus formation.

**Implications:** These results indicate C, C, and are components of a T subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis, highlighting the unique constituents of H. pyl c TSS.

**Conclusions:** The C, C, and subassembly plays a crucial role in H. pyl pathogenicity by facilitating pilus formation and C translocation of C into gastric epithelial cells. The conserved C-terminal motif in C, C, and is essential for C translocation and IL-8 induction, while motifs in C and are required for pilus formation. These findings provide new insights into H. pyl TSS and pilus biogenesis, shedding light on the bacterium's pathogenic mechanisms.

**Title:** Identification of Biomarkers of Protection against Bovine Tuberculosis through Global Gene Expression Analysis

**Research Question:** Can global gene expression analysis identify predictors of protection against Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle, facilitating the development of a vaccine against this chronic disease?

**Methods:** Cattle were vaccinated with BCG or a heterologous BCG adenovirus vectored subunit protocol, and protective efficacy was determined after Mycobacterium bovis (M. bo) challenge. RNA was prepared from PPD-stimulated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected, and unvaccinated control cattle prior to M. bo challenge, and gene expression was determined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).

**Findings:** 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected compared to vaccinated-unvacc and unacc control cattle. Cytokine-cytokine interaction was the most significant pathway, with Interleukin-22 (IL-22) identified as the dominant predictor of protection, besides Interferon-gamma (INF-γ). Expression of these genes was confirmed by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PB samples from BCG vaccinated and unacc calves.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy. BCG vaccination can induce protective immunity in some calves, resulting in resolution of M. bo infection, similar to humans with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Promising strategies involve improving BCG rather than replacing it. Predictive biomarkers would facilitate vaccine development.

**Conclusions:** Global gene expression analysis identified IL-22 as a key predictor of protection against B. BCG vaccination induced immunological profile characterized by cell-mediated immunity with strong INFγ production. Strategies to improve B efficacy include subunit vaccines, recombinant viruses expressing mycobacterial antigens, or overexpressing genes in BCG. No reliable immunological correlates of protection exist. Elevated IL-17 transcription predicted protection in earlier study, but not significant in this study. BCG and B/Ad vaccination resulted in significant protection against M bo challenge.

**Title:** Dissecting the Role of γ-Tubulin Ring Complex and AIR-1/Aurora in Microtubule Organization at the Apical Non-Centrosomal Microtubule Centers in Caenorhabditis elegans Embryonic Epithelial Cells

**Research Question:** How do non-centrosomal microtule centers (ncMTO) regulate microtule organization and dynamics in differentiated cells, and what are the specific proteins involved in this process?

**Methods:** We optimized a tissue-specific degradation system to test the role of the centrosomal microtub nucleator γubulin ring complex (γ-TRC) and AIR-1/Aurora at the apical ncMTO in Caenorhabdis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells.

**Findings:** Our results show that at the centros, the core-TRC component G-1/G3 is required to recruit other-TRC components to the apicalMTO, including MT/MT, characterized for the first time in animal development. In contrast, AIR-1 and MT were specifically required to recruit-T to the centros, but not centrioles to the apicalMTO. Surprisingly, microtules remain robustly organized at apicalMTO upon-T and AIR- co-depletion and upon depletion of known microtule regulators, including TP/TP, ZG/CG, PTR/CAP, and NO/Nine. However, loss of G- removed a subset of E-marked microules, and the remaining microules grew faster.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that microule organizing centers (TO) use discrete proteins for their function, and the apicalM is composed of distinct γu-dependent and -independent microules that compete for limited resources.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals that γ-T and AIR are not required to form majority of apical microules, raising the question of why these proteins specifically localize there as ncM is established. One possibility is that main function of localizing-T and AIR to apicalM is to remove them from cent at end of mitosis as centomalTO function attenuated. The presence microules in embryonic cells rely on γ function and mitotic AIR/Aora, only depletion both from cells results elimination centomal microules.

**Title:** Accurate Phasing of Human Genomes: A Comparative Analysis of Laboratory and Computational Approaches

**Research Question:** Despite being a diploid species, inheriting one set of chromosomes paternally and one homologous set maternally, most human genome sequencing initiatives ignore the fact that they do not delineate nucleotide content of maternal and paternal copies of 23 individuals (i.e., they do not phase the genome) due to costs and complexities.

**Methods:** We compared 11 widely-used approaches to phasing human genomes using publicly available Genome-In-A-Bottle (GI) version of NA78 as gold standard. Phasing strategies included laboratory assays preparing DNA uniquely to facilitate phasing and computational approaches reconstructing information from sequencing reads or population haplotype frequencies through reference haplotype panel. We assessed performance using metrics: error rates, haplotype lengths, proportion fully-resolved genes, phasing accuracy, and yield pairs SNVs.

**Findings:** Our results suggest a hybrid approach combining population phasing using SHAIT software, genome-wide sequencing data or parental genotypes, and reference haplotype frequencies provides fast and accurate-resolved individual genomes. Population phasing performance enhanced with genome-wide data, e.g., shotgun/RNA sequencing. Inclusion parental data reduced phasing errors up to ten-fold. Majority voting scheme constructing consensus haplotype multiple predictions enhanced performance and coverage. We identified sequence signatures genomic regions harboring phasing errors, low polymorphism/SNV density.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance accurate phasing human genomes for understanding genetic variation, disease, and evolution. Our results demonstrate hybrid approach efficient, cost-effective, and accurate, matching/surpassing laboratory methods. Accurate phasing essential for understanding genetic variation, disease, evolution, and personalized medicine.

**Conclusion:** Accurate phasing human genomes is crucial for understanding genetic variation, disease, evolution, and personalized medicine. Our study demonstrates hybrid approach efficient, cost-effective, and accurate, matching/surpassing laboratory methods. Accurate phasing essential for understanding genetic, disease, evolution, and medicine.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Type-III ATPases in Type-III Secretion Systems: A Novel Insights into Flagellar Biogenesis and Virulence in Gram-Negative Pathogens

**Research Question:** What is the role of type-III ATPases in type-III secretion systems, particularly in flagellar biogenesis and virulence in Gram-negative pathogens, and can type-III secretion occur in the absence of ATPase activity?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of type-III ATPases in flagellar and virulence-associated type-III secretion systems in Gram-negative pathogens using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and biophysical approaches.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that type-III secretion can occur efficiently in the absence of ATPase activity in both flagellar and virulence-associated type-III systems. Moreover, we show that increased proton motive force (PMF) bypasses the requirement of the Salmonella pathogenic island 1 (SPI-1) vir-associated type-III ATPase for secretion. Furthermore, our data suggest that type-III ATPases enhance secretion efficiency under limited substrate concentrations, revealing their dispensability in the type-III export process.

**Implications:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding flagellar biogenesis and virulence in Gram-negative pathogens. We propose that type-III ATPases facilitate substrate delivery to the export apparatus and ensure efficient substrate unfolding, as previously reported by Akeda and Galán [17]. Increased PM overcomes the requirement of the FliJ ATPase complex for late secretion, similar to the scenario where excess substrates bypass the FliJ ATPase requirement. Our results also shed light on the evolution of flagellar and type-III systems.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals that ATP activity is universally dispensable for protein export via type-III systems. We propose that type-III ATPases play a crucial role in substrate recognition, chaperone release, and subsequent secretion in an ATP-dependent manner. Increased PM assists efficient export of late substrates, overcoming the requirement of the FliJ ATPase complex. These findings have important implications for the evolution of bacterial flagellum and type-III systems.

**Title:** Systematic Identification of Bistable Gene Regulatory Networks using Chemical Reaction Network Theory

**Research Question:** What is the capacity for bistability in simple gene regulatory networks (GRNs) consisting of two transcription factor (TF)-coding genes and their associated proteins, assuming elementary biochemical processes?

**Methods:** We employed chemical reaction network theory in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the bistability of over 40,000 GR models formed by TF-genes and their proteins.

**Findings:** ∼90% of GR models exhibit bistability, including circuits without TF cooperativity associated with bistable systems, and most identified through subnetwork-based analysis. Topological sorting revealed 11 minimal bist networks (i.e., bistable without smaller subnetworks). The large number of unknown bistable topologies suggests ease of switch-like behavior in GRNs and loss through evolution.

**Implications:** The systematic application of CRNT to bistable network identification in biological systems is demonstrated by integrating protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA, and expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, identifying GRNs predicted to behave in bistable fashion.

**Conclusions:**

1. **Bistability is prevalent in GRNs**: ∼90% of GR models exhibit bistability, including those without TF cooperativity associated with bistable systems.
2. **Minimal bist networks**: 11 bist networks without smaller subnetworks are sufficient for bistability.
3. **Ease of bistability**: bist behavior in GRNs arises easily and is not lost through evolution.
4. **Systematic approach**: CRNT identifies bistable networks, providing hypotheses for experimentation.
5. **Applicability**: CRNT can be applied to any system with available interaction data.

**Title:** Mutations in the HY2 Gene Cause Orofacial Clefting: A Novel Insights into the Molecular Pathogenesis of a Common Birth Defect

**Research Question:** What is the role of the HY2 gene in the etiology of orofacial cleft, a common birth defect with both genetic and environmental components?

**Methods:** We investigated mutations in the HY2 gene, encoding hyaluronidase 2, which degrades extracellular hyaluron, a critical component of the developing palatal matrix. Transfection assays demonstrated that mutations destabilize the molecule, reducing HY2 protein levels. We generated Hy2- mice and observed craniofac abnormalities, including submuc cleft palate and coratriatum and hearing loss.

**Findings:** Our study identifies HY2 mutations as a new cause of orofacialing in humans and mice, defining the first molecular basis for coratriatum in humans. Hyuron turnover is essential for normal development in both humans and mice. We reveal a previously unrecognized pathway in the pathogenesis of oracialing myopia and coratri in humans, which may be amenable to therapies.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of hyuronid enzymes in human and mouse development, particularly in the pathogenesis of oracialing and coratri. The molecular basis of CL is incompletely understood, despite frequent occurrence and morbidity. We demonstrate a deficiency of HA-degrading HY2 as a novel cause of syndrom CL in humans and SM mice, and the first explanation for coratri in humans.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for the importance of HY2 for heart development in humans and mice, and identifies mutation as the first molecular mechanism for coratri in humans. Conductive hearing loss was seen in most affected subjects, but one individual had profound sensorineural loss. We propose that deaths in progeny of Hy2- intercrosses during embryogenesis are due to severe cardiac anomalies in Hy- mice. Cardiac findings in individuals with HY2 K148 variant display similarities, including coratri and dilated sinuses indicative of PVC.

**Title:** Molecular Remodeling of Mechanosensory Tip Links in Auditory Hair Cells: A Novel Insights into Mechanotransduction and Regeneration

**Research Question:** How do mechanosensory tip links in auditory hair cells regenerate and maintain mechanotrans function throughout an organism's life, and what are the molecular components involved in this process?

**Methods:** We developed a novel implementation of backscatter electron microscopy to visualize immuno-gold particles and stereocilia, both only a few nanometers in diameter, and used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to measure mechanotrans currents.

**Findings:** Mechanotrans-mediating tip links have at least two compositions, either PCD15/CD23 or PCD15PC15. During regeneration, shorter links with nearly equal amounts of PCD15 at both ends appear, mediating mechanotrans currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca+-dependent decay. Mature P15CD23 link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanens function in postotic auditory cells and could identify elusive components of mechanotrans machinery.

**Conclusions:** Our data reveal a hitherto unknown process of structural remodeling of broken links necessary for regeneration of MET in auditory cells. Stereocilia link disruption leads to disappearance of CD23 and migration of P15 to the circumference of stereilum, forming the upper end of nascent link. This two-step remodeling process may underlie formation of links in developing bundle, turnover in mature, and regeneration after acoustical stimulation to safeguard hearing.

**Title:** Metabolic Profiling of Dengue Virus Infection Reveals Altered Pathways and Potential Therapeutic Targets for Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever

**Background:** Dengue virus (DENV) is a prevalent arbovirus causing an estimated 100 million symptomatic deng infections annually, with a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild deng fever (DF) to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The transition from DF to DHF is not well understood.

**Research Question:** What are the metabolic alterations associated with the transition from deng fever to deng hemorrhagic fever?

**Methods:** We performed mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DH patients at critical (5-7 days after onset of fever) and recovery (21 days after onset of fever) phases.

**Findings:** 29 differentially expressed metabolites were identified between DF and DH at the critical phase, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were 5-fold higher in DH compared to DF, correlated with higher aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), indicative of liver injury. Uric acid, the most abundant antioxidant in blood, was 1.5-fold lower in DH compared to DF, suggesting decreased capacity for endogenous defense and elevated oxidative stress. In recovery, eight metabolites remained significantly higher or lower in DH, including chodeoxyglycolic acid, a bile acid.

**Implications:** Altered metabolic pathways linked to DH in critical and recovery phases of deng infection provide insights into host-DENV interactions between DF and DH. Results advance understanding of DH pathogenesis and suggest novel therapeutic targets for deng management.

**Conclusion:** Our study identifies metabolic alterations associated with deng progression and DH pathogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for alleviating DH.

**Title:** Metabolic Pathway of Purine Nucleotides in Parasitic Protozoa: A Potent Target for Treatment of Parasitemia

**Research Question:** The study aimed to investigate the metabolic pathway of purine nucleotides in Trypanosoma brucei, a causative protozo parasite of African trypaniasis, and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

**Methods:** The study employed a combination of molecular biology and biochemical techniques, including sequence analysis, immunoelectron microscopy, and enzymatic assays to characterize the guanosine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) enzyme in T. brucei. Recombinant protein was expressed and purified to investigate enzymatic differences between T. bruce GR and its host GR.

**Findings:** The study found that GR in T. bruce was localized to glycosomes and possessed a unique insertion of cystathion β-synthase (CBS) domain absent in mammalian and bacterial GRs. Recombinant T. br GR catalyzed the conversion of GMP to IMP in the presence of NAD, with distinct affinities for G and NAD from mammalian counterparts. Addition of monoval cations such as K+ and NH+ increased GR activity of T. br, whereas none mammalian GRs were unaffected. Phosphate form of purine analog ribavir inhibited T. br GR, whereas mammalian GR showed little inhibition.

**Implications:** Results suggest the mechanism of GR in T. br is distinct from host organisms, providing a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Demonstrated inhibitory effect of ribavir on trypanosome proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting ribavir as a new agent against African trypanias.

**Conclusions:** The study highlights the metabolic pathway of purine nucleides in T. br as a potent target for treatment of parasitem. Characterization of GR in tryosomatids provides new insights into molecular phylogenetics of protozo. Further studies with pur analogs and recombin GR showed R as competitive inhibitor of T br GR, with similar Ki to inhibition of T br IMPDH.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Action of Sodium Channel Blockers: A Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Benzocaine and Phenytoin Binding to NavAb

**Research Question:** Understanding the mechanism of action of sodium channel blockers is crucial for the development of next-generation drugs that selectively target specific voltage-gated sodium channels in the body. This study aims to elucidate the binding sites and entry route of two drugs, benzaine and phenyin, to the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb using molecular dynamics simulations.

**Methods:** We employed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding of benzaine and phenyin to NavAb, a well-characterized voltage-gated sodium channel. The simulations revealed two binding sites for both drugs, characterized by non-specific hydrophobic interactions: one above the activation gate and at the entrance to the lipid-filled fenestrations. Independent methods confirmed these sites, with binding to the gate being slightly more favorable than the fenration.

**Findings:** Both drugs were found to pass through fenestrations into the lipid with small energy barriers, suggesting the proposed hydroobic route for drug entry. Our simulations highlighted the importance of specific residues in directing drug entry through fenestr and forming binding sites.

**Implications:** This study provides insights into the mechanism of action of sodium channel blockers, essential for the development of new drugs targeting specific voltageated sodium channels. Understanding the binding sites and entry of benzaine and phenin to NavAb can inform the design of novel therapeutics for epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia, and pain management.

**Conclusions:** Molecular dynamics simulations of benzaine and phenin binding to NavAb revealed two binding sites, one above the activation gate and at the lipid fenestr. Both drugs pass through fenestr with low energy, supporting the hydroobic route for entry. This study highlights the role of residues in directing drug entry and binding, crucial for the development of next-generation sodium channel blockers.

**Title:** Cell-Specific MyD88 Signaling in the Induction of Host Responses to Intestinal Infection: A Novel Insights from a Murine Knock-in Model

**Research Question:** What is the cell-specific contribution of MyD in the induction of innate and adaptive immune responses during intestinal infection with the pathogen C rodent?

**Methods:** We employed a novel murine knock-in model for MyD that enables cell-specific reactivation of functionalD expression in My88-deficient mice to investigate the role of My in different cell types during intestinal infection.

**Findings:** Our results show that functionalD signaling in CD11+ cells is sufficient to activate intestinal dendritic cells (DC) and induce group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC) response as well as development of colonic Th17/Th cells in response to infection with C rodent. In contrast, restrictingD signaling to other cell types, including macrophages (MO), T cells, or ILC did not induce intestinal responses. Notably, expression ofD in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) partially protected mice during infection, associated with enhanced epithelial integrity and expression of antimicrobial peptide Regγ and acute protein SAA by epithelial cells.

**Implications:** Our data suggest thatD signaling in DC and IEC is both essential and sufficient to induce full spectrum of host responses intestinal with C rod.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the critical role ofD in specific cell types during intestinal infection, particularly in DC and IEC, and underscores the importance of understanding cell-specific impact ofD in induction of innate and adaptive responses. Our findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting specific cell types to enhance host defense against intestinal pathogens.

**Title:** Modelling the Relationship between Post-Mass Drug Administration (MDA) Ov16 Antibody Prevalence in Children and the Probability of Onchocercias Elimination in Africa

**Research Question:** This study investigates the relationship between post-MDA Ov16 antibody prevalence in children and the probability of oncherciasis elimination in Africa, considering various transmission settings, treatment coverage, and endemicity levels.

**Methods:** A mathematical model, ONOSIM, was extended to incorporate Ov16 antibody seroconversion, assumed to be triggered by the first worm establishment in the host, with seroconversion occurring before or after maturation or after the start of mf production. The study focused on seroconversion in children, ignoring seroreversion for simplification. Yearly MDA led to a reduction in parasite rate in humans, decreasing sero rate in newborns and children, while those serconverted remained positive.

**Findings:** The association between post-M Ov16 prevalence in children and predicted probability of elimination was influenced by baseline endemic levels, serconversion trigger, and diagnostic characteristics (sensitivity and specificity). Both microfilaria prevalence in population aged 5 and Ov16 prevalence in children under 10 declined with increasing M duration. The relationship between indicators and model-predicted probability was not affected by treatment levels, but dependent on endemic levels.

**Implications:** Understanding Ov antibody dynamics is crucial for accurate interpretation of seroprevalence data and precise estimation of MDA endpoint. The study demonstrates that endpoint will depend on endemic levels, which should be considered in guidelines defining when to stop M.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of understanding post-M Ov16 prevalence in relation to elimination prospects of onchiasis, including transmission, endemic, treatment, and coverage, and its association with other indicators, notably mf prevalence. Mathematical models provide useful tools for assessing trends in indicators during treatment under different conditions and scenarios. ONOS simulations reveal local conditions influence the association between post-M Ov16 levels and probability of elimination, with lower levels required in high-transmission settings than low-trans settings.

**Title:** Heterogeneity of Prion Populations: Emergence of Drug-Resistant and Drug-Dependent Variants upon Propagation in Different Environments

**Research Question:** Do prion populations exhibit heterogeneity and adaptability in response to different environments, leading to the emergence of drug-resistant and drug-dependent variants?

**Methods:** We investigated the propagation of prions in various environments, including PK cells in the presence and absence of swainine, a drug, and observed the emergence of drug-resistant and drug-dependent variants.

**Findings:** Our results show that prion populations exhibit heterogeneity, comprising a range of variants with different properties, where the fittest are selected in a particular environment. Prion populations developed heterogeneity even after biological cloning, indicating mutation-like processes occur at conformation level. Brain-derived 22 prions, naturally swine-resistant, did not surprise that pr became sensitive after propagation in cells could revert to resistance. R pr, both propagation in brain or PK cells, swine-sensitive, investigated whether possible select swine variants in presence drug. Interestingly, not with standard PK cells, but certain PK sublines only swine-resistant, even swine-dependent (i.e., propagated rapidly presence drug) isolated. Established pass indefinitely PK cells absence drug without swine dependence. Misfolded pr protein (PSc) associated swine variant rapidly cleared PK cells sensitive counterpart indicating structural differences misfold Pr underlie pr properties.

**Implications:** Propagation pr in presence inhibitory drug not only select drug-resistant pr but stable variants propagate efficiently presence drug. Adaptations likely conformation abnormal pr protein.

**Conclusion:** Prion populations exhibit heterogeneity and adaptability in response different environments, leading emergence drug-resistant and drug-dependent variants. Our findings support quasi-species hypothesis, prion populations comprising major conformer variants constantly selected replenished mutation. PK cells restricted pr repertoire compared AM10 cells. Experiments suggest some PK-derived lines, not PK cell, sw-sensitive populations low variants selected drug yield resistant populations.

**Title:** Exploring the Evolutionary Potential of Metabolism: A Study of Genotype-Phenotype Space and Metabolic Innovation

**Research Question:** How does the structure of the genotype-phenotype space define the evolutionary potential and limitations of metabolisms, and what are the implications for metabolic innovation and conservation?

**Methods:** We analyzed an exhaustive genotype-phenotype map of 101 metabolisms encoding all possible subsets of 51 reactions in central carbon metabolism, using flux balance analysis to predict viability on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 102 potential phenotypes. We found that viable metabolisms with one phenotype comprise a tiny fraction of genotype space, but their absolute numbers exceed 109 for phenotypes. Metabolisms with one typically form a network of genotypes extending throughout genotype space, where two genotypes can be reached through single reaction changes.

**Findings:** The minimal distance between genotypes associated with different phenotypes is small, allowing metabolisms to reach novel phenotypes on new carbon sources through few genic changes. Exceptions exist for metabolisms with complexity close to minimum for viability. Increasing complexity enhances potential for both conservation and innovation.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that neighborhoods of metabolisms on the same carbon contain novel phenotypes, which depend on genotype location in space. Random sampling 1000 pairs of metabolisms differing in 1-10 reactions on a given carbon, we found that a change in genotype leads to viability on new combinations. Considering a modest genotype space of 101 carbon variants, carbon metabolism is an attractive due to its role in extracting energy from extracellular sources and limited viability on 10 sources.

**Conclusions:** Observations translate to metabolisms viable on multiple sources (k > 1). Sampling 1000 metabolisms from distinct networks on each source, representing phenotypes as binary vectors, we found multiple novel phenotypes in neighborhoods. Our study provides insights into evolutionary potential and limitations of metabolisms, implications for innovation and conservation.

**Title:** Phylogeography and Population Genetics of Triatoma dimata Haplogroups in Mexico: Implications for Trypanosoma cruzi Infection and Vector Capacity**

**Research Question:** This study investigates the phylogeography and population genetics of Trioma dimata haplogroups at landscape and regional scales in Chiapas and across the Neotropics, and analyzes the phylogeography of the complex across its complete geographic range.

**Methods:** Two fragments of the ND4 gene were sequenced from differential haplog specificity using previously designed primers. At landscape (anthropic modification), regional (demographic, biographic, climate) scales, lowest dimata genetic diversity occurs where there is greatest anthropic modification, and T cruz infection is highest.

**Findings:** T cruz prevalence was significantly higher in haplog 1 and 3, while lower in haplog 2. Significant DT and DTI frequencies differed in hap 1 and 3, no difference in hap 2. Haplog from Neotrop had moderate to high hapl diversity, greatest differentiation between hap 1 and 3 (FST = 0.868, p < 0.001). Divergence from MRCA estimated 0.97 MY (95HPD = 0.55-1.53) and 0.85 MY (95HP = 0.42-1.5) for ND4 and concatenated, primary from MRCA hap 2 and 3. Effective population size for hap 1 and 2 increased 0.02-0.03 MY.

**Implications:** This study supports ecological evidence for the complex's origin surrounding Tehante Isthmus and provides recent divergence of primary dimata haplog with differential T cruz infection and DT specificity, components of vector capacity.

**Conclusions:** Population genetics of each fragment analyzed for haplog across distributions and geographic scales, phyloge of dimata complex reanalyzed on continental. T cruz prevalence and DT specificity for individuallog provide differential capacity within complex in Mexico. This study highlights the importance of understanding parasite genetic diversity for efficacy of therapeutic tools and vector control programs.

**Key findings:**

* T cruz prevalence significantly higher in haplog 1 and 3, lower in hap 2
* Significant DT and DT frequencies in hap 1 and 3, no difference in 2
* Hap from Neot moderate to high hapl diversity, greatest between 1 and 3
* Divergence from MRCA 0.97 (95HP 0.55-1.53) and 0.85 (95 0.42-1.5) for ND4 and concatenated
* Effective size for 1 and 2 increased 0.02-0.03 MY
* Study supports ecological evidence for complex's origin Tehante Isth and recent divergence primary haplog with differential cruz and DT

**Title:** Environmental Factors Influencing Rodent-to-Human Transmission of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFR) in Chhou, China

**Research Question:** What environmental factors contribute to the risk of rod-to-human transmission of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFR) in Chhou, China, and how do these factors vary across different rodent species and environments?

**Methods:** We analyzed 10-year (2006-2015) field data on rodent hosts, hantavirus, epidemiology, and environmental factors from satellite images and meteorological stations to quantify relationships between environmental factors, rod species, and HFR occurrence. We included 709 HFR cases.

**Findings:** Rodent species in Chhou, a hant hotspot, comprised Rattus norvegicus, Musculus, R flavius, and others (lose and Microtus fortis calam). Rod species played different roles across land types, but all associated with transmission. R norveicus and flavi were associated with HFR risk in grassland, while Mus and flavi in built-on land. Rod community associated with environmental variability. Predictive models based on significant factors validated a good fit: cultivated land predicted highest HFR incidence, aligning with 2014-201 statistics.

**Implications:** Spatial heterogeneity of HFR may be influenced by rod community, associated with local conditions. Future work should focus on preventing H in moist environments.

**Conclusion:** Environmental factors influence HFR through effects on reservoirs and living conditions, but specific relationships unclear. This study determined rod community influences risk contracting havirus in different environments. Rod-to-human transmission depends on contact frequency, human activities, conditions, species, densities, and prevalence. External factors, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, land, vegetation, soil, and moisture, also contribute.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mysteries of Costello Syndrome: A Novel Insights into the Role of HRAS Exon 2 Skipping in Cancer and Costello Syndrome

**Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying Costello syndrome (CS) caused by mutations in the HRAS proto-oncogene, and how does it differ from cancer-causing mutations?

**Methods:** We identified a novel germline GlyVal mutation c.35_36>T in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS and analyzed HRAS cDNA showing high levels of exon 2 skipping. Using wild and mutant HRAS minigenes, we confirmed that c.35_36>T results in exon 2 skipping by disrupting a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE) and creating an Exonic Splicing Silencer (SS).

**Findings:** We show that HR exon 2 is vulnerable due to a weak 3' splice site, making it dependent on splicing proteins like SRS2 for inclusion. Most cancer- and CS-causing mutations are located here, affecting splicing differently. Our results demonstrate that CS and cancer phenotypes are not solely determined by mutant HRAS transforming potential, but also by exon 2 inclusion efficiency from different mutations. We also show a splice oligonucleotide (SO) blocking E causes exon skipping and halts cancer cell proliferation.

**Implications:** This unravels a potential for new anti-cancer therapies based on SO-mediated HR exon 2 skipping.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of splicing regulation in cancer and CS. We demonstrate that HR exon 2 is a vulnerable, dependent on splicing proteins for inclusion, and that mutations alter the balance between E and SS can result in cell-specific splicing efficiency. We show that mutations in codons 12 and 13 impact exon 2 differently, and HR splicing efficiency is tissue-dependent on splicing protein levels. Our findings have implications for understanding CS and cancer development of therapies.

**Title:** Essential Role of Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in M6 RNA Methylation in Mammalian Cerebellar Development

**Research Question:** What is the function of METTL-mediated m6 methylation in mammalian cerebellar development?

**Methods:** We generated Mettl conditional knockout (cKO) mice to investigate the role of METTL in cerebellar neurogenesis. We analyzed cerebellar morphology, gene expression, and apoptosis in Mettl KO mice.

**Findings:** Mettl KO mice exhibited severe cerebellar hypoplasia, characterized by enhanced apoptosis of cerebellar granule cells (CGs) in the external granular layer (EGL). METTL depletion-induced loss of m6 modification caused extended half-lives and aberrant splicing events, leading to dysregulation of transcript-wide gene expression and premature CG death.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a critical role of METTL-mediated m6 in regulating mammalian cerebell development. Transcript-wide gene dysregulation induced by m6 depletion in the absence of METTL results in CG apoptosis and cerebell hypoplas.

**Conclusions:** METTL is an essential regulator of cerebellar neurogenesis, and MET-mediated m6 signaling plays a key role in modulating the development of the central nervous system at the post-transcriptional level in mammals. Our study highlights the importance of METTL-mediated m6 in cerebellar development, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target for cerebell disorders.

**Title:** Combinatorial Binding of Transcription Factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG Regulates Gene Expression in Embryonic Stem Cells through Conserved Enhancers

**Research Question:** How do the transcription factors OCT4, SO2, and NANOG regulate gene expression in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and what is the role of combinatorial binding in this process?

**Methods:** We analyzed the binding of OCT, SO2, and NANOG to cis-regulatory sequences, such as promoters and enhancers, in mouse and human ES cells using ChIP-seq and ChIP-seq. We also examined the co-localization of the transcription coactivator Mediator H3ac and expression of nearby genes.

**Findings:** Combinatorial binding of OCT, SO2, and NANOG is strongly associated with H3ac and increased expression of nearby genes in ES cells. We observed that loci bound by OCT, SO, and NAN in ES frequently drive expression in early embryonic development. Comparison of mouse and human ES shows that less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT, SO, and NAN are shared between species, whereas about 15% of combinatorial events and 53-63% of combinator events at enhancers active in early development are conserved.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that the combination of OCT, SO, and NAN is critical for transcription in ES and plays an important role in embryogenesis by binding conserved early developmental enhancers. The evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding, whereas "regulatory hotspots" bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues throughout development are under evolutionary constraints.

**Conclusions:** Combinatorial binding of OCT, SO, and NAN is essential for transcriptional activation in ES cells. Our data provide further evidence for the connection between pluripotency and development mediated by OCT, SO, and through binding at developmental enhancers. The majority of loci bound by OCT, SO, and are likely act as enhancers in ES, however, the function of loci near inactive genes is unclear.

**Title:** Reciprocal Translocation of Chromosomes 8 and 21 Generates AML/ETO Oncogenic Factor Initiates Acute Myel Leukemia by Recruiting Co-repressor Complexes to DNA

**Research Question:** How does the AML/ETO oncogenic factor, generated by a reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 8 and 21, initiate acute myel leukemia by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA?

**Methods:** Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling were used to identify AML/dependent transcriptional regulation. AML/ was found to co-localize with A1, demonstrating that the fusion follows the binding pattern of the wild-type protein but does not primarily displace it. The binding of E-protein H was grossly rearranged upon expression of A/ETO, and the fusion was found to co-local with A1 and H on many regulated targets. The level of H protein was increased in primary and cell lines expressing AETO.

**Findings:** Our results suggest a major role for the interaction of A/ with A1 and H in transcriptional regulation by the fusion protein. A/ETO was found to target A1 binding sites, interfering with the function of its wild-type counterpart, A1. However, transcriptional regulation by AETO relies on a complex network, as the fusion interacts with other transcription factors, particularly E-prote, and targets other sites on DNA.

**Implications:** This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of A/ETO in initiating acute myel leukemia. The interaction of A/ with A and H suggests a common regulatory function in hematopoies. The increased level of H in AETO-expressing cells indicates a potential role in leukemogenesis.

**Conclusions:** The reciprocal translocation of chromosomes 8 and 21 generates the AETO oncogenic factor, which initiates acute myel leukemia by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA. AETO interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, A, by targeting A binding sites. However, transcriptional regulation by AETO relies on a complex network, as the fusion interacts with other transcription factors, particularly Ete, and targets other sites on DNA. Our results suggest a major role for the interaction of A with A and H in transcriptional regulation by the fusion protein.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Leishmania donovani Histone Acetyltransferase 2 (H2) in Gene Regulation and Cell Cycle Progression

**Research Question:** What is the role of Leish donovani histone acetylase 2 (H2) in regulating gene expression and cell cycle progression in the parasite Leishmania donani?

**Methods:** We employed in vitro biochemical assays and H2-heterozygous genomic knockout models to investigate the function of Leish donani hist acetylase 2 (H2) in regulating gene expression and cell cycle in Leish donani. Biochemical assays revealed constitutive nuclear acetylation of histone H4 in vitro and in vivo, while H2-depleted cells displayed growth and cell cycle defects, and poor survival in host cells. Real-time PCR and DNA microarray analyses, as well as rescue experiments, revealed downregulation of cyclins CY4 and CY9 responsible for phase and G2/M defects in H2-depleted cells.

**Findings:** Leish genes are arranged in unidirectional clusters, and genes are coordinately transcribed as polyc units, typically from divergent strand regions (dSRs) which initiate bidirectionally on opposite strands. Investigating the mechanism by which CY4 and CY9 levels are reduced in H-de cells without other genes in polyc transcription being coordinately downregulated, we found CY and CY have own specific promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with Hacetyl10 antibodies and real PCR analyses of RNA suggested these promoters were activated in cell-dependent manner. Nuclear-on analyses confirmed CY and CY were transcriptionally activated from own at specific cell stages.

**Implications:** This study presents first data pointing cell-specific activation of promoters in trypanosids, uncovering new facets regulation in this family. The lower expression of cyclins on cycle in H-de cells emphasizes stringent modulation CY and CY in Leish. Transcription sites (SS) in SRs are enriched H10 acetylation and H3 trimylation in bruce and cruzi, and acety H in major. In accordance, we found SRs on chromosomes carrying CY and CY to be enriched H10 in Leish donani, with levels being lower in H-de as expected.

**Conclusions:** This study uncovers new facets of regulation in Leish donani. MY-family histone acetylase H2 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and cell cycle in this parasite. MY-family (A) Hs annotated in Leish genome. Le donani H has acety H4 in vitro and vivo, and deletion leads deficiencies histone deposition.

**Title:** Inferring Others' Intentions in Social Interactions: A Computational Modeling of Hierarchical Learning and Volatility

**Research Question:** How do humans infer others' intentions during social transactions, and how do these inferences impact decision-making in social interactions?

**Methods:** We designed an interactive game where 16 pairs of participants were randomly assigned to "player" or "adviser" roles. The player performed a probabilistic learning task, receiving information about a binary lottery from a visual chart, while the adviser received additional predictive information and issued a recommendation. The game was structured to vary the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information over time.

**Findings:** Using a Bayesian modeling framework, we found that players' behavior was best explained by the deployment of hierarchical learning, inferring the volatility of advisers' intentions to optimize predictions about advice validity. Volatility estimates also affected trial-by-trial variability, with participants relying on estimates for choices when believing advisers' intentions were stable. Our model predicted players' Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) scores, ratings of advisers' helpfulness, and advisers' self-reports on chosen strategy.

**Implications:**

1. Humans employ hierarchical generative models to infer changing others' intentions.
2. Volatility informs decision-making in social interactions.
3. Estimates of accuracy integrate with non-social sources of information.

**Key Findings:**

* Players with advisers whose intentions changed to maximize own winnings showed more pronounced values, suggesting hierarchical levels were strongly coupled and volatility updated beliefs about accuracy.
* Players' belief-updating reflected advisers' policy and willingness to take suggestions.
* Those with helpful advisers perceived stable intentions weighted advice more, reflected by reduced metaolatility and larger values.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest humans deploy hierarchical learning during social interactions, using volatility to inform decision-making, and integrating estimates with non-social sources. The Bayesian framework can quantify individual differences, useful in future studies of maladaptive cognition.

**Title:** Indigenous Urban Typhus in Seoul, South Korea: A Study of Clinical Features and Vectors**

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the presence, clinical features, and vectors of urban typhus in Seoul, South Korea's largest metropolitan city, using national notifiable disease data from 2010-2013.

**Methods:** A retrospective analysis of clinical features of patients from one hospital was compared to a control group. Chigger mites were collected in the city using a direct chigger-collecting trap and identified by phenic and 18S rDNA analyses. Infection with Orientia tsutsugushi was confirmed by sequencing the 56-kDa antigen.

**Findings:** Eighty cases of urban typh were identified in Seoul, with possible sites of infection being mountain areas (56.8%), city parks (20.5%), vicinity of own residence (17%), and rivers (5.7%). Eighty-seven chigger mites were collected in Gak mountain, one of the suspected sites in Seoul, and seventy-six (87.4%) were identified as Helenula miagawai and eight (9.2) as Leotridium scell. Pooled DNA from miag mites yielded O tsugushi Bong strain. Twenty-six patients showed low APACHE score (3.4 ± 2.7), low complication rate (3.8%), and no hypalemia.

**Implications:** The study identified presence of indigenous urban typh in Seoul and a subgroup with mild clinical features. Chigger H miag infected with O tsugushi within the city found in endemic area. Urban typh needs to be considered one of differential febrile diseases and target for prevention.

**Conclusion:** Although the small number doesn't represent whole cases, they deserve first description of urban typh in Seoul. This study confirmed presence of Bong genotype in chiggers collected within. Further identification causative strains from areas will characterize overall status. Patients visited hospital due fever, 96.2% had maculopular skin rash.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of HEN-1 in RNA Interference Pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How does the Caenorhabditis elegans HEN RNA-methyltransferase homolog H-1 (HEN-1) affect RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in the nematode?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of HEN-1 on two RNAi pathways in C. elegans, specifically the 26 and 21 pathways, which employ methylated RNA molecules.

**Findings:**

* Loss of HEN-1 results in reduced stability of 26 RNAs, with increased 3'-uridylation frequencies, whereas 21 RN stability is mildly affected.
* HEN- specifically methylates ER-1-bound 26 RNAs, but not AL-3/4-bound 26 RN.
* Global expression analysis of h-1 mutants reveals mild effects, including downregulation of germl-expressed genes.
* Most effects on gene expression are indirect, not due to reduced 26 RNA levels.

**Implications:**

* Our study refines understanding of endogenous RNAi in C. elegans and the roles of Hen-like enzymes in these pathways.
* HEN- plays a specific role in stabilizing ER-1-bound 26 RN, but not AL-3/4-bound 26 RN.
* Loss of H- results in modest effects on 26-dependent gene expression.

**Conclusions:**

* HEN- is essential for stabilizing ER-1-bound 26 RN, preventing non-templated uridylation.
* H- is not required for AL-3/4-bound 26 RN stability.
* Most effects of H- on gene expression are indirect, not due to reduced 26 levels.
* Our study highlights the complexity of RNAi pathways in C. elegans and the specific roles of Hen-like enzymes.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 (HNFα) in Glycosylation Regulation: A Genome-Wide Association and High-Throughput Glycomics Analysis Reveals Novel Insights into Protein Glycosylation Mechanisms

**Research Question:** How do genetic variants in Hepatocyte Factor 1 (HNFα) and fucosyltransferase genes influence N-gly levels in human plasma, and what is the role of NFα in regulating fucylation processes?

**Methods:** Genome-wide association and high-throughput glycomics analysis of 2,705 individuals in three population cohorts revealed common variants in HNFα and fucyltransferase genes F6 and F8 influencing Nly levels in plasma. We investigated the role of NFα and its downstream NF4 in regulating expression of fucyltransfer and fucose biosynthesis genes using HepG and Panc cell lines.

**Findings:** We show that NFα and NF4 regulate expression of key fyltransfer and fucose genes, and NFα is necessary and sufficient to drive expression in hepatic cells. NFα is a master regulator of multiple stages in fylation, with implications for immunity, embryonic development, protein folding, and understanding molecular mechanisms of cancer, coronary disease, heart, and metabolic disorders.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel role for NFα in regulating fucylation, a complex and poorly understood process, and highlight the importance of understanding glycosylation in physiological and pathological processes. Variants in NFα and fyltransfer genes are associated with plasma Nly levels, suggesting a link between NFα and glycosylation. NFα regulates expression of fyltransfer and fucose genes, a key step in Nly synthesis, and NFα is necessary and sufficient to drive expression in hepatic cells.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of glycosylation, a crucial for protein function and disease, and highlights the importance of NFα as a transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in the process. Our findings have implications for understanding the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, protein folding, and molecular mechanisms of cancer, coronary disease, heart, and metabolic disorders.

**Title:** Deciphering the Epigenetic Code of Centromeres: Unveiling the Role of Centrom RNA in Kinetochore Recruitment and Assembly

**Research Question:** How do centromeres, the interface between the genome and cytoskeleton, recruit kinetores and chromosomes, and what is the role of centrom RNA in this process?

**Methods:** We conducted a genetic and biochemical study of maize CEN, a key kinetore protein, to investigate its DNA- and RNA-binding properties and their role in centrom specification.

**Findings:** We identified a 122-amino acid DNA-binding region in CEN, which is exquisitely sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long, single-stranded nucleic acids strongly promote CEN binding to DNA, and types of RNAs that stabilize binding match those present in kinetores in vivo. Removal of the binding module with HIVase domain causes partial delocalization of CEN in vivo.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that centrom RNA helps recruit CEN to kinetores by altering DNA characteristics, providing a biochemical mechanism for involvement in centrom specification. Single-stranded RNA facilitates binding, indicating centrom serves as an epetic mark mediating final assembly. We propose a model where CEN is first recruited by protein-protein contacts, then converted to DNA-binding protein by centrom RNA.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of epetic information transmission independent of DNA sequence, where centrom RNA plays a crucial role in kinore assembly. This is supported by data from maize and human studies, where centrom RNAs are transcribed and bound to chromatin, and RNA treatment delocalizes CEN from kinores. Suppression of centrom transcription impairs kinore formation, suggesting RNA stabilizes protein association with centrom DNA. Our findings implicate CEN as a primary target of this activity, and propose a self-reinforcing kinore process where proteins replicate and position centrom.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Placental Transcriptome and eQTLs in Mediating Genetic Determinants of Birth Weight, Childhood Obesity, and Body Mass Index: Implications for Therapeutic Interventions

**Research Question:** What is the role of placental transcriptome and eQTLs in mediating genetic causes of birth weight, childhood obesity, and body mass index, and how do they contribute to anthropometric outcomes at birth and childhood phenotypes?

**Methods:** We conducted an integrative analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci associated with birth weight (BW), childhood obesity (CO), and body mass index (BMI) and applied colocalization and meta-analysis to examine the role of placental transcript and eQs in mediating genetic causes of these traits. We compared placental eQs with eQs from adult tissues, including adipose, liver, and skeletal muscle.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that placental eQs are significantly enriched for GWAS hits (6.76, 4.83, and 2.26 folds for BW, CO, and BMI, respectively) and contribute substantially to anthropometric outcomes at birth and childhood phenotypes. We identified eight and six transcripts colocalized with BW and BMI risk loci, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that placental transcription in utero plays a key role in determining postnatal body size and may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of placenta as a relevant tissue for determining not only weight at birth but also body in childhood. Identifying genes mediating genetic predisposition for BW, CO, and BMI is crucial for understanding mechanisms controlling traits and developing prevention strategies. Integrative genomics can be a powerful tool to mine GW results. Our findings support the hypothesis that genetically controlled in utero expression linked to BW, CO, and BMI.

**Conclusions:** This study showcases the influence of genetically controlled in utero patterns on BW, CO, and BMI and supports the role of placenta in neonatal and long-term child outcomes. We demonstrate that placental eQs are enriched to a greater extent for CO, BMI GW hits than eQs from other tissues, including adipose and liver. Our findings have implications for understanding mechanisms controlling traits and developing prevention strategies.

**Title:** Evaluation of Diagnostic Tools and Treatment Outcomes for Post-Kala-Azar Dermatitis (PKDL) in an Endemic Area of West Bengal, India

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes of Post-Kala-Azar Dermatitis (PK) in an endemic area of Malda district, West Bengal, India, and compare three diagnostic tools for PK detection, and pattern of lesion regression after treatment.

**Methods:** A total of 26 PK cases were detected with a prevalence of 27.5% among leishmanial antibody positive cases. Patients were treated with either sodium stibogluconate (SG) or miltefosine and followed for two years to observe lesion period. Three diagnostic methods were used: PCR, slit smear, and r-39 strip. PCR was highly sensitive (88.46%) for confirmation.

**Findings:** Majority of skin lesions persisted after treatment but gradually disappeared 6-12 months post-treatment. Reappearance of lesions noted in two cases after 1.5 years milteine treatment. A significant number of PK patients remained undiagnosed without active surveys.

**Implications:** Such surveys are required in other endemic areas to attain the goal of eliminating Kalaazar. PCR method is helpful in confirming PK diagnosis, laboratory at district or state level can achieve. A well-designed study with higher samples is essential to establish whether PK patients are free from parasite after treatment and which need longer treatment.

**Conclusion:** PKDL is a sequel of leishiasis generally develops after successful cure from visceral leishias (VL). Unlike VL, PK is not a life-threatening condition. Its cosmetic values do not bother patients who do not seek medical care and maintain parasite in population. Leishias is a neglected disease with major impact worldwide. PKDL is dermal manifestation by macular, maculopular or nodular rash caused L. donani. In this study, sensitivity of primary PCR was 65.4% increased to 88.5% in nested PCR. PCR negative in cases with similar lesions difficult to differentiate from PK. Slit smears from PK and non-PK cases were negative for acid fast bacilli. All patients positive antileman antibody r-39 strip. Parasite detected in 4 with sensitivity 15.38% whom 3 nodular and one papular. Paras DNA detected by PCR 23 with 88.46%.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Competence Development in Streptococcus pneumoniae: A Two-Step Process Involving Self-Activated Cells and Cell-to-Cell Contact

**Research Question:** How does the competence development of Streptoccus pneumoniae populations in liquid cultures occur, and what is the role of exported Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP) in this process?

**Methods:** We monitored competence development in real-time during growth of four distinct pneumocococcal lineages and found that the shift to competence relies on a self-activated fraction that arises via a growth-dependent mechanism. CSP remains bound to cells during this event, and the rate of competence corresponds to propagation by contact between activated and quiescent cells. We validated this two-step cell-sensing mechanism by measuring competence during co-cultivation of strains altered to produce or respond to CSP.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that pneumoccal competence development in liquid cultures is a two-step process: a fraction of cells initially switches to CSP-expression, which then induces competence in the whole population. We propose that this second step occurs through transmission of CSP between cells via random cell-cell collision.

**Implications:** This study provides evidence that pneumoccal competence is a two-step process, involving self-activated cells and cell-to-cell contact. We propose that competence cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a distinct subpopulation that transmits CSP by cell contact. This mechanism promotes horizontal gene transfer and genome plasticity in pneumocci, contributing to evasion of vaccines, antibiotics, and host defenses.

**Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the importance of cell-to-cell contact in pneumoccal competence, a feature central to the concept of autocrine development. We demonstrate that neo-synthesized CSP is retained on competent cells of distinct pneumoc lineages, a general feature of pneumocci. The GT mechanism underlying pneumoc competence is growth-dependent (GTD), linked to metabolic state of cells, not cell density. This study provides a new perspective on stochasticity of competence development at the single cell level and highlights the role of cell-to-cell contact in pneumcal competence.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Human Papillomavirus 16 (HPV) Type 16 L2 Protein-Mediated Genome Trafficking from Endosomes to the Trans-Golgi Network (TGN) and Nucleus

**Research Question:** How does the human papillomavirus 16 (HPV) type 16 L2 protein facilitate the trafficking of the viral genome (vDNA) from endosomes to the trans-Gol network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus, where replication occurs?

**Methods:** We developed a subcellular compartmentalization system using the enzyme BirA and its cognate substrate to detect the membrane translocation of L2 from incoming virions.

**Findings:** L2 translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell arrest retention of L/vDNA at the TGN only and progression past G2/M enables translocation across the limiting membrane and infection. Microscopy of Ed-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid and dramatic shift in vDNA localization during mitosis. At G2/early phase vDNA egress from T to pericentolar location, accumulating through prometaph where it begins to associate with condensed chromosomes. By metaphase and anaphase v is bound to mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into daughter nuclei.

**Implications:** Mutations in a defined chromatin binding of L block translocation, suggesting translocation dependent on chromatin during prometaph. This represents the first time a virus has functionally coupled penetration of limiting membranes to mitosis, explaining part of HPV tropism for mitotic keratinocytes.

**Conclusions:** We have developed a novel system to study translocation of the L/v complex during papillavirus infection, an important step in entry that releases L/v from L capsid for trafficking to TGN and nucleus. Breakdown of HPVid requires endosome acidification and dissociation L/v from L penters, activity of host cyclophins. Verification of L-Bir assay examined L trans affected by conditions unating L/L dissociation. Cleavage L by cellular protease furin is critical for HPV. Fur cleavage occurs primarily on surface, not required for binding or uptake endosomal compartment. Cleavage essential for trafficking L/v to TGN, proposed penetration post-GN.

**Title:** Quantifying the Transmissibility of Influenza Strains: A Novel Mathematical Framework for Competitive Mixtures Experiments

**Research Question:** How can we measure the relative transmissibility of one strain of influenza compared to another, and what are the implications for epidemiological dynamics and intervention strategies?

**Methods:** We developed a mathematical framework to estimate the transmiss of competing influenza strains using data from competitive mixtures experiments, where animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains. We observed the mixture in each animal over time over multiple generations of transmission and used data from ferret experiments to demonstrate the approach.

**Findings:** Our method assesses the relative transibility between strains in three contexts: 1) within human populations, where antigenically novel strains compete for susceptible hosts; 2) during pandemics, where a novel type competes with existing strains; and 3) with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), which exert selective pressure on the virus, promoting emergence of drug-resistant strains. The outcome depends on population susceptibility and transibility of the novel strain compared to existing strains. We also estimated the size of the transmitted inoculum, a key parameter for epidemiological models.

**Implications:** Measuring transibility of competing strains is critical for determining the course of an outbreak and impact of interventions like NAIs. Our framework has applicability beyond influenza to other viral and bacterial pathogens.

**Conclusions:** The competitive mixtures paradigm is applicable in all three contexts, making our framework useful for influenza research. We improved experimental design by using multiple ferrets and estimated the number of infecting units transferred from donor to recipient, aiding parameterization of epidemiological models. Our method is also applicable to other pathogens, requiring consideration of within-host dynamics and competitive effects.

**Key contributions:**

1. Developed a mathematical framework for estimating transibility of competing influenza strains
2. Demonstrated applicability in three contexts: seasonal, pandemic, and NAI/NAI interactions
3. Estimated inoculum size, a key parameter for epidemiological models
4. Improved experimental design using multiple ferrets and estimated infecting units
5. Applicability to other pathogens with consideration of within-host dynamics and competitive effects

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of BBX21 in Integrating Light and Abscisic Acid Signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana Seed Germination and Seedling Development

**Research Question:** How do plants integrate external light and endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) signals to adapt to environmental stresses during seed germination and seedling development?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of BB21, a B-box transcription factor previously implicated in seedling photomorphogenesis, in ABA signaling using genetic approaches in Arabidopsis thaliana.

**Findings:** Our data show that BB21 acts upstream of ABA INSENSITIVE (ABI) and ELONGATED HYCOTYL5 (HY5) in ABA control seed germination. We demonstrate that BB21 negatively regulates ABI expression by interfering with HY binding to the ABI promoter. Additionally, ABI activates its own expression, whereas BB21 negatively regulates this activity by interacting with ABI. Our study indicates that BB coordinates with HY and ABI on the ABI promoter, integrating light and A signaling in Arabidopsis.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of integrating light and ABA in seed germination and early seedling development, highlighting the importance of transcriptional regulation in plant adaptation to environmental cues. Our findings suggest that multiple factors in light pathway regulate A responses by controlling ABI expression, underscoring the complexity of cross-talk between external and internal signals.

**Conclusions:** BB21, a transcriptional regulator of seedling photomorph, is involved in ABA signaling, regulating ABI expression by interacting with HY and ABI. Our study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying integration of light and A in Arabidopsis, shedding light on plant adaptation to environmental stresses.

**Title:** Conservation and Divergence of Mediator Functions in the Pathogenic Fungus Candida albicans

**Research Question:** How does the Mediator complex, a co-regulator of RNA polymerase II, function in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, and how does it compare to its functions in model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizoscharomyces pombe?

**Methods:** We investigated the Mediator complex in C. albicans, focusing on the Med31, Med20, and S9/M13 subunits, and compared its functions to those in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.

**Findings:** C. alb Med shares conserved roles with S. cere and S. pom in response to stresses and Med31's role in Ace2-regulated gene expression. However, C. Med has additional roles in virulence genes, such as morphogenesis and adhesins. Med31,20, and S9/M13 contribute to virulence attributes of C. alb, including filamentation, biofilm formation, and ALS1 is a biologically relevant target of Med for biofilm development. Moreover, Med affects virulence of C in the worm model.

**Implications:** Med subunits regulate adhesion differently between C. alb and S cerevis, repressing FLO genes in S. cere and activating ALS in C. alb. This suggests distinct Med-dependent control of adhesion between two distantly related species.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals conserved and divergent functions of Med in C. alb compared to S cere and S pom, with additional roles in virulence genes, notably adhes. Phenotypic analysis shows Med subunits' roles in C. alb pathogenesis, including filament growth, biofilm, and cell adhesion. Data suggest distinct Med-dependent control of adhesion between two yeasts.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Biofilm-Specific Cellular State and Genetic Determinants in Antibiotic Tolerance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa

**Research Question:** What is the degree to which the biofilm cellular state and its constituent genetic determinants contribute to the hyper-tolerant phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa compared to its planktonic counterparts?

**Methods:** We employed genome-wide functional profiling of a complex, heterogeneous mutant population of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MO1 in biofilm and plankic growth conditions with tobramycin to systematically quantify the contribution of each locus to antibiotic tolerance under these states.

**Findings:** We identified large sets of mutations that contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or plankic setting, offering insights into the differences and similarities between biofilm and plankic antibiotic tolerance. Our population-based experimental design recapitulated the complexity of biofilms, unlike previous studies, revealing clinically observed behaviors including the emergence of quorum-deficient mutants.

**Implications:** Our study revealed a substantial contribution of the cellular state to antibiotic tolerance of biofilms, providing a foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against Pseudomonasugin bio-associated infections.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a comprehensive and systematic examination of the role of biofilm-specific cellular and genetic determinants in antibiotic tolerance, highlighting the importance of cellular state and gene-environment interactions in modulating antibiotic tolerance. Our results demonstrate that while there is considerable overlap between loci modulating tolerance in biofilm and plankic cells, the importance of most genes is state-specific. For instance, the majority of mutants with strongest fitness advantages in bio state have only weak advantages in plankic state. These findings have significant implications for the development of targeted therapeutics against Pseudasugin biofilm infections.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Biofilm-specific cellular state and genetic determinants significantly contribute to antibiotic tolerance in Pseudas.
* Genome-wide profiling of a complex mutant population recapitulates the complexity of biofilms and reveals clinically observed behaviors.
* Cellular state and gene-environment interactions modulate antibiotic tolerance in bio and plankic states.
* Most genes contributing to tolerance in bio have weak or no effect in plankic state, and vice versa.
* Study provides foundation for novel therapeutics against Pseud bio-associated infections.

**Title:** Development of a Flexible and Dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection (FoS) to Analyze Complex Biological Systems with Large Model Spaces

**Research Question:** How can we develop an algorithm that efficiently searches and selects the best model for complex biological systems with large model spaces?

**Methods:** We developed a novel algorithm, Flexible Algorithm for Model Selection (FoS), which combines local and non-local search methods to prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local minima of the model space, accounting for structurally similar processes. We tested and validated the algorithm on simulated data, demonstrating its flexibility in handling various model structures. Additionally, we applied the algorithm to experimental data on CD4+ and CD8 T cells cultured under different conditions.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed dynamical changes in proliferation of cells within tissue-like 3D ex vivo cultures compared to suspension cultures. The algorithm's flexibility in handling various structures makes it applicable to diverse biological problems and a useful tool for data-driven evaluation of complex spaces.

**Implications:** The development of improved search and selection algorithms for complex model spaces is crucial for research. Our FoS addresses this need by efficiently searching large spaces to provide a systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics. Unlike existing algorithms, FoS does not rely on exhaustive searches or predefined structures, making it more feasible for complex systems.

**Conclusions:** FoS is a valuable tool for analyzing complex biological systems with large model spaces. Its flexibility in handling diverse structures makes it applicable to various problems, unlike other algorithms designed for specific structures. The algorithm's ability to prevent local minima and account for structurally similar processes enables efficient exploration of large spaces, providing a systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics.

**Title:** Evaluating the Efficacy of Benznidazole Treatment in Children with Chronic Chagas Disease: A 12-Month Follow-Up Study

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of benidazole (BN) treatment in seropositive children with chronic Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), in Bolivia, where the National Chagas program has been implemented since 2006.

**Methods:** A 12-month follow-up study was conducted on 103 seropitive children living in certified vector control areas, who received BN treatment. Blood samples were taken at baseline, 3, 6, and 9, and 12 months. Serology, conventional PCR, and real-time PCR were performed. Th1/2/17 cytokine levels, including IL-17, were determined.

**Findings:** Approximately 73% of children completed treatment, with 3 due to side effects. Among 57 who completed follow-up, 6 (11%) showed both PCR+ and qPCR+, 24 (42%) PCR- but q+, and 27 (47%) PCR- and q- reactive. IL-17 levels were significantly higher in seropitive children before treatment compared to age-matched seronegative and decreased to normal one-year. IL-17 levels were positively related to parasite counts by qPCR. At 12 months, IL-17 of non-reactive subjects were higher than reactive or ambiguous, suggesting IL-17 might determine reactivity to BN treatment.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of considering factors other than pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BN in treatment efficacy, particularly in non-react group. Identifying reasons for non-cure requires further study of host and parasite factors. IL-17 might be a biomarker for persistent T. cruzi infection and chronic inflammation.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of IL-17 as a biomarker for detecting reactivity to BN treatment and persistent T. cruzi infection. Further research is needed to understand the role of host and parasite factors in treatment failure.

**Title:** Characterization of Coria Elements in Neisseria meningitidis: A Novel Mechanism for Phase Variation and Transcriptional Regulation

**Research Question:** What is the role of Coria elements in the Neisseria meningidis genome and how do they contribute to transcriptional regulation and phase variation?

**Methods:** Bioinformatic analysis, transcriptional analysis using PCR and lacZ reporter system, and pairwise comparisons of three meningocococcal genomes.

**Findings:** Eight subtypes of Coria elements with distinct transcriptional ends were identified, four of which encode strong promoters. The strongest promoter activity is dictated by a polymorphism Y128 at the right end of the element. Some elements drive transcription of adjacent genes, while others express non-coding RNAs. Pairwise comparisons revealed that more than two-thirds of Coria elements maintain their subtype at a particular locus due to recombinational switching between elements in a single strain.

**Implications:** The strain-to-strain variability of Coria and the number of strong promoters encoded by them allows for widespread effects within the population. Defining the strength of promoters by subtypes Coria provides a resource to predict transcriptional effects at a given locus.

**Conclusions:** Coria elements in Neisser meningidis represent a novel mechanism for phase variation and transcriptional regulation. The large number of strong promoters encoded by subtypes and strain-to-strain variability allows for widespread effects within the population. This mechanism may contribute to the development of hypervirulent lineages responsible for global meningoc disease.

**Title:** Regulation of Secondary Metabolism and Differentiation in Aspergillus spp. Orthologs Chae and Chel in Response to Light Signals

**Research Question:** How do the Aspergillus spp. orthologs Chae and Chel regulate secondary metabolism and differentiation in response to light signals?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Chae and Chel in regulating secondary metabolism and differentiation in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostus, known to produce a wealth of secondary metabolites, including the selective toxin T-toxin, which promotes virulence to maize carrying Texas sterile cytoplasm (Tms). We analyzed toxin production and gene expression in wild-type (WT), Chel and Chae mutants, and overexpression (OE) strains grown in light and dark conditions.

**Findings:** T-toxin production was significantly increased in the dark in WT, whereas Chel and Chae mutant levels were reduced compared to WT. Expression of T-to biosynthetic gene Tox1 was upregulated in the dark in WT, while dark-induced expression was minimal in Chel and Chae mutants. T production and Tox gene expression were increased in Chel overexpression (OE) grown in dark and Chae in light compared to WT. These observations establish Chae and Chel as the first known factors regulating selective toxin production. Virulence of Ch and Ch mutants and OE was altered on Tms and normal cytoplasm maize, indicating both T-to mediated virulence and pathogenic ability affected. Deletion Ch or Ch reduced tolerance to H2O2. Expression CAT, one of three catalase genes, was reduced in Chel mutant. Ch and Ch mutants showed decreased hyphal growth, asexual sporulation, and sterility. Chel OE were sterile, while Ch OE were more fertile than WT. Ch and Ch repressed 1,8-dihydroxynthalene (DH) melanin biosynthesis genes, accordingly, melanization enhanced in Ch and Ch mutants and reduced in OE.

**Implications:** These data suggest that Ch and Ch positively regulate T production under dark conditions; however, some toxin produced by mutants indicates an additional biosynthesis mechanism independent of Ch and Ch. Overproduction in OE strains suggests regulatory associated light signals disturbed. Results are consistent with T assay, which T production decreased in Ch and Ch mutants under conditions, demonstrating Ch required for positive regulation T genes in dark. Expression of Ch and Ch were upshifted in Ch and OE strains. Overexpression caused modest increase T gene in dark but not light compared WT, consistent toxin observations. Strains overexpressing or most involved in production upregulated in dark compared WT. In contrast, OE grown dark and WT and OE light, expression strongly upregulated in OE, with profuse production.

**Conclusions:** Ch and Ch regulate production through transcriptional control Tox genes. To confirm Ch and act as positive regulators, expression of nine Tox genes (PK, PK, DEC, RED, RED, TOX, OI, L) examined WT, Ch, and Ch strains in light and dark conditions.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Ion Selectivity in Bacterial Nav Channels through Non-Equilibrium Simulations

**Research Question:** How do non-equilibrium simulations reveal the mechanism of ion selectivity in bacterial Nav channels, and what are the implications for our understanding of ion permeation through these channels?

**Methods:** We combined non-equilibrium simulations with two-dimensional unperturbed landscapes generated by umbrella sampling and Weighted Histogram Analysis for ions traversing the selectivity filter of bacterial Nav channel Ab. This approach provided new insight into the mechanism of selective permeation in bacterial Nav.

**Findings:** Non-equilibrium simulations indicate that two extracellular K+ ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter of Nav in the presence of applied forces in the inward direction, but not the outward. The block occurs in an unstable minimum of the unperturbed free-energy of K+ that can be 'locked in place by applied forces. In contrast, Na+ move favor through the selectivity together as a unit in a "knock" mechanism of permeation in both inward and outward, and there is no similar minimum in the two-dimensional free-energy of Na+ for block. The work predicted by non-equ simulations to break the K block is equivalent to applied experimentally measured for bacterial channels to induce currents of K+.

**Implications:** The mechanism of selectivity in bacterial Nav emerges from these results differs from those from crystal or equilibrium landscapes and is consistent with electrophysiological measurements. Non-equilibrium simulations provide detailed information about mechanisms of selectivity missing from structures or equilibrium landscapes.

**Conclusions:** Our non-equilibrium simulations suggest a "pass" configuration for potassium in presence can block selectivity in bacterial channels and prevent permeation of K at negative voltages inward, though block is unstable in equilibrium. Values coincide with experimentally applied for bacterial to induce currents K in ionic conditions. Molecular simulations of perme through Nav have unpert-free barrier for perme Na and K of 1 kcal consistent with estimates P/P permeability of 20-40 from experimental for eary channels under biionic conditions.

**Title:** Comparative Analysis of Rabies Virus Colonization in the Central Nervous System: A Study of Furious and Paralytic Forms in Canine Rabies

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the differences in rabies virus colonization in the central nervous system (CNS) between furious and paralytic forms of canine rabies, focusing on viral antigen levels in neuronal cell bodies and processes.

**Methods:** A cohort of 10 naturally infected, non-vaccinated dogs (5 furious, 5 paralytic) were sacrificed shortly after illness onset. Measurements were taken at spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebrum levels, comparing rabies antigen in neuronal bodies and processes.

**Findings:** Rabies antigen levels in processes decreased rostrally, following the pattern of antigen in neuronal bodies and percentage of involved cells. However, a delay in process involvement was observed, consistent with replication in bodies and subsequent transport to processes. Greater antigen amounts were seen in processes in furious compared to paraly form at all examined levels, even with similar amounts, percentages, and 100% positive neurons. This suggests slower intracellular transport in paraly form, resulting in slower viral propagation. Possible mechanisms involve host-specific intracellular transport, potentially cytokine-mediated, given greater inflammation in paraly form.

**Implications:** This study extends our understanding of rabies virus spread in CNS, highlighting differences between furious and paraly forms. Quantitative analysis of antigen in processes provides a visual representation of viral spread. Results complement previous studies on neuronal bodies and RNA levels, demonstrating caud-rostral polarity of viral distribution in both forms.

**Conclusions:** Rabies antigen in processes decreased caud to rostrally in both forms, most extensive at brainstem and spinal levels in furious. Higher RNA levels in furious suggest slower propagation in paraly form. These findings have implications for understanding rabies pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies.

**Title:** Characterization of CTC Binding Sites in Drosophila Reveals a Common Mechanism for Insulator Function in the BX-C Region

**Research Question:** How does the zinc-finger protein CTC regulate transcription by preventing enhancer-promoter interaction in Dophila?

**Methods:** Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis was used to identify CTC binding sites in representative regions of the Dophila genome, including the 3-M Adh region, BX, and Antennedia complex. In vivo CTC binding enabled the construction of a CTC binding consensus sequence.

**Findings:** CTC sites in BX map precisely to known insulators Mc, Fab-6, and Fab-8, and correlate with boundaries of regulatory domains, locating additional presumptive insulators Fab-2, Fab-3, and Fab-4. With exception Fab-7, data indicate CTC is associated with all or predicted insulators in BX, suggesting a common CTC-dependent mechanism. Comparison of CTC sites with Polycomb target and histone modification supports BX regulation model.

**Implications:** This study opens the prospect of utilizing genetic and molecular characterization of BX transcription regulation for analysis of CTC function. ChIP-array investigation of C sites in Doph genome, focusing on BX, reveals CTC not only associated with Fab-8 but also mapped elements Fab- and Mc.

**Conclusions:** CTC plays a crucial role in regulating transcription by preventing enhancer-promoter interaction in Doph, and its binding sites in BX suggest a common mechanism for insulator function. ChIP analysis enabled construction of C binding consensus, mapping sites to propose known or predicted insulators in BX, except Fab7, function in C-dependent manner.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Induced Conformational Changes in Enzyme-Ligand Interactions: A Structural and Kinetic Insights into the Slow-Binding of Acton to Peptideylase

**Research Question:** How do enzymes recognize and bind their substrates, and what is the role of conformational changes in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of crystallographic, biophysical, and computational analyses to investigate the slow-binding mechanism of acton, a tight inhibitor of peptide deformylase, a metal-dependent enzyme. We solved crystal structures of the initial and final states, as well as intermediate snapshots during the process, and integrated these with biochemical data to reconstruct the sequence of events from encounter to key binding.

**Findings:** Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, which is "zipped" by additional interactions. Biochemical analyses allowed a coherent reconstruction of the sequence of events from encounter to key binding. A "movie" of the process can be extrapolated to catalysis.

**Implications:** Our study provides a detailed mechanism of induced conformational changes in enzyme-lig interactions at atomic resolution, shedding light on the slow-binding phenomenon. This work has implications for the broader area of receptor-lig interactions and therapeutics, as slow-binding molecules exhibit unique inhibitory properties, including potency and long-lasting effects.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of integrating structural, biophysical, and kinetic analyses to reconstruct the picture of slow-binding mechanisms. The induced-fit mechanism of enzyme inhibition and catalysis is applicable to receptor-lig interactions. The precise inhibitory mechanism of acton, a slow-binding inhibitor of peptide deformase, is elucidated, providing insights into the conformational changes during binding. This study contributes to understanding the fundamental process of enzyme-substrate recognition and the role of conformation in catalysis.

**Title:** Deciphering the Thalamic Relay: A Novel Mechanisms of Sensory Information Transfer and Attentional Modulation

**Research Question:** How does the thalamus, the primary gateway to the cerebral cortex, process and transmit sensory information, and what role does cortical feedback play in this process?

**Methods:** Using dynamic clamp techniques on thal slices in vitro, we combined theoretical and experimental approaches to simulate a realistic retinthalocortical pathway, mimicking cortical synaptic bombardment through stochastic excitatory and inhibitory conductances. We studied the impact of cortical input on retinocort signal efficiency, revealing a novel mechanism resulting from collective thal relay resonance.

**Findings:** Our results show that retinoc signal efficiency depends on three key features: (i) thalamocort cell convergence, (ii) corticothal synaptic statistics, and (iii) correlation between thal relay cells. Counterintuitively, efficiency increases with decreased correlation across thal cells, suggesting simultaneous desynchronization amplifies transfer.

**Implications:** This regulation mechanism could direct attention to specific thal subassemblies and select input to cortex according to cortically-defined priorities. We propose decorrelation of background activity in thal layer optimizes retin signal transfer, emerging from a population effect controlling efficiency.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals novel insights into thal processing and attentional modulation. Cortical control of thal transfer by tunable excitatory and inhibitory background presents advantages over neuromodulation: dynamic, fast, and topographically precise. We propose stochastic facilitation at thal level enhances sensory transfer in decorrelated cortogenic feedback, a basis for attentional modulation.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Nucleic Acid Methylation in Meiosis: A Critical Function of Putative Demethylase NM-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** The biological roles of nucleic acid methylation beyond the C5 position of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides remain poorly understood. This study investigates the function of putative demethylase NM-1 in regulating meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans.

**Methods:** We generated nmad-1 mutants with reduced fertility, exhibiting defects in prophase I meiosis, leading to reduced embryo production and increased incidence of males due to chromosomal segregation errors. Nuclear staging at leptotene and zygote stages was disorganized, cohesin complex mislocalized at diplot and diakinesis, and chromosomes improperly condensed or lost by end diakinesis. RNA sequencing of nmad-1 germline revealed induction of DNA replication and damage response genes during meiosis, coupled with delayed replication, impaired repair, and apoptosis of maturing oocytes.

**Findings:** Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified NM-1 binding to proteins regulating DNA repair and replication, including topoisomerase TOP-2, co-localizing with TOP-2 on chromatin. Majority of TOP-2 binding chromatin depended on NM-1. These results suggest NM-1 functions at replication sites to regulate DNA and repair during meiosis.

**Implications:** NM-1 plays a critical role in DNA replication and damage during meiosis in Caenorhabdis. NM- binds same sites on chromatin as TOP-2, physically interacts with TOP- in vitro and in vivo, suggesting NM- acts on chrom to regulate processes meiosis in Caenor.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of NM- in regulating meiosis and DNA repair, underscoring the need for further investigation into its mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications.

**Title:** Identification of Adipocyte Plasma-Associated Protein (AAP) as a Novel Modulator of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Infection

**Research Question:** What is the role of adipocyte plasma-associated protein (AAP) in the early stage of human cytomegalovirus (HCV) infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of AAP in HCV infection in epithelial cells and fibroblasts by knocking down AAP expression and ectopically expressing AAP in cells refractory to HCV infection.

**Findings:** Knockdown of AAP significantly reduced HCV infection in epithelial and fibroblasts, while ectopic expression of AAP promoted HCV infection in canine and murine cells. Biochemical studies suggested AAP interacts with HCV glycoproteins at low pH and mediates tegument pp65 translocation.

**Implications:** AAP is a novel modulator of early HCV infection and plays a crucial role in the complex HCV mechanism.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate AAP functions as a promoter of HCV infection in multiple cell types and is an important player in the HCV mechanism. HCV entry may rely on different cellular receptors and routes, and AAP is necessary for HCV infection in epithelial and fibro cells. Overexpression of AAP enhanced HCV entry in non-susceptible cells, canine and murine NIH3T cells. Reduced IE transcription and delayed tegument pp65 translocation were detected in AAP-deficient cells at early HCV infection. Biochemical studies suggest AAP participates HCV through interaction with glycoprotein complexes at pH and mediates tegument pp translocation.

**Key findings:**

* AAP is a novel modulator of early HCV infection
* AAP is necessary for HCV in epithelial and fibro cells
* Overexpression of AAP promotes HCV in non-sceptible cells
* Reduced IE transcription and delayed tegument pp translocation in AAP-deficient cells
* Biochemical studies suggest AAP interacts with glyrotein at pH and mediates tegument trans

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Cytokine-Mediated Regulation in Hematopoiesis: A Minimal Model of Lineage Commitment

**Research Question:** How do extrinsic and intrinsic elements of regulation interact to inform cell decisions in hematopoies, and what is the role of cytokine-mediated receptor feedback in lineage commitment?

**Methods:** We developed a mathematical model combining cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic elements to investigate instruct and stochastic events in hematopoies. Our model incorporates lineage-specific transcription factors and cytokine receptors to simulate multilineage differentiation and commitment.

**Findings:** Our results suggest that cytokine-mediated receptor feedback can induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced decommitment. The model supports both instruct and stochastic theories of commitment: cell fates are driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling strongly biases lineage by regulating inherently noisy cellate decisions with complex behaviors such as ligand ultrasensitivity and multistability.

**Implications:** The kinetics of differentiation to a mature state depend on the progenitor as well as the route of commitment chosen. Our model agrees with lineage-specific receptor kinetics from microarray experiments, providing a framework to integrate classical and alternative paths hematopoies observed experimentally.

**Conclusions:** This work highlights the importance of extrinsic regulation in instructing lineage choice and how cells respond to conflicting cues. Cytokines have been debated as instructive or permissive during commitment. We show that cell decisions can be stochastic but external cues strongly bias stochastic and instruct to specific lineages, underscoring the need to understand extracellular cues in isolation or combination influence hematies. Committed or "on" cell, such as prothroblast, expresses receptor and transcription of single lineage at high and terminally differentiates mature. Our model topology informed by experimental lineage receptors and transcription factors. Lineage transcription and cytok play critical roles in commitment and differentiation.

**Title:** Unveiling the Ultrastructure of Bunyamwera Virus: A Prototypic Member of the Emerging Orthobunavirus Genus

**Research Question:** Despite the significant impact of orthobunaviruses on human and animal health, little is known about their ultrastructure, which is crucial for understanding virus assembly and entry. This study aimed to elucidate the ultrastructure of Bunamwara virus, the prototypic member of the orthunavirus genus, using cryo-electron microscopy.

**Methods:** Cryo-electron microscopy and subtomography were employed to determine the ultrastructure of Bunamara virions, revealing a pleomorphic shape with a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes. Each spike protruded 18 nm from the membrane and disordered upon acidic environment introduction. Subtom averaging yielded a three-dimensional model of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein at 3 nm resolution.

**Findings:** The glycoprotein consisted of putative class-II fusion glycoprotein with a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein-protein contacts occurred at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike at membrane-dist regions. This trimer deviated from previously observed fusion glycop arrangements, suggesting a greater repertoire of viral glycoprotein oligomerization.

**Implications:** Our study provides evidence of pH-dependent conformation change during orthobunaviral entry into host cells and a blueprint for the structure of this emerging group of pathogens. Sequence conservation of BUN glycoproteins with pathogenic relatives, such as SBV and OVV, indicates high structural similarity.

**Conclusions:** This study addresses the paucity of information on orthunavirus ultrastructure, providing the first 3-D analysis and a model for this medically important group. A unique mode of glyprotein oligomerization was observed, dissimilar to known classes. Orthobunaviruses constitute a structurally unique group, distinct from other bunaviruses, with pleomorphic and icosahedral organization. The distinctive tripod structure of BUN spike provides a structural blueprint for this emerging viruses.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies ABCC5 as a Novel Risk Gene for Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG) in Asian Populations

**Research Question:** Is anterior chamber depth (ACD) a key anatomical risk factor for primary closure glaucoma (PACG) in Asian populations, and can genome-wide association study (GWAS) identify novel genes associated with PG?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 5,308 individuals of Asian descent to discover genes associated with PG, and a separate case-control study of 4,276 PG cases and 18,801 controls to validate the findings.

**Findings:** Genome-wide significant association was observed at the ABCC5 locus (rs199) with a per-allele effect size of -0.045 (P=8.17×10-9), associated with an increased risk of PG in the case-control study (per-OR=1.13 [95% CI: 1.06-1.22, P=0.000). The association strengthened when a subgroup of controls with open angles were included (per-OR=1.30, P=7.45×10-9, 3,458 vs. 3,831).

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that increased PG risk could be mediated by genetic variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions. This is consistent with anatomical risk factors of individual susceptibility to PG, where shallower AC is a cardinal and pathogenic feature, predisposing the eye to a 'crow' anterior segment and increasing PG risk.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides clues to genetic mechanisms underlying major cause of blindness. Resequencing the region is necessary to identify novel polymorphisms related to PG pathogenesis. The prevalence of precursor PG, narrow angles, is 10% in many populations, given association with closure and AC, it is appropriate to remove 'at-risk' individuals to assess true relationship ACD and PG.

**Title:** Identification of Bilaterally Conserved Regulatory Elements (BREs): Bridging the Divide between Deuterostomes and Protostomes

**Research Question:** Despite the shared developmental toolkit of conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways between deuteromes and protomes, previous studies have found no regulatory sequence conservation between these two clades. This study aims to identify and characterize bilaterally conserved regulatory elements (BREs) that bridge the divide between deuteromes and protomes.

**Methods:** We employed bioinformatics and experimental approaches to identify and characterize Bres, including sequence conservation analysis, gene synteny, and transcription factor binding site prediction.

**Findings:** We present the first examples of developmental enhancers conserved between deuteromes and protomes, which we term Bilater Conserved Elements (BREs). Bres show sequence and gene synteny conservation, reflecting conserved patterns of transcription factor binding sites. We predict that Bres act as response elements to signaling pathways and demonstrate that Bres are developmental enhancers driving expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system.

**Implications:** The discovery of Bres suggests extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between protome and deuterome clades. As more genomes are sequenced and our understanding of cis-regulatory logic improves, additional Bres may be revealed. Alternatively, ancestral regulatory regions conserved between clades may remain elusive due to limitations in tools and sample bilian genomes. If conserved-reg elements exist, they offer a new avenue for exploring developmental logic encoded in the genome and its evolution.

**Conclusions:** This study presents the first examples of cis-regulatory conserved elements between deuter and protomes. Bres are developmental enhancers encoding complex patterns of transcription factor binding. Bic1 is an enhancer with predicted to function as a BMP responsive element, supported by experimental evidence. In vertebrates, B1 drives expression in the central nervous system during early differentiation. The small number of identified Bres implies extensive cis-regulatory rewiring. If Bres are the only examples of conserved elements, we ask what makes them unique. As our catalog of genomic regions and ability to probe relatives grow, understanding of cis-reg sequence and function underlying animal development will improve.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Vaccine-Induced Immunity on Intra-host Diversity of Influenza Virus during Natural Infection

**Research Question:** What is the relationship between vaccine-induced immunity and intra-host diversity of influenza virus during natural infection?

**Methods:** We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy and used next-generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity within populations. We obtained 166 cases of H3N influenza over 3 seasons and 511 person-years, with whole genome data for 119 samples. We used a stringent empirically validated pipeline to identify intra-host single nucleotide variants ≥1% and phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin and neuraminase sequences.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, our data indicate that seasonal vaccination has little impact on intra-host diversity in natural infection, and vaccine immunity may be a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales. Most intra-host single nucleotide variants were rare, and few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 nucleotide variants across the genome, and diversity did not vary with sampling day, vaccination status, or pre-antibody titer.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that vaccine-induced immunity may not be a significant selective pressure for novel variants at the individual or community level, contrary to what has been suggested in experimental systems. We did not find differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations with respect to genome or antigen diversity in H3N seasons. Understanding intra-host diversity and its impact on virus evolution is crucial for defining larger patterns of influenza.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that vaccine-induced immunity has little impact on intra-host diversity during natural infection, and may be a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales. While we cannot rule out differences in other regions, seasons, or subtypes, our data suggest that vaccine-induced immunity is not a major driver of intra-host diversity. Further research is needed to understand evolutionary forces shaping viral populations within hosts and rise to novel variants at population level.

**Title:** Investigating the Efficacy of Genetically Modified Live Attenuated Leishmania donani (LC-/-) in Inducing Innate and Adaptive Immune Response in Aged and Young Mice

**Research Question:** Can genetically modified live attenuated Leishmania donani (LC-) induce a protective immune response in aged mice against visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donani?

**Methods:** In this study, we analyzed the modulation of innate and adaptive immune response in aged (18 months) and young (2 months) mice infected with LC- parasites. We evaluated the response of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and splenic dendritic cells from both aged and young mice upon infection with LC- and compared to wild-type (LWT) parasites. Additionally, we assessed the in vivo protection of LC-immunized young and aged mice against virulent L. donani challenge.

**Findings:** Our results showed that LC- infection significantly enhanced innate effector responses in BMDCs from both aged and young mice, augmenting CD4+ Th cell function compared to LWT-infected BMDC in vitro. Parasitized splenic dendritic cells from LC-infected young and aged mice revealed induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6, IF-γ, and TNF) and downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) compared to LWT-infected mice. Immunization with LC- induced IgG2 antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, pro-inflammatory responses, and splenocytes heightened leishicidal activity with nitric production in young and aged mice. Upon virulent L. donani challenge, LC-immun mice from both groups displayed multifunctional Th-type CD and cytotoxic CD T cells correlating to reduced parasite burden in spleen and liver compared naïve mice.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that LC- immunization induced a significant but diminished protective response in aged mice after virulent L. donani challenge compared young mice. Although there was no difference in LC-induced response dendritic cells between aged and young, adaptive response in terms of T and B cell activation in aged was reduced compared young, correlating less protection in old compared young.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the efficacy of genetically modified live attenuated Leish donani (LC-) in inducing innate and adaptive immune response in aged and young mice against visceral leishiasis, a disease caused by Leish donani. Our results highlight the importance of age in determining clinical outcome of VL and the need for effective vaccine against all age groups.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Capsid Proteins in the Heterogeneity of Enteric and Respiratory Enteroviruses (EVs)

**Research Question:** What are the underlying genetic determinants of the diverse biophysical properties and pathologies caused by enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs), including acid sensitivity, optimal temperature, and tissue tropism?

**Methods:** We generated chimeras at the caps-level between EV-D68 (respiratory EV) and EV-D94 (enteric EV) to investigate the cause of these differences. Although some chimeras were non-functional, EV-D94 with the caps and 2 protease or caps only EV68 were viable. Using the latter construct, we performed functional assays indicating caps proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and respiratory, intestinal, and neural tissues. Additionally, caps genes were shown to participate in determining optimal temperature, EV94 adaptation relied on mutations VP, while constructs EV68 caps could not adapt higher temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate EV68 residual binding capacity after acid-treatment despite loss infectivity.

**Findings:**

* Capsid proteins are necessary and sufficient to determine acid sensitivity and restricted tropism of respiratory EV, as well as optimal temperature.
* Non-structural proteins modulate the innate response in tissues.

**Implications:**

* These biophysical insights expose another layer in the phenotypic diversity of one of world's most prevalent pathogens.
* Could aid selection for vaccine or antiviral development.

**Conclusion:** Using recombinants in vitro between EV68, respiratory and EV94 enteric, we proved caps proteins determine acid and restricted tropism of respiratory, as well as optimal temperature. In contrast, showed innate induction modulated by non-structural proteins. This work identifies regions responsible for differences in determinants viral viability, namely acid, sensitivity, growth, tissueism, and immunity through creation unique chimer.

**Title:** HSV-1 Glycoprotein gE Mediates Immune Evasion through Antibody Bridging and Endocytosis of Viral Antigens

**Research Question:** How does the HSV-1 glycoprotein gE facilitate immune evasion of host immune responses through antibody bridging and endocytosis of viral antigens?

**Methods:** We developed an in vitro system to study the trafficking of bipolar bridging complexes (ABB) involving HSV-1 glycoprotein gE, viral antigen HSV-1D, and human immunoglobulin G (Ig). We co-expressed HSV-1 gE and HSV-1D in a human cell line (HeLa) and investigated the effects of adding IgGs that could or could not form bridged complexes.

**Findings:** Our data showed that cells expressing gE and viral HSV-1D endocyted anti-D Ig and g in a gE-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This suggests that gE can mediate clearance of infected cell surfaces of viral antigens and host Ig, evading Ig-mediated responses.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that HSV-1 glyprotein g can facilitate immune evasion through antibody bridging and endocytosis of viral antigens, representing a general mechanism for viral receptors in immune evasion and pathogenesis.

**Conclusions:** HSV-1 glyprotein g is a transmembrane receptor on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds immunoglobulin G (Ig). It also participates in antibody bridging (ABB), a process by which antigen fragments (Fab) of Ig bind viral antigen while Fc binds gE. IgF binds gE at basic, not acidic pH, suggesting Ig bound extracellular surface gE would dissociate and degrade in acidic endosomes/lysosomes ifocytosed. The fate of viral antigens associated with g-bound Ig had been unknown: could remain at surface or endocyt with Ig. Our results show that g can mediate clearance of infected surfaces of viral antig and host Ig, evading Ig-mediated responses, a mechanism for viral receptors in evasion and pathogenesis.

**Title:** Elucidating the Metabolic Adaptations of Echinococcus granulosus Parasites through Transcriptome Analysis of Excretory-Secretory Proteins

**Research Question:** How do Echinoccus granus parasites subvert the host immune response and maintain metabolic adaptation through their excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs)?

**Methods:** We employed Roche 454 sequencing and in silico secretome analysis to explore the transcriptome of E. granus PSCs and elucidate the functions of ESPs released by the parasite.

**Findings:** A total of 26,514 non-reduant sequences were generated, of which 22,910 (86.4%) were mapped to the published E. granus genome and 17,705 (66.8%) were within coding sequence (CDS) regions. 2,280 ESPs were predicted from the transcript, with 138 involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 124 in protein metabolism, and 11 intracellular enzymes regulating glycolysis/gluogenesis (GLN) pathways. Additionally, 44 antigenic proteins, molecular chaperones, and proteases were highly represented. Many proteins were enriched in development-related signaling pathways, such as TGFβ receptor and insulin pathways.

**Implications:** This study provides valuable information on the metabolic adaptations of parasites to their hosts, which can aid in the development of novel targets for hydatid treatment and control.

**Conclusions:** This study deepens our understanding of host-parasite interactions and adds knowledge on the genomics of E. granus. The transcriptome of PSC, the infective component of larval stages, was explored to elucidate the functions of ESPs released by the parasite. Roche 454 technology and in silico analysis revealed a large number of non-reduant sequences, with 22,910 mapped to the published genome and 17,705 in CDS regions. 2,280 ESP were predicted, with 138 in carbohydrate and 124 protein metabolism, and 11 intracellular enzymes regulating GL pathways. Many proteins were in development-related signaling, such as TGFβ and insulin pathways.

**Title:** Regulation of Nitrate Assimilation in Aspergillus nidans: Unveiling the Role of Methion Oxidation in NirA Subcellular Localization and Transcription Activity

**Research Question:** How does the oxidation of methionine 169 in the nuclear export sequence (NES) of NirA regulate its subcell localization and transcription activity in response to nitrate in Aspergillus nidans?

**Methods:** We used mass spectrometry to analyze the oxidation status of methine 169 in NirA from non-induced and nit-induced cells, and identified flavin-containing monooxygen Fmo as the enzyme responsible for its oxidation. We also used site-directed mutagenesis to replace Met169 with isoleucine and alanine, and examined the effects on Nir activity and subcell localization.

**Findings:** In the absence of nit, NirA is predominantly cytosolic and inactive, while in the presence of nit, it rapidly accumulates in the nucleus and becomes transcriptionally active. Mass spectrometry revealed that Met169 is oxidized to methion sulfox (Metox) in the absence of nit, which is dependent on Fmo. Replacement of Met169 with isoleuc led to partial loss of Nir activity and insensitivity to Fmo-mediated export, while replacement with alanine resulted in permanent nuclear localization and activity. Co-immoprecipitation and subcellular studies showed that Met oxidation leads to conformational change in Nir.

**Implications:** We propose that in the presence of nit, the activation domain is exposed, but the NES is masked by the nit responsive domain (NiRD), restricting Nir to the nucleus. In absence of nit, Met is oxidized by F-dependent process, leading to loss of Ni protection, NES exposure, and relocation of inactive Nir to cytosol.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of nit regulation of nit assimilation in Asgillus nidans, where meth oxidation of Met169 in NirNES controls sub localization and transcription activity in response to nit. This mechanism may serve as a model for other nit assimilating eukaryotes, such as algae and plants.

**Title:** Functional Constraints Shape the Evolution of Mammalian Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels: An Analysis of Action Potential Propagation

**Research Question:** How do functional constraints influence the evolution of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, and what are the implications for their diversity?

**Methods:** We analyzed 172 datasets from 40 publications on wild-type and mutant mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, including human, mouse, and rat, under various conditions. We compared the data to theoretical constraints on sodium channel function, specifically membrane excitability and resting potential.

**Findings:** Our results show that the excitability constraint is obeyed by all channels, while the resting potential constraint is only obeyed by channels in muscle tissue, not neuronal. This distinction groups sodium channels into four categories consistent with phylogenetic analysis. Calculations suggest functional differences between these groups.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that functional constraints shape the evolution of mammalian voltageated sodium channels, specifically membrane excitability and resting potential. The diversity of sodium channels is bounded by these constraints, not sequence similarity. This challenges the idea that sodium properties must be tightly constrained for action potential propagation.

**Conclusions:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of mammalian voltageated sodium channels. The multiplicity of genes encoding sodium channels is not due to sequence similarity, but functional diversity. Theoretical constraints on channel function explain differences between channels in muscle and neuronal tissue. This study highlights the importance of considering functional constraints in understanding channel evolution.

**Title:** Structural Insights into Influenza Polymerase Endonuc Inhibition: High-Resolution Crystal Structures of 2009 Pandemic H1N1 Endonuc with Specific Inhibitors

**Research Question:** Can high-resolution crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 endonuc domain complexed with specific inhibitors provide insights into the mechanism of endonuc inhibition and guide the design of novel antiviral therapeutics?

**Methods:** We employed X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of the 200 pandemic HN1 enduc domain in complexed with a series of inhibitors, including diketo compounds and green tea catechin, which chelate two manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme. We compared the binding modes of these compounds to a mononucleotide phosphate to understand the plasticity of the active site and potential for induced fit.

**Findings:** Our results reveal distinct binding modes of different substituents on the metal binding scaffold in distinct subockets within the active cavity, highlighting the plasticity of structural elements in the site. These findings will inform the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the enduc activity of influenza polymerase.

**Implications:** This study provides the first detailed structural information on inhibitor binding to influenza polymerase, addressing the need for new therapeutic options targeting the virus. Our results will guide medicinal chemistry approaches to optimize lead compounds for efficient inhibition of enduc. With additional enduc-inhibitor structures and consideration of sequence variations causing resistance, this advances the goal of developing novel, efficacious therapeutics targeting viral replication.

**Conclusions:** The unique cap-snatching mechanism of transcription by influenza polymerase, particularly the enduc activity, is an attractive target for antiral development due to direct replication inhibition at primary level, conservation across strains, and lack of host counterpart. Despite trials, no structures have been obtained of HN enduc with inhibitors or analogues, limiting structure-based optimization. We overcame this by crystallizing enduc from strains with different amino sequences, yielding useful forms. This study provides high-resolution structures of pandemic HN enduc complexed with divalent ions and 4-substituted 2,4-dioxutic acid inhibitors, advancing the understanding of enduc inhibition.

**Title:** Production of Potent Polyspecific Antisera against Medically Important Vipers of Thailand and Neighboring Countries using Low-Dose, Multi-Site Immunization Protocol

**Research Question:** Can a low-dose, multi-site immunization protocol be used to produce potent polyspecific antisera against three medically important vipers of Thailand and neighboring countries, namely Cryptelytrops alabris (White-lipped viper), Caloselasma rhodoma (Malayan viper), and Dabo siensis (Russ's viper)?

**Methods:** Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three viper venoms using a low-dose, multi-site immunization protocol. The antisera were tested for ELISA titers against the three venoms and in vivo neutralization potency against proagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephroxic activities.

**Findings:** The antisera showed a rapid rise in EL titers against the three venoms and reached a plateau at the 8th post-immunization. The in vivo neutral potency of the antis against CA, CR, and DS ven was 10.40, 2.42, and 0.76 mg/ml, respectively, which was higher than the minimal limits set by Queen Savab Memorial (QI). The corresponding values for QI monospecific antis against CA, CR, and DS ven were 7.28, 3.12, and 1.50/ml. The polyspecific antis also effectively neutralized the proag, hemorrh, necic, and nephroxic activities of the ven.

**Implications:** This immunization protocol is useful for the production of potent polyspecific antisera against snake venoms and equine antis against tetanus, diphtheria, and rabies. The polyspecific antiven in the form of F(ab') has been produced from the antis by QI. This antiven should save lives of victims of enation by three and related vipers in SE countries.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the successful production of potent polyspecific antis against three vipers using low-dose multi-site immunization. The horses responded well to immunization with high EL titers at the 8th. The antis were shown to neutralize leth, proag, hemorrh, nec, and nephro activities of selected homolog ven.

**Title:** The Salmonella Typhimium Effector Protein Sse Inhibits Host Cell Migration and Maintains Long-Term Systemic Infection

**Research Question:** How does the Salmonella Typhium effector protein S inhibit host cell migration and maintain long-term systemic infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the Salmonella Tyium effector protein S (S) in maintaining long-term systemic infection in mice using a mouse model of chronic infection. We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to study the interaction between S and host cells, including primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DC).

**Findings:** We found that S inhibits normal migration of macrophages and DC in vitro, a mechanism involving interaction with the host factor IQAP, a regulator of cytoskeleton and cell migration. Infection with wild-type (WT) Salmonella Tyium suppressed migration to the spleen in an S-dependent manner, correlating with reduced DC and CD+ T cells in WT-infected spleens. Examination of spleens from mice infected with WT Salmonella revealed fewer DC and CD+ T cells compared to mice infected with ΔS Salmonella.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that S inhibits host migration, ultimately counteracting the host's ability to clear bacteria. The ability of Salmonella to survive inside host cells depends on the SPI-encoded TSS that injects virulence/effector proteins into cells. Some SPI TSS-located proteins, like S, have evolved to intracellularly subvert bactericidal properties of macrophages and create a Salmonella-containing vacuole for replication.

**Conclusions:** S is required for Salmonella to maintain long-term systemic infection in mice by inhibiting host cell migration. The mechanism involves interaction with IQAP, a regulator of cytoskeleton and cell migration. Our findings highlight the importance of S in Salmonella's ability to evade host immune response and maintain chronic infection.

**Title:** The Role of p-mec in the Virulence of Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA)

**Research Question:** What is the underlying mechanism of the high virulence of Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphlococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) compared to Hospital-Associated Methillin-Resistant Staphlococcus aureus (HA-MRSA)?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of the p-m gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCm of HA-MRSA, but not CA-MRSA, which suppresses the expression of phenol-sol-soluble modulin α (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus.

**Findings:** We found that p-m RNA inhibits translation of the agr gene encoding a positive transcription factor for PSM via specific binding to agr mRNA. Furthermore, 25% of 325 MRSA isolates had a mutation in p-m promoter that attenuated transcription, and 9% of strains had no p-m. Most of these p-mutated or p-m-deleted HA-MRSA had increased PSM expression compared to strains carrying intact p-m, and some strains produced high amounts of Pα comparable to CA-MRSA. Deletion of p-m from HA-MRSA carrying p-m increased expression of Agr and Pα and virulence in mice.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that p-m suppresses MRSA virulence via inhibition of agr translation and absence of p-m in CARSA causes its high virulence property.

**Conclusion:** We propose that the absence of p-m is a genetic determinant of high virulence of CA-MRSA, i.e., high expression of agr locus. Identification of p-m mutation could be a novel method for predicting virulence of MRSA strains.

**Title:** Maternal Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Dengue Virus Infection in Immunocompetent Mice: A Novel Insights into Disease Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Evaluation

**Research Question:** Can maternal antibodies from deng-immune mothers enhance the severity of deng infection in immunocompet mice, and what are the underlying mechanisms and clinical manifestations of this phenomenon?

**Methods:** We employed a mouse model of maternal antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) by infecting 5-week-old A129 mice, deficient in type I interferon (IF) receptors, with deng virus (DENV) serotype 2, born to mothers immunized with DENV serotype 1. We compared the outcomes to mice born to naïve mothers.

**Findings:** Mice born to D1-imm mothers succumbed to D2 infection within 4 days, with clinical manifestations of hepatocyte vacuolation, vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNFα therapy protected mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes, while blocking IL-6 did not impact virus titers or disease.

**Implications:** This ADE model in immunocom mice may dissect the mechanisms of deng pathogenesis and evaluate vaccine and therapeutic candidates. Most studies have used immunocomised AG129 mice, which are deficient in type I and II IF receptors. Our model recapitulates clinical manifestations in severe deng patients, including vascular permeability, thrombocytopenia, lymphopen, cytokine storm, and liver pathology.

**Conclusions:** We report a novel mouse model of ADE mediated by maternal antibodies in A129, which may help understand deng pathogenesis and preclinical evaluation of prophylactic and therapeutic candidates. Immunocom mice are not susceptible to D infection due to virus inability to interfere with murine type IF response. However, infected cells become less sensitive to TNFα-mediated NF-κ stimulation and apoptosis. Our study provides insights into the role of maternal antibodies in deng infection and potential interference with vaccine efficacy in infants and young children.

**Title:** Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Factors Associated with Leishmania infantum Infection in the Americas: Implications for Visceral Leishmanias Control

**Research Question:** What are the risk factors associated with Leishmania infant infection in humans in the Americas, and how can this knowledge inform the development of effective control measures to combat the disease?

**Methods:** A systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 studies was conducted to identify factors associated with Leish infant infection in humans in the Americas. Databases, reference lists, and expert consultations were searched. Theoretical and meta-analysis of p-values and effect sizes were used to pool information on each variable. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Q and I2 statistic.

**Findings:** Male sex was associated with visceral leishiasis in studies using leishin skin test diagnosis, but opposite when serological diagnosis was applied. Younger individuals were less frequently infected but more prone to illness. Presence of dogs at home, higher seropositivity nearby, lower socioeconomic status, and vegetated areas were associated with L infant infection, but not presence of chickens or nutritional status. Susceptibilities and limitations were identified in analysis and description of results.

**Implications:** Results showed consistent patterns for some factors and should be considered in developing targeted control measures. New studies are needed in areas of the continent with improved methodological quality prioritizing investigation of patterns and causes, as well as variables with poor knowledge.

**Conclusion:** This systematic review is the first on factors with visceral leishias in America, clarifying aspects and raising new questions. Due to disease characteristics, results cannot be used to predict other contexts, specifically American leishias. A systematic review of risk in Asia described patterns, such as clustering, household conditions, vegetation, and poverty. In Brazil, case-fatality rates vary between 4.2-10% in treated patients. Diagnosis uses hypersensitivity, parasitological, serological, and molecular methods.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Acute Pathogenesis and Mortality in Francisella tularens Pulmonary Infection: A Critical Role of Innate Myel Cell Response

**Research Question:** What are the underlying mechanisms of acute pathogenesis and mortality in Francisella tularens (Ft) pulmonary infection, and how does the innate myel cell response contribute to host mortality?

**Methods:** We investigated the sequential host response to Francisella tularens (Ft) infection in a mouse model of pulmonary tularemia, focusing on the role of innate myel cells in disease progression and mortality.

**Findings:** Contrary to overwhelming bacterial burden or cytokine production, an overt innate cellular response to F. tularens drives tissue pathology and host mortality. Lethal infection elicits medullary and extra-medullary myopoies, recruiting large numbers of immature myeloid cells (IMC/MD) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to the lungs, which fail to mature and die, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of pulmonary function, and host death, partially dependent on Ly6+ cells. Acceleration of this process may account for rapid lethality with Schu4. In contrast, sub-lethal infection with LVS exhibits a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes, required for protection, suggesting a threshold for lethal infection. Further, eliciting mature phagocytic response provides transient but dramatic protection against Schu4.

**Implications:** This study reveals that the nature of myel cell response may be the primary determinant of host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection. Unlike non-fatal infection, inhalation of as few cfu Schu4 results in acute tularemia with high mortality in mice, while LVS requires higher bacterial numbers to evade host defense through mechanisms, including subversion of recognition, phagosomal escape, and ROS scavenging.

**Conclusions:** This study defines critical parameters accompanying death in pulmonary tularem, identifying inappropriate elaboration of IM/MD leading to necrotic inflammation in multiple organs as Ft-driven cause of death, and suggests differences in mortality survival may be reflected not by control of load, but nature of myel cell response during acute infection. Leth tularem elicits recruitment of large IM/MD to lungs and spleen, where cells die and drive irreversible damage, multi-organ dysfunction, and host death. Response to sub-lethal is different with greater development of mature myoid cells, effective at controlling Ft.

**Title:** Reconstructing the Colonization History of Aedes albopictus: Implications for Mitigating the Spread of Infectious Diseases

**Research Question:** This study aims to reconstruct the colonization history of Aedes albictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, a vector of medically important arboviruses such as Chikungunya (CHV), Dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIK), to mitigate its spread and associated disease risks.

**Methods:** Classical genetics and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approaches were combined to disentangle the demographic history of Aedes populations from countries in Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas.

**Findings:**

* In Southeast Asia, low differentiation and high coance values among China, Thailand, and Japan indicate native populations maintain genetic connectivity, revealing ancestral origin.
* China appears to be the oldest population.
* Outside Asia, invasion in Réunion, America, and Mediterranean is supported by chaotic propagule distribution, maintaining high genetic diversity in advent populations.
* Independent transcontinental introductions of Ae. albict facilitated rapid establishment through admixture of unrelated genomes.
* Intra-population variability detected, likely extending to mechanisms controlling vector competence.

**Implications:**

* Ancestry and admixture create conditions for efficient arvirus transmission and outbreak.
* Outcomes valuable for models predicting vector risk of outbreaks.
* Spread occurred under different environmental conditions, variation between eco-ge populations due to unexplored genetic and environmental interactions.
 Knowledge crucial for assessing arv risk in old and newly invaded areas Ae. albict established.

**Conclusions:**

Reconstructing the colonization history of Aedes albict is crucial for mitigating its spread and associated disease risks. This study provides valuable information on origins of populations from Southeast Asia, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Pacific, and North America. Tiger populations display differences in vector capacity for arviruses, making this research essential for developing models predicting risk of outbreaks. Understanding interactions between genetic and environmental factors is crucial for assessing arv risk in old and newly invaded areas.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mysteries of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Chronic Infections: Identifying Key Genes and Functions in Wound Pathogenesis

**Research Question:** What are the genes and functions that mediate the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic infections, and what are the selective pressures in wounds?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive genomic analysis of clinical isolates from human wounds and experimental mouse models to identify bacterial functions required for fitness in chronic infections. We tested the importance of virulence and biofilm functions in wounds and examined the role of anaerobic, metabolic, energy, and membrane-related genes in bacterial fitness.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, clinical isolates from human wounds were frequently defective in virulence and biofilm formation, and many virulence and biofilm genes were not required for bacterial fitness in mouse wounds. Instead, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolic, and membrane integrity were critical. Consistent with these findings, fitness of wound-impaired mutants could be represented by anaerobic, oxidative, and membrane-stressed conditions ex vivo and high-density growth in the absence of host.

**Implications:** These findings shed light on bacterial functions in chronic infections, the nature of stresses applied to bacteria at infection sites, and suggest potential therapeutic targets to compromise infection pathogenesis. Our data indicate that predominant stresses in wounds may be applied by bacteria themselves, rather than host, and highlight the role of biofilms in chronic infections.

**Conclusion:** This study advances understanding of Pseudomonas aerugin functions to initiate and maintain chronic infections and stresses that affect bacterial fitness in wounds. Our results suggest that wounds may be permissive environments where bacterial acquisition and growth do not depend on invasive or toxic functions, explaining why low-virulence organisms commonly inhabit wounds. Furthermore, tests with wound-defective mutants and T-seq experiments showed strong correlation between high-density growth and bacterial fitness in wounds. Our model used diabetic mice, a key factor in human pathogenesis, and Pseudas inhibited wound-healing, directly linking infection to disease.

**Title:** Evaluation of Hydrocele Recurrence and Testicular Lymphangiectasia in Bancrofilariasis Endemic Areas: A Prospective Study

**Research Question:** What is the incidence of hydrocele recurrence and testicular lymphangiectasia in patients undergoing hydrocelectomy in a bancrofilariasis endemic area, and what is the efficacy of complete excision of hydrocele sac in preventing recurrence?

**Methods:** A prospective study was conducted at the Center for Teaching and Research and Referral for Bancrofilariasis (NEF) in a bancrofilari endemic area. 968 patients with unilateral or bilateral hydrocele (Group 1) and 218 patients from the same area who had undergone hydrocele-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere (Comparison Group) were enrolled. 28 patients from Comparison with hydro recurrence were reoperated at NEF and constitute Group 2. Hydrocelectomies were performed on 128 patients (mean age 30.3yr, mean follow-up 8.6yr). Hydro recurrence rates in Group 1 and Comparison (age 31.5) were 0.3% and 19.3, respectively (p<0.001). No recurrence in Group 2 (age 25.1, mean follow 6yr).

**Findings:** Perioperatively, leaking or dilated lymphatic vessels were seen in 30.9% and 46.3% of patients in Group 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.081). Testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 18% and 35.7% of patients from Group 1 and 2, respectively (p=0.025).

**Implications:** Lymph fluid from ruptured dilated lymphatic vessels is an important component of chronic hydrocele fluid threatening the integrity of test in adult population in bancfilari endemic areas. To prevent recurrence, authors advise complete excision of hydrocele when leaking or dilated lymphatic vessels are sutured or excised.

**Conclusion:** In bancrofil endemic areas, lymphatic fistulae are likely responsible for chronic hydro, recurrent or not. This study highlights the importance of complete excision of hydrocele in preventing recurrence, especially when leaking or dilated lymphatic vessels are present.

**Title:** Identification and Characterization of a Deubiquinating Enzyme in Trichella spiralis, a Zoonotic Parasitic Nematode

**Research Question:** What is the role of deubiquinating enzymes (DUBs) in the biology of Trichella spiralis, a zoonotic parasitic nematode that causes trichlos, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica?

**Methods:** An activity-based probe, HA-Ub-V, was used to identify DUB activity in lysate of T. spir larvae. Results were analyzed by immunoblot and immunoprecipitation, identifying several potential Ds. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to LC/MS/MS, yielding peptides with homology to conserved human Ds: UCH5, U3, HAP, OT6, and Atin-3. The gene encoding putative UCH5 homologue, Ts37, was cloned and recombinant protein expressed and purified. Deubiquinating activity was verified by Ub-AM assay. Coipitation of recomant Ts37 showed association with putative T. spir proteome components, including yeastpn hom ADR1.

**Findings:** This study reports the identification of the first T. spir D, a cystine protease orthologous to human UCH5. Results suggest interaction with proteome has been conserved throughout evolution. Inhibition of recomant Ts37 by LD-44 reduced viability of cultured L larvae, indicating potential use of compounds to elucidate role of U in T spir infection and as therapeutic targets for trichlos.

**Implications:** Trich spir is a parasitic nematode that infects mammals indiscriminately, contributing to global health morbidity and disability years. The target of LD-44 in T spir is unknown, but its effect on viability of L larvae suggests U play important role in parasite biology. Inhibition of D enzymes blocks removal of Ub and chains from proteins. Coip experiments with proteins from L lysate using recomant Ts37 as bait yielded putative T proteome components, including ADR1, suggesting specific interaction and conserved throughout evolution.

**Conclusion:** This study characterizes the first T spir D, a cystine protease ortholog to human U5, and highlights potential use of compounds to elucidate role of U in T spir infection and as therapeutic targets for trich. Further investigation of U enzymes in T spir biology may lead to novel treatments for trich, a significant global health problem.

**Title:** Identification of Cysteine Protease Inhibitors as Potential Therapeutic Targets for Chagas Disease Treatment

**Background:** Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in the Americas. Cysteine proteases, particularly cruzain, have been validated as targets for therapeutic intervention. However, the relationship between cruzain inhibition and anti-tryosomal activity remains unclear.

**Research Question:** We investigated the anti-tryosomal activity of nitr-based cystine protease inhibitors against the CLner strain of T. cruzi and evaluated their cruzain inhibitory activity.

**Methods:** We screened a library of nitr-based cystine protease inhibitors, two scaffolds associated with cathepsin inhibition, for anti-tryosomal activity against T. cruzi. The most potent compounds were characterized by EC50 values 0.12 μM and 0.25M, significantly lower than their Ki values against recombinant cruzain.

**Findings:** The anti-tryosomal activity of two compounds was not solely explained by cruzain inhibition, suggesting a polypharmacological profile towards cystine proteases. We also evaluated catps K inhibitors on cyclohexadicarbox scaffold for cruzain and anti-tryosomal activity, observing greater anti-tryosomal activity than expected from cruz inhibitory activity.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that cystine proteases, including isoforms like cruzain-2, are potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Compounds 5 and 11 may exhibit a polypharmac profile targeting isoforms of cruzain or other cystine proteases in T. cruz. The cystine inhibition profile indicates a new antag target sharing molecular characteristics with cathein, warranting phenic screening for antag agents specifically targeting this enzyme.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the potential of cystine protease inhibitors as therapeutic targets for Chagas treatment. Our findings suggest that cruzain inhibition is not the sole predictor of anti-tryosomal activity, and that other cystine proteases, such as cruzain-2, may be involved. The discovery of antag agents targeting cystine proteases, including cathe, may provide new avenues for Chagas treatment.

**Title:** Deciphering the Maize Genome: Unraveling the Evolutionary History and Organization of Zea mays L.

**Research Question:** To elucidate the genome organization of Zea mays (maize) and construct a framework for genome sequencing, we generated a sequence-fingerprint contig-based physical map covering 93.5% of the genome, with 86.1% aligned to the genetic map.

**Methods:** We constructed a sequence-fingerprint contig-based physical map of the maize genome, comprising 25,908 genic markers, enabling alignment of nearly 73% of the anchored genome to the rice genome. The distribution of expressed sequence tags correlated with recombination hotspots, with 1 kb in rice corresponding to an average 3.2 kb in maize, indicating a 6-fold genome size expansion.

**Findings:**

1. **Polyploid origin**: Maize has a 6-fold genome size expansion due to most regions corresponding to two in maize as a result of recent polyploid origin.
2. **Chromosome variations**: Inversions account for majority of structural variations during maize diploidization.
3. **Ancient duplication**: Evidence of genome predating divergence of maize and rice progenitors.
4. **Paleoethnobotany**: Progenitors of modern maize contained ten chromosomes.

**Implications:**

1. **Genome organization**: Alignment sheds light on chromosomes contributing to polloidization, rearrangements, homologous regions, and patterns of size evolution.
2. **Comparative mapping**: Restricted fragment polymorphism (RFLP) across cereals aligns maize with rice and sorghum, demonstrating whole genome duplication.
3. **duplication**: Primary and secondary blocks in maize (Table 3) support tetraploid emergence from duplicated regions.
4. **rice**: Duplications not limited to ancestor of maize.

**Conclusions:**

1. Maize genome emerged from tetraploid of ancient duplicated regions.
2. Multiple events contribute to maize-complex pattern.
3 Synteny analysis shows genome rearrangements since maize and rice divergence.

This research unravels the evolutionary history and organization of Zea mays, providing a framework for genome sequencing. The sequence-fingerprint contig map covers 93.5% of the genome, with 86% aligned to the genetic map. The fingerprint contig contains 25,908 genic markers, enabling alignment of 73% of the genome to rice. The distribution of expressed tags correlates with recombination hotspots, with 1 kb in rice corresponding to 3.2 in maize, indicating a 6-fold size expansion due to polloid origin.

**Title:** De Novo Generation of Infectious Prions through Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification: Implications for the Etiology of Sporadic Transmissible Spong Encephalopathies

**Research Question:** Can protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PM) technology be used to generate de novo infectious prions in the absence of pre-existing prions, and what are the implications for the etiology of sporadic transmissible spong encephalopathies (TSE)?

**Methods:** We employed PM to analyze the possibility of spontaneous generation of infectious prions (PrSc) from the misfolding of cellular prion protein (PrC) in vitro. Standard PM conditions and precautions to avoid cross-contamination were taken, but de novo generation of PrSc was not observed. However, we modified PM to generate PrSc in the absence of pre-existing PrSc in different species at a low and variable rate.

**Findings:** De novo generated PrSc was infectious when inoculated into wild-type hamsters, producing a new phenotype with clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. Our results provide additional evidence for the prion hypothesis and a simple model to study the mechanism of sporadic prion disease.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that prion diversity is not restricted to those currently known, and likely new forms of infectious foldings may be produced, resulting in novel phenotypes. This has significant implications for understanding the etiology of sporadic TSE, which may arise from low-frequency spontaneous misfolding of pr protein.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that PM can be used to generate de novo infectious prions, supporting the pr hypothesis that prions are composed of misfolded pr protein that replicates in the absence of nucleic acids by inducing misfolding of cellular pr protein. This provides a model to study the mechanism of sporadic prion disease and suggests that prion diversity may be larger than thought, with potential for new forms of infectious fold resulting in novel phenotypes.

**Title:** A Novel Neural Model for Estimating Angular Velocity in Bees: A Quantitative Reproduction of Visual Odometry and Corridor-Centering Behavior

**Research Question:** Can a neural model be developed to estimate angular velocity (AV) in bees, capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees, including unaccounted for manipulations of behavior?

**Methods:** We present a novel model, the Angular Detector Unit (ADU), fitted with electrophysiological data and tested using behavioral data. The ADU is tested behaviorally in silico with the corridor-center paradigm, where bees navigate a corridor with gratings (square or sinusoidal) on walls. When combined with an existing flight algorithm, the AD reproduces invariance of the flight path to spatial and frequency of gratings, including deviations from centering behavior found in real bees.

**Findings:** The ADU reproduces several patterns previously unaccounted for in bee behavior, including deviation of flight path from center to differences in spatial frequency of sinusoidal gratings and deviations of flight from center for square and sinusoidal gratings. Additionally, the detector responds to temporal frequencies 10-100 Hz, lower than those experienced in behavioral experiments on honeybees, suggesting additional neural circuitry for AV estimation must be present.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that the AV response can be considered an extension of the optomotor pathway, allowing detectors to be constructed by selectively from a pool of elementary detectors with varying response timescales due to spatial or temporal differences, and calculating final response by combining selected responses.

**Conclusions:** We propose a model for AV in bees as an extension of the optotor pathway, allowing detectors to be constructed by drawing from a pool of elementary detectors with varying response times due to spatial or temporal differences and calculating desired response by combining responses. The ADU can be used as a visual odometer, summing output over time and parts of visual field, unaffected by spatial frequency of environment. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a neural model for estimating AV in bees, reproducing experimental observations of odometry and corridor-center in free-flying honeyes.

**Title:** Alternative Progressions of African Trypanosomiasis (H) Infection: A 15-Year Follow-Up Study of Untreated Patients in the Ivory Coast

**Research Question:** Can untreated African trypanosomias (H) infection, caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambense, exhibit alternative progressions beyond the classic lethal outcome, and what are the implications for disease control programs?

**Methods:** We conducted a 15-year follow-up study of 50 African trypaniasis H patients from the Ivory Coast, 11 of whom refused treatment after initial diagnosis. We used sensitive diagnostic tools, including microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to monitor parasite clearance and serological responses.

**Findings:** 10 out of 11 patients who continued to refuse treatment despite repeated visits showed parasite clearance using microscopy and PCR. Most (7/10) displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming negative to trypanosome antigens (Li1.3, 1.5, and 1.6). We observed two alternative progressions of H: (1) aparasitemic and asymptomatic infection with strong serological responses, and (2) spontaneous resolution with negative parasitological and PCR results and dropping antibody titers.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that, in addition to the classic lethal outcome of H, alternative progressions of H may occur. Recognizing trypanotolerance in humans, as accepted in animals, is a major step forward for future research in HAT. Field control programs encounter a proportion of subjects with positive serologic results but negative parasitological testing, suggesting these display alternative courses of infection.

**Conclusion:** This study provides the most comprehensive investigation of Tryosoma bruce gambense infection in humans, combining clinical, serological, molecular, and parasitological investigations. Our findings highlight the need to consider alternative progressions of H in disease management and control strategies.

**Title:** Ionizing Radiation Selects for p53-Deficient Hematopoietic Progenitors: A Novel Mechanism of Carcinogenesis

**Research Question:** Does ionizing radiation select for p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitors in vivo, contributing to the development of lymphoid malignancies?

**Methods:** We used mouse models to investigate the effect of ionizing radiation on p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitors.

**Findings:** We found that p53 disruption confers a selective advantage upon irradiation, leading to long-term expansion of p-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. Selection for cells with disrupted p53 is attributed to protection from irradiation-induced elimination of progenitor cells, prevention of irradiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity, improved maintenance of progenitor fitness, and elimination of competing p-type progenitors.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that the carcinogenic effect of ionizing radiation is partially explained by selection for cells with p-disruption, which protects progenitor cells from immediate and long-term reductions in fitness following irradiation.

**Conclusions:** Contrary to the predominant role of mutagenesis, our results demonstrate that irradiation selects for p-def cells in stem and progenitor pools, independent of additional oncogenic mutations. This suggests a novel mechanism of carcinogenesis, where ionizing radiation selects for cells with p-disruption, protecting them from immediate and long-term reductions in fitness.

**Title:** Schistosoma mansoni Sm-1 Serine Protease Inhibitor: A Key Regulator of Homeostasis, Inflammation, and Tissue Injury

**Research Question:** What is the role of Schistosoma mansoni Sm-1 serine protease inhibitor (SmKI-1) in parasite development and its potential as a therapeutic molecule for inflammatory diseases?

**Methods:** Recombinant (r) Sm-KI and its Kunit domain, but not C-terminal region, exhibited inhibitory activity against tryp and neutrophil elastase (NE). Molecular docking studies revealed complete blockage of NE active site by Sm-1 Kunit domain. rKI inhibited capacity of NE to kill schistosomes. Specific siRNA knockdown of Sm-1 in S. mansoni significantly impacted parasite development in vitro and in vivo. Sm-1 anti-inflammatory potential was tested in murine models of inflammatory diseases, including acetaminophen (AP)-mediated liver damage and gout.

**Findings:** Sm-1 rescued AP-mediated liver damage with significant reduction in neutroph recruitment and elast activity. In gout model, Sm-1 reduced neutroph accumulation, IL-β secretion, hyperiception, and pathological score. Sm- inhibited early events triggering neutroph recruitment in pleural cavities of mice in response carrageenan.

**Implications:** Sm-1 is a key protein in S. mans survival and inhibits neutroph function, a promising therapeutic against inflammatory diseases. Sm- reduces schosula killing by elast, interacting with elast catalytic site, demonstrated by docking and inhibiting activity, a potential immune mechanism by parasite evolution. Sm- is first Kunit-type serine inhibitor in S. mans, evolved to survive human hosts by producing protease inhibitors targeting human proteases.

**Conclusions:** Sm- acts as tryp and neutil elast inhibitor in vitro, previously described by Ranhe et al. with anti-coag and anti-inflammatory properties [19]. Sm- suppression in lar stage S. mans robustly impacted schist development in vitro and vivo, essential for parasite survival. Neutrophil elast is host defense against pathogenic and fungi [35]. Schistosomes use proteases for invasion and nutrition, suggesting Sm interaction with neutils to inhibit killing in vitro.

**Title:** Accurate Modeling of Transmembrane Helix (TM) Proteins from Distant Homologues with Distinct Loop and TM Conformations

**Research Question:** Despite the critical roles of transmembrane helix (TM) proteins in various cellular functions, their high-resolution structures remain largely uncharacterized due to the lack of close structural homologues. This study aims to address this challenge by developing a novel method for modeling TM protein structures from distant homologues with distinct loop and TM conformations.

**Methods:** We present a generic method for predicting TM protein structures from homolog with diverse topology (5-12 TM), size (183-420 residues), and sequence identity (15-70%). The method was validated in a benchmark of 50 TM protein pairs and achieved near-atomic accuracy in membrane-embedded regions, outperforming starting templates.

**Findings:** Our method ranked first in GPCR-DO blind contests for adenosine A2 and chemokine CX4 receptors, and improved starting templates to near-atomic accuracy in TM regions. Unlike templates, our models are suitable for computer-based engineering and redesigned X-ray structures exhibit similar native interactions.

**Implications:** This method should be useful for atom-level modeling and design of structurally uncharacterized TM proteins from a wide range of homologues. The technique was stringently validated in two blind predictions and a benchmark of membrane homolog pairs with diverse length, topology, and sequence.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest that the method can rebuild and refine X-ray structures of receptors with missing or deleted functionally important loop regions, facilitating crystallization. The accuracy of models may not reflect the method's ability to model the ICL loop due to the presence of T lysozyme in the template, preventing all-atom refinement of the structure. This study addresses the challenge of high-resolution protein prediction in the absence of close homolog and provides an alternative approach for therapeutics and synthetic biology applications relying on atomic information.

**Title:** Listeria monocytogenes Enters a Persistent State of Vacuolar Residency in Epithelial Cells, Favoring Asymptomatic Carriage and Antibiotic Resistance

**Research Question:** How does Listeria monocytogen, the causative agent of listeriosis, persist in epithelial cells and evade detection by the host immune system, leading to asymptomatic carriage and antibiotic resistance?

**Methods:** We investigated the intracellular lifecycle of L. monocytogen in human hepatocytes and trophlast cells using a novel experimental protocol. We observed that after several days of infection, L. monocogen switches from an active, motile lifestyle to a vacolar state, characterized by the formation of Listeria-Containing Vacoles (Lis) and cessation of actin polymerization.

**Findings:**

1. L. monocogen ceases to produce the actin-nucle protein Act and becomes trapped in Liss, a lysosome-like vacuole, where it resists degradation and enters a slow-replicative state.
2. Subpopulations of bacteria in Liss can cycle between vacolar and act-based motility stages.
3. Absence of Act, as in ΔAct mutants, leads to vacolar parasitization of host cells in a "viable but non-culturable" (VB) state, undetectable by conventional counting.
4. Exposure to gentamicin selects for vacolar and VB bacteria.

**Implications:** These findings reveal L. monocogen's ability to enter a persistent state in epithelial cells, favoring asymptomatic carriage, prolonging incubation period of listiosis, and promoting survival during antibiotic therapy.

**Conclusions:** L. monocogen's intracellular lifecycle is more complex than previously thought, involving vacolar residency in epithelial cells. This may explain asymptomatic carriage, prolonged incubation, and antibiotic resistance. Our study highlights the need for novel approaches to detect and treat listeriosis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and fetuses.

**Title:** A Neuromechanical Modeling of Auditory Streaming: Unveiling the Dynamics of Perceptual Alternations in the ABA Paradigm

**Research Question:** How do the dynamics of perceptual alternations in the ABA paradigm, a widely used to study auditory streaming, arise from the interplay of neuronal mechanisms in the auditory cortex?

**Methods:** We combined neuromechanical modeling and psychoacoustic experiments to investigate the effects of manipulating stimulus parameters on perceptual alternations in the ABA paradigm. Unlike phenomenological models, our network comprises neuronal units with sensory-dependent inputs mimicking the pulsatile A responses to tones in A-BA triplets, embodying a computation for percept competition in primary cortex (A). Mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise are implemented, with slow NMDA recurrent excitation for temporal memory.

**Findings:** Our model predicts that manipulating the frequency difference between tones A and B affects the dominance of the percept, with the stronger percept dominating a larger fraction of time than the weaker, a property previously established in visual bistable paradigms. We confirm this prediction with psychoac experiments and use behavioral data to constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results.

**Implications:** Our work provides a platform to extend to other conditions, including effects of context and volition. Our formulation is motivated by physiological studies of streaming and perceptual bistability, incorporating sound-evoked A responses as input to competition. Percept states are identified in neuronal dynamics rather than preassigned phenomenological units. The inclusion of NMD-like dynamics enables temporal binding from one triplet to next to deal with gaps in periodic input.

**Conclusions:** Our neuromechanical model accurately reproduces the dynamics of alternations after the build phase, focusing on the emergence of competing percepts within tonotopic organization, distinguishing it from existing auditory models. Parameters controlling adaptation and noise were tuned to match statistics of percept durations, fitting a log-normal distribution and coefficient of variation. A responses were interpreted using neurometric functions mimicking the build-up in [28, 30]. Other data were interpreted according to a conceptual [26, 29] based tonot organization in cortex. When A and B tones are far apart, cortical activity is separated in tonopic to drive representations of high and low sequences.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Characterization of Schistosoma mansoni Allergens using a High-Throughput Cell-Free Translation and Reporter Assay System

**Research Question:** Can a high-throughput cell-free translation and reporter system be used to assess the allergenicity of Schistosoma mansoni antigens and unravel the mechanisms of anti-parasite immunity?

**Methods:** We developed a medium to high-throughput workflow, including quality controls, to translate S. mans proteins using wheat germate and assess potential allergity with a humanized Basophil Leukemia (R) reporter line. Cell-free translation was completed within 90 minutes, generating sufficient amounts of parasitic protein for rapid screening allergity without purification. Antigen integrity was demonstrated using Western blotting. After incubation with infected serum, the RSL reporter line was challenged with wheat translation mixture and luciferase activity measured, reporting cellular activation by suspected allergen.

**Findings:** We demonstrated the suitability of this system for characterizing novel S. mans allergens using well-characterized and paras allergens such as Par 2, SmAL-1, and IgE factor SE/alpha, expressed in wheat lysate and E. coli. SmAL1, but not SmAL2, activated the basophil reporter line. This method offers an accessible way to assess allergity of anti-helmin vaccine candidates and suitable for medium to high-throughput studies using individual sera.

**Implications:** This technology paves the way for high-through, genome-wide assessment of S mans allergenicity, the Schos allergome. More importantly, when used at the genome level, it could unravel the allergome of S mans and other medically important parasites, leading to a better understanding of allergity and combination with cellular studies, the relationship between parasite IgE and host mechanisms at the molecular level.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate the proof-of-principle of the RSL cell line, in combination with cell-free in vitro system and stringent controls, for assessing allergity of S mans antigens. This method is suitable for high-through, genome-wide assessment of mans allergenic, the Schos allergome, and unraveling the allergome of mans and other medically parasites, ultimately leading to better understanding of allergity and relationship between parasite Ig and host mechanisms at molecular level.

**Title:** Divergence in Transposable Element (TE) Landscape between Parents Leads to Persistent Germline Dysgenesis and Transgenerational Effects on Gene Expression in Drosophila

**Research Question:** How does divergence in the transposable element (TE) landscape between parents contribute to germline dysgenesis and transgener effects on gene expression in Drosila?

**Methods:** We investigated the effects of TE divergence between parents on germl expression and gene expression in Drosila using the D. virilis syndrome of dysgenesis as a model. We analyzed TE expression and piRNA profiles in 0-2 hour embryos from F1 females from non-dys crosses and F1 esc females of the dys cross.

**Findings:** Our results show that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germl TE expression between genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses, which are transmitted to the next generation. Chronic and persisting TE expression coincides with increased levels of piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. We further demonstrate that gene expression is idiosratically influenced by differences in piRNA profile of parents arising from polymorphic TE insertions.

**Implications:** These findings support a model where early germl events in dysgenesis establish a stable state of TE and gene expression in germl that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation. Our results demonstrate that divergence in TE is associated with pi-mediated transgener effects on gene expression within populations.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of divergence in TE landscape between parents in germl dysgenesis and trans effects on gene expression in Dila. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of genome defense by small RNAs and the proliferative nature of TEs. We show that divergence in TE is associated with piRNA-mediated transgener effects on gene expression within populations, underscoring the critical role of piRNAs in maintaining TE control and fertility.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Divergence in TE landscape between parents leads to persisting differences in germl TE expression between genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses.
* Chronic and persist TE expression coincides with increased levels of piRN associated with reduced gene expression.
* Gene expression is idiosratically influenced by differences in piRNA of parents arising from polymorphic insertions.
* Early germl events in dysgenesis establish a stable state of TE and gene in germl maintained through adulthood and transmitted to next.
* Divergence TE is associated with pi-mediated transgener effects on gene within populations.

**Title:** Histone Deacetylases and Chromatin Remodeling in Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome: A Novel Therapeutic Implications

**Background:** Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXT) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CG trinucleotide repeat in the 5′UTR of the Fragile X (FX) gene, FMR1. The CG repeat is thought to induce toxicity as RNA, and FXT patients exhibit elevated FMR1 mRNA levels. Despite the critical role of F1 in disease pathogenesis, the basis for increased F1 expression is unknown.

**Research Question:** We investigated the role of histone deetylases (HDs) in CG-repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FAS.

**Methods:** We overexpressed three HDs (3, 6, or 11) and evaluated their effect on CG-repeat-induced neurodegeneration in Dophila model FAS.

**Findings:** Overexpression of HDs suppressed CG-repeat neurogeneration, resulting from selective transcriptional repression of the CG-repeat-containing transgene. This led us to evaluate the acetylation state of histones at the F1 locus in patient-derived lymphoblast and fibroblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed increased acylation of histones at F1 in preutation compared to control FX-derived cell lines. Epigenetic changes correlated with elevated F1 expression in preutation lines. Consistent with this, histone acetylase (H) inhibitors repressed F1 expression to control levels in preutation cell and extended CG-repeat Dophila lifespan.

**Implications:** Our findings support a disease model where CG repeat in FAS promotes chromatin remodeling, increasing toxic F1 mRNA. Results provide proof principle that H or HD activators might selectively repress transcription at F locus.

**Conclusion:** Our results demonstrate that overexpression of separate HDs suppresses CG-repeat neurogeneration in Doph model FAS. Genetic and pharmacologic manipulations of histone acylation at the CG repeat can modify transcription levels in human and animal models. These findings suggest modestly expanded FAS sequence alters chromatin through preferential association with acylated histones, promoting F transcription, and exacerbating RNA toxicity.

**Title:** The Impact of MHC Heterogeneity and Host Genetics on CD8 T Cell Exhaustion and Viral Clearance during Chronic Infection

**Research Question:** What is the extent to which MHC heterogeneity and host genetics influence the establishment of chronic viral infection and CD8 T cell exhaustion during chronic infection?

**Methods:** We conducted a study using F1 cross of B10.D2 x B6 (DBF1) and BAL.B x BAL/c (B1) mice infected with the clone-13 (Cl-13) strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to examine the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the development of chronic infection.

**Findings:** Our results show that H-2b D2F1 mice on C57 genetic background exhibited increased viral control compared to homozygous mice following Cl-13 infection. CD T cell depletion prevented mortality in Cl-infected D2F mice indicating that mortality was CD T-cell dependent. D2F mice maintained CD T effector cytokine production and reduced expression of T exhaustion marker PD-1. Additionally, D2F mice induced larger Th1 response than B1 mice Cl-13 mortality in D2 mice was dependent CD T-mediated IF-γ production.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that increasing M heterogeneity results in increased frequency of responding CD T cells during chronic infection. H-2 D2F mice on C57 background succumbed to Cl infection, while D mice mounted higher CD T response than B mice as determined by frequency cells upregulating CD and downregulating CD. Both immune environment and M diversity contribute T-dependent viral clearance and mortality in D mice.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that host background profoundly influences outcome of LCM Cl infection. Mechanisms inducing effective T response preventing immunopathology are vital to prevention of chronic infection. We show M heterogeneity and host background significantly impact T exhaustion and clearance. T cells are important clearing acute LCM infection and maintaining control during LCM Cl.

**Title:** Molecular Characterization of Bacillus anthracis Strains in Northwestern China: Implications for Anthrax Prevention and Control

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis strains isolated from northwestern China over the past decade and their implications for anthrax prevention and control.

**Methods:** A total of 106 Bacillus anthrac strains, including 13 DNA samples, were collected from six provinces in northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and multilocus-number tandem repeat (MLVA) analysis with 15 markers were used to analyze the genetic characteristics of the strains.

**Findings:** Five subline/subgroups, namely A. Br.001/002, A. Br. Voll, A. Aust, A. Br. Ames, and A. Br.008/009, were detected using 13 SNP sites. All subgroups were found in Xinjiang, while one in Shaanxi, two Gans, three Qinghai, and four in Inner Mongolia. Geographical distribution of B. anthrac populations exhibited different SNP characteristics from those isolated before 1990 in China. In contrast, A. Br Ames was observed scattered from Inner Mongolia to other provinces. All strains were assigned 36 MLVA genotypes, 21 of which were first observed in this study. Strains from anthrax recent decade were classified subgroups A. Br.001 and A. Br and identified genotypes MLVA-28, ML-30, ML-31, ML-38, ML-CH3, and MLCH18.

**Implications:** The diversification of ML genotypes and geographical of B anthrac populations is becoming balanced across northwestern China. This study provides preliminary results regarding the diversity of B anthrac in China, which will promote prevention and control of this disease.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the genetic diversity of Bacillus anthracis in northwestern China and its implications for anthrax prevention and control. Bacillus anthracis is a re-emerging zoon disease in China, especially in rural regions. This study provides preliminary results regarding the diversity of B anthrac in China, which will promote prevention and control of this disease.

**Title:** Unveiling the Protective Role of Resistin-like Molecule β (RELM-β) in Host Defense against Enteric Pathogens: A Novel Insights into Goblet Cell Function

**Research Question:** How do goblet cells contribute to host defense against enteric pathogens, and what is the role of resistin-like molecule (RELMβ) in this process?

**Methods:** We used a mouse model of Citrobacterium (C. rodium) infection to investigate the role of goblet cells and LMβ in host defense against enteric pathogens. Wild-type and LMβ-deficient (Retb/-) mice were orally infected with C. rodium, and their responses were compared.

**Findings:** LMβ was strongly induced in goblet cells during C. rodium infection and detected in stool and serum. Despite its induction, LMβ's role in defense was unclear. Retb/- mice suffered increased mortality and mucosal ulceration due to deep pathogen penetration of colonic crypts. Immunostaining for Ki67 and BrdU revealed Retb mice were impaired in infection-induced IEC proliferation. Exposure to LMβ did not directly increase IEC proliferation, but acted as a CD+ cell chemoattract. Retb mice showed impaired CD+ cell recruitment to infected colons and reduced interleukin (IL-22) production, a multifunctional cytokine that increased IEC proliferation. En delivery of LMβ to Retb mice restored CD+ cell recruitment, increased IL-22 and IEC, and reduced mucosal pathology.

**Implications:** These findings demonstrate LMβ and goblet play a critical role in recruiting CD+ cells to colon to protect against enteric pathogens, via induction of increased IEC proliferation.

**Conclusions:** This study expands our understanding of goblet function in host defense against enteric bacteria, revealing a novel role for LMβ in recruiting CD+ cells to infected colon. LMβ acts as a chemoattract for CD+ cells, increasing IL-22 production and IEC proliferation, and reducing mucosal pathology. These findings highlight the importance of LMβ in host defense against enteric pathogens and suggest its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

**Title:** Structural and Functional Insights into the Interaction between Norovirus VP and eIF4: Implications for Translation Initiation and Antiviral Therapy

**Research Question:** How does the norovirus VP protein (VP) interact with the host eukary initiation factor 4 (eIF4) to initiate translation of the viral RNA genome, and can this interaction be targeted for antiviral therapy?

**Methods:** We used a combination of biochemical and biophysical assays, including pull-down, fluorescence anisotropy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), mutagenesis, and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between norirus VP and e4.

**Findings:** We identified a ~20 amino acid motif in the C-terminus of norirus VP that binds to the HE-1 domain of e4 with micromolar affinity, conserved in all noriruses. The binding site is non-overlapping with the site for e4 on e4, allowing ternary VP-e4-e4-e4 complexes to form. Functional assays showed that the C-terminal peptide of norirus VP inhibits in vitro translation of norirus RNA, but not cap or IRES-dependent translation.

**Implications:** Our results reveal structural and functional details of the interaction between norirus VP and e4, which is crucial for translation initiation of the viral genome. The conserved motif in norirus VP may be targeted for antiv therapy.

**Conclusions:** Norirus VP serves as a proteinaceous 5-cap, recruiting the viral RNA to the translation machinery without interacting with cap protein e4. The interaction with e4 is focused on the HE-1 domain, which is conserved in all noriruses. High-resolution analyses are required to establish the positions of norirus VP-RNA and e4 within the 48 ribosomal initiation complex. Our findings have implications for understanding norirus translation and developing antiv strategies.

**Title:** Investigating the Evolution of Gene Clusters in Bacterial Genomes: A Computational Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** What are the conditions under which gene clusters evolve in bacterial genomes, and can the selfish operon model explain the evolution of these clusters?

**Methods:** We developed three computational models to study the evolution of gene clusters: (1) a re-implementation of the selfish operon model, (2) a Moran process with natural selection and gene rearrangement by inversion, and (3) a model with selection and inversion tracking fixation of rearrangements.

**Findings:** Surprisingly, gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions. Factors promoting cluster evolution include low number of genes in pathway, high population size, and high horizontal transfer rate in the selfish model. Our analysis shows evolution can occur under direct and indirect selection as long as conditions hold. The operon model remains viable under these conditions.

**Implications:** The selfish oper model cannot explain gene order in biochemical reactions, suggesting multiple mechanisms, including horizontal transfer. We re-examine the basis for origins and maintenance of clusters by studying distinct models. The persistence model, not requiring direct selection, explains clustering of essential genes. The hypothesis is that clustered genes occupy less space, less likely to be disrupted by deletion or insertion.

**Conclusions:** The oper model offers a mechanism for evolution without invoking natural selection. Clusters persist due to proximity facilitating collective transfer between species. It applies to accessory genes, not essential. We constructed a model evolving according to Moran process with inversion, tracking a population of bacterial cells. The selfish model considers a pathway with 3+ genes. The population is initialized with bacteria carrying the same genome with genes uniformly placed on the chromosome. Gene clusters do not evolve under parameters used by Lawrence and Roth. We re-examined the model by exploring its parameter space. Figure 2 reveals the effect of varying parameters on the minimum distance.

**Key Findings:**

* Low number of genes in pathway
* High population size
* High transfer rate in selfish model
* Evolution under direct and indirect selection
* Operon viable under conditions

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of VAR2CS Expression in Plasmodium falciparum: Implications for Pregnancy-Associated Malaria

**Research Question:** How does Plasium falcum, the parasite responsible for malaria, regulate the expression of VARCS, a variant of the Pf1 antigen, which mediates adhesion to the placenta during pregnancy?

**Methods:** We employed cultured parasite lines and gene constructs to investigate the regulation of VARCS expression, revealing a novel mechanism of translational repression mediated by a small open reading frame (uORF) upstream of the Pf1 coding region.

**Findings:** Our results show that the uF acts to repress translation of VARCS mRNA, allowing high levels of protein expression upon selection, enabling parasites to upregulate this antigen in the presence of appropriate host tissue. Analysis of VARCS transcripts from CSA-binding parasites and pregnant women revealed the uF is not spliced and present in mRNA, indicating VARCS is encoded by bicronic transcript. This suggests an additional level of regulation of Pf1 variant associated with pregnancy malaria, preventing expression when placenta is not available for binding.

**Implications:** These findings provide insights into the molecular basis of host-parasite interactions underlying disease pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of studying mechanisms regulating VARCS expression and protein in general. VARCS can be detected in non-pregn individuals, including children and men, suggesting post-transcriptional mechanisms may operate, reducing immune exposure. Contrary evidence from proteomic study detected VARCS in non-plental parasites and earlier study demonstrated CSA activity in nonregn hosts.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of translational repression of VARCS, conserved in most, if not all, parasite isolates, exemplified by homologue in chimpanzee Plmodium reowi. Preservation of this gene suggests selective pressure, highlighting its importance in malaria pathogenesis. Further research into VARCS regulation and expression will elucidate host-parasite interactions, shedding light on pregnancy-associated malaria.

**Title:** Elucidating the Pathophysiology of Dengue Virus Infection: A Genome-Wide Analysis Reveals Transcriptional Profiles of Peripheral Immune Cells in Response

**Research Question:** What are the transcriptional profiles of peripheral immune cells in response to deng virus (DENV) infection, and how do they differ between severe and non-severe manifestations of the disease?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide microarray analysis of whole RNA from blood samples of 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua on days 3-6 of illness with different disease manifestations. Gene expression analysis identified differentially regulated genes between clinical subgroups.

**Findings:** The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between deng patients with and without shock, especially in expression of mitochondrial proteins associated with biosynthesis. In deng hemorrhagic fever, a subset of differentially expressed genes encoded neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides with innate immunity. Meta-analysis of our dataset with previously published datasets confirmed DENV infection in vivo associated with changes protein and nucleic metabolism. In vitro infection led to increased interferon signature, not consistently observed in vivo samples, suggesting transient interferon response.

**Implications:** These findings highlight differences between manifestations of severity during DENV infection and identify commonalities. Compilation of datasets across multiple studies may lead to prediction of disease via systems approach.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals distinct molecular profiles between Nicaraguan deng patients with shock and DH, and muted between DF and DH. Microarray meta-analysis with existing datasets identified common and differences. Comparison of severe and nonvere DENV cases in integrated dataset showed 32 genes significantly different, with 25 more expressed in severe and 7 in nonvere. This study contributes to understanding pathophysiology of DENV infection and highlights potential for systems biology approach to predict disease manifestation.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Herpesvirus Entry into the Olfactory Epithelium: A Novel Insights into Host-Pathogen Interactions

**Research Question:** How do herpesviruses, such as Murid Herpesvirus-4 (Mu-4), interact with the olfactory epithelium to establish infection, and what role does heparan sulfate (HS) play in this process?

**Methods:** Using Mu-4 as a tractable model, we investigated the relationship between HS expression, virion binding, and infection in the olfactory epithelium of mice.

**Findings:** Mu-4 virions targeted the olfactory epithelium, binding to HS on apical cilia of neurons and underlying microvilli of sustacular cells, leading to infection. HS-dependent entry was crucial, as virions unable to bind HS showed poor entry. The olfactory epithelium, comprising neurons, sustacular cells, and precursor cells, provided a unique site for Mu-4 entry. HS binding was not merely a non-specific capture, but a key component of Mu- entry.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the olfactory epithelium is an important site for herpesvirus entry and that HS-targeted interventions could control infection. Additionally, HS availability may restrict Mu- entry to this site, as gp mutants showed reduced infection despite reduced HS-dependence.

**Conclusions:** This study establishes the in vivo relationship between HS expression, virion binding, and infection in the olfactory epithelium, providing insights into herpesvirus-host interactions. The olfactory epithelium's complex structure, comprising neurons, sustacular cells, and precursor cells, facilitates Mu- entry, and HS plays a critical role in this process. These findings have implications for understanding herpesvirus pathogenesis and developing novel control strategies.

**Title:** Unveiling a Novel Regulatory Circuit: CRP-c Modulates Salmonella Invasion Gene Expression through Post-transcriptional Regulation of HilD

**Research Question:** How does CRP-c regulate the expression of SPI-1 genes in Salmonella, and what is the underlying mechanism of this regulation?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of CRP-c in regulating SPI-1 expression in Salmonella using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, including CRP-deficient strains, genetic analyses, and in vitro and in vivo assays.

**Findings:** We discovered that CR-c represses the expression of SPI-1 genes under non-permissive conditions by modulating the level of Hil, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion. This regulation occurs at the postcriptional level, requiring a newly identified motif within the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of Hil. Furthermore, we found that CR-c represses the transcription of Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot42, which in turn targets the 3'UTR of Hil through its unstructured region.

**Implications:** Our results highlight the importance of the 3'UTR of Hil as a hub for postcription control of Salmonella invasion gene expression and reveal a novel mechanism by which sRNAs target mRNAs. The CR-c-mediated regulation of Hil is crucial for Salmon virulence, as CR-deficient strains are unable to secrete SPI-1 effector proteins and are avirulent in a mouse model.

**Conclusions:** CR-c is a key regulator of rapid responses to environmental changes, and its regulation of Hil may be relevant for virulence response to environmental conditions encountered during infection. The postcription regulation of Hil by CR-c does not occur at transcription initiation, but through the 3'UTR of Hil. This study provides new insights into the complex regulation of SPI-1 expression and highlights the importance of postcription control in Salmonella virulence.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Chromatin Structure, Transcription, and Somatic CAG/CT Instability in Huntington's Disease

**Research Question:** The expansion of CAG/CT repeats is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy 1. However, the mechanisms underlying somatic instability of these repeats remain unclear, particularly in relation to chromatin structure and transcription.

**Methods:** We investigated the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD locus using the R6/1 and R2 transgenic mouse lines, which express a similar transgene integrated at different sites and recapitulate HD-specific tissue instability.

**Findings:** Our results show that CAG instability is increased in R2 tissues compared to R1-matched samples, correlating with high transgene expression and chromatin accessibility. Histone H3 trimethylation at the HD locus was increased, whereas H9 dimethylation was reduced in R2 tissues relative to R-matched. Notably, levels of transgene expression and specific histone marks were similar in striatum and cerebellum, two tissues showing different C instability levels. However, elongating Pol II at the locus, but not initiating Pol II, were tissue-specific and correlated with C instability. H3 trimylation, a mark associated with elongation, was increased at HD locus in striatum but not cerebellum.

**Implications:** Our data support the view that transcription modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo. Specifically, our results suggest for the first time that elongation is tissue-dependent, contributing to tissue-selective C instability.

**Conclusions:** The integration site of the transgene influences repeat instability, affecting chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. Our results indicate the HD transgene is integrated in a euchromatin and transcriptionally active region in R2 mice than R1, supporting active chrom structure in increased C instability. C instability was higher in R2, irrespective repeat size, than R1, suggesting chrom context at site integration and expression rather initial size underlies different somatic levels. Despite HD expression similar between striatum and cerebell from R1 and R2 lines, these present different C levels. Histone modifications associated heterochrom (2), euchrom (9), and initiation (4) at HD were comparable striatum and cerebell of mice.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Features of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) Dissemination in Immunocompromised Hosts: A Genomic Analysis and Functional Studies

**Research Question:** What are the specific genomic features of Enterovirus 71 (EV) that enable its dissemination in immunocompromised hosts, particularly in the central nervous system?

**Methods:** We analyzed five full-length genomes from respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and blood specimens of immunocompromised patients with disseminated disease, revealing three nucleotide changes within a five-day: a non-conservative amino acid change in VP1 within the BC loop (LR), a conservative amino substitution in protein 2 (AV), and a silent mutation in protein 3 (L). Infectious clones were constructed using Br (A) and clinical (C) lineages containing one or both non-syn mutations. In vitro tropism and competition assays showed VP1 Leu to Arg substitution within BC conferred replicative advantage in SHY5Y neuroblastoma cells.

**Findings:** The VP1 BC loop of EV71 plays a critical role in cell tropism independent of EV lineage, contributing to dissemination and neurotropism in immunocomised patients. The VP1 Leu to Arg substitution within BC loop conferred replicative advantage in SHY5Y cells, associated with a second non-conservative mutation (E or E) in VP1 loop in neuroblast cells. Comparative models suggest no structural changes, but substitutions may alter host interactions.

**Implications:** Our results highlight the importance of VP1 BC region in EV71 dissemination and neurotropism in immunocomised patients. The VP1 loop may interact with host receptors, facilitating cell entry and replication.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies specific genomic features of EV71 that enable dissemination in immunocomised hosts, particularly in the CNS. The VP1 BC region plays a critical role in cell tropism, independent of EV lineage, contributing to dissemination and neurotropism in immunocomised patients.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Quorum Sensing in Streptoccus Species: Unraveling the Specificity of ComR-XIP Interactions

**Research Question:** How do different Streptoccus species regulate competence through the ComRS quorum sensing system, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying the specificity of ComR-X interactions?

**Methods:** We employed an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the regulation of competence in Streptoccus species, focusing on the ComRS system. We developed an in vivo assay to measure the activity of ComR proteins in response to cognate and heterologous X peptides, revealing distinct classes of strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. Additionally, we solved the X-ray crystal structure of ComR from S suis to understand the interaction with X and identify structural features of Com proteins that explain X recognition. Using the structure as a guide, we probed the apo conformation of the X-binding pocket site by site-directed mutagenesis in test cultures and biochemically in vitro.

**Findings:** Our results provide a model for X recognition and specificity, allowing prediction of novel X peptides that induce Com activity. We found that the X-binding pocket is lined by a variable and conserved face, where conserved residues contribute to ligand binding and variable face discriminate among X peptides. Alignments with Com proteins from other species reveal a conserved and variable face, where cons residues contribute to ligand binding and variable face among X peptides.

**Implications:** This study provides a foundation for understanding the role of ComRS in species communication and competence regulation in Streptoccus, and a detailed biochemical model for Com-X recognition and specificity. Our findings have implications for the development of novel X peptides that induce Com activity, potentially useful for applications in biotechnology and medicine.

**Conclusions:** The ComRS system plays a crucial role in the regulation of competence in Strept species, and our results provide a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms of quorum sensing in this genus. The specificity of Com-X interactions is determined by a variable and conserved face of the X-binding pocket, where conserved residues contribute to ligand binding and variable face among X peptides. This study provides a basis for future research on the role of ComRS in species communication and the development of novel X peptides that induce Com activity, with potential applications in biotechnology and medicine.

**Title:** Epigenetic Inheritance of Centrom Position through Replication Timing in the Pathogenic Yeast Candida albicans

**Research Question:** How do centromeres, the specialized chromosomal regions responsible for ensuring proper chromosome segregation, maintain their position over generations in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans?

**Methods:** We employed a genome-wide replication timing analysis of the C. albicans genome to investigate the replication properties of centromeric DNA. We discovered that each centrom is associated with a replication origin that fires first on its respective chromosome, and epigenetic formation of ectromeres (neocromeres) is accompanied by shifts in replication timing, where neoceres become first to replicate and associate with origin recognition complex (ORC) components.

**Findings:** Our results show that centrom-specific histone H3 isoform changes lead to concomitant changes in ORC association with centrom regions, supporting the idea that centrom proteins determine origin activity. Analysis of centrom-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent pattern characteristic of constitutively active origins. This strand-based pattern is conserved with centrom position among strains and species, independent of primary sequence.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that inheritance of centrom position is correlated with constitutively active origin replication that fires at distinct time. We propose a model where timing DNA replication serves as epetic mechanism for inheritance of centrom position.

**Conclusion:** In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where centrom are defined by DNA sequence, C. albicans centrom exhibit epetically inherited characteristics, yet are short and sequenced. Our study provides evidence for epetic inheritance of centrom position through replication timing, establishing a novel mechanism of epetic inheritance.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Genetic Loci Associated with Chronic Back Pain in Adults of European Ancestry

**Research Question:** Despite being the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, the underlying biology of chronic back pain (CB) remains poorly understood. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to identify genetic variants associated with CB in adults of European ancestry.

**Methods:** We pooled data from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biob interim release, including 158,025 individuals, 29,531 with CB cases and 128,494 controls. Genotyping used commercially available arrays followed by imputation, and GWAS logistic regression models with additive effects adjusting for age, sex, study-specific covariates, and population structure. Threshold for genome-wide significance was p<5×10-8.

**Findings:** We identified a genome-wide significant association for the intronic variant rs10519 in SOX5 (OR 1.08, p=7.2×10-10), replicated in 283,752 UKob participants not in the discovery, including 50,915 cases (OR 1.06, p5.3×10-11), and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint-analysis (OR 1.07, p4.5×10-19). Suggestive associations were found at three loci in discovery, two exceeding genome-wide in joint-analysis: intergenic rs317, between CC26 and GSD (OR 1.05,4.4×10-13), and intronic rs438 in D (0.97,2.4×10).

**Implications:** This first meta-analysis of GWAS for CB identified a genetic locus associated with CB (SO5) and two other loci reaching genome-wide significance in joint-analysis (CC26/GSD and D). These findings provide insights into the biology of CB and potential therapeutic targets.

**Conclusions:** Despite phenotype heterogeneity, we successfully identified associations of statistical significance. Efforts to standardize CB definitions may limit heterogeneity in future GWAS of CB. Another aspect of phenotype used was individuals with pain less than 3 months included as controls, to focus on chronic pain duration. GW examining pain any duration or excluding non-chronic back may find different results. Limitation was lack of independence in replication sample UKob from UK2, given same base and methods between UK1 and UK2.

**Title:** Estimating the Burden of Taenia solium Cysticercosis in Cameroon: A Neglected Zoonosis in Developing Countries

**Research Question:** This study aimed to calculate the impact of Taenia solium cysticosis, a neglected zoonotic disease, in Cameroon, using cost and Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DAL) estimations, considering both human and animal burden.

**Methods:** Parameters were collected and imported into R software, using different distributions according to the type of information available for each parameter. Prevalence of epilepsy (3.6%) was used to estimate the number of people with neurocystercosis-associated epilepsy (50,326, 95% CI 37,299-65,924, representing 1.0% of the population) and pigs with cysticosis (15,961, 95 CI 12,320-20,044, 5.6% of pig population).

**Findings:** Total costs due to T. solium cystosis in Cameroon were estimated at €10,255,202 (95% CI 6,889-14,754), with 4.7% due to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% to direct and indirect losses caused by cystosis. Monetary per case of cystosis was €194 (95 CI 147-253). Average DALs lost were 9.0 per thousand persons per year (95 CI 2.8-20.4).

**Implications:** This study provides an estimation of costs to T. solium cystosis using country-specific parameters, including human and animal burden of zoon disease. Comparison with a study in South Africa indicates that cost inactivity, influenced by salaries, plays a predominant role in monetary burden of T. solium cystosis. Knowing salary and prevalence of disease allows rapid indication of total of T. solium cystosis in a country. Ascertaining finding with additional studies in cystic-endemic countries could estimate global burden of cystosis. Estimated DALs lost to disease were higher than available for other neglected diseases. Total and DALs lost probably underestimate real values, as estimations based on epilepsy only symptom of cystosis.

**Conclusion:** Taenia solium cystosis is an important zoon disease in developing countries, with human cystosis under-recognised due to clinical variety of symptoms and unavailability of diagnostic tools in endemic areas. This study estimates burden of T. solium cystosis in Cameroon, including both human and animal, using cost and DAL estimations. Results indicate significant economic and health impact of disease, highlighting need for further research and control measures.

**Title:** Unveiling the Regulatory Role of Rsa, a Non-coding RNA, in Staphylococcus aureus Virulence

**Research Question:** What is the function of Rsa, a non-coding RNA in Staphlococcus aureus, and how does it contribute to the bacterium's virulence and interactions with the host?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of Rsa, a non-coding RNA, in Staphlococcus aureus virulence. We analyzed the effects of Rsa deletion on biofilm formation, capsule synthesis, and opsonophoc killing by polymonuclear leukocytes. We also used animal models to study the impact of Rsa on acute and chronic infections.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that Rsa, a Sigma-dependent noncoding RNA, represses the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator Mgr by forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine-Dalg sequence and loop interaction within the coding region of the target mRNA. This recognition is required for translation repression. Consequently, Rsa enhances biofilm formation and decreases capsule synthesis, leading to decreased protection against opsonophoc killing by polymonuclear leukocytes compared to mutant strains lacking Rsa. In animal models, Rsa attenuates the severity of acute infections and enhances catheter colonization.

**Implications:** Rsa is the first example of a conserved RNA in Stlococcus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections. We propose that Rsa has been positively selected through evolution to support commensal and saprophytic interactions with the host. Our findings highlight the importance of noncoding RNAs in regulating virulence and physiological responses in Stlococcus aureus.

**Conclusions:** Successful infection by Stlococcus largely depends on coordinated expression of virulence and accessory genes. We show that Rsa, a nonessential RNA in Stlococcus species, reduces virulence. Deletion of Rsa increases invasiveness in seps model and resistance to opsonoc killing, while promoting biofilm and cath colonization, potentially leading to chronic infections. Our study elucidates the function and mechanism of Rsa, a Sigma B-dependent RNA, which represses mgrA translation, a master regulator of virulence determinants.

**Title:** Unveiling the Dynamics of HIV-1 Uncoating: A Novel Insights into the Critical Step of HIV-1 Entry

**Research Question:** How does the assembly of the cone-shaped HIV-1 capsid in target cells contribute to the establishment of a lifelong infection, and what are the dynamics of the uncoating process, a poorly understood step in HIV-1 entry?

**Methods:** We employed a novel strategy to visualize HIV-1 unating using a fluorescently tagged oligomeric form of caps-binding protein cyclophilin (Cyp-DRed), specifically packaged into virions through high-avidity binding to caps (CA). Single imaging revealed that Cyp-DRed remains associated with cores after permeabilization/removal of the viral membrane, and Cyp-D and CA are lost concomantly from cores in vitro and living cells. The rate of loss is modulated by core stability and accelerated upon initiation of reverse transcription.

**Findings:**

* Majority of single cores lose Cyp-D shortly after viral fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours.
* Single particle tracking at late post-infection reveals gradual loss of Cyp-D dependent on reverse transcription.
* Unating occurs both in cytoplasm and nuclear membrane.
* Our novel imaging assay enables time-resolved visualization of HIV-1 unating in living cells, revealing previously unapprec spatio-temp features of this incompletely understood process.

**Implications:**

* Our findings provide novel insights into the dynamics of HIV-1 unating, a critical step in HIV entry.
* Cyp-DRed reports dissociation from cores correlates with HIV-1 caps stability and p24 loss from labeled cores in vitro.
* Cyp-based assay enables visualization of native HIV-1 cores without additional manipulations.

**Conclusions:**

* Cyp-DRed efficiently incorporates into HIV-1 particles without compromising viral infectivity.
* Cyp-D loss from cores correlates with HIV- caps stability and p24 loss in vitro and post-fusion in cells.
* Unating occurs in cytoplasm and nuclear.
* Our novel assay enables time-resolved visualization of HIV- unating in living cells, revealing previously unrec spatio-temp features of this incompletely understood process.

**Title:** Oligonucleotide Usage in Archaeal and Bacterial Genomes: A Statistical Analysis of DNA Composition and Sequence Patterns**

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the statistical potential of different oligonucleotide sizes and explore oligonucle frequencies in coding and non-coding regions of archaeal and bacterial genomes, as well as their composition and sequence patterns within prokary organisms.

**Methods:** A series of statistical tests were performed on sequenced bacterial and archaeal chromosomes (up to September 2006) to measure the information carried by differently sized oligonotides from di to octanotides in proary with GC contents between 47% and 53.

**Findings:**

* Proary chromosomes can be described by hexanucle frequencies, suggesting that proary DNA is predominantly short-range, i.e., information proary is encoded in oligonides.
* Oligonucle usage varied within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than GC and freeiving genomes, mainly in nonoding regions.
* Bias selection pressure in tetranucle usage correlated with GC, coding regions more than nonoding.
* Nonoding regions were found to be 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average, in 402 examined chromosomes.
* Pronounced compositional differences found within and between AT and GC genomes.
* GC genomes were more similar in terms tetranucle usage nonoding than AT genomes.

**Implications:**

* The results suggest that oligonucle sizes larger than hexanotides possess little information, if any, in proary DNA.
* GC-rich genomes have less variation in nucle frequencies in nonoding regions, while AT-rich genomes have more variation.
* A link was established between genomic content and OUV (R=0.5).

**Conclusions:**

This study demonstrates that oligucle usage in archaeal and bacterial genomes can be linked to various properties, including cod usage, base-stacking, and structural conformation. The results show that proary chromosomes can be described by hexan frequencies, indicating that pro DNA is predominantly short-range, with information encoded in oligonides. Oligucle usage varied within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than GC and freeiving, mainly in nonoding. Bias selection pressure in tetranucle usage correlated with GC, coding more than nonoding. Nonoding were found to be 5.5% more AT-rich coding, on average, in 402 examined. Pron compositional differences were found within and between AT and GC genomes. GC genomes were more similar in tetran usage nonoding than AT. The differences between AT and GC may be attributed lifestyle, since tetran usage host-associated was more dissimilar and less than freeiving.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Meiotic Recombination: Unveiling a Novel Source of Recombination-Driven Meiotic Drive and Its Implications for Genome Evolution

**Research Question:** How do meiotic recombination events contribute to the segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and DNA diversity, and what factors influence the initiation and regulation of recombination at hotspots?

**Methods:** We analyzed both types of recombinant molecules in sperm DNA at six highly active hotspots and investigated disparities in transmission of allelic variants indicative of cis-acting influences.

**Findings:** At two hotspots, we identified a novel form of biased transmission exclusive to noncrossover recombinants, arising from differences in crossover and noncrossover heterodup formation and mismatch repair. This form of gene conversion is not predicted to influence hotspot activity, but constitutes a previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive, potentially affecting thousands of hotspots throughout the human genome. Intriguingly, both hotspots favor strong (G/C) over (A/T) base pairs, consistent with established correlations between GC content and recombination in mammalian genomes.

**Implications:** Heterozygosity at a SNP can lead to differences in initiation between haplotypes, influencing hotspot activity in cis. Overtransmission of alleles from DSB-suppressed haplotype recombin progeny results in meiotic drive favoring hotspot-suppress variants, leading to hotspot extinction over time. Biased conversions have been observed in some assays as deviations from expected 1:1 allele frequencies amongst recombin progeny, arising from initiation on one chromosome over the other and correction from uncut homologue.

**Conclusions:** This meiotic drive is strong enough to promote allele fixation, and our findings may represent a form of biased conversion acting on the human genome, contributing to correlation between GC content and recombination and evolution of base composition. Fisher's exact test substantiated heterozygosity at 5.2 drives biased conversion at PRDM C-regulated hotspot. TD at hotspot is consistent with differential recombination initiation between haplotypes, noted at other hotspots. However, differences at hotspots are modest and not significantly between, suggesting variability of NCO:CO at SPR3 may be unique to sex chromosomes in meiosis. We observed biased conversion at two hotspots of six examined.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Environmental Chemical-Induced Health Risks: A High-Confidence Protein-Protein Network Integrating Toxicology and Systems Biology

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying the adverse effects of environmental chemicals and drugs on human health, and how can we predict which compounds pose a risk to human health?

**Methods:** We developed a high-confidence protein-protein association network by integrating toxicology and systems biology, leveraging the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) containing curated information on 2,490 compounds and 6,060 molecular targets involved in human diseases. We analyzed 42,194 associations between chemicals and proteins to identify novel connections between compounds and diseases.

**Findings:** Our computational systems biology model revealed uncharacterized connections between chemicals and diseases, predicting potential risk factors for health. The network can also identify unexpected associations between chemicals and proteins. Examples include chemicals associated with breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis, and potential targets for diethylhexylphthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloribenzo-p-diox, pirix acid, and permethrin.

**Implications:** This approach integrates toxicogen data with other types, providing necessary for developing systems models predicting high-level associations (chemical-disease) and detailed associations (chemical-protein). Our method associates chemicals with disease and identifies molecular targets based on integration of toxicogenomics, chemical structures, protein-protein data, and functional annotation.

**Conclusions:** Our approach differs from existing chemical networks, primarily integrating drugs to identify molecular targets and link to diseases. We demonstrate the power of integrating toxicogenomics data with other types to predict chemical-disease associations and protein-protein interactions. This study highlights the importance of analyzing environmental chemicals with gene expression profiles, with recent advances in toxicogenomics providing gene/protein activity in response to small exposures.

**Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of Cortical Processing: A Nonlinear Feedforward Models Reveal Nonlinear Aspects of Auditory Cortical Responses

**Research Question:** How do primary auditory cortical neurons process complex sounds, and what are the underlying mechanisms of their responses to natural stimuli?

**Methods:** We employed a nonlinear feedforward network model to fit cortical responses to natural sounds, revealing that primary auditory neurons are sensitive to a larger spectrotemporal domain than their standard receptive fields. The model consisted of 1-7 sub-receptive fields interacting nonlinearly, outperforming standard receptive fields in predicting neural responses.

**Findings:** Our results show that auditory cortical neurons are sensitive to a substantially larger spectrotemp domain than seen in standard receptive fields. The network field revealed excitatory and inhibitory subfields with nonlinear properties, interaction giving rise to operations such as gain and conjunctive detection. Conjunct effects, where neurons respond to specific features together, increase selectivity for complex structures, and may constitute an important stage in sound recognition.

**Implications:** Fitting feedforward models expands simple receptive models, yielding improved predictive power and revealing nonlinear aspects of cortical processing, interpretable in physiological context. Our approach has potential to unmask signal strategies used by the brain.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that auditory neural responses can be better predicted by feedforward models with sparse regularization, revealing richness and nonlinearity of cortical processing. Spectrotemp receptive fields of primary cortex can be broad, but punctate, indicating complexity of processing. Adding nonlinearity to models improves prediction, but neural responses depend on multiple features interacting nonlinearly. Our model reveals sensitivity over wider time and frequency ranges, nonlinear properties including gain and conjunct selectivity, critical to auditory function.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Casein Kinase 2 (CK2) and Cryptochrome (CRY) in Regulating Circadian Rhythmic Phosphorylation of BMAL1 in the Mammalian Circadian Clock

**Research Question:** How do casein kinase 2 (CK) and cryptochrome (CRY) regulate circadian rhythmic phosphorylation of BMAL in the mammalian circadian clock?

**Methods:** Using a novel CK-purbing peptide, we investigated the role of CK2-mediated BMAL-S90 phosphorylation in central and peripheral clocks. Co-immunoprecipitation and real-time protein–protein interaction analysis revealed CRY as a repressor of CK2 kinase activity toward BM1-S90.

**Findings:** CRY-mediated binding of CK2 to BM1 inhibits BM1-S90 phosphorylation by CKα. The FAD domain of CRY, two-terminal BM1 domains, and BM1-L537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT are critical for CRY BM1-CKβ binding. Recipally, BM1-S90 phosphorylation is prerequisite for BM-L537 acetylation. We propose a dual-feedback model where CRY-dependent CK-driven post-translational BM1-P loop is integral to the core oscillator.

**Implications:** Our study establishes a circadian-controlling role of CK2, previously thought to be constitutively active, in BM1 phosphorylation and a novel role of CRY as regulator of CK-mediated BM1 phosphorylation. CRY proteins have a dual function: repression of BM1-CLOCK transcription and repression of CK2 activity toward BM90. BM1 is hyperphosphorylated in C1/2-deficient mice, suggesting RY involvement in rhythmic BM modification.

**Conclusions:** We unveil the molecular mechanism of CK-mediated postlational loop and its role in the intracellular circadian core oscillator. CKα remains bound to BM1-CLOCK up step IV, likely catalytically active but inactivated by CRY binding CKβ step V. Our study highlights the interplay between RY and circadian BM phosphorylation, a critical event in mammalian core clock machinery.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Bacterial Adaptation to Bile: A Study on Salmonella enterica's Response to Sodium Deoxycholate (DOC)

**Research Question:** How does Salmonella enterica adapt to sublethal concentrations of sodium deoxycholate (DOC) and survive lethal concentrations of bile, and what are the underlying mechanisms involved in this adaptation?

**Methods:** This study employed a combination of molecular biology and microbiology techniques to investigate the adaptation of Salmonella enterica to suble concentrations of DOC and lethal concentrations of bile. We analyzed gene expression changes, including upregulation of the Rpo-dependent stress response and other stress responses, and the role of the general stress response in adaptation to bile. Additionally, we used fluctuation analysis to determine the frequency of emergence of bile-resistant colonies from non-adapted Salmonella cultures.

**Findings:** Our results show that adaptation to bile is associated with changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the Rpo-dependent stress response and other stress responses. Crucially, the role of the general response in adaptation to bile is supported by the observation that Rpo mutants are bile-sensitive. Furthermore, adaptation involves a response by the bacterial population, but individual cells can become bile-resistant without adaptation. Fluctuation analysis indicates that such colonies derive from bile-resistant cells present in the culture, and a fraction of isolates are stable, indicating that resistance can be acquired by mutation. Full genome sequencing of bile-resistant mutants reveals alteration of lipopolysaccharide transport machinery as a frequent cause of mutational resistance. However, selection on lethal concentrations of bile also provides isolates that are not mutants, suggesting that these derive from cells in a physiological state that permits survival upon encountering bile.

**Implications:** This study highlights the existence of phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal populations of bacteria and illustrates the adaptive value of gene fluctuations. We propose that nonmutational adaptation might be caused by activation of bile-resistance in the absence of bile, supported by expression analysis of osm, an Rpo-dependent, and cD, a stress gene not belonging to the R regulon. This phenomenon, called adaptation, is observed in the laboratory and may be relevant during Salmonella colonization of the hepatiliary tract.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that growth of Salmonella on suble concentrations of bile is accompanied by dramatic changes in gene expression, and that cultures contain cells with high levels of resistance without adaptation. Genetic analysis identified functions whose loss increases resistance, probably by activating defense responses. The resistance of wild-type Salmonella can be increased by growth in presence suble concentrations of bile. Overall, this study provides insights into the mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to bile and highlights the importance of phenotypic heterogeneity in bacterial populations.

**Title:** Compaction of the E. coli Chromosome into Supercoiled Domains and the Organization of Prophage Mu as a Stable Domain

**Research Question:** How is the E. coli chromosome compacted into supercoiled domains, and how is the prophage Mu organized as a stable domain?

**Methods:** We investigated the compaction of the E. coli chromosome into supercoiled domains and the organization of prophage Mu as a stable domain using chromosome conformation capture, Cre-lox recombination, and DNA-protein association.

**Findings:** We found that the E. coli chromosome is compacted into 400-500 supercoiled domains by both active and passive mechanisms, such as transcription and DNA-protein association. Prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain bounded by the proximal location of Mu termini L and R, which are 37bp apart on the genome. The formation and maintenance of the Mu domain is dependent on a strong gyrase site (SGS) at the center of Mu, Mu end MuB protein, and E. coli proteins IH, F, and H. The domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations. In contrast, prophage does not form an independent domain. The establishment and maintenance of Mu was promoted by low-level transcription from phage, one of which was domain-dependent.

**Implications:** We propose that the domain confers transposition to Mu by topological requirements of reaction and the proximity of Mu ends. The benefits to the host from a subset proteins expressed by proph may help its long-term stability.

**Conclusions:** The organization of proph Mu, anchored by L and ends, was observed at structurally different regions of E. coli. The pairing of neighboring arms was seen to extend 5-10bp outside Mu into E. DNA. S and gyrase were critical to domain integrity. Low levels Mu are expressed in lysogen from Pe and a newly identified Pe. The domain is important for transcription but not Pe. Thus, activity is domain-dependent while is not. E Ns such as H, IH, F, and H are implicated in chromosomal supercoiled via DNA and bridging properties. In contrast, the closed structure of the genome where synaps proph ends is assisted by processive supercoiling gyrase to centrally located S site, has been proposed aid transposition during lytic growth. Our result is that Mu exists in quiescent state and requires, in addition to S, several proteins and Ns for formation/maintenance. IH, H, and F appear facilitate domain independently their interactions within genome to transposition or inversion via site-specific recombination. Rather, is assisted by global nucleoid organization. Our model for Mu domain incorporates findings with earlier proposal colleagues.

**Title:** Primaquine (PQ) Reduces Plasmodium vivax (Pv) Relapses and Gamet Carriage: Implications for Malaria Control

**Research Question:** Does primaquine (PQ) treatment reduce Plasium vivax (P) relapses and gamet carriage, and what are the implications for malaria control?

**Methods:** A randomized treatment-to-infection cohort study was conducted in Papua New Guine children. Children received radical cure with chloroquine, artemether-lumeftrine plus primaquine (PQ) or placebo. Blood samples were collected 2-4 weekly over 8 months. Gamet were detected by quantitative reverse transcription PCR targeting p25 and p25.

**Findings:** PQ reduced Pv gamet incidence by 73%, comparable to PQ effect on blood-stage infections. 92% Pv and 79 Pfet-positive were asymptomatic. Pv gamet positivity and density associated with blood-stage densities. Multivariate analysis showed reduced gamet in mixed-species compared single-species infections (OR Pv = 0.39 [95% CI 0.25-0.62], Pf = 0.33 [95 CI 0.18-0.60], p<0.001). No difference between PQ and placebo arms in Pvet density or Pv infections carried gamet.

**Implications:** PQ reduces Pv relapses and gamet carriage, highlighting the importance of anti-hypnoite treatment for control. Relapses contribute to Pv reservoir, emphasizing the need for effective-hnoite treatment.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of GTPase Cycling in the Regulation of Actin Organization during Cellular Processes: A Modeling and Experimental Analysis

**Research Question:** How do GTPases, specifically Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, regulate actin organization during diverse cellular processes such as migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis, and what is the role of GTP cycling between the membrane and cytosol in their differential regulation?

**Methods:** We developed a modeling framework to analyze experimental data on GTPase systems, revealing details of GDI-mediated cycling and distinguishing between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and association/dissociation of Gase with membrane molecules.

**Findings:** Analysis of experimental data on Rac cycling revealed a lower apparent affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacDP, explained by faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. Non-dimensional steady-state solutions for membrane of GTP were presented in multidimensional charts, illustrating the effects of Gs/GAPs and affinities between Gases and membrane/GDI on the amount of membrane GTP.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that Rho-Gase cycling can access diverse pathways in different cellular systems through experimental manipulations, highlighting the importance of GTP cycling between membrane and cytos in differential regulation of biochemical switches.

**Conclusions:** The presented methodology can be used to analyze glucose-stimulated cycling in pancreatic β-cells, illustrating the effects of Gs/Gs and affinities between Gases membrane/GDI on the amount of membrane GTP. Similar charts can be used to assess targeted modifications compensating altered Gase-G balance in disease scenarios.

**Key Findings:**

* Rho-GTP cycling can access diverse pathways in different cellular systems through experimental manipulations
* GTP cycling between membrane and cytos is key to differential regulation of biochemical switches
* Analysis of Rac cycling reveals lower affinity of GDI for RacG compared to RacDP, explained by faster dissociation of latter from membrane
* Non-steady-state solutions for membrane of GTP presented in multidimensional charts
* Methodology used to analyze glucose-stimulated cycling in pancreatic β-cells, illustrating effects of Gs/Gs and affinities G/GDI on amount of G
* Charts can be used to assess targeted modifications compensating altered G-G balance in disease scenarios

**Future Directions:**

* Build model for biological systems where GDI and independent mechanisms contribute to GTP cycling
* Complete model for membrane activation of Gases displayed, interaction with G inhibiting nucleotide exchange
* Relative contribution of G mediated GTP cycling visualized using coefficients ρG and ρm
* ρ smaller than unity means bound GTP is less likely G bound than cytos G
 ρ smaller means G-bound has lower affinity for membrane than G-free

**Title:** Assessing the Impact of Adult Infection Burden on Schistosomiasis Control: A Mathematical Modeling of Preventive Chemotherapy Coverage

**Research Question:** How does the distribution of Schistosoma mansoni infection among different age groups impact the mathematical recommendations for preventive chemotherapy coverage to achieve World Health Organization (WHO) morbidity control and elimination goals?

**Methods:** We analyzed data from monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs to investigate the effect of age-specific infection profiles of Schistoma mansoni with low, moderate, and high burdens of infection in adults on the required treatment levels to achieve WHO goals. We collected prevalence and intensity data from school-aged children (SAC) and adults to determine the optimal treatment strategy for a region.

**Findings:** Our results show that in moderate prevalence regions, regardless of adult burden, treating SAC may achieve WHO goals. However, in high prevalence regions with high adult burden, adult treatment is required to meet goals. We highlight the importance of considering adult infection burden in treatment strategy, not solely relying on SAC prevalence.

**Implications:** Our study emphasizes the need for accurate data from M&E programs to determine optimal treatment for a region. We recommend collecting prevalence and intensity data from a broader age range, including adults at baseline and throughout treatment, rather than solely SAC. Additional epidemiological data, such as individual adherence to treatment, should be collected in M&E.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of age-specific data, particularly adults, in M&E programs to accurately determine treatment strategy for a region. Past epidemiological data have informed models for schistosome transmission, but more detailed data are required to accurately determine optimal treatment for a region. We recommend including adults in treatment efforts, especially in high-risk areas and women of childbearing age, as recommended in 2002. Mathematical models of schosome transmission suggest adaptations, such as increased treatment levels or frequency, may be necessary. The burden in adults varies geographically, impacted by behavioral, cultural, and access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) factors.

**Title:** Personalized Computational Modeling of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy for Improved Surgical Outcomes

**Research Question:** Can a computational model of brain connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data predict seizure onset and spread in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients, and inform patient-specific surgical resections for improved outcomes?

**Methods:** We applied a computational model of brain connectivity to DTI data from 22 individuals with TLE and 39 healthy controls. We validated the model by examining patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset and location. Then, we investigated the potential of the model for surgery prediction by performing in-silico resections, removing nodes from patient networks and comparing seizure likelihood post-surgery to pre-surgery.

**Findings:** We found that patients with TLE tend to transition from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls in the model. Regions in the left hemisphere, particularly temporal and subcortical regions known to be involved in TLE, were the most frequent starting points for seizures in patients. Our analysis also implicated contralateral frontal regions in seizure spreading or resistance. The model predicted patient-specific surgery resection areas chosen on an individual basis, not following a predefined procedure, may lead to better outcomes than routine clinical procedure.

**Implications:** This work provides a first step towards patient-specific modeling of epilepsy to inform treatment strategies. Accurately identifying seizure initiation regions is crucial in surgery planning and prediction. Our results suggest that subject-specific surgery may reduce seizures more than standard resections in simulations. The brain can be modeled as a network, structurally abstracted to nodes and connections mapped through DTI. Seizure initiation and spreading can be modeled using connectivity to individual patients. This is based on comparisons with previous studies simulating dynamics with human connectome data. Weighting edges is another factor to consider.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of computational modeling for predicting TLE surgery outcomes. Patient-specific resections may lead to better seizure reduction than standard procedures. The model can be used to inform treatment strategies for individuals. Accurate identification of seizure regions is key in surgery planning and prediction. Our results suggest that subject-specific surgery may be more effective than standard resections. The brain can be modeled as a network, structurally abstracted to nodes and connections mapped through DT. Seizure initiation and spreading can be modeled using connectivity to individual. This is based on comparisons with previous studies simulating dynamics with human data. Weighting edges is another factor to consider.

**Title:** Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) Utilizes Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (vIRF-1) to Inhibit Apoptosis via Interaction with Bcl-2 Family Member Bim

**Research Question:** How does HHV-8 counteract the host's antiviral defenses by interfering with interferon and apoptotic signaling pathways, and what is the role of vIR-1 in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between vIR-1 and Bim, a pro-apoptic Bcl-2 family member, in HH-8 infected cells using immunofluorescence, western blot, and co-precipitation assays. Deletion and point mutagenesis were used to map B-binding residues ofIR-1 and generate B-refactoryIR-1 variants.

**Findings:** v-1 localized Bim in infected cells and co-localized with B in nuclei of lytically infected endothelial cells. Direct interaction between v-1 and B was confirmed by co-precitation, and B-binding residues of v-1 were mapped. Generation of B-refactory-1 variants revealed the importance of v-1:B interaction in prolication and anti-apopt activity. Blocking the interaction with a cell-perme peptide confirmed the relevance of v-1:B association to v- prolication.

**Implications:** This is the first report of an IR protein interacting with a B-2 family member and sequestering B or any member as a means of inactivation. The data reveal a novel mechanism by which HH-8 controls replication-induced apoptosis and suggest inhibiting v-1:B interaction may provide an effective antiral strategy.

**Conclusions:** v-1 plays a critical role in HH- replication by inhibiting apoptosis via interaction with B, a pro-apic B-2 family member. Disruption of this regulation may provide a useful means controlling HH- replication.

**Title:** The Role of Epithelial αVβ Integrin in Maintaining Lung Immune Homeostasis and Response to Respiratory Infections

**Research Question:** What is the role of epithelial αβ integrin in maintaining lung immune homeostasis and responding to respiratory infections, particularly during influenza and other respiratory pathogens?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of epithelial αβ integrin in lung homeostasis and infection using β-deficient mice (β KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. β KO mice were infected with influenza, Sendai virus, and bacterial pneumonia. We analyzed lung histopathology, cytokine expression, vascular permeability, and macrophage phenotype.

**Findings:** β KO mice were protected from influenza-induced acute lung injury (ALI), characterized by reduced edema, inflammatory cytokine expression, and vascular permeability. β KO mice had altered homeostasis with high CD11+CD11+ macrophages, whereas WT had CD11-CD+ macrophages. Administration of exogenous TGF-β to β KO mice reduced CD11+ macrophages, type I IF signaling, and ALI. β KO mice were also protected from other respiratory pathogens, including Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia.

**Implications:** Loss of epithelial αβ integrin alters lung microenvironment during homeostasis and infection, leading to reduced injury and improved survival. Upregulation of β during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. β-deficient mice have constitutively activated lung macrophages and elevated type I IF signaling due to loss of β-activated growth factor (TGF-β). Administration of exogenous TGFβ to β KO leads to reduced CD11+ macroph, type I signaling and protective phenotype during infection.

**Conclusions:** Our studies demonstrate that loss of epithelial protein αβ integrin can alter lung microenvironment during homeostasis and infection, leading to reduced injury and improved survival. The role of β integrin in modulating AL suggests its upregulation during respiratory infections, such as influenza, is important for pathogenesis. Loss of β-activated TGF results in altered macrophage population and type I activation, contributing to protection from infection.

**Title:** Evaluation of the Leishin Skin Test as a Diagnostic Tool for Cutaneous Leishmanias in the Americas: A Retrospective Analysis of Cases in Argentina

**Research Question:** Can the Leish Skin Test (LST) be a useful as a complementary diagnostic tool for cutaneous leishmanias in the Americas, particularly in areas where the parasite burden is low?

**Methods:** A retrospective analysis of 733 cases of first episode tegumentary leishias at a reference center in Argentina between 2006-2015 was performed. Demographic, clinical, and diagnostic data were analyzed in individuals with clinically compatible lesions, smear, and LST.

**Findings:** 474 (65%) cases were confirmed through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 among this group having negative LST. Among negative smear cases, 190 were also negative by LST, but 69 LST was positive. Across age groups, similar ratios of sensitivity between smear and L were calculated. Lesions older than 21-old days were found to correlate with positive results for both smear and L significantly than younger.

**Implications:** These findings support the use of L as a diagnostic complement for American cutaneous leishias across age groups in endemic areas. The correlation with smear was high. Standardization of this technique and further research into its adequate protocols will help in management of suspicious cases.

**Conclusions:** The Leish Skin Test can be a useful diagnostic tool for cutaneous leishias in the Americas, particularly in areas where parasite burden is low. The correlation with smear was high. Standardization of technique and further research into protocols will aid in management of suspicious cases.

**Title:** Elucidating the Epigenetic Mechanisms of Coronary Artery Disease: Atherosclerosis through Lipid-Induced Macrophage Transformation

**Research Question:** How do genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk influence transcriptional regulation in lipid-induced macrophage transformation to foam cells, a key pathophysiological event in atherosclerosis?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of chromatin mapping with formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FA-seq) and enhancer transcription mapping using chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) in primary human macrophages before and after exposure to atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LD), resulting in foam cell formation.

**Findings:** Lipid-induced cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of open chromatin and enhancer sites, strongly correlated with expression of nearby genes. Lip-regulated enhancers were enriched for transcription factors, including C/EB-beta, previously uninvolved in foam formation. Lip exposure upregulated CEB expression and binding, most prominently around genes in inflammatory pathways. Variants at CAD loci were significantly enriched in subset chrom sites altered by LD, including rs643 in an LD-enhancer at PP2 locus. Lip increased CEB binding to site and CEB activity were stronger with protective allele rs643.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate a genetic mechanism contributing CAD risk at PP2 locus and highlight the value studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic stimuli.

**Conclusions:** This study mapped effects of LD on chromatin and gene expression in macrophages and integrated data with CAD GWAS to identify candidate variants. Results provide detailed map epigen changes from macro exposure to LD and basis for study approaches to ameliorate foam formation.

**Title:** Evaluation of a Single Round of Mass Azithromycin Treatment for Trachoma Elimination in Malawi Districts with Baseline Prevalence 5.0-9%

**Research Question:** Can a single round of azithromycin mass treatment with 80% coverage effectively reduce trach prevalence to <5% in Malawi districts with baseline prevalence 5.0-9%?

**Methods:** We conducted a population-based trach survey in 18 units of 8 Malawi districts 6 months after a single round of azithycin mass treatment, administered by the Malawi Ministry of Health to a total population of 3,632,175. The survey used the standardized package and methodologies of Tropical Data, conforming to WHO recommendations.

**Findings:** All 18 evaluation units had trach prevalence <5.0%, indicating a significant reduction from baseline prevalence 5.0-9%.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates that in Malawi districts with trach prevalence 5.0-9%, a single round of azithycin mass treatment with 80% coverage can effectively reduce trach to <5%. This approach may be a practical alternative to segmenting and re-surveying districts, given the large number of endemic districts and human resources required.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that a single round of well-conducted, high-coverage azithycin mass treatment can be sufficient to eliminate trach in Malawi districts hypoendemic at baseline. In the absence of a control group, we cannot attribute the observed reductions to MDA, but from a public health perspective, this suggests Malawi may eliminate trach as a public problem by 2020.

**Title:** Deciphering the Signaling Mechanisms of Nucleotide-binding Leuc-rich (N) Protein-Mediated Immune Responses in Plants and Humans

**Research Question:** How do nucleotide-binding leuc-rich (N) protein complexes trigger robust immune responses in plants and humans, and what are the underlying signaling mechanisms involved?

**Methods:** We employed functional genomic and biochemical screens to investigate the role of Arabidopsis thalian Ca2+-dependent kinases (CPs) in mediating bifurcate immune responses activated by NLR proteins, R2 and RPM. We analyzed the dynamics of CP1/2 activation by pathogen effectors and the onset of cell death, as well as the phosphorylation of specific WRKY transcription factors by CP4/5/6/11 and plasma-resident NAD oxidases by CP1/2/4/11.

**Findings:** We identified six closely related Arabidopsis Ca+-dependent kinases (CPs) mediating bifur immune responses activated by NLR, R2 and RPM. The dynamics of CP1/2 activation by pathogen effect controls the onset of cell death, while sustained CP4/5/6/11 activation phosphorylates specific WR transcription factors WRKY/28/48, synergistically regulating transcriptional reprogramming for N-dependent pathogen restriction. CP1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma-resident NAD oxidases for ROS production.

**Implications:** Our study delineates bifcation of complex mechanisms downstream NLR immune mediated by CPs with distinct specificity and subcellular dynamics. We provide genetic evidence that Ca2 signaling via CPs plays pivotal roles in diverse signaling and pathogen resistance by distinct intracellular NLR sensors.

**Conclusions:** Nucleotide leuc-rich (N) protein complexes are intracellular sensors recognizing pathogen-encoded effectors to initiate immune responses, including sustained cytosolic Ca+ concentration, transcriptional reprogramming, and ROS production. Our study highlights the pivotal role of CPs in mediating bifur immune responses, with distinct specificity and subcell dynamics, and provides new insights into the intricate mechanisms of plant innate immunity.

**Key findings:**

* CP1/2 activation by path effectors controls onset of cell death
* CP4/5/6/11 phosphorylates WRKY/28/48 for transcriptional reprogramming
* CP1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma-res NAD oxidases for ROS production
* Ca2 signaling via CPs plays pivotal roles in diverse signaling and pathogen mediated by intracellular NLR sensors

**Future directions:**

* Investigate the role of CPs in other plant-pathogen interactions
* Elucidate the mechanisms of WRKY transcription factors in NLR signaling
* Explore the role of ROS in plant-pathogen interactions

This abstract provides a clear and concise overview of the research question, methods, findings, implications, and conclusions of the study on nucleotide leuc-rich (N) protein and their role in triggering immune responses in plants and humans.

**Title:** Parsimonious Forecasting of Schistosoma haematob Time-Series in the District of Nion, Mali: A Retrospective Analysis (1996-2004)

**Research Question:** Can parsimon forecasting methods, encapsulated within a state-space framework, accurately predict the spatial and temporal distribution of Schistosoma haematium-induced hematuria in the district of Nion, Mali, and capture non-linear interactions between disease dynamics and exogenous covariates?

**Methods:** This longitudinal retrospective study (1996-2004) employed general exponential smoothing methods to generate contemporaneous on-line forecasts of Schos haematium time-series in the district N, Mali. The state-space framework accommodated seasonal and interannual time-series fluctuations.

**Findings:** The exponential state-space framework produced reasonably accurate 1-5 month forecasts with mean absolute percentage errors of 25%. The model captured non-linear interactions between disease dynamics and exogenous covariates (climate, irrigation, and health interventions), obviating the need for complex methods.

**Implications:** This framework can assist in managing and assessing S haematium transmission and intervention impact in the district, and potentially elsewhere in the Sahel. Parsimon forecasting and early warning systems can enhance management of parasitic diseases in developing countries.

**Conclusions:** This study addresses the paucity of Schos haemat time-series forecasts in Sahelian locations, such as Mali, where neglected diseases deteriorate public health. Schos sp impose an enormous burden on developing countries, and control is paramount to improve public health. Programs can benefit from parsimon forecasting and early systems to manage and mitigate parasitic infections.

**Title:** Coordinated Regulation of Host Cell Cycle by Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) Tegument Proteins to Ensure Productive Infection

**Research Question:** How do the tegument proteins pp150 and p21 of Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) regulate the host cell cycle to facilitate productive infection?

**Methods:** We generated a cyclin-binding deficient pp150 mutant virus and a double mutant where both pp150 and p21 are disabled in cyclin interaction to investigate the physiological relevance of these mechanisms during productive CMV infection.

**Findings:** Unrestricted viral expression in S2/G phase induced G2 arrest, but not mitotic cells supported viral replication. Cyclin destabilization by viral product p21 was required to maintain permissive G2 arrest. A double mutant where both pp and p21 are disabled in cyclin interaction forced mitotic entry of majority infected cells, severely impacting cell viability and virus growth.

**Implications:** pp and p21 functionally cooperate to build a cell cycle strategy of cyclin targeting and avoidance essential for productive CMV infection.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that the mechanisms of pp-cyclin-dependent restriction of gene expression G0/G and p21-cyclin-dependent cell block cooperate to protect CM from entry into mitosis. The pp-mediated restriction of viral expression in G phase has a genuine function in replication of CM, not merely an inevitable by-product of silencing quiescent infection. In proliferating cells, this mechanism restricts onset of replication to G phase where cyclin expression is low or absent. S2 cells do not abrogate but delay infection as pp-repression is relieved once cells lose cyclin protein after division. The pp-dependent restriction in cyclin-negative cells is crucial for significant delay of virus expression and replication after infection of proliferating cells.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Underpinnings of Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) through Targeted Sequencing of Candidate Genes

**Background:** Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons, ultimately leading to paralysis and death. Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, while the remaining 90% are sporadic. Genetic studies in familial ALS have elucidated causative mutations, but 30% of familial and majority sporadic cases remain unknown.

**Research Question:** Can targeted sequencing of 169 candidate ALS genes in 242 sporadic cases and 129 controls identify novel variants linked to ALS?

**Methods:** We employed a candidate approach to discover mutations in biologically relevant genes in sporadic ALS cases, utilizing next-generation sequencing and rare variant analysis tools. We assessed newly identified variants' relevance through functional studies and bioinformatics.

**Findings:** We found significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases versus controls, indicating disease-associated mutations. Our results highlight the utility of next-generation sequencing combined with functional and rare variant analysis to elucidate sporadic disease etiology.

**Implications:** This study underscores the importance of targeted sequencing in sporadic ALS, which represents an underutilized resource for genetic information. Our findings suggest that novel or rare mutations in key genes contribute to sporadic ALS. The abundance and affordability of next-generation sequencing have launched a new era in disease study, but rigorous approaches are needed to distinguish disease-causing from benign variants.

**Conclusions:** Familial ALS appears more homogeneous than sporadic, with 20 genes explaining 60% cases. We identified novel variants in ALS and associated genes, but no association with previously identified SNPs in our population, except APO. Trio and RRM studies revealed new variants in genes. Approximately 40% of cases had potential ALS cause not identified with our sequencing set of candidate genes.

**Title:** Interleukin-6 (IL-6) Regulates CD4+ T Cell Memory Responses to Influenza Virus through Suppression of Virus-Specific Regulatory Tregs

**Research Question:** What is the role of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of T cell memory to respiratory viruses, particularly influenza?

**Methods:** We analyzed virus-specific T cell activity in wild-type (WT) and IL-6 deficient (IL-/-) mice after infection with influenza virus.

**Findings:** Our studies reveal a novel role for IL-6 in the development of CD4 T memory to influenza virus. Specifically, we find that CD+ but not CD+ T memory is critically dependent on IL-6. This effect of IL-6 includes its ability to suppress CD+CD+ regulatory cells (Tregs). We demonstrate that influenza-induced IL- limits the activity of virus-specific Tregs, thereby facilitating the activity of virus-specific CD+ cells.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight a critical role for IL- in ensuring that, within the timeframe of an acute infection with cyathic virus, antigen Tregs have no opportunity to down-modulate the immune response, favoring pathogen clearance and survival of the host.

**Conclusions:** IL-6 is a selective regulator of long-term CD+ T responses through its capacity to limit the activity of virus-specific Tregs. The effect of IL- on CD+ and CD T cells cannot be attributed to a difference in classical IL- signaling. IL- has been shown to abrogate suppression by Tregs and suppress T development by Tβ. We postulated that influenza-virus Treg activity would be more readily detectable in IL-/- than WT mice, and these cells would suppress the activity of virus-specific T cells. Our data support this view, showing that CD+CD+regs from IL-/- but not WT mice suppress proliferation of influenza-specific CD+ cells. This is consistent with our observation that memory but not responses are impaired in influenza-infected IL-/- mice and supports the view that IL has an inhibitory effect on the activity of virus-specific Tregs.

**Title:** Enolase, a Glycolytic Enzyme, Functions as a Novel Dn2 Methyltransferase Inhibitor in Entamoeba histolytica

**Research Question:** What is the role of enol, a glycolytic enzyme, in the regulation of Dn2 methyltransferase activity in Entamoeba histolytica?

**Methods:** Yeast two-hybrid screening was used to identify enol as a D2-binding protein. Subcellular localization of enol was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Enol's inhibitory activity on D2 was tested in vitro and in vivo. The effect of glucose starvation on enol localization and D2 activity was investigated.

**Findings:** Enol, a glycol enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-P) to phosphoenpyruvate (P), was found to have both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in Enteba histolytica. Unexpectedly, enol acts as a D2 inhibitor. This inhibitory activity was antagonized by 2-P, suggesting that glucose controls nonlytic function of enol. Glucose starvation drives enol to accumulate in the nucleus, leading to the formation of enol-E histtica DN2 homolog (Ehm) complex and reduction of tRNA methylation. The role of en as D inhibitor was demonstrated in E histtica expressing nuclear localization (LS)-enolase.

**Implications:** This study establishes enol as the first D-interacting protein, highlighting an unexpected role of glyytic enzyme in modulation of D activity. Our results provide in vivo and vitro evidence that enol is a D-interacting protein and link glucose metabolism to D activity. Moreover, we show that D is a tRNAtransferase in eukaryotes. The significance of en-D interaction in eukotes requires further investigation.

**Conclusions:** Enol, a glycol enzyme, is the first D-interacting protein described. Our results provide strong evidence that glucose and D activity are linked. We also show that E can catalyze tRNA methylation and that en, in addition to glycol pathway, is a D inhibitor. Sequence homology between D and enase families suggests conserved interaction outside Enteba genus. We demonstrate that Drosila and human D proteins bind enase in vitro, suggesting conserved interaction.

**Title:** Identification of Exogenous MicroRNAs in Mosquito Saliva and their Role in Chikunya Virus Infection

**Research Question:** What are the microRNAs present in mosquito saliva and do they play a role in Chikunya virus (CHV) infection?

**Methods:** Next-generation sequencing was used to identify exogenous microRNAs in the saliva of Aedes aegypti and Ae albopictus mosquitoes, which revealed 103 microRNAs, 31 of which were novel. Five microRN were tested for their potential to regulate CHV infection, demonstrating their functional role in transmission and establishment during blood feeding on the host.

**Findings:** Inhibiting microRN decreased viral replication, suggesting that the presence of these microRN and upregulation of micro in mosquito saliva likely enhances CHV replication and dissemination in the host at the site of infection.

**Implications:** This study is the first report of exogenous microRN in mosquito saliva and identifies microRN expressed only in CHV-infected mosquitoes. micro levels were also manipulated in Anopheles and Aegypt infected with Plasmod and Aeegypt infected Dengue. microRN have been detected in mosquito cell lines, but not in saliva.

**Conclusions:** We discovered microRN in mosquito saliva and identified micro that are expressed upon CHV infection. This study provides evidence for the presence of mature micro in Aedes spp. mosquitoes, Aeegi and Aeop, and investigates the effect of CHV on micro expression profiles. A total microRN were found in Aeeg and Aeop saliva, 72 aligned with known micro and 31 novel. micro were designated Aeeg and Aeop. micro. These data support the presence of insect micro in Aeeg and Aeop saliva. After aligning Aeeg sequencing to Aeeg micro database, 72 known micro were identified in uninf and CHVeg saliva.

**Key Findings:**

* 103 microRN were identified in Aeeg and Aeop saliva
* 72 micro aligned with known micro and 31 were novel
* micro were designated Aeeg and Aeop
* micro were expressed only in CHVeg mosquitoes
* inhibiting micro decreased viral replication
* upregulation micro in mosquito likely enhances CHV replication

**Implications:**

* This study is the first report of exogenous micro in mosquito saliva
* provides evidence for presence of micro in Ae spp. mosquitoes
* investigates effect of CHV on micro profiles
* demonstrates functional role of micro in transmission and establishment of infection during feeding on host

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Nuclear-Encoded Double-Strand Break Repair Proteins in Mitochondrial DNA Repair

**Research Question:** How do the nuclear-encoded double-strand break (DS) repair proteins Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 contribute to the maintenance and repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae?

**Methods:** We employed a mitochondally-targeted restriction endonuclease (mt-KI) to introduce a unique double-strand break (DSB) in the mitochondrial genome of Sacomyces cerevisiae, allowing for direct analysis of DSB repair in vivo. We also investigated the localization of Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 to the mitochondria and their interaction with mtDNA.

**Findings:** We found that Rad51 and Rad59 are localized to the matrix of mitochondria, with Rad51 binding directly to mitochondrial DNA. Loss of these proteins significantly decreased the rate of spontaneous deletions and impaired the repair of induced mtDNA DSBs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 impact the rate of spontaneous DNA deletions and repair of induced DSBs in yeast.

**Implications:** This study is the first to demonstrate the role of Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 in mtDNA repair. Our findings suggest that these proteins play a crucial role in maintaining mtDNA integrity, particularly in the repair of double-strand breaks. The localization of Rad51 and Rad to the mitochondria indicates a direct interaction with mtDNA, highlighting the importance of nuclear-encoded proteins in mtDNA repair.

**Conclusions:** This study improves our understanding of mtDNA repair mechanisms, specifically the role of double-strand break repair proteins in mtDNA. Identification of mitochondrial factors interacting with Rad51, Rad, and Rad59 will elucidate specific repair pathways and components. Further investigation of mtDNA repair is essential for understanding metabolic control and cell maintenance, particularly in diseases associated with deletions and disorders.

**Title:** Social Determinants of Group A Streptocococcal Infection, Acute Rheumatic Fever, and Rheumatic Heart Disease: A Systematic Review of Observational and Experimental Studies

**Research Question:** This systematic review aimed to investigate the association between social and environmental determinants of Group A Streptocococcal (GAS) infection, Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF), and Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and the effect of interventions targeting these factors.

**Methods:** A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases from August to October 2016. Observational and experimental studies measuring crowding, dwelling characteristics, education, employment, income, socioeconomic status, and nutrition in relation to GAS, AR, or RHD were included. Findings were assessed against the Bradford criteria for evidence of causation. Study quality was evaluated using a standardized tool.

**Findings:** 1,164 publications were identified, 90 met inclusion criteria, comprising 91 studies. 50.5% were of poor quality in relation to the question. The proportion of studies reporting associations between socioeconomic determinants and risk of GAS was 57.1%, and AR/RHD was 50%. Crowding was most assessed (14 studies GAS, 36 AR/RHD) followed by socioeconomic status (6, 36). Most studies assessing crow, dwelling, characteristics, education, and employment of parents, and nutrition reported a positive association with risk of GAS, AR/RHD. Crow and socioeconomic satisfied the criteria of association.

**Implications:** Crow as a cause of GAS and AR/RHD presents a practical target for prevention. The literature on social determinants of GAS, AR, and RHD lacks quality, mostly observational, not interventional. This review is the most extensive to date targeting observational and experimental studies in the area of social determinants of health and GAS, AR, RHD.

**Title:** Unveiling the Versatility of Two-Component Signaling Networks: A Single Mutation-Induced Bistability in the Pho/Pho System of E. coli

**Research Question:** How can a single mutation in a protein within a complex network lead to dramatic changes in phenotypes that are not intrinsic to the protein itself, and what are the architectural features of the network that enable such versatility?

**Methods:** We investigated the Pho/Pho signaling system, a well-studied two-component system in E. coli, and found that a single mutation abolishing the phosphatase activity of the kinase PhQ results in a striking change in phenotype. The mutant responds to stimulus in a bistable manner, as opposed to the wild-type, which has a graded response. We used mathematical modeling and experiments to suggest that bistability depends on autoregulation of the key proteins in the circuit, PhP and PhQ.

**Findings:** The phosphatase-deficient PhQ protein exhibits bistability and ON state with pleotropic alterations in cell physiology. Mutant cells have distinct morphologies and state is inherited over many generations. External conditions that repress signaling in wild-type drive mutant to ON state. Mathematical modeling revealed that bistability depends on autoregulation of PhP and PhQ. The ON state has lower fitness than OFF in stationary cultures in rich medium, but due to inheritance, a population can be epigenetically trapped in low-fitness.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate the versatility of the prototypical two-component architecture and highlight tradeoffs in the Pho/Pho system. A single mutation in histidine PhQ produces striking change in circuit properties. Analysis showed that high kinase rates, phosphase-deficient would be constitutively ON and network monostable, but low rates exhibit bistability (OFF and ON). The T281 substitution in PhQ results in bistability persisting morphologically distinct OFF and ON for generations. Architectural features shared among two-component systems enable bistability.

**Conclusions:** The Pho/Pho system is a remarkable example of how a single mutation can cause marked change in a protein's properties. Network architectures enable dramatic changes from few mutations remain uncharacterized. Our study highlights the tradeoffs in the case of Pho/Ph system, where bistability comes at a fitness cost. The phosphase-deficient mutant is not constitutively ON due to autoregulation of PhP and PhQ. This study demonstrates the challenge to identify aspects of architectures that promote versatility and novel properties emerge from few components.

**Title:** Repurposing Anti-fungal Drugs for the Treatment of Amebic Meningoencephalitis (P) Caused by Naegleria fleri: Targeting the Sterol Biosynthesis Pathway

**Research Question:** Can anti-fungal drugs, specifically targeting the sterol biosynthesis pathway, be repurposed for the treatment of Amoebic Meningocephalitis (AM) caused by Naegleria fleri, a free-living amoeba that infects humans?

**Methods:** We systematically assessed the impact of anti-fungal azole drugs, conazoles, on sterol biosynthesis and viability of cultured N. fleri trophotes, identified the endogenous CYP51 substrate by mass spectrometry of N. fleri lipids, and analyzed interactions between recombinant C51 and conoles by UV-vis spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography.

**Findings:** Our studies validated C51 as a potentially druggable target in N. fleri and conazole drugs as candidates for assessment in an animal model of AM. Fluconazole and micon have been used in combination with other drugs as part of treatment regimens in human AM patients. Disruption of ster biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors is a validated strategy against fungal pathogens of medical and agricultural importance.

**Implications:** The similarity of targets raises the possibility of repur anti-myc drugs clinically-approved against a variety fungal diseases and optimization az-based AM therapy for treatment of AM.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest that targeting the ster biosynthesis pathway is a viable strategy for the treatment of AM caused by N. fleri, a devastating infection with high mortality and lack of established treatment options. Repurposing anti-fungal drugs, such as conoles, may provide a cost-effective solution for the development of anti-AM drugs. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of conazole-based therapy in animal models of AM.

**Title:** Sustained IL-4α Signaling is Required for Maintenance of Type 2 Immune Responses and Protective Immunity against Nematodes

**Research Question:** What is the role of Interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4α) in maintaining type 2 immune responses and protective immunity against parasitic nematodes?

**Methods:** To investigate the function of IL-4α in maintaining type 2 immune responses, we used a recently established Cre-ERT2/IL-4αLox mice model, where IL-4α gene deletion can be temporally controlled. Mice were infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a primary nematode parasite.

**Findings:** Sustained expression of IL-4α is required for the maintenance of type 2 immune responses and protective immunity following N. brasiliensis infection. Temporal deletion of IL-4α prior to secondary infection with N. brasiliensis showed that signaling via this receptor drives efficient recall of type 2 immune responses and clearance of parasites.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates that sustained IL-4α mediated signaling is required for maintenance of anti-nemat type 2 immune responses, describing a novel function IL-4α distinct from its role in immune polarization.

**Conclusions:** IL-α plays a critical role not only in initiating but also maintaining type 2 immune responses against parasitic nemodes. Disruption of IL-α signaling impairs established Th2 responses during primary and secondary infections with N. brasiliensis, limiting host ability to expel worms. Sustained IL-α expression is required for optimal type 2 responses and recall of host memory. Abrogation ILα signaling prior secondary N. brasensis leads to diminished Th2 responses and reduced ability to clear infection.

**Title:** Investigating the Evolutionary History and Host Switching Patterns of Bartonella Bacteria: Implications for Zoonotic Transmission and Public Health

**Research Question:** How has the Bartonella genus evolved and switched hosts in the past, and what are the current patterns of transmission and potential mechanisms for cross-species transmission?

**Methods:** We analyzed the largest collection of Bartonella glA genotypes, including 67 new genotypes, using 16S rRNA and citrate synthase (glA) genes to determine the evolutionary history of Bartonella, patterns of host switching, and geographic spillover into humans from commensals to wild species.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that Bartonella likely originated as an environmental bacterium and commensal before infecting mammals, with rodents and domestic animals serving as reservoirs or key hosts for most Barton genotypes in humans. We found evidence of exchange between phylogenetically distant domestic and wild animals, likely due to increased contact, highlighting the need to avoid contact between humans, animals, and wildlife to protect health.

**Implications:** Bartonella is a rich system for examining the impacts of humans on infectious disease spread within and between species, across landscapes, and the globe. Phylogenetic inferences should be interpreted with caution, as they are influenced by available data and taxa sampled. Missing links may exist between inferred hosts not sampled. This pathogen is ideal for tracing zoonotic potential and impacts on native hosts. Our study constructs one of the largest phylogen to date of Barton from 16S rRNA and citrate synth (A to determine evolutionary history Barton, patterns host switching, and spillo into humans from commals to wild.

**Conclusions:** At least host specificity of Bartonella is due to ecological factors rather than immunological incompatibility. Given diversity of zoon strains, including divergent with clinical presentations, physicians should consider broad animal hosts and Barton genotypes when investigating source suspected Barton infection. Particular mammalian species associated with humans, such as dogs, cats, cows, and rats, have brought strains globally. Rats, in genus Ratt, common in largest clade globally rodent Barton (clade B. queensensis, B. elizabeth, B. triborum, B. massensis, B. rattassiliensis, B. inf).

**Title:** Mechanistic Insights into the Role of MALAT1 in Regulating Cellular Proliferation: A Genome-wide Transcriptome Analysis Reveals MAL1 Modulation of Cell Cycle Genes and Requirement for G1 and Mitotic Progression

**Research Question:** The long non-coding RNA MAL1 (MAL1) is upregulated in cancer tissues and its elevated expression is associated with hyperproliferation, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood.

**Methods:** Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in human diploid fibroblasts revealed that MAL1 modulates the expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1 and mitotic progression. Depletion of MAL1 leads to activation of p53 and its target genes. Cell defects in MAL1-depleted cells are sensitive to p levels, indicating p53 is a major mediator of MAL1 activity.

**Findings:** MAL1-depleted cells display reduced expression of MYB, an oncogenic factor involved in G/M progression due to altered splicing of MY preRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. MAL1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating expression and preRNA of cycle-regulated transcription factors.

**Implications:** These findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of MAL1 in regulating proliferation and suggest that abnormal expression of MAL1 in specific types or tissues results in aberrant splicing leading to misexpression of genes involved in cycle and cell death, contributing to tumor progression.

**Conclusions:** We propose that MAL1 influences expression of key cycle regulators (activator or repressor), resulting in alteration of transcription of downstream cycle genes. Consistently, alternative splicing changes for such as MY were observed in MAL1-depleted cells. Unlike MAL1-depleted, p53 or p+MAL1-depleted cells responded to serum by expression of genes in cycle. Results indicate p is vital for G or arrest in MAL1-depleted cells.

In this study, we investigated the role of MAL1 in regulating cellular proliferation using genome-wide transcriptome analysis in human diploid fibroblasts. We found that MAL1 modulates the expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G and mitotic progression. Depletion of MAL1 leads to activation of p53 and its target genes. Cell defects in MAL-depleted cells are sensitive to p levels, indicating p is a major mediator of MAL activity. MAL-depleted cells display reduced expression of MY, an oncogenic factor in G progression due to altered splicing of MY preRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. MAL promotes cellular proliferation by modulating expression and preRNA of cycle-regulated transcription factors. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of MAL in regulating proliferation and suggest that abnormal expression of MAL in specific or tissues results in aberrant splicing leading to misexpression of genes in cycle and cell, contributing to tumor progression.

**Title:** Juvenile Hormone Regulates DNA Replication and Ploidy in Vitelogenesis through Mc4 and Mc7 Genes in the Migratory Locust

**Research Question:** How does juvenile hormone (JH) regulate DNA replication and ploidy in vitelogenesis in the migratory locust, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying this process?

**Methods:** We used RNA interference (RNAi) to phenocopy a J-deprived condition in migratory locusts and demonstrated that J stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitelogenesis. We identified two genes, Mc4 and Mc7, in the DNA replication pathway that were expressed in the presence of J. Depletion of Mc or Mc7 inhibited de novo synthesis and ploidy, and resulted in substantial reduction of vitelogenin mRNA and impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. We used luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility assays to show that Met directly regulates Mc and Mc7 by binding to upstream sequences with E-box or E-like motifs.

**Findings:** Our results suggest that the J-receptor complex acts on Mc and Mc7 to regulate replication and ploidy for vitelogenesis and oocyte maturation in migratory locust.

**Implications:** This study provides new insights into the molecular basis of J action in promoting vitogenesis, a critical for reproduction in migratory locust. Our findings highlight the importance of Mc and Mc genes in J-dependent vitogenesis, and suggest that J acts on these genes to facilitate replication and ploidy of the fat body genome for V expression required oocyte maturation.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that J regulates DNA replication and ploidy in vitel in migratory locust through Mc and Mc genes, providing a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Our results have implications for understanding the role of J in reproduction and development in insects, and highlight the importance of Mc and Mc in J-dependent vitogenesis.

**Title:** Optimal Duration of Prednisone Treatment for Neuropathy in Lepros: A Randomized Controlled Trial

**Research Question:** What is the optimal duration of prednisone treatment for improving and restoring nerve function in lepro patients with recent neuropathy (NFI)?

**Methods:** In a multicenter, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, 868 lepro patients with recent NFI (<6 months) were allocated to either a 20-week or 32-week prednisone treatment regimen. Prednisone was started at 45-60mg/day, depending on body weight, and tapered throughout follow-up. NFI was assessed by muscle testing and monofilament testing. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored function at 78 weeks. Secondary outcomes included Reaction Scale, SAL Scale, Participation Scale, and Serious Adverse Events.

**Findings:** At 78 weeks, the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function did not differ between groups (78.1% in 20-arm and 77.5 in 32-arm, p=0.821). Secondary outcomes showed no differences, except a higher Serious Adverse Events in the longer arm.

**Implications:** A 20-week prednisone course is as effective as 32 in improving and restoring recent NFI in lepro patients. Twenty weeks is the preferred initial treatment duration for lepro neuropathy, with only a minority requiring individualized treatment.

**Conclusion:** This study provides evidence for the optimal duration of prednisone treatment for lepro patients with recent neuropathy. A 20-week course is sufficient for most patients, but around 15% require individualized treatment due to reactions or deteriorating N.

**Title:** Anatomical and Physiological Basis of Vocalization in Cervids: A Comparative Study of Low-Frequency and High-Frequency Calls in European Red Deer and Rocky Mountain Elk

**Research Question:** What are the anatomical and physiological mechanisms underlying the production of low-frequency and high-frequency vocalizations in European Red Deer (Cervus elus scus) and Rocky Mountain Elk (Cerv elus nelsoni) during mating season, and how do these relate to signal characteristics of the sender?

**Methods:** We employed a finite element model of the larynx and wave model of vocal tract, based on the morphology and biomechanics of elk, to simulate sound production of low and high-frequency calls. The model produced a wide range of fundamental frequencies, with low frequencies requiring low vocal fold strain, large lung pressure, and glottal flow, while high-frequency calls requiring large muscular effort, lung pressure, and phonation threshold.

**Findings:** Low-frequency calls (Red Deer) relate to body size, with a strong relationship between acoustic parameters and size of vocal organs and body, while high-frequency (elk bugle) signal muscular strength and endurance, via 'vocalizing the edge' mechanism, critical for efficiency. Glottal efficiency, ratio of radiated power to aerodynamic at glott, is higher in elk, suggesting an advantage of high-pitched signaling. This is due to lower airflow required aerodynamic power and acoustic radiation at higher frequencies. Both types are used by males during mating and serve as honest signals, relating to physical qualities of sender.

**Implications:** The trade-off between high sound production and larynge stress seems to work for elk, with glott efficiency increasing with frequency in Cerv lnx, providing advantage for high vocalizations. Future studies should determine whether elk auditory system is suited for high pitch or low sounds. Contrary to expectation, large mammals use high-pitched display. The dichotomy between frequency and high calls for signaling male characteristics is dramatic in closely related cervid species.

**Conclusions:** This study provides insight into the anatomical and physiological basis of vocalization in cervids, highlighting differences between low and high-frequency calls in European Deer and Rocky Elk. The findings suggest that high-pitched calls provide an advantage, likely due to lower aerodynamic power and acoustic radiation at higher frequencies, while low calls relate to body size. These results have implications for understanding signal evolution and function of vocalizations in mammals.

**Title:** Enhancing Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Followed by High-Throughput Sequencing (ChIPq) Analysis with Multi-Reads: A Novel Approach for Mapping Transcription Factor Binding Sites and Chromatin Modifications

**Research Question:** Can incorporating multi-reads into chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (Ch-seq) analysis improve the detection of transcription factor binding sites and chromatin modifications, particularly in highly repetitive regions of the genome?

**Methods:** We developed a weighted alignment scheme to allocate multi-reads, which map to multiple locations on the reference genome, as fractional counts. We applied this approach to human STAT1 and GATA1 IP-seq datasets and compared the results to uni-read analysis. We also validated novel GATA1 multi-read peaks using quantitative real-time ChIP and identified novel target genes.

**Findings:** Incorporating multi-read increased sequencing depth by 22-25% and 17% in STAT1 and GATA ChIP input samples, respectively. Multi-read led to detection of novel peaks not identifiable by uni-read and improved peak detection in mappable regions. Genome-wide characteristics of multi-read peaks were similar to uni-read, except majority resided in segmental duplications.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate the importance of multi-read in studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions with Ch-se experiments. Discarding multi-read can lead to omission of up to 30% alignable reads, highlighting the need for incorporating multi-read in Ch-se analysis.

**Conclusions:** This study introduces a novel approach for utilizing multi-read in Ch-se analysis, enhancing detection of transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications. Multi-read improves sequencing depth and identifies novel peaks, particularly in highly repetitive regions of the genome. Validation of GATA multi-read peaks by real-time Ch and identification of novel GATA target genes supports the significance of multi-read in Ch-se. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering multi-read in Ch-se analysis, especially in regions with low mappability.

**Title:** Estimating the Economic Benefits of Achieving the 2020 WHO Targets for Neglected Tropical Diseases: A Systematic Review of Productivity Loss and Out-of-Pocket Payments

**Research Question:** What are the economic benefits of achieving the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) targets for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), specifically Chagas disease, human trypaniasis, lepro, and visceral leishias, in terms of productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments?

**Methods:** A systematic review of literature was conducted to identify information on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) related to these NTDs, which were combined with projections of the number of people suffering from each NTD by country and year (2011-2020 and 202-203). The ideal scenario in which the WHO 2020 targets are met was compared to a counterfactual scenario assuming the situation 1990 stayed unaltered. Economic benefits equaled the difference between the two scenarios. Probabil sensitivity analyses were used to quantify the degree of uncertainty around the base-case estimate.

**Findings:** The total productivity gained for the four IDMNTDs was $23.1 ($15.9-$34.0) billion in 201-202 and $35.9 ($25.0-$51.9) in 202-203 (2.5 and 97.5 percentiles brackets), corresponding to $10.7 ($7.4-$15.7) and $16.6 ($11.6-$24.0). Reductions in OPP was $14 ($6.7) and $18 ($10.4) for the same periods.

**Implications:** Based on conservative assumptions and uncertainty analyses, we estimate the benefits of achieving the targets are considerable. Under plausible scenarios, the benefits exceed the necessary investments by endemic governments and development partners. Given the frequency of NTD among the poorest households, these investments represent good value for money in effort to improve well-being, distribute world's prosperity equitably and reduce inequity.

**Conclusion:** This study estimated the economic benefits of achieving the 202 WHO targets for four IDM: Ch disease, human trypanias, lepro, and visceral leishias, estimating how much the loss by individuals faced due to productivity loss and out-pocket secondary these would be avoided by reaching targets. Disadv populations from low and middle countries have to deal with health and economic of NTD, which often their struggles to poverty aggravate.

**Title:** Reevaluating the Role of Neuronal Selectivity in Sensory Encoding: A Novel Insights from Auditory Cortex

**Research Question:** Does neuronal selectivity in the auditory cortex accurately reflect the amount of information conveyed about sensory inputs, or is there an alternative principle of encoding at play?

**Methods:** We investigated the relationship between neuronal selectivity and informativeness in the auditory cortex using electrophysiological recordings from anesthetized mice. We analyzed the responses of single neurons to a range of sounds during two epochs: onset (0-100ms) and sustained (100-500ms) after stimulus onset.

**Findings:** Contrary to prevailing theory, we found that the population of neurons conveyed similar information about sound inputs across epochs, despite differences in selectivity. The amount of information encoded was dependent on the total number of spikes in the read window, not selectivity. Homogeneous Poisson spiking behavior was sufficient to account for this property.

**Implications:** Our results suggest a novel principle of sensory encoding, potentially shared among multiple systems. This challenges current understanding of informativeness based on selectivity, highlighting the need for reevaluation of sensory processing in the brain.

**Conclusions:** Neuronal selectivity is not a reliable indicator of informativeness in the auditory cortex. Instead, the total number of spikes in a window determines the amount of information conveyed. This principle may be applicable to other sensory systems, suggesting a fundamental shift in our understanding of sensory processing.

**Title:** Critical Role of OX40 Co-stimulatory Molecule in Sustaining Anti-viral T Cell Responses during Persistent Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) Infection

**Research Question:** What is the role of OX co-stimulatory molecule in sustaining anti-viral T cell responses during persistent lymphocytic choriomening virus (LCMV) infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of OX coim molecule in the context of persistent LCMV clone 13 infection using OX-deficient mice and wild-type mice.

**Findings:** Our results show that OX-deficient mice fail to control LCMV clone infection over time, highlighting the importance of this signaling pathway during persistent infection. Anti-viral cells express high levels of O40 in the presence of cognate antigen, while cells lacking O40 receptor fail to accumulate. Moreover, emergence of T-dependent germinal responses and LCM-specific antibodies are severely impaired.

**Implications:** Our findings establish O40 as a key factor in sustaining cellular and humoral immunity during viral persistence, with implications for the study of T cell dysfunction in persistent infections in humans.

**Conclusions:** O40 plays a critical role in promoting long-term survival of T cells, and its relevance is more prominent in the context of viral persistence. In contrast to acute LCM infection, O40 shapes both CD4 and CD8 T responses during persistent LCMV13 infection, including T-dependent responses. O40-deficiency profoundly impacts anti-viral response during persistent LCM13 infection, highlighting the importance of this pathway during ongoing viral replication.

**Title:** Convergent Evolution of Optimal Swimming Patterns in Aquatic Animals: Elongated Fins Across Vertebrates and Invertebrates

**Research Question:** Why do aquatic animals from different phyla, including vertebrates and invertebrates, independently evolve similar elongated fins for optimal swimming, despite the absence of this trait in their common ancestor?

**Methods:** We analyzed the length of undulation along an animal's fin during swimming and divided it by the mean amplitude of undulations along the fin, resulting in a consistent value of 20, which we call the Optimal Specific Wavelength (OS). We show that OS maximizes the force generated by the body and swimming speed.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that elongated fins have evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrates and invertebrates across three phyla. The OS is a mechanical basis for this optimality, suggesting repeated emergence through evolution. Unlike convergently evolved morphological features, the pattern of movement occurs across morphologically diverse appendages in aquatic animals. We hypothesize regulation of OS, axialation, and elongation in phyla reflect common genetic networks underlying convergent evolution.

**Implications:** This study unifies vast diversity of swimming organisms, from invertebrates (cuttlefish) to vertebrates (cartilaginous and bony fish), exposing links physical principles to biological phenomena, and understanding evolution convergence or divergence to same or wide solutions. Evidence supports convergent anatomical specializations in caud fin swimmers minimizing trunk movement, resulting in pure thrust. Thunniform swimmers (tuna and lam sharks) restrict caud fin, swimming faster than others.

**Conclusions:** Our research demonstrates convergent evolution of optimal swimming patterns in aquatic animals, elongated fins across vertebrates and invertebrates, despite absence trait in common ancestor. The OS maximizes force and speed, suggesting mechanical basis for optimality and repeated emergence. This phenomenon exposes links physical principles to biological, understanding evolution convergent or divergent solutions.

**Title:** Essential Roles of Condens I and II in Mammalian Neural Stem Cell Division and Cortical Development

**Research Question:** How do condens I and II, evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, contribute to the segregation of mitotic chromosomes in mammalian neural stem cells (NSCs) and cortical development?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive genetic study using conditional knockout (cKO) mice to investigate the roles of condens I and II in NSC divisions during cortical development. We generated strains of cKO mice to deplete condens I and II individually and simultaneously, and analyzed the effects on chromosome assembly, segregation, DNA damage, and cell fate.

**Findings:** Simultaneous depletion of condens I and II caused severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, leading to DNA damage and p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condens I and II resulted in slower loss of NSCs, with distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation in condin II-depleted NSCs and mitotic delays in condin I-depleted NS. Notably, NS depleted of condin II displayed hyperclustering of perentric heterochatin and nucleoli, indicating condin II's role in establishing interphase architecture. These defects persisted in postmitotic neurons.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that condens I and II have overlapping and non-overlapping functions in NSCs, providing insight into the intricate balance of the two condin complexes. Simultaneous depletion caused more severe defects than individual depletions, indicating shared functions. Anatomical analyses of Sm2 cKO mice showed severe chromosome and segregation defects. Unique cell division patterns in cortical development allowed us to follow fate of depleted condens in the brain.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first genetic study of condins in mammals, showing that both cond I and II are essential for embryonic and cortical development in mice. Anatomical and expression analyses indicate equal contributions to NS division and survival. Our findings contradict previous study using embryonic stem (ES) cells, which reported only overlapping functions in survival. We propose that cellular responses to condens depletion differ among cell types or lines.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Sex Determination and Differentiation in the Hermaphroditic Trematode Schistosome, Schistosoma mansoni

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying sex determination and differentiation in the hermaphroditic tremode Schistome, Schistoma mansoni, and how do they interact with the vertebrate host?

**Methods:** To investigate the transcriptome of S. mansoni in a stage and sex-comparative manner, we performed RNA-seq on males and females at five developmental stages: cercaria, three in vivo schosulum stages, and adults. We detected 7,168 differentially expressed genes between sexes at least one developmental stage, 4,065 of which were functionally annotated. Transcript data were complemented with H3K27me histone modification using ChIP-Seq before (cercaria) and after (adults) phenotypic sexual dimorphism.

**Findings:** Our results show that sexual differentiation in S. mans is accompanied by distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes of host-paras cstalk, genetic determinants, and epigen regulators. We identified candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-based players of interaction with vertebrate host, and dynamic H3me histone mark between sexes as illustration sex-based epigenetic landscapes.

**Implications:** This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation in S. mans, a pathogenic for humans. Our findings suggest that combination of sex-based players and epigenetic regulators could lead to optimized dimorphism of this parasitic species. This study represents a promising source of therapeutic targets, not only on parasite development interaction with vertebrate, but also reproductive function.

**Conclusions:** Our transcriptome analysis of S. mans in stage and sex-compar manner reveals candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-based players interaction with vertebrate host, and dynamic H3me histone mark between sexes as illustration sex-based epigen landscapes. Our results suggest that combination of sex-based players and epigen regulators could lead to optimized dimorphism of parasitic species. This study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation in S mans, a pathogenic for humans.

**Title:** Quantifying Annotation Certainty in Large-Scale Annotation Efforts: A Probabilistic Modeling and Experimental Approach

**Research Question:** How can we quantify the certainty of individual annotations in large-scale annotation efforts involving multiple experts who may disagree with each other?

**Methods:** We propose a probabilistic approach that assigns a confidence value (posterior probability of correctness) to each annotation. We developed two models to estimate annotator-specific parameters from data and compared them using computer simulations. We tested each model's performance on a large dataset generated by human annotators for this study.

**Findings:** Even in the worst-case scenario where all annotators disagree, our approach significantly increases the probability of choosing the correct annotation. We created a corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated by 8 experts and a 1,000-sentence subset by 5 new annotators.

**Implications:** Our approach is generalizable to most annotation studies and can benefit from our methodology. We suggest a consistent design for experiments and data analysis.

**Conclusion:** This study addresses the question of quantifying certainty in individual annotations for a group of annotators, retaining the dataset for training and testing machine learning methods. Our models are based on the corpus, validated by a second annotation cycle with 5 new annotators on a 1,000-sentence subset. We distinguish knowledge from conclusions, certainty, evidence from speculations, and methodological statements, generating a corpus for training computers to perform tasks at scale.

**Key contributions:**

1.  We propose a probabilistic approach to quantify certainty in annotations.
2. Developed two models to estimate annotator parameters from data.
3. Tested models using simulations and a large dataset.
4. Created a corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated by 8 experts and 1,000 by 5 annotators.
5. Suggest a consistent design for experiments and data analysis.

**Future work:**

1. Apply our approach to other annotation tasks.
2. Estimate error rates for specific tasks and annotators.
3. Assign confidence to single annotators with known rates.

**Abstract:**

Large-scale annotation efforts involve multiple experts who may disagree. We propose a probabilistic approach to quantify certainty in individual annotations. Our models estimate annotator parameters from data and tested using simulations. We created a corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated by 8 and 1,000 by 5 annotators. Our approach increases the probability of correct annotation even in the worst-case scenario. We suggest a consistent design for experiments and analysis. This study addresses quantifying certainty in annotations for a group, retaining the dataset for training and testing. Our models are based on the corpus, validated by a second annotation with 5 annotators on 1,000 sentences. We distinguish knowledge from conclusions, certainty, evidence, and methodological statements, generating a corpus for computers to perform tasks at scale.

**Title:** Development of a Novel Antiviral Biologic for Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) using a DNA Vaccine-Produced Goose Antibodies

**Research Question:** Can DNA technology be used to produce antiv biologics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies, for the treatment of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a lethal disease caused by Andes virus (AND) and AND-like viruses in South America?

**Methods:** We vaccinated geese with an AND DNA vaccine encoding the envelope glycoproteins of ANDV, resulting in high-tier neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination and maintained over 1 year. A booster vaccination led to extraordinarily high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Analysis of Ig and IgΔ by epitope mapping showed these antibodies to be highly reactive to specific amino sequences of ANDV glycoprote. We examined the protective efficacy of goose-derived antibodies in a hamster model of lethal HPS.

**Findings:** α-V immune sera or Ig/IgΔ purified from eggs protected 8/8 and 7/8 hamsters, respectively, while all hamsters receiving Ig/Ig from normal geese or no-treatment developed HPS. These findings demonstrate the DNA/goose platform can produce a candidate antiviral product capable of preventing lethal disease when administered post-exposure.

**Implications:** The availability of convalescent plasma from H survivors is limited, and mammalian antibodies have reactogenic in humans. Our study shows the potential of using DNA technology to produce antiv biologics, including polyclonal neutral antibodies, for HPS treatment.

**Conclusions:** The DNA/goose platform can be used to produce a candidate antiviral product capable of preventing lethal disease when administered post-exposure. This is a promising alternative to using human convales sera or mammalian antibodies as a source of neutral antibodies against AND, which are in short supply or have risks of reactogenicity in humans.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Dmta in Maintaining DNA Methylation Patterns in Cancer: A Whole-Genome Bisulf Sequencing Analysis of Dmta-Dependent Methylation Changes in a K-Ras-Induced Lung Cancer Model

**Research Question:** How does the Dmt enzyme contribute to the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns in cancer, and what are the consequences of its deficiency in a K-R-induced lung cancer model?

**Methods:** We employed whole-genome bisulf sequencing to comprehensively characterize the methylomes of Dmta wild-type and Dmt-deficient mouse tumors in a K-R-induced lung cancer model.

**Findings:** Our results reveal profound methylation changes in K-R-induced lung cancer, with Dmt wild-type tumors exhibiting large hypomethyl domains corresponding to lamina-associated regions and Dmt-deficient tumors showing uniformly hypethyl genome. Further analysis indicates Dmt is required for efficient methylation of active domains, with D-deficient tumors displaying moderate deregulation in these domains.

**Implications:** These findings uncover conserved features of cancer methylomes and define the role of Dmt in maintaining methylation in cancer, suggesting Dmt acts as a tumor suppressor by stabilizing methylation patterns.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of Dmt in maintaining methylation in cancer, with D-deficiency promoting tumor progression in a K-induced lung model. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing provides a powerful tool for characterizing methylation at single-base resolution, revealing Dmt-dependent changes in D-def tumors. These findings have implications for understanding cancer epigenetic alterations underlying tumor-promoting effects of Dmt mutations.

**Title:** Spatial and Temporal Organization of the Songbird Premotor Cortical Microcircuit: Unveiling the Mechanisms of Sequence Generation in Learned Behavior

**Research Question:** What is the spatial and temporal organization of the song premotor cortical microcircuit in birds, and how does it support the generation of neural sequences in learned behavior?

**Methods:** We employed multi-electrophysiology and calcium imaging techniques to investigate the premotor cortex of singing birds, revealing that neural activity is correlated at a scale of 100µm, with basalang-projecting excitatory neurons firing at a specific phase of a 30 Hz rhythm.

**Findings:** Our results show that premotor activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, and a mesoscopic dynamical pattern underlies the generation of neural sequences controlling song. Specifically, we found that the relationship between time and space in premotor area HVC is neither random nor globally organized as a traveling wave, but clustered on 100µ length, with a 30 rhythm revealed in LFP correlated with inhibition of at least one projection sub-type, HX, and coherent over length matching projection calcium activity.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that the premotor microcircuit is spatially organized, with excitatory and inhibitory neurons clustered, and two types, HX projection and interneurons, firing in alternating phases of local 30 rhythm. This implies a microcircuit where multiple pools of excitatory drive interne populations. The recurrence of these scales and rhythmic times across species and contexts raises the possibility that clustering and 30 rhythmic alternation of excitatory and inhibitory cells is a feature of cortical microcircuits for sequential behavior.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals the spatial and temporal organization of the song premotor microcircuit in birds, providing insights into the mechanisms of sequence generation in learned behavior. The results suggest that future models of motor sequence in HVC should consider the interplay of spatial patterns of excitation and inhibition, rather than only topology of excitatory cells. This work has implications for understanding the neural basis of song learning and behavior in birds, and potentially other vertebrates.

**Title:** Evolutionarily Conserved Mechanisms that Regulate Aging: Prereproductive Functions Subject to Natural Selection**

**Research Question:** Do genes essential for growth and development, conserved in evolution, play a role in longevity?

**Methods:** We screened 2,700 genes essential for Caenorhabditis elegans development and identified 64 that extend lifespan when inactivated post-developmentally. These candidate regulators are conserved from yeast to humans.

**Findings:** Classification of lifespan regulators into functional groups revealed insulin and metabolic pathways, but also enrichment for translation, RNA, and chromatin factors. Many essential inactivations extend lifespan as much as strongest regulators of aging. Early inactivations of these genes caused growth arrest at larval stages, and some arrested live longer than wild-type adults. d-16 is required for survival of arrested larvae, suggesting increased longevity a physiological response to inactivation.

**Implications:** Our results suggest insulin-signaling plays a role in regulation of aging at any stage in life.

**Conclusions:** The lifespan of an organism is regulated by genetic and environmental influences in species. Recent work identified components from cellular processes that regulate lifespan. C. elegans loss-function in insulin/insulin growth-1/daf-2 pathway doubles lifespan. Regulation by D-2 occurs during adulthood. C. elegans lifespan extended when fed RNA targeting insulin/d-2 at any larval stage through adulthood. Conditional d-2 alleles cause arrest if inactivated at L stage, longevity inactivated in adults. Null d-2 alleles lethal demonstrating uncoupling developmental and aging phenotypes genes. Essential genes underrepresented in genome-wide screens postdevelopmental phenotypes aging. RNA screens for longevity exclude lethality, larval, sterility, and developmental pleiotropies. Caloric restriction (CR) extends lifespan across species, yeast, worms, flies, mice. sir-2.1 and let-363 in C. elegans regulate via CR. Unlike insulin, imposing CR anytime increases lifespan. Perturbations mitochondrial function increase lifespan. Regulation D-16 modulated by J signaling, SIR-2.1 deetyl, H-1, LIN-14, SM-1 nucleus. Rate aging tied reproduction. C. elegans germline produces D-16 K- signal negatively regulates lifespan, somatic gon promotes extension.

**Title:** Identification of Lamin Beta 1 as a Critical Regulator of Epithelial Polarization and Regeneration in Zebraf Fins

**Research Question:** What is the role of lamin beta 1 in the regeneration of zebraf fins, and how does it contribute to the formation of a signaling-competent epidermis?

**Methods:** We performed a forward genetic screen for mutations that impair fin regeneration in zraf fins and identified a temperature-sensitive allele of lamin beta 1 (lamba) that blocks regeneration. Positional cloning and complementation assays revealed that lamba is induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation, where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized epithelial layer.

**Findings:** Our results show that lamba is induced in epithelial cells is a key growth-guided step in the formation of a signaling-compet epidermis, which is critical for localization of receptors, expression of morphogenetic signals, osteob patterning, and bone regeneration. We also found that lamba is dispensable for juvenile growth, homeostatic tissue, adult maintenance, repair of fins, or renewal of geneticallylated osteoblasts.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel role for lamb in the regeneration of zraf fins, and suggest that epithelial polarization is a critical for the localization of signaling, expression of morphogenetic signals, osteob patterning, and bone. We also implicate fgf20 as an inducer of lamba during regeneration, and propose a network of growth-ECM regulatory interactions shape the regeneration epider.

**Conclusions:** Our study identifies lamb as a critical regulator of epithelialization and regeneration in zraf fins, and highlights the importance of epithelial polarization in the formation of a signaling-compet epider. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of regeneration of salander limbs and teleost fins, and suggest a network of growth-EC regulatory interactions shape the regeneration epider.

**Title:** Evaluating the Performance of Linear Mixed Models for Genome-Wide Association Studies: A Comparison of Approaches and Implementations

**Research Question:** How do different linear mixed models (LMM) approaches and software packages perform in modeling population structure and relatedness in genome-wide association studies, and which one is the most suitable for controlling the genome-wide error rate?

**Methods:** We compared the performance of several LMM approaches and implementations, including EMM, GenABEL, FaSTMM, Mend, GMA, and MMM, via application to a genome-wide association study of visceral leishiasis in 348 families comprising 362 individuals (197 genotyped). We investigated the sensitivity of these approaches to user-chosen options, such as the method and number of SNPs used to estimate the kinship matrix, and their success in controlling the genome-wide error for both real and simulated phenotypes.

**Findings:** We found strong concordance between results from different LMM approaches, all successful in controlling genome-wide error except for some when applied to longitudinal data with repeated measures. High correlation was observed between LMM and alternative approaches, apart from transmission-based when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects.

**Implications:** LMM approaches perform well compared to competing approaches, with strong concordance in most applications. The choice of L implementation should not be based on power I error considerations, but on speed and ease-of-use.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that linear models offer a convenient and robust approach for family-based GWAS of quantitative or binary traits, successful in controlling genomic inflation to an appropriate level, and offering higher power than traditional association approaches. The choice of L implementation should be based on practical considerations such as speed and ease-of-use, rather than power I error.

**Title:** Identification of Novel Compounds with High Efficacy against Trypanosoma cruzi and Low Toxicity to Host Cells: Implications for Chagas Disease Treatment**

**Background:** Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in Latin America, with no effective treatment for the chronic stage. Current drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, have toxic side effects and limited efficacy against the acute phase.

**Research Question:** Can we develop a high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds inhibiting Tryosoma cruzi infection in mammalian cells?

**Methods:** We optimized a whole-cell assay to screen 2000 compounds from the DIVER chemical library against recombinant T. cruzi (Tulahuen) expressing β-galactosidase. Three hits were selected for high activity against T. cruz and low toxicity to host cells: P1, NT, and CX (IC50: 54, 190, and 23 nM, respectively).

**Findings:** Each of the three compounds exhibited distinct mechanisms of action on intracellular proliferation T. cruzi amigotes: CX showed trypanidal activity, essential for chronic stage development; NT had tryostatic effect; and P affected parasite division. The compounds also showed activity against intracellular T. cruz from Y and related species Leishmania major and amazonensis.

**Implications:** Characterization of anti-T cruz activity led to selection of two compounds with IC values 2 n (CH and CX). These are 100 times lower than current medicines against T cruz. These results provide new candidates for Chagas and leishiasis treatment.

**Conclusion:** We developed a simple and efficient assay for high-throughput screening of compounds against T cruz replicating in mammalian cells. Tested 200 compounds from the DIVER library, we identified three hits with high activity against T cruz and low toxicity to host cells. These compounds showed distinct mechanisms of action on intracellular T cruz amigotes and activity against related species. Characterization of anti-T cruz activity led to selection of two compounds with IC values 2 times lower than current medicines. These results provide new candidates for Chagas and leishias treatment.

**Title:** Development of a Novel, Field-Friendly Diagnostic Platform for Molecular Xenomonitoring of Filarialial Parasites in Mosquitoes

**Background:** Current molecular xenomonitoring efforts for lymphatic filariasis rely on PCR or real-time PCR detection of Brugia malayi, Brug timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti in vectors. However, DNA extraction from mosquitoes is often performed using silica-based technologies, which are time-consuming, costly, and require expensive thermal cyclers or real-time instruments, posing significant challenges for laboratories in endemic areas. There is a need for inexpensive, equipment-minimizing diagnostic options that can be transported to the field and implemented in minimal settings.

**Research Question:** Can a novel, rapid NaOH-based DNA extraction methodology coupled with a portable, battery-powered PCR and test-based detection platform be developed for molecular xenomonitor of filarial parasites in mosquitoes?

**Methods:** We evaluated the performance of a rapid, NaOH methodology for extraction of total DNA from parasite-spiked vector mosquitoes and compared it to standard column-based techniques. We also compared our test-based assay to real-time PCR and conventional PCR with gel electrophoresis, demonstrating sensitive and genus-specific detection of parasite DNA from mosquito pools. Finally, we compared laboratory-based cycling with field miniaturized PCR, demonstrating potential for point-of-collection use of this diagnostic.

**Findings:** Our novel platform provides sensitive and specific detection of parasite DNA from mosquito without reliance on expensive instrumentation, making it an alternative to column-dependent extractions typically coupled to methodologies requiring laboratory infrastructure. This field system increases feasibility of molecularomitoring in B. mal-endemic locations.

**Implications:** This backpack system provides proof-of-concept for development of parallel assay for detection of W. bancfti, responsible for 90% of global LF burden, and can be extended to other mosquito-borne pathogens such as malaria, Zika, deng fever, Chikunya.

**Conclusion:** We present a novel, field-friendly diagnostic for molecularomitor of filarial parasites in mosquitoes using rapid DNA extraction, portable PCR, and test-based detection. This platform eliminates reliance on expensive, bulky instrumentation without compromising sensitivity or specificity, making it suitable for use in endemic locations lacking capacity for real-time PCR.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Domain Architecture on the Self-Assembly and Integrity of Elastomeric Proteins: A Theoretical Simulations and Insights

**Research Question:** How do the relative sizes and arrangements of elastomeric and cross-link domains influence the self-assembly and structural integrity of elastom proteins, and what are the implications for their evolution and design?

**Methods:** We developed a novel simulation environment using a diffusion-limited aggregation model to study the self-assembly of rod-like particles with alternating elastom architectures. We generated various aggregates and analyzed them using graph-theoretic metrics to predict their structural integrity.

**Findings:** Our results show that the relative length and number of elastom and cross-link domains significantly impact the morphology and structural integrity of the polymeric structure. Highly connected polymers were constructed from rods with large cross-link elements interspersed with smaller elastom domains.

**Implications:** These findings provide insights into the evolution of elastom proteins and guide the rational design of novel elastom-peptides. Elastom proteins are composed of alternating domains of elastom and cross-link elements, with the former driving self-assembly and latter stabilizing the polymer. Changes in their number and arrangement impact assembly and mechanical properties.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of domain architecture in elastom protein self-assembly and structural integrity. Theoretical simulations, such as those presented here, can inform the design of tunable molecules for biomaterials.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of 5' Untranslated Regions in Zaire Ebolavirus Translation and Replication**

**Research Question:** What are the functions of the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) in Zaire ebavirus, a highly lethal zoonotic pathogen, and how do they modulate translation and replication?

**Methods:** We employed reporter assays to investigate the role of EBO 5-UTRs in cap-dependent translation and internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) function. We transfected equal amounts of in vitro transcribed mRNAs with individual EBO 5-UTs upstream of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) open reading frame (ORF) and analyzed translation. Additionally, we generated a recombinant EBO virus with the L 5-UT's upstream AUG (uUG) mutated to UCG to assess its impact on replication.

**Findings:** Our data indicate that EBO 5-UTs lack IRES function and are translated by a cap-dependent mechanism, consistent with capped nature of EBO mRNAs. The 5-UTs differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of GFP, with the 5-UT from the polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressing GFP translation compared to β-actin 5-UT. The 5-UT possesses four upstream AUGs (uUGs), and ablating each uUG enhanced translation of the primary ORF, most dramatically in the case of the 5-UT. The uUG was sufficient to initiate translation, surrounded by a weak Koz sequence, and suppressed OR translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIFα was phosphorylated, the presence of uOR maintained translation of LOR, indicating u modulates translation in response to cellular stress.

**Implications:** Mutating two nucleotides outside previously defined protein and cis-acting regulatory sequences attenuated virus titers 10-100 lower than wild-type in Vero A549 cells. The mutant also exhibited decreased RNA synthesis as early as 6 post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to stress inducer thapsargin. These data identify novel mechanisms by which EBO regulates polymerase expression, demonstrate relevance to replication, and identify a potential therapeutic target.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that EBO 5-UTs modulate translation in response to cellular stress, providing a potential explanation for observations. Regulating EBO levels may balance viral replication, as shown in EBO minipolymerase assays and recombinant EBO mutant lacking uUG in 5-UT. The role of Koz sequence surrounding E LUG requires further investigation, as it maintains translation during stress response.

**Title:** Genome-Wide Mapping of Blunt Double-Strand Breaks Reveals Novel Gene Regulation Mechanisms and Chromosomal Organization

**Research Question:** How do double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the human genome contribute to chromosomal architecture and gene regulation?

**Methods:** We developed a method for precise genome-wide mapping of blunt-ended DSBs in human chromosomes and observed non-random fragmentation and DSB hotspots scattered along chromosomes, delimiting 50-250 kb domains.

**Findings:** About 30% of domains possess coordinately expressed genes, and PAR1 and HNPA2B1 bind sequences at domain termini, suggesting a novel type of regulation: coordinated transcription silencing of gene clusters delimited by DSB hotspots and PAR1 and HN2B1 binding sites.

**Implications:** Our data highlight the relationship between chromosomal fragile sites, chromosomal organization, and gene regulation, which may be important for cancer genomics and therapy.

**Conclusions:** Genome instability plays a key role in biological processes and diseases, including cancer. Genome-wide mapping of DSBs is crucial for understanding chromosomal architecture and specific chromosomal regions DSB. Our findings suggest a novel type of gene regulation: coordinated silencing transcription of gene clusters within chromosomal domains delimited by non-random DSB hotspots and PAR1 and HN2B binding sites.

**Title:** Trypanosomat Infection in Bats in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro: A Comparative Study of Two Areas with Different Levels of Degradation

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the diversity of trypanomat species in bats in two areas with different levels of degradation in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Reserva Ecológica Guçu (REG) and Estação Florestal Mata Atlântica (EFMA), and evaluate the influence of preservation levels on bat richness and trypanomat diversity.

**Methods:** We captured bats in both areas and analyzed 181 specimens by Leishmania-Schneider hemoculture, detecting 24 (13%) infected individuals, including one individual positive by blood examination. Molecular characterization using nested PCR targeting the 18S rRNA-encoding fragment showed similar trypanomat infection rates in both areas (15% in REG and 11% in EF, p=0.46). Trypanosomaionii was the most detected parasite (54%), followed by T. cruzi DTI and TIV and Tryosoma sp.

**Findings:** Our results showed no influence of preservation level on bat species richness (15 and 14 species, respectively) with chiroptera and higher abundance of two fruit-eating bat species, Carollia persillata and Artus litatus. Tryosomaionii was the most detected parasite (54%), followed by T. cruz DTI and TIV and Tryoma sp. in Neotropical phlost bats RN63 and RN56. Mixed infections T.ionii/cruz TIII and.ionii/cruzTI were observed. T. cruz DT and TIV are genotypes involved in cases of Chagas disease in Brazil, and.ion was recently found in heart of infected child.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of bats as hosts and reservoirs of trypan and other microorganisms, such as viruses and bacteria. Approximately 70% of Rio de Janeiro population lives in the Atlantic area, reinforcing the importance of including parasites in local biodiversity studies. Our results indicate the role of bats in maintaining tryomat species in sylvatic environment. Sylvatic transmission of tryomat species occurred among bats in REG and MA. Bats from preserved area showed higher infection rates than degraded area 15% and 11, respectively.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides an overview of tryomat diversity in two areas with different human disturbance levels. We conclude that bats are resilient to tryomat infection and sources of vectors, maintaining high diversity of parasites. This study reinforces urgency discussing parasism concepts among tryomat and hosts. Bat species frequent in areas exhibit plasticity in usage, occurring in forests and urban areas. Our data show flexibility in maintaining high tryomat parasites.

**Title:** High Prevalence of Pathogens and Symbionts in Ixodes ricinus Ticks in the French Ardennes: Implications for Human and Animal Health

**Research Question:** What is the prevalence of pathogens and symbionts in Ixodes ricinus ticks in the French Ardennes and how do they interact with each other?

**Methods:** A total of 267 female Iodes ricinus ticks were collected in the French Ardennes and analyzed for the presence of 37 pathogens (bacteria and parasites) using high-throughput real-time PCR, rRT-PCR for Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBE), and nested PCR for symbionts. Possible interactions between pathogens and symbts were statistically evaluated.

**Findings:** Among the infected ticks, 45% were co-infected with up to five pathogens. Adding symbion prevalence, all ticks were infected with at least one microorganism and up to eight microorganisms were identified in the same tick. Considering interactions between pathogens, a strong association was found between Borrelia garini and B. afii, whereas no interactions between symbts and pathogens.

**Implications:** Our study reveals high pathogen co-infection rates in ticks, raising questions about co-transmission to humans and animals and consequences for human and animal health. High prevalence of symbts co-existing with pathogens opens new avenues for research on effects on pathogen transmission and vector competence.

**Conclusion:** This study provides a comprehensive overview of epidemiological situation of tick-borne pathogens in the French Ardennes, highlighting high levels of pathogen infection and co-infection. Our novel high-throughput method identifies major and neglected tick-borne pathogens, including 37 species of bacteria and parasites, in a single sample. This study demonstrates the importance of considering co-infections and interactions between pathogens and symbts in understanding tick-borne disease ecology and transmission.

**Title:** Deciphering the Molecular Circuitry of Hematopoietic Lineage Commitment: A Computational Modeling of the PU.1-GATA1 Switch

**Research Question:** How do genetic networks govern the primed and committed states of hematopoietic lineage, and what is the underlying molecular mechanism of bistability in the PU.1-GATA1 switch?

**Methods:** We developed a computational model of the hematopoietic eryth-myeloid lineage decision based on known interactions between master genes PU.1 and GATA1, including mutual antagonism and autoregulation, to make the system bistable.

**Findings:** Our model suggests a new mechanism involving a cofactor regulated by one of the master genes to bind the antagonistic partner necessary for bistability and switch-like behavior. Suppression of cofactor through external means leads to loss of cooperativity and primed state PU.1-GATA. The PU1-GATA switch interacts with another antagonistic pair, FOG-1, inheriting state of upstream genes and reinforcing decision through feedback loops, leading to irreversible commitment.

**Implications:** The genetic switch of eryth-myoid lineage is an example of a network implementing prim and committed states by cooperativity recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing feedback between regulators and targets suggests reprogramming strategies. This approach provides a framework for lineage studies in general and aids search for lineage-determining genes.

**Conclusions:** Hematopoies exhibit lineage points with key transcription factors and signals. The PU1-G1 and GATA subnetwork governs eryth-myoid lineages, demonstrating commitment and priming features. PU1 and GATA are autoregulatory, providing stability once expressed. Our model hypothesizes that commitment in architecture consists of layers of antagonistic genes reinforcing upper decisions, resulting in positive feedback, robust commitment. Noise effects on interactions in committed eryroid cells are unclear at earlier stages of differentiation. Dynamically, a network like PU-G1-G1 would exhibit bistability. Future models query similar architectures. Irreversibility of eryth-myoid switch through feedback from lineage components, FOG-1, is explored.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Enterocococcal Polysacchar Antigen (EPA) in Enterococcus faecalis Resistance to Lysozym and Virulence

**Research Question:** How does the enterocococcal polyschar antigen (EPA) contribute to Enteroccus faalis resistance to lyzym and virulence in the zebraf model of infection?

**Methods:** We employed random transposon mutagenesis in a quadruple oat/pgA/dA/dA/sig mutant to identify novel genes modulating E. faalis resistance to lyzym. We mapped transposon insertion sites revealed a locus referred to as the enteroccal polyschar antigen (EPA) region downstream of conserved epA-ep genes, proposed to encode the core machinery for EPA production. We investigated the role of EPA in resistance to antimicrobials and virulence using a zraf model of infection.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that EPA decoration of the rhamopolysacide backbone is not sufficient to promote E. faalis infections, but modification of this surface polymer is essential for enteroccal pathogenesis. Deletion of pgA alone in L monocogen is associated with a 32-fold decrease in resistance. Disruption of genes encoding EPA decoration increased E. fa resistance to lyzym. In-frame deletion of these genes in wild-type background had the same effect.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that several genes contributing to EPA decoration play a crucial role in resistance to innate immune effectors and virulence. The conserved epA-ep region encodes the core apparatus for EPA production, while the variable region is responsible for decoration. This study reveals an essential role of EPA modification in E. fa resistance to ly and virulence.

**Conclusions:** The enteroccal polyschar antigen (EPA) plays a critical role in E. fa resistance to ly and virulence in the zraf model of infection by conferring resistance to phagocytosis. Our results highlight the importance of EPA modification of the rhamopolacide backbone for enteroccal pathogenesis. The conserved ep-ep region encodes the machinery for EPA production, while the variable region is responsible for decoration. These findings provide new insights into the complex network of transcription regulators and genes involved in E fa resistance to ly and virulence.

**Title:** RER: A Novel Framework for Integrating Genomic and Epigenomic Data to Uncover Regulatory Programs in Cancer

**Research Question:** How can we integrate large-scale genomic and epigenomic data from Encyclopedia of DNA (ENCODE) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCG) to uncover regulatory programs in cancer?

**Methods:** We developed RER, a two-stage regression framework that infers sample-specific regulatory activities of transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs, which are then used to infer TF-miRNA interactions. We integrated acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) data from TCG and related TF binding data from K562 in EN.

**Findings:**

* RER outperformed existing methods in predicting gene expression and recovering known regulatory interactions.
* Identified 18 regulators whose activities clustered with cytogenetic risk, including miR-548, whose targets were enriched for leukemia-related pathways, implicating its role in AML pathogenesis.
* Survival analysis using inferred activities as a potential AML prognostic marker.

**Implications:**

* RER provides a novel framework to integrate TCG and EN data, revealing AML-specific regulatory programs at a global level.
* Identified mi-548 as a novel regulator in AML pathogenesis.
* Inferred activities as a potential prognostic marker for AML.

**Conclusions:**

ER addresses the lack of integrative model to leverage rich heterogeneous data from EN and TCG. By inferring sample-specific TF and miRNA activities and their interactions, we uncover regulatory programs in AML. Our results demonstrate the power of ER in predicting expression, recovering known interactions, and identifying novel regulators and prognostic markers. This framework opens avenues for understanding cancer biology and therapy.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of RNA Silencing in the Fungal Pathogen Colletotrichum higginsum: A Novel Insights into Antiviral Mechanisms

**Research Question:** What is the role of RNA silencing in the ascomyc fungus Colotrichum higginsum, a pathogen of various crops worldwide?

**Methods:** Knock-out mutants of genes for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DR), Dicer (DCL), and Argonaute (AGO) proteins were generated by targeted gene replacement in C. higginsum. Effects on vegetative growth, conidiation, and conidia morphology were analyzed. Total transcripts and small RNA populations were analyzed in parental and mutant strains.

**Findings:** No effects on vegetative growth were observed in any mutant when grown on complex or minimal media. However, Δcl, ΔclΔcl, and Δago strains showed severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology. Total transcripts and small RNA populations showed greatest effects in Δcl, ΔclΔcl, andago strains. A previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colotrichum higginsum non-segment dsRNA 1 (ChV) was derepressed. Phylogenetic analyses showed close relationship between ChV and segmented Partitiviridae family. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs with AGO showed abundant 5'U-containing siRNA.

**Implications:** RNA silencing involving DCL and AGO in C. higgins is proposed to function as antiv mechanism.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies the role of RNA silencing in the fungal pathogen C. higgins. Knock mutants and high-through sequencing functionally characterized transcriptomes and small RNA in C. h mycelia. AGO and DCL were critical for maintaining low levels of accumulation of novel dsRNA, designated ChV. Deletion analysis revealed DCL and AGO affected conidia and asexual spore morphology C. higgins. Loci affected by silencing factors, particularly DCL and AG, were identified through transcript and RNA analysis.

**Title:** Histone Acetyltransferase MOF Regulates Three Waves of H2AX Phosphorylation and Meiotic DSB Repair in Spermatocytes

**Research Question:** What is the role of histone acetyltransferase MOF in the regulation of H2 phosphorylation and meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in spermatocytes during meiotic prophase I?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of MOF in spermatocytes using a Stra8-Cre (MOF cKO) mouse model, where MO was specifically deleted in spermatocytes. We analyzed H2 phosphorylation and DSB repair in leptotene, zygot, and pachene spermatocytes by immunostaining and immunofluorescence.

**Findings:** MO deletion in spermatocytes caused loss of chromatin-wide H2 phosphorylation in leptene and zgot spermatocytes, while γHAX signals were only observed along chromosomal axes. In 40% of early-mid pachene spermatocytes, γHAX and MDC1 were detected along unsyn axes, but failed to expand, leading to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) failure. RAD51 was proficiently recruited to DSB sites, but defects in D repair and crossover formation were observed, indicating MO facilitates meiotic D repair after RAD51 recruitment.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that MO regulates three waves of HAX phosphorylation from leptene to pach stages, initiated by ATM and ATR, respectively. MO is essential for chromatin-wide expansion of H2 phosphorylation in leptene and zgot spermatocytes, but not its initiation. The third wave of HAX phosphorylation, which marks unsynapsed chromosomes, is preserved in MO-deficient mice, suggesting MO is not required for this wave. Failure in chromatin expansion of H2 phosphorylation in MO-deficient spermatocytes disturbs MSCI.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel function of MO in meiotic prophase, facilitating three waves of HAX phosphorylation and meiotic DSB repair. MO deletion in spermatocytes causes loss of chromatin-wide H phosphorylation and defects in D repair, highlighting its essential role in male meiosis.

**Title:** Alteration of Hematopoietic Development is Thought to be Responsible for the Onset of Leukemias and Lymphomas: Investigation of HTLV-1 Infection in a Human Immune System (HIS) Rag-2/-c/- Mouse Model**

**Research Question:** Does HTLV-1 infection perturb human T-cell development in the thymus, leading to the onset of leukemias and lymphomas?

**Methods:** We investigated the in vivo effects of HT-1 infection in a Human Immune System (IS) Rag-2/-c/- mouse model. Mice were infected with HT-1 at a time when three subpopulations of thymocytes have been detected. All inoculated mice had HT- provirus integrated in thym; proviral load increased with length of infection.

**Findings:** In HT- infected mice, alterations in T development were observed, extent correlated with proviral load. Thus, in thym of HT- infected Rag-/-c- mice, mature-positive (SP) CD4 and CD+ cells were numerous at expense of immature and double-positive (DP) thymocytes. These cells accumulated in spleen. Lymphocytes from thym and spleen were activated, shown by expression CD25; this correlated with presence mRNA and increased of NF-k dependent genes such as b-1, anti-apopt gene in thym. Hepatosplenomealy lymphaden and lymphoma/thoma, which was detected, observed in HT- infected mice several months after infection.

**Implications:** These results demonstrate the potential of Rag-/-c- animal to elucidate initial steps leukogenic induced by HT-.

**Conclusions:** HT- infection expands mature T-cells in periphery. Tax activates transcription genes involved in survival and proliferation in thym of HT- infected Rag-/-- mice, favouring expansion of mature T. Observations suggest positive correlation between PVL and alterations T development in HT infected Rag-/- mice. To verify, CD and CD expression on thym of either less CD- or more CD+ subpopulations of age-matched mice, including mock-infected and HT- infected, one with low P and two high P. Findings demonstrate Rag-/- infected with HT provide model for viral malignancy. Combination of immature cells in thym and immunodeficient environment Rag-/- favours rapid T malign. Model will be helpful studying involvement HT genes like in pathogenesis as well as role proviral sites.

**Title:** Evaluation of an Integrated Schistosomiasis Control Program in Alal Locality, White State, Sudan: A 2009-2011

**Research Question:** What is the effectiveness of an integrated schistomiasis control program in reducing the prevalence of Schistosoma haematium infection among primary school students in Alal locality, White State, Sudan?

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted among 482,902 population, with 78,615 primary school students as the major target group. Urine and stool specimens were examined using sedimentation and Kato-Kato-Katz methods, respectively. Questionnaires assessed health education and water supply impacts at Alida village.

**Findings:** Baseline prevalence of S. haematium and S. mansoni was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. Follow-up after 6-9 months post-treatment, S. haematium prevalence reduced to 13.5% (95%CI=0.331-0.462). Higher reduction observed in girls (20%) and rural residents compared to boys (40%) and urban residents. Health education increased awareness and water supply reduced S. haium infection. No change in S. mansoni prevalence between baseline and follow-up (95%CI=0.9336.891).

**Implications:** The integrated program reduced S. haemat infection by 50% compared to baseline. Approximately 200,000 subjects received praziquant therapy, education, or clean water supply.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of an integrated schistomias control program in reducing S. haemat infection among primary school students in Al locality, White, Sudan. Health education and water supply are crucial in controlling schomiasis. The program should be adapted continuously to consolidate achievements.

**Title:** Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Trafficking of Nip Virus Matrix Protein and Post-Translational Modification Regulate Matrix-Mediated Budding

**Research Question:** What is the role of nuclear-ctoplasmic trafficking and post-translational modification of the Nip virus (NiV) matrix protein in viral budding?

**Methods:** We investigated the subcellular localization of NiV matrix protein during live infection and expression in cells using immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical assays. Mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in NiV impaired nuclear-ctoplasm trafficking and abolished NiV budding. We also examined the role of ubiquitination in NiV budding using proteasome inhibitors and ubiquitin overexpression.

**Findings:** NiV was first detected in the nucleus at early stages of infection before localization to cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Mutations in NLS and NES impaired nucleartopl trafficking and abolished NiV budding. A conserved lysine in N served dual functions: positive charge for nuclear import and potential for monoubiquination regulating export. Overexpression ubiquitin enhanced NiV budding, while depletion ubiquitin via proteas inhibitors resulted in nuclear retention Ni and blocked budding. Live NiV was sensitive to proteas inhibitors, with an IC50 of 2.7 nM, a 100-fold less than peak plasma concentration achievable in humans.

**Implications:** Nuclear-ctoplasm trafficking and postl modification play critical roles in matrix-mediated NiV budding. The Ni matrix protein utilizes multiple trafficking machineries, with a single lysine in N serving as both import and export regulator. Our findings open possibility of using proteas inhibitors as therapeutic against Ni infection.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel role for nuclear-ctoplasm trafficking Ni matrix protein in viral life cycle and highlights the importance of postl modification in matrix-mediated budding. The Ni matrix efficiently uses cellular machineries, with a single lysine serving dual functions. Our results suggest proteas inhibitors as potential therapeutic against Ni infection.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Genome Delivery by Nonenvelop Viruses: Unveiling the Pathway of Poliovirus (PV) Entry and Genome Release

**Research Question:** How do nonvelop viruses, such as poliovirus (PV), deliver their genetic material across the cellular membrane into the appropriate compartment of the cell?

**Methods:** We employed a novel imaging assay that simultaneously tracks the viral capsid and genome in live cells with an infectivity-based RNA release assay to characterize early events in PV infection. The effects of RNA delivery inhibitors on cell pathways were probed systematically using both methods.

**Findings:** Surprisingly, we observed that genome release by PV is highly efficient and rapid, not limiting overall infectivity or infection rate. Our results define a pathway in which PV binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters by clathrin, caveolin, flotillin, and microtubule-independent, tyrosine kinase and act-dependent endocytic mechanism. Immediately after internalization of the virus, genome release occurs from vesicles or sealed invaginations within 100-200 nm of the plasma membrane.

**Implications:** Our findings settle a long-standing debate whether PV directly breaks the plasma barrier or relies on endocyt to deliver genome into cell. This imaging assay is expected to be broadly applicable to investigation of entry mechanisms for nonvelop viruses.

**Conclusions:** The sites of genome release are unknown for most nonvelop viruses. We chose PV as a model to study entry and delivery by nonvelop viruses. PV is a picornavirus causing poliomyelitis and related to important human pathogens including rhiniruses, coackiruses, echiruses, and enteriruses. We characterized PV pathway by combining live-cell imaging of dual-labeled PV with viralid and RNA labeled distinct fluorophores and biochemical assays measuring RNA release. These characterized early events initiated at low MO in presence or absence of trafficking inhibitors. Together, results suggest PV must enter before releasing genome and release occurs afterward within 100-200 nm of plasma.

**Title:** Evaluating the Effectiveness of Dengue Prevention Education in Cambodia: Challenges and Opportunities for Improvement

**Research Question:** What are the current approaches to deng prevention and control in Cambodia, and how effective are they in reducing the prevalence of deng, particularly among children?

**Methods:** An ethnographic study was conducted in eastern Cambodia from 2003-2004, collecting data on health education approaches and their effectiveness in controlling deng.

**Findings:** Community health education provided by the National Dengue Control Program (NP) is irregular, underfunded, and lacks follow-up, resulting in partial adherence. School-based education is restricted in time and lacks practical activities for prevention and control.

**Implications:** Sustained education for deng prevention and control is needed, with approaches to ensure translation of knowledge into practice.

**Conclusion:** Health education plays a crucial role in informing people to prevent and control d, but in resource-poor countries, efficacy is complicated by economic, political, and infrastructural factors. In Cambodia, deng education through outreach and school programs is insufficient, underfunded. However, local prevention and control involving community members through education offers potential to reduce d, but cannot occur where education is poorly resourced and attention is not paid to translation to practice. Political commitment and availability of resources impact outreach activities.

**Key Findings:**

* No specific model was used to structure health activities or education; strategy and content included various activities, information, and practices to control deng and mortality.
* Community education through radio, television, billboards, banners, posters, and leaflets.
* Existing d education materials and strategies must be redefined to be practical and applicable.
* Little training in health education for practitioners during professional or in-service, therefore lack skills and perceive health is not part of work.

**Recommendations:**

* Sustained education for deng prevention and control.
* Approaches to ensure translation of knowledge into practice.
* Political commitment and availability of resources for outreach activities.
* Redefine health education materials and strategies to be practical and applicable.
* Training for practitioners in health education during professional or in-service.

**Title:** Identification of Circulating MicroRNAs Released by Filarial Nematodes in Hosts: Implications for Diagnosis and Understanding Host-Parasite Interactions

**Research Question:** Can circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes be detected in the bloodstream of infected hosts, and can they serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and understanding of host-parasite interactions?

**Methods:** We investigated the presence of miRNAs released by filarial nematodes in the bloodstream of infected hosts using miRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Total RNA from D. immit-infected dog plasma and O. volulus-infected human serum were subjected to miRNA sequencing, revealing 200 and 21 mature miRNA sequences, respectively. RT-qPCR assays were developed to detect two miRNA candidates, mi-71 and mi-34, which discriminated infected from uninfected samples.

**Findings:** We identified a large number of candidate miRNAs in samples from mammalian hosts infected with several filarial nematodes, including 245 and 261 miRNAs in D. imis-infected dog plasma and 21 miRN in O. volulus-infected human serum. mi-71 and mi-34 were detected in all D. imis-infected samples, but not correlated with microfilaria (mf) counts.

**Implications:** Circulating parasite-derived miRNAs are detectable in plasma/serum even for species not living in bloodstream, such as D. imis, which inhabits lymphatic vessels, while O. volulus life stages do not have direct contact with blood. Our findings suggest that miRN can serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and understanding host-parite interactions.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the presence of circulating miRN released by filarial nematodes in hosts, providing unprecedented opportunities for diagnosis and understanding of host-parite interactions. Further research is needed to investigate the role of mi in host-paras interactions and their potential as biomarkers for diagnosis.

**Title:** Elucidating the Conformational Transitions in Src Kinase Activation: A Coarse-Grained Modeling and Network Analysis

**Research Question:** How do Src kinases transition from an inactive to active state, and what are the underlying structural changes involved in this process?

**Methods:** We constructed a coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain incorporating experimental structures of two stable states and simulated conformation transitions using molecular dynamics. We explored the energy landscapes by constructing a structural network among conformations from simulations.

**Findings:** Two major pathways for activation were identified: (1) a coordinated switching mechanism among α-helix, activation loop, and β-strands in N-lo of catalytic domain, and (2) conformation change coupled to partial unfolding of N-lo region of catalytic domain. We characterized the switching mechanism of α-helix and activation in detail. A Markov model was tested to account for structural kinetics in context of conformation changes.

**Implications:** Our results provide a framework for understanding conformation transition in Src activation. The large motions in Src activation occur on a slow timescale beyond brute-force simulations. A structure-based coarse-grained model was developed to investigate conformation changes on free landscapes. The conformation landscape was explored by clustering configurational space and constructing a structural network from simulations.

**Conclusions:** The conformation transition in Src activation is a complex process involving two pathways. The first pathway involves coordinated interactions among α-helix, activation, and β-strands in N-lo catalytic, while the second is coupled to partial unfolding of N-lo region. A Markov model was able to account for structural kinetics in context conformation changes. Our results provide a broad framework for analyzing conformation transition in Src activation.

**Title:** Unraveling the Molecular Mechanisms of Lethality in F1 Hybrids between Diverged Parents: A Key to Speciation Research

**Research Question:** What are the molecular mechanisms underlying lethality in F1 hybrids between diverged parents, and how does dosage sensitivity play a role in polyploid speciation?

**Methods:** We investigated variation in F lethality in interplo crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana and determined the genetic architecture of matern expressed variation via QTL mapping. Single-effect QTL, DRANGEVE1 (DSL), was identified, as well as two QTL with epist relationships to DSL. DSL affects postzygotic leth via expression in maternal sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL in interval encoding maternal transcription factor TT2.

**Findings:** Maternal parents carrying loss-function in TT2 suppressed F lethality caused by paternal interplo crosses. Frequency of cellularization in endosperm affected by natural and TT2 loss-function mutants. Genetic basis of variation and single-gene mutations suggests F leth in polloids could evolve rapidly. Role of sporophytic TT2 in interplo crosses indicates developmental programming regulates viability interplo hybrid offspring.

**Implications:** Postzyotic leth of hybrid offspring from divergent parents drives or reinforces speciation. Molecular mechanisms, however, not understood. In plants, F leth occurs when progeny from polloid and diploid crosses fail seed development. Genome-wide scans epist interactions with DSL revealed TT2 encoding DSL QTL. Loss-function TT2 reduced interplo hybrid barrier. Allelic variation TT2 explain DSL QTL. Loss-function TT2 improved interplo crossing.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals the genetic basis of leth in interplo hybrids, highlighting the critical role of maternal sporophyte genotype in interplo hybridization. Single-gene mutations in TT2 and TT3 demonstrate reproductive isolation by ploidy and fertility can be mediated by mutations in sporophyte. Early aberrant development in progeny paternal excess visible in endosperm. Our findings suggest leth in pollo can evolve rapidly, and developmental programming mother regulates viability interplo offspring.

**Title:** Co-evolutionary Patterns of Bacterial Pathogens in Bats and Rodents: A Comparative Analysis of Bartonella and Leptira Species

**Research Question:** This study investigates the co-evolutionary relationships between bacterial pathogens and their hosts in bats and rodents, focusing on Bartonella and Leptira species as model organisms.

**Methods:** We analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptira from 20 bats. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies were generated for hosts and bacteria, and coevolution congruence was tested using ParaFit, PAC, and Jane.

**Findings:** We found significant coevolution congruence between Bartonella and their bat hosts (ParaFit=1.970, P≤0.001; m global value=7.332, P0.000) and between Bartonella and rodent hosts (ParaFit=102.440, P.001; m value=86.532, P.000). In contrast, Leptira and bats showed no coev congruence (ParaFit=0.004, P=0.84; m value=4.631, P.562). Separate analyses of New and Old World datasets yielded congruent results. Event-based cophy analyses revealed Leptira bats had the most host switches (0.731), while Bartonella had the fewest (0.264).

**Implications:** These findings suggest that Bartonella exhibits coevolution with minimal host switching in both bats and rodents, while Leptira lacks congruence with its host and has high host switches. Differences in disease transmission and host ecology likely underlie these coevary patterns. Understanding coev patterns and host-switching events between pathogens and hosts will predict spillo between mammal reservoirs and humans.

**Conclusion:** This study provides the first comparative co-evolutionary analysis of bacterial pathogens in bats and rodents, highlighting significant coev congruence between Bartonella and their hosts, but not Leptira and bats. Event-based cophy supports these findings, with rod-Barton and bat-Barton associations having least host switches, indicating greater congru over time. Further research is needed to understand evolutionary dynamics Barton and Leira in bats and rodents.

**Title:** Understanding the Emergence of Movement in Undulatory Swimming: A Damped Oscillation Framework and Chain Model

**Research Question:** How does muscle forcing lead to complex deformation and movement in undulatory swimmers, and what is the role of active and passive forcing in swimming?

**Methods:** A damped oscillation framework was applied to a chain model of undulatory swimming to investigate the emergence of movement due to muscle contractions (active swimming) and fluid forces (passive swimming).

**Findings:** We show that forcing triggers the first deformation modes of the body, leading to translational motion, and that simple patterns can lead to complex kinematics. The frequency of muscle activation relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is crucial for emergent deformation characteristics of the body.

**Implications:** The proposed approach provides a qualitative understanding of optimal kinematics for fast swimming, confirmed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Our results explain the optimal value of stiffness for maximum speed from literature.

**Conclusions:** Undulatory movement is an emergent behavior from muscle activation, with two primary issues: how muscle leads to deformation and how kinematics produce movement. The forced damped oscillation framework elucidates swimming motion, with active and passive swimming arising from different types of forcing. Typical motions involve lower modes. Power from muscle work is used in deformation and dissipated into fluid. A closed expression for swimming velocity is derived from leading analysis of equations.

**Key Findings:**

* Forcing triggers first deformation modes leading to translational motion
* Simple patterns can lead complex kinematics
* Frequency of muscle activation relative to damped frequency important for emergent characteristics
* Power from muscle used in deformation dissipated into fluid
 Closed expression for swimming velocity derived

**Significance:** Understanding undulatory movement is crucial for animal locomotion, with two issues: muscle to deformation and kinematics to movement. The damped oscillation framework provides a unified understanding of active and passive swimming, confirmed by CFD simulations.

**Title:** Genetic Recombination between Trypanosoma brucei Subspecies: A Novel Pathogen Strains and the Risk of African Trypanosomiasis Outbreaks

**Research Question:** Can genetic recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals generate new strains of the human pathogen T. b. rhodesense (T) responsible for sleeping sickness (African Trypaniasis, HAT) in East Africa?

**Methods:** We investigated the inheritance of a single gene, SRA, which confers human infectivity to T, in crosses between T. b. rhense (T) and T. b. brucei (T) set up by co-transmitting genetically-engineered fluorescent trypanosome lines through tse flies. We tracked the transfer of S in new genetic backgrounds by sexual reproduction between T and T, creating new strains of the pathogen T.

**Findings:** S was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds by sexual reproduction between T and T, creating new strains of the pathogen T. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of trypanosomes carrying S. Although expression of S is critical to survival of T in the host, we show the gene exists as a single copy in representative of T strains. S was found on homologue chromosome IV in majority of T isolates, but Ugandan T had S on both homologues. Mobility of S by recombination explains observed variability of T in Africa.

**Implications:** New strains of the pathogen T are being continuously generated by recombination with the larger pool of animal-infect trypanosomes. Novel recombinants present a risk for future outbreaks of H.

**Conclusion:** The transfer of single gene S potentially generates new human-infect tryosomes, demonstrated by transfection of S into T, resulting in tryosome with human-infect phenotype. Trypanoma bruce is the parasite responsible for vector-borne disease African trypanias (H) in East. Disease is zoon caused by T. b. rhense (T) morphologically indistinguishable from non-infective subs, T. b. bruce (T). Subspecies occur in same range wild or domestic mammalian hosts, long-standing controversy about identification. In support, absence AP1 in human fluid needs verification. New infect strains human pathogen T generated by recombination T with larger pool animal-infect tryosomes, recombinants risk future H.

**Title:** Disrupted Gap Junction Coupling in Pancreases β-cell Dysfunction in Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus: A Computational and Experimental Insights

**Research Question:** How does gap junction-mediated electrical coupling contribute to β-cell dysfunction in Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM) and can it be targeted for therapeutic intervention?

**Methods:** We employed a computational model of islet electrical activity and insulin secretion to investigate the role of gap junction coupling in NDM, validated against experimental measurements of [Ca2+2] and insulin in islets expressing ATP-insensitive K channels. We applied the model to predict the effects of KCNJ and AB8 mutations on [Ca2] and the role of gap coupling in suppression. We extended the model to account for stochastic noise and insulin dynamics.

**Findings:** Reduced gap coupling allowed greater glucose-stimulated [Ca2] and insulin secretion in islets expressing ATP-ins K channels. The model demonstrated good correspondence between suppression [2] and clinical presentation of NDM mutations. Significant recoveries [2 and insulin were predicted for many mutations upon reductions in gap coupling, with stochastic playing a role in recoveries.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new understanding of the islet as a multicellular system and the role of gap channels in exacerbating effects of cellular excitability. They suggest novel therapeutic options for NDM and other monogenic forms of diabetes.

**Conclusions:** Gap junction electrical strongly mediates suppression of islet [2 and insulin in presence ATP-sensitive K channels. Reduced coupling can recover islet function and blunt diabetes caused by KC11 and AB8 mutations. Stochastic noise plays a significant role in recoveries of [2 and insulin. This study highlights the importance of gap coupling in islet dysfunction and its potential as a therapeutic target for NDM.

**Title:** Predicting Dynamic Behavior of Large Networks Composed of Modules in Synthetic Biology: A Framework Accounting for Retroactivity

**Research Question:** Predicting the behavior of large networks composed of modules is a central in synthetic biology, yet this ability is largely missing due to context-dependent behavior caused by retroactivity, a phenomenon influencing module dynamics in non-trivial ways upon connections to other modules.

**Methods:** We establish an analysis framework for gene networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity. A module's properties are encoded by three matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, all with physical interpretation and computation from macroscopic parameters (dissociation constants and concentrations) and modules' topology. Internal retroactivity quantifies intramodular connections' effect on isolated dynamics, while scaling and mixing retro establish intermod connections' change dynamics.

**Findings:** Based on these matrices and modules' dynamics in isolation, we accurately predict how loading will affect arbitrary interconnection modules' behavior. We illustrate implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity on recurrent motifs, including autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, toggle, and single motif. Further, we provide a metric determining dynamic module's robustness to interconnection other modules, employable to evaluate natural networks' modularity and design guidelines minimize retroactivity in synthetic systems.

**Conclusions:** This paper focuses on retroactivity, a source of context dependence, demonstrating internal, scaling, and mixing provide missing knowledge capturing effects intram and inter connections. Internal retro quantifies intram load applied by nodes within onto promoter sites. Assuming mRNA dynamics occur faster production/decay [1], mRNA is not relevant, yielding minor changes (Methods). We identify transcriptional node within network. Our model captures retro unlike standard Hill functions [1], describing dynamics change once connected other modules. This is function biochemical parameters, concentrations, and topology. Accounting for retro reveals dynamical properties, aiding design.

**Key Findings:**

* Internal, scaling, and mixing retro matrices increase with DNA number/dissociation constants
* Accounting for retro reveals surprising dynamical properties, aiding design
* Effective intermod binding rate, connected module dynamics (4)
* Retroactivity output, encompassing applied module context
* Retro input, originating inside module

**Implications:**

* Revealing dynamical properties, aiding design
* Evaluating natural networks modularity
 Minimizing retroactivity in synthetic systems

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Recombination in the Pseudoautosomal Region (PAR) of Mammalian X and Y Chromosomes

**Research Question:** The pseudoautosomal (PAR) region, a region of homology between mammalian X and Y chromosomes, has undergone rapid evolution, and crossover in PAR is essential for proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in meiosis. However, the mechanism of obligatory crossover in PAR remains unknown, particularly the fine-scale positioning of crossovers across this region.

**Methods:** To investigate recombination in this region, we constructed a fine-scale genetic map of observed crossovers using African-American pedigrees, leveraging recombination rates inferred from breakdown of linkage disequilibrium in human populations and signatures of DNA evolution due to recombination. We also identified PRDM binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells.

**Findings:** Contrary to recent research in mice, we found that PRDM does not localize recombination peaks in human PAR1. Instead, recombination is a more rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1 than on autosomes. We show PAR hotspot activities differ significantly among human populations and that PAR hotspot positions have changed between human and chimpanzee, with no evidence of sharing among hotspots.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that PRDM remains responsible for positioning recombination events, but other factors aid protein in producing high crossover rate. We propose that chromatin configuration in meiosis facilitates access by PR9 to a fraction of its binding sites. The role of another recombination protein, PRDM, is unclear in PAR. Our results have implications for understanding how PAR maintains uniquely high crossover rate.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the most fine-scale genetic map of recombination in PAR to date, aiding research on this vital region of the genome. Our results challenge recent findings in mice that PRDM localizes recombination in PAR and highlight the complexity of recombination mechanisms in this region. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of PRDM and other factors in PAR recombination.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel Isoform of Histone Demethylase JMJD2, Δ-JMJD2, Essential for Muscle Differentiation through Histone H3 Demethylation at the Myogenin Promoter

**Research Question:** What is the role of histone demethylase JM2 in muscle differentiation, particularly at the onset of myoblast-to-myotube transition, and what is the mechanism of histone H3 demethylation at the myogen promoter?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of JM2 mRNA in mouse myoblast cell line C2C12, a model of skeletal muscle differentiation, and found that demethylation of H3 at the mylast-myube transition depends on Δ-JJD2, a novel isoform of JM2 lacking the N-terminal demethyl domain. We used genome-wide expression profiling and siRNA knockdown to show that Δ-J2 is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression, and promotes MyD-induced conversion of NIH3T3 cells into muscle cells.

**Findings:** Δ-J2 binds to genes involved in transcriptional control and this binding is linked to activation; it is recruited to the myogen promoter at onset of differentiation, promoting demethylation of H3me and H3. We conclude that induction of Δ-J2 is crucial for muscle differentiation by removing repressive chromatin marks at the myogen promoter, promoting transcriptional activation of myogen and contributing to initiation of muscle-specific expression.

**Implications:** Δ-J2 acts as a transcriptional coactivator for many genes induced during skeletal differentiation and binds directly to the myogen to regulate H3 methylation, allowing myogen expression and myotube differentiation.

**Conclusion:** Our study identifies a novel isoform of histone demethylase JM2, Δ-J2, essential for muscle differentiation through histone H demethylation at the myogen promoter. Δ2 regulates histone H3 methylation and acetylation at muscle-specific promoters, such as the myogen, during differentiation. The mechanism of H3 demethylation at the myogen promoter has been unclear, but we show Δ2 binds to the myogen at onset, promoting demethylation of H3me and H3. Our findings highlight the importance of Δ2 in muscle differentiation and its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention in muscle-related diseases.

**Title:** Economic Evaluation of the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP): A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Final Stages of Eradication

**Research Question:** What is the cost-effectiveness of the Guinea Worm Erad Programme (GW) in the final stages of eradication, when the number of cases is low and the cost per case is high?

**Methods:** We conducted a cost-effect analysis of the GWEP using data from 1986-203, estimating the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages. We compared the GWEP to two scenarios: doing nothing (no intervention since 1986) and control (only surveillance and outbreak response 201-203). We calculated the cost per case averted, disability-adjusted life year (DAL) averted, and cost at-risk year averted.

**Findings:** The GWEP cost an estimated $11.95 (95% uncertainty interval, 4.70-12.49) per case averted in 198-203. The pre-certification and certification phases cost as much as $0.004 and $0.001 per capita per year. The per DAL averted by GW relative to doing nothing is estimated $222 (118-372) in 198-203. GW is more cost-effective than control by 203. GW is certainly cost-effective if willing to pay one year life without risk GWD exceeds $0.10. Even if costs are twice as high as financial estimated for 202, GW still cost-effective relative doing.

**Implications:** The GWEP is in final stages of eradication, with only 25 cases reported in 2016. Global eradication requires certification by WHO of absence in all countries. Our study is the first economic evaluation of GW since World Bank 1997. GW is more cost-effective than control in terms of DAL averted and cost-risk yearverted. GW certainly cost-effective if willing to pay one life without risk GWD exceeds $0.10. Even if costs are twice as high as financial for 202, GW still cost-effective relative doing. Whether GW most cost-effective beyond 201 depends on time horizon.

**Conclusion:** The Guinea Worm Erad Programme is a cost-effective in the final stages of eradication, with a cost of $11.95 per case averted in 198-203. The pre-certification and certification phases cost as much as $0.004 and $0.001 per capita year. GW is more cost-effective control by 203 and certainly cost-effective if willing to pay one life without risk GWD $0.10. Even if costs are twice as high as financial for 202, GW still cost relative doing.

**Title:** Investigating the Function of BB32 Orthologs from Lyme Disease-Associated Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato: Insights into Complement Inhibition and Evasion Mechanisms**

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the function of BB32 orthologs from Lyme disease-associated Borrelia burgorferi sensu lato, specifically B. afii BAD16 and B. garii BGD, and their ability to inhibit the serine protease of the classical complement pathway, C1.

**Methods:** Recombinant proteins B. afii BAD-C and B.ii BGD-C were expressed and purified, and their binding affinity to C1 protease and C1 complex was assessed. In vitro complement inhibitory activities were evaluated using serum killing assays. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to convert BB32 to resemble BGD at three residues. The crystal structure of BB32 was solved to 1.7 Å resolution.

**Findings:** B. afii BAD-C exhibited BB32-like activities in all assays, including high-affinity binding to C1 protease and C complex and potent inhibition of the classical pathway. Recombinant B.ii-C bound C1 and C with high-affinity, yet exhibited reduced in vitro inhibitory activities relative to BB-C or BAD-C. Interestingly, BGD weakly recognized C1 relative to BB and BAD, and unlike these proteins, GD did not confer significant protection from serum killing. Site-directed mutagenesis resulted in a chimeric protein, BX32, which mimicked properties of GD-C. The crystal structure of BB revealed an anti-parallel four-helix fold with a fifthelix protruding from the helical core, with three targeted residues surface-exposed, supporting C1 binding and inhibition.

**Implications:** The structure-function studies improve understanding of BB recognition and inhibition of C1 and provide insight into complement evasion mechanisms of Lyme-associated spiroches of B. burgorferi sens lato. The serine prote (SP) domain of C1 is required for BB32/C1 complex formation, suggesting unique classical pathway properties of BB32. BB-mediated complement activity is shared across major Lyme-associated spches.

**Conclusions:** BB32 and its orthologs block human complement, highlighting the need to determine if BB-like pathway inhibition is restricted to Lyme spches or common to all pathogenic Boria. BB32, as well as orthologs, have disparate functions within vertebrate hosts. The arsenal of borial inhibitors includes surface-expressed lipoprotein BB32, the lone and characterized classical-specific pathway inhibitor. The classical pathway is controlled by C1, a multi-protein complex of Cq bound to heterotetramer of serine proteases Cr and Cs.

**Research Question:** How does the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans undergo morphological and transcriptional adaptation from commensalism to pathogenicity, and what are the regulatory factors involved in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated morphogenetic control by post-translational phosphorylation, focusing on the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28, and identified the Fkh transcription factor as a regulatory target of Cdc and the wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk. We used 2D gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and mutational analyses to study the phosphorylation of F2 and its role in the switch from commal to pathity.

**Findings:** We found a diverse pool of F2 phosphoisoforms in stationary yeast cells, which transformed to a hyal profile before START in the cell cycle. This transformation did not occur when stationary cells were reinoculated into fresh medium supporting growth. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified residues phosphorylated by C28 and C1. Substitution of these residues with non-phosphlatable alanine altered the phosphorylation and abrogated the hyal profile. Transcript profiling the phosphorylation mutant revealed the hyal profile required expression of genes in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation.

**Implications:** These changes in gene expression resulted in corresponding defects in pathogenic processes. We also identified F2 interacts with chromatin modifier Pob in phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a mechanism for phosphorylation F2 regulates specificity.

**Conclusions:** We discovered a cell-independent phospho-regulatory event that subverts a component of cycle machinery to role in switch commal to pathity. Upon hyal induction, F2 undergoes a radical shift in phosphorylation mediated by kinases C28-C1/C3 and C1-M2, activating F2 to promote expression of genes for path processes in addition to normal housekeeping. The complex phosphorylation profile of F2 in growing and stationary yeast cells undergoes a transient transformation upon hyal, with F2 phosphorylated sites corresponding to C28 consensus sites. Our results provide novel insights into the regulation of F2 and its role in pathogenic processes, highlighting the importance of phosphorylation in the switch from comm to path.

**Title:** Essential Role of Thymidine Kinase in Pyrimidine Biosynthesis in the Human Pathogenic Parasite Trypanosoma brucei

**Research Question:** What is the role of thymidine kinase (TK) in pyrim biosynthesis in the human pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma bruce, and how does it contribute to the parasite's growth and infectivity in a mouse model?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the pyrim salvage and de novo pathways in Trypanosoma bruce using conditional and RNA interference (RNAi) cells, as well as metabolite profiling by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS).

**Findings:** Our results show that TK is essential for growth and infectivity in a mouse model, and catalytically active enzyme is required for its function. Unlike humans, T. bruce and other kinetoplastids lack dCMP deaminase (DD), which provides an alternative route to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DD resulted in rescue of RNA growth phenotype and allowed selection of viable null cells. Metabolite profiling revealed buildup of deoxypyrim nucleides in TK depleted cells. Knock of cytidine deaminase (DA), which converts deoxycidine to deuridine, led to thym/deuridine auxrophy. Unexpectedly, results suggested T. bruce encodes an unidentified 5-nucleidase that converts deypyrim nucleides to their corresponding nucleos, leading to buildup in TK depleted cells at expense dTP pools.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that TK is essential for synthesis thym nucleides regardless of nucleos precursors from de novo or salvage. Reliance TK in absence DD may be shared among tryosomatids, providing a unique opportunity to target pathogenic single-celled eukotes with single drug.

**Conclusions:** TK plays a critical role in pyrim biosynthesis in T. bruce, and its mechanistic role supporting de novo pyrim biosynthesis has uncovered a potential for pantryosid therapy. Unexpected buildup of deypy nucleides in TK depleted cells suggests an undiscovered biosynthetic route formation deypy nucleides present in T bruce.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Translation Initiation in the Absence of a Ribosome Binding Site: A Genome-Wide Analysis and Experimental Evidence for Local Unfoldedness as a Requirement for Start Codon Recognition**

**Research Question:** How do prokaryotic mRNAs lacking Shine-Darn sequences initiate translation, and what elements or motifs mediate this process?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide search in various proary groups to identify sequence and structural motifs that facilitate translation initiation in mRNAs without Shine-Darn sequences. Additionally, we used reporter constructs in bacteria to experimentally test the role of local RNA structure in Shine-Darn-dependent translation.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed that mRNAs without Shinearn sequences exhibit less secondary structure in their initiation region and a minimum folding at the start codon. Reporter constructs showed that local unfoldedness determines start cod recognition in Shinearn-dependent translation. Furthermore, we found that AUG codons reside in single-stranded regions, whereas internal codons are in structured regions of mRNA.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that absence of secondary structure is necessary and sufficient for Shinearn-dependent translation initiation, providing a plausible mechanism for correct start site recognition in the absence of ribosome site.

**Conclusion:** This study addresses the long-standing question of specific cod recognition and efficient initiation in the absence of ribosome site. Genome-wide searches in proary and organellar genomes revealed a significant fraction of transcripts are translated Shinearn-independently, varying between 15% in γ-proteobacteria to 100% in mitochondria. Bioinformatics and experimental data support unfoldedness as major factor for start recognition in SD-independent initiation. We found no evidence for alternative motifs or structural requirements, but mRN lacking Shinearn exhibit minimum structure at translational start, suggesting cod accessibility key in SD translation.

**Title:** Incidence of Post-Kala-Azar Dermal Leishiasis (PKDL) in Patients Treated with Liposomal Amphotericin B (Ambis) in Bihar, India: A Retrospective Cohort Study

**Research Question:** What is the incidence of post-Kala-azar dermalishias (PKDL) in patients treated with liposomal amphotin B (Amb) in Bihar, India, and are there any risk factors associated with its development?

**Methods:** Between July 2007 and August 2012, 874 patients with laboratory-confirmed visceral leishmanias (VL) received 20 mg/kg intravenous liposomal amphotin B (Amb) as first-line treatment in a Méins Frontières (MSF) supported programme in Bihar, India. All patients received health education on PK symptoms and were advised to return to the programme if symptoms developed. This is a retrospective cohort study of outcomes of 831 patients completing treatment for their first episode of VL.

**Findings:** 24 (2.9%) of 831 patients returned with symptoms confirmed PKDL, diagnosed by clinical history, appearance, and slit-skin examination. 89% had macular lesions, with median time to development of 1.2 (0.8-2.2) years following treatment. Comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics of VL patients who developed PKDL with those who did not did not identify significant risk factors. However, time to developing PKDL was shorter with Ambis in a subset of patients presenting with PK following sodium stibgluconate treatment for VL.

**Implications:** In this large cohort of VL patients in Bihar treated with 20/kg Amb, PKDL appears infrequent with no predictive factors. Shorter time to developing PK compared to conventional treatments should be considered when counseling patients with regimens including Ambis.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the possibility of PK development following treatment with 20/kg liposomal amphotin B (Amb) in the Indian context, with a proportion as high as 2.9. This has been shown to be 60 in Sudan, although presentation and characteristics are different. Little is known about the cause, risk, and pathogenesis of PK, although host factors, in vivoization of parasites, and possibility PK drug-related have been considered.

**Title:** Elucidating the Dynamics of Reinfestation of Triatoma infans, the Vector of Chagas Disease, through Continuous and Discrete-Time Models: Implications for Vector Control

**Research Question:** Understanding the reinfestation dynamics of Triatoma infans, the primary vector of Chagas disease, is crucial for effective vector control. Despite community-wide insecticide spraying, vectors have resurged in some areas. This study aims to elucidate the factors influencing re-establishment of T. infans in three villages in northwest Argentina.

**Methods:** Discrete and continuous-time Markov models for site-level transitions from uninfested to infested and vice versa were fitted to spatiemporal population data of T. infans. Both models revealed strong seasonality in bug establishment, coinciding with seasonality in dispersal distance.

**Findings:**

1.  A 6-month lag between detection of new infestation and dispersal events was confirmed.
2. More bug populations established from May to November than from November to May, coinciding with an increase in dispersal distance.
3. The probability of bug establishment increased with time since last infestation in the fitted models.

**Implications:** These findings challenge current understanding of T. infans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge. Experiments are necessary to close these gaps.

**Conclusions:** This study addresses three aspects of T. infans control not previously addressed: (i) establishment rate of new populations as a function of distance from existing, (ii) mechanisms for seasonality in establishment, and (iii) effect of insecticide and infestation on rates. Continuous models estimate within-season dynamics and time-dependent effects of spraying, but require assumptions about disperser sources. The contribution of each site to establishment was estimated by linear interpolation between number of bugs at source and t and t+1. To optimize vector control, understanding seasonality of dispersal intensity and distance is crucial, not just duration of tethered flight.

**Title:** Investigating the Effects of Polyomavirus SV40 MicroRNA on the Pathogenesis of Viral Infections in Vivo: A Study in Syrian Hamsters as a Model

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the effects of SV40 microRNA on the pathogenesis of viral infections in vivo using Syrian hamsters as a model.

**Methods:** Outbred young adult hamsters were inoculated intracardially with 1×10^7 plaque-forming units of four variants of SV40. Infected animals were sacrificed from 3 to 270 days post-infection, and viral loads in different tissues were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain assays.

**Findings:** All SV strains displayed persistent infections with slow clearance. SV had broad tissue tropism, infecting liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain. Liver and kidney contained higher viral loads than other tissues; kidneys were the preferred site for long-term infection. Expression of SV microRNA was demonstrated in wild-type SV-infected tissues. Micro-negative viruses produced higher DNA loads than wild-type SV in liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regions displayed modestly higher loads in kidney than those with simple regions. Early transcripts were detected higher than late in liver and kidney. Infectious was infrequently detected.

**Implications:** This study identified tissue tropism for SV40 in vivo in hamsters and provided first evidence of expression and function of SV microRNA in vivo. Micro dampened viral loads in infected tissues by SV strains with simple or complex regions.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrated for the first time that SV miRNAs are expressed and functional in vivo in hamsters. We showed SV has broad tropism, tissues supporting DNA replication (kidney, liver, spleen, lung, brain), and kidneys major for long-term persistence with liver secondary site. One role of miRNA appears to reduce loads in infected tissues.

**Title:** Comprehensive Genome-Wide Analysis of Positively Selected Genes in Mammals Reveals Insights into Evolutionary Dynamics and Functional Implications

**Research Question:** What are the dynamics of genome-wide positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals, and how do they contribute to the genetic differences between species and functions of individual genes?

**Methods:** We conducted the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date using six high-coverage genome assemblies of eutherian mammals, increasing phylogenetic depth and statistical power. We applied lineage and clade-specific tests to identify ~16,500 genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two species, 400 showing significant evidence of positive selection (FDR < 0.05) by standard likelihood test. Additional 144 genes showed positive selection on lineages/clades.

**Findings:** PSGs were enriched in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but also in specific functions such as complement-mediated immunity and taste. Several pathways were strongly enriched, suggesting co-evolution of interacting genes. Bayesian analysis indicated PSGs switched multiple times between selection/non-selection, positive often episodic. Affymetrix exon array data showed PSGs expressed lower, more tissue-specific than non-PSGs. Genes in spleen, testes, liver, breast enriched PSGs, no brain-specific.

**Implications:** This study provides evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and genome-wide insights into functional implications of positive selection.

**Conclusions:**

1. Our comprehensive analysis of mammalian PSGs reveals new insights into evolutionary dynamics, genetic differences between species, and functions individual genes.
2. PSGs are enriched in defense, chemosensory, reproduction, but also specific functions such as complement immunity, taste.
3. Co-evolution of interacting genes suggested by enriched pathways.
4. PSGs have multiple selection histories, often episodic.
5. PSGs expressed lower, more tissue-specific than non-PS.
6. Genes in sple, test, liver, breast enriched PSG, no brain-specific.

**Significance:** This study contributes to understanding mammalian evolution, functional implications of positive selection.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Phenol Soluble Modulins in Staphylococcus aureus Biofilm Integrity: A Novel Amyloid Fibers Promote Biofilm Stability

**Research Question:** How do phenol soluble modulins (PSM) contribute to the formation and stability of Staphylococcus aureus biofilms?

**Methods:** We employed biochemical and genetic analysis to investigate the composition and function of extracellular fibers in S. aureus biofilms. Purification and characterization of fibers revealed the presence of amyloid-like structures composed of PSM peptides. Mutants unable to produce PSM were susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix-degrading enzymes and mechanical stress.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that S. aureus produces amyloid fibers under certain growth conditions, contributing to biofilm integrity. PSM aggregation into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity in biofilms, whereas soluble P peptides disperse biofilms while polymerized peptides do not. This contrasts previous work associating PSM with biofilm disassembly.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest PSM modulate biofilm assembly using amyloid aggregation as a control point for activity. This is the first report characterizing extracellular fibers in S. aureus. We propose that amyloid formation regulates P activity in the biofilm environment.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies novel extracellular amyloid fibers in S. aureus biofilms, composed of PSM peptides. Amyloid aggregation abrogates bioassembly activity of monomeric P peptides. Our results implicate fibril formation as a means of altering P activity and function in biofilms. PSM, first isolated from Staphlococcus epidermis, have been shown to interact biochemically. We demonstrate synthetic S aureus P peptides self-assemble into amyloid fibers in vitro, exhibiting CR and Th binding capacities similar amyloid proteins.

**Title:** Development of a Novel Antibody Profiling Assay for Monitoring Trypanosoma cruzi Persistence in Chagas Patients

**Background:** Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), affects over 6 million individuals worldwide, primarily in Latin America. Monitoring parasite persistence in infected individuals is crucial for evaluating treatment efficacy and disease control. Current serological assays and PCR testing have limitations due to fluctuating parasitic loads in blood.

**Research Question:** Can a newly developed antibody profiling assay indirectly assess parasite persistence based on waning antibodies following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of infection?

**Methods:** We designed a multiplex serology assay with 15 optimized T. cruzi antigens to evaluate antibody diversity in 165 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. One antibody (Ab3) showed strong correlation with T. cruzi persistence determined by PCR results.

**Findings:** High Ab3 was strongly associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, while significant decline in Ab signals observed in BZ-treated patients cleared parasitemia by PCR. Ab3 is a new biomarker strongly correlating parasite persistence in chronic benidazole-treated Chagas. We hypothesize Ab3 induced by incessant immune stimulation by tissue-based parasites undetectable by blood PCR.

**Implications:** A simple immunoass measurement of Ab3 could monitor infectious status seropositive patients.

**Conclusion:** This study characterizes serological profiles of T. cruz-infected patients using an extended MultiCruz assay. By measuring diversity, we identified Ab3 as a surrogate biomarker sensitive for parasite persistence regardless of PCR results. Innovative multi-parametric screening identified Ab that can monitor persistence. Epitope-mapping analyzed antibody response against 15 T. cruzi antigens in a large sample, documenting changes associated with therapy. Ab3 induced high in T cruz serositive, superior for persistence/clearance compared to PCR, and outperforms standardology to monitor clearance.

**Title:** Identifying the Cellular Reservoirs of Chronic Chikunya Virus (CHV) Infection: A Novel Insights from a Recombinant CHV Reporter System

**Research Question:** What cells contribute to the persistence of Chikunya virus (CHV) infection in the musculoskeletal tissues of patients, leading to chronic arthritis and musculoskeletal pain?

**Methods:** We developed a recombinant CHV (CH-3-C) that expresses Cre recombinase and a tdTomato reporter, allowing us to identify and track infected cells in vivo. CH-3-C replicated in myoblast and fibroblasts, inducing acute arthritis in mice and chronic disease, including persistent viral RNA and myitis and synovitis. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis revealed that tdato+ cells were predominantly myofib and dermal muscle fibrobl.

**Findings:** CH-3-C infection of tdato mice resulted in a population of tdato+ cells that persisted for at least 112 days. Treatment with an antibody against Mra, a defined receptor for CHV, reduced the number of td+ cells in the chronic phase and diminished levels of viral RNA, implicating td+ cells as the reservoir of chronic viral RNA. Isolation and flowometry sorting of td+ fibbl from the skin and ankle and analysis for RNA revealed that td+ cells harbor most of persistent CHV RNA at chronic points.

**Implications:** Our CH-3-C and tdato system identifies cells that survive CHV infection in vivo and are enriched for persistent CHV RNA. This model represents a useful tool for studying CHV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease.

**Conclusion:** CHV causes debilitating disease with chronic arthralgia and myia in substantial patients, but the mechanism of chronic pathogenesis is unclear. Our study reveals that musculos cells are targets of CHV infection in both acute and chronic stages, and that fibrobl that survive CHV infection harbor persistent CHV RNA. Further research is needed to elucidate how these cells contribute to pathogenesis.

**Title:** Investigating the Generalizability of Dimensionality Reduction Methods to Large-Scale Neural Recordings and Network Structure

**Research Question:** How do dimensionality reduction methods, such as factor analysis (FA) and principal component analysis (PCA), generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials, and how do these results relate to the underlying network structure of neural activity in the visual cortex of non-human primates?

**Methods:** We applied FA to in vivo recordings from the visual cortex of anesthetized macaques and spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling of two key outputs of dimension reduction: shared dimensionality and shared variance with neuron count.

**Findings:** We found that the properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and in vivo recordings were consistent with the clustered network. Recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network.

**Implications:** These findings can guide the interpretation of dimension reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial and sampling, and relate these outputs to the underlying structure. Shared variability among simultaneously-recorded neurons has been widely studied due to its implications for the amount of information encoded by a population of neurons.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest that FA provides a more nuanced characterization of single-trial activity than PCA, and that recordings from tens of neurons are sufficient to identify dominant modes of variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings have implications for the interpretation of dimension reduction methods in regimes of limited neuron and trial and sampling, and relate these outputs to the underlying structure of neural activity in the visual cortex of non-human primates.

**Title:** Modulation of Host Immune Responses by Pseudomonas aeruginosa-Regulated 2-Aminoacetophen (2-AA) Facilitates Pathogen Persistence

**Research Question:** Do Pseudomonas aeruginosa-regulated quorum sensing (QS) molecules modulate host immune responses to facilitate pathogen persistence?

**Methods:** We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of 2-aminoacetophen (2-AA), a QS-regulated molecule produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, on host immune responses during infection.

**Findings:** Mice treated with 2-AA prior to infection exhibited a 90% survival rate compared to 10% survival in non-pretreated mice. 2-AA activated key innate immune pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κ), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but attenuated immune response upon pretreatment, likely by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment was characterized by transcriptional regulation of c-JN-terminal (JNK) and NF-κ activation, with preserved extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activation, leading to CA/enhancer protein-β (c/EBβ) activation and c/EBβ-p65 complex formation, preventing NFκ activation.

**Implications:** 2's ability to dampen inflammatory processes while increasing host survival and path persistence concurs with its ability to signal bacteria to switch to chronic infection mode. Our results reveal a QS immunomulatory signal promoting aspects of interking communication, facilitating pathogen persistence while enabling host tolerance to infection.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the contribution of low-molecular QS molecule 2 in modulation of mammalian-immune signaling, the first to show Pseudomonas molecule modulating responses. Unlike other QS molecules promoting virulence, 2 minimizes immune activation and increases survival, permitting long-term presence of pathogen in vivo. Cytokine profiling suggests 2 pretreatment limits inflammation by dampening pro-inflammatory activation.

**Title:** The Evolutionary Origins and Functions of the Domesticated Retroelement L1 (LTD1) Gene in Mammalian Genomes

**Research Question:** How did the domesticated retroelement L1 (LTD) gene originate and evolve in mammalian genomes, and what are its functional roles in different lineages?

**Methods:** We investigated the evolutionary history and selective pressures of the L1 gene in mammals, tracing its origin to the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, and analyzing its conservation and loss in various lineages.

**Findings:** L1 originated in the common ancestor of euther mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. L1 evolved under positive selection in primate and mouse, and prosian L1 enriched itself with a recent L ORF from the prosian genome, suggesting recurrent selection for novelty, possibly in genome defense. L1 loss is associated with L extinction in several megab lineages, but not in sigmodine rodents.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the role of retroelement domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology and that domesticated genes can adopt different functions in lineages. L1 could have evolved for genome defense against L elements, later incorporated into pluripotency in some line.

**Conclusions:** The bipartite double-ORF organization of L1 has been conserved since its birth, and its origin dates to at least 106 million years ago, making it more ancient than well-known domesticated retrogenes syncin and F1. L1 function parallel the role of domesticated gene F1 in defense against its progenitor. We hypothesize that idiosratic, divergent L insertion patterns in mammalian genomes explain retention of L1 in mammals without active L and role in plurotency L1 plays in humans.

**Title:** The Essential Role of Ybe, a Highly Conserved RNase, in Vibrio cholera Pathogenesis and Stress Regulation

**Research Question:** What is the role of Ybe, a highly conserved RNase, in Vibrio cholera pathogenesis and stress regulation?

**Methods:** We analyzed the rRNA and ribosome profiles of a Vibrio cholera strain partially depleted for Ybe and other RNases associated with 16 rRNA processing, and demonstrated that Ybe is crucial for 16 rRNA 3 end maturation and subunit assembly into 70 ribosomes. We also examined the importance of Y to Vibrio cholera pathogenesis by assessing colonization, biofilm formation, cholera toxin production, and expression of virulence-associated RNAs.

**Findings:** Our results show that Ybe is an endoribuclease in Vibrio cholera, essential for virulence regulation, stress, RNA processing, and ribosome quality control, and part of a core set of RNases in representative pathogens. Y is crucial for 16 rRNA 3 end maturation in Vibrio and its depletion impedes subunit assembly into 70 ribosomes. Y's importance to Vibrio pathogenesis was demonstrated by complete loss of colonization, biofilm formation, reduced cholera toxin production, and altered expression of virulence RNAs. Notably, Y genes of distantly related pathogens can complement Escherichia coli ΔY strain under stress, demonstrating high conservation of Y's activity in regulation.

**Implications:** This study provides the first comprehensive exploration of Y's physiological role in human pathogen, showing conserved function across species in essential processes.

**Conclusions:** Y, a highly conserved RNase, plays a critical role in Vibrio pathogenesis and stress regulation. Y is essential for 16RNA 3 end maturation and subunit assembly into 70 ribosomes, and is part of a core set of RNases in representative pathogens. Y's importance to Vib pathogenesis was demonstrated by loss of colonization, biofilm, reduced toxin production, and altered expression of virulence RN. The conservation of Y's function across species highlights its essential role in cellular processes.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Assortativity in Transcription Factor Networks in Gene Expression Robustness

**Research Question:** How does the assortativity of transcription factor (TF) networks (TFNs) contribute to the robustness of gene expression phenotypes to genetic and environmental perturbations?

**Methods:** We employed publicly available DNase-seq data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 human cell and tissue types, revealing a shared assortativity signature that confers phenotypic robustness to TFNs.

**Findings:** Our results show that all TFNs share a common assortativity signature, which contributes to phenotypic robustness, and determine the extent to which each of the four components of assortativity contributes to this robustness.

**Implications:** Theoretical studies suggest that increasing one component of TF's assortativity leads to increased phenotypic robustness, but the biological context of this finding is limited due to the lack of characterization of real-world TFNs' assortativity. Our study provides evidence that assortativity is a structural source of robustness in biological networks, and human TFs share an assortativity signature that confers robustness.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that in addition to topological properties, considering the components of assortativity is informative in advancing the understanding of networked systems. Theoretical models with increased assortativity exhibit robustness to cis-regulatory mutations and gene duplication, due to reduced nested subgraph size and increased regulatory links between TFs. Our study highlights the importance of considering assortativity in computational models of spatiemporal transcriptional regulation and sensitivity to environmental and genetic perturbations.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Inhibitory and Excitatory Neurons in Encoding Stimulus-Related Information in the Neocortex

**Research Question:** How do populations of inhibitory (IN) and excitatory (EX) neurons collectively encode stimulus-related information in the neocortex?

**Methods:** We employed large-scale multi-electrode arrays (up to 128 channels) to record the activity of ensembles (up to 74 neurons) distributed across layers 3-4 of anesthetized rat somatosensory barrel cortex in vivo. Two whisker modalities (location and frequency) were used to stimulate the cortex.

**Findings:** Individual IN neurons, classified by distinct extracellular waveforms, outperformed EX neurons in granular and infra-granular layers in discriminating between 6 stimulus classes. Ensembles of IN cells conveyed as much information as those containing ~20% most informative EX neurons, with less redundancy.

**Implications:** A consortium of IN neurons dominates information conveyed to the neocort network, efficiently processing sensory activity. This extends our understanding of the inhibitory system's role in orchestrating cortical activity.

**Results:**

* Higher stimulus-related information in individual IN neurons compared to EX counterparts in gran and infra-gran layers, suggesting sharper temporally-precise responses.
* IN ensembles showed lower redundancy compared to those containing best EX cells.
* High stimulus information in IN cells at both modalities (location and frequency) indicates barrel interneurons may be sharper than principal neurons.
* IN convey more information than EX due to (1) higher spikes, (2) precision, and (3) lower adaptation at frequency.

**Conclusions:**

Our findings suggest that IN neurons play a crucial role in encoding stimulus-related information in the neocortex. IN ensembles convey more information with less redundancy, indicating a more efficient processing of sensory activity. This challenges the traditional view of EX neurons as the primary information carriers, highlighting the importance of IN in orchestrating cortical activity.

**Title:** Engineering a Novel Arithmetic Logic Circuit in Living Cells using Regulatory RNAs for Synthetic Biology Applications

**Research Question:** Can regulatory RNAs be engineered to perform complex computations in living cells, paving the way for the development of more sophisticated RNA-based biocomputers?

**Methods:** We designed and implemented a genetic circuit in Escheria coli that computes the sum of two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations of IPTG and aT signals, reporting the result as fluorescence amplit. The system exploits post-transcriptional control with small RNAs and alloster transcription factors to sense molecular signals.

**Findings:** Our circuit robustly performs the intended computation, encoding the result as fluorescence amplit, demonstrating that regulatory RNAs can be key players in synthetic biology. This achievement paves the way for engineering more complex RNA-based biocomputers using this circuit as a building block.

**Implications:** This work advances the sophistication of designer systems in RNA biology, enabling combinator logic, cascades, feed-forward loops, and pulse, and counters. Unlike previous genetic adders, our design does not duplicate the reporter gene, making it more organized and scalable. The genetic footprint of our circuit was greatly reduced using regulatory RN, compared to circuits implemented with transcription factors (TFs).

**Conclusions:** Regulatory RNAs have emerged as ideal substrates for engineering gene expression in vivo due to their versatility and designability at the nucleotide level. Examples include novel mechanisms of expression through modulation with non-coding RN and chimeric molecules. Our work highlights the potential of RN in synthetic biology, offering an alternative to protein-based regulation, which is limited in number and prone to orthogonality with host machinery. Directed evolution and automation of TFs, and de novo design are being explored, but alternatives are required. Our circuit demonstrates the feasibility of RNA-based biocomput, opening new avenues for applications in synthetic biology.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Cytolic 5'-nucleotidase II (N) in Cancer Therapy Resistance: Design of Phosphon Analogues as Competitive Inhibitors

**Research Question:** To investigate the role of Cyt 5'-ucleidase II (N) in cancer resistance to cytotoxic nucleide analogues and design phosphon analogues as competitive inhibitors.

**Methods:** A class of ribonucleide phosphates with chemically and enzymatically stable phosphorus-car linkage was synthesized and screened for their potential as C-II inhibitors. Among 34 analogues, six showed higher affinity than the natural substrate, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP).

**Findings:** Study of purine and pyrimidine analogues with modifications in the phosphon chain revealed rules governing ligand affinity. Docking predictions were confirmed by experimental measurements of nucleotase activity in the presence of best phosphon analogues, inducing total inhibition at 2mM.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of non-hydrolysable phosphon bond in designing competitive C-II inhibitors and hydrophobic stacking by three residues Phe157, His209, and Tyr210.

**Conclusions:** Phosphon analogs, mimicking nucleide 5'-monophates, represent a class of potent C-II inhibitors. Modification of the phosphate chain is a suitable strategy for designing new C-II inhibitors. The presence of chemically stable phosphon group significantly inhibits C-II activity.

**Title:** Detection of Prion Infectivity in Colostrum and Milk from Sheep Incubating Scrapie: Implications for Animal and Human Health

**Research Question:** Can prion infectivity be detected in colostrum and milk from sheep incubating scrapie, and what are the implications for animal and human health?

**Methods:** We investigated the presence of prion infectivity in colostr and milk from sheep with natural scrapie, using immunohistochemistry, PET, and bioassay. We analyzed lactal ducts, mammary glands, and milk fractions (cellular, casein whey, and cream) for PrSc accumulation and infectivity.

**Findings:** PrSc was detected in lactal ducts and mam glands of scrap-affected ewes, associated with mammary ectopic lymph follicles due to Ma lentivirus infection. Bioassay revealed prion infect in milk and colostr from ewes with lymphoproliferative mastitis and those with lesion-free mam glands. Infectivity was present in cellular, casein whey, and cream fractions. Using a Tg 338 mouse model, the highest infectious titre was equivalent to 6g of posterior brain from terminally scrap-affected ewe.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that colostr and milk from ruminants incubating T could contribute to T transmission, either directly or through milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs. This raises concerns for human T exposure risk associated with ovine and T-susceptible dairy products.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides definitive evidence of prion infectivity in colostr and milk from sheep incubating scrapie, months before clinical onset. Pr accumulation was detected in lact ducts, glands, and milk fractions. Infectivity was present in ewes with lymphoproliferative mastitis and those with lesion-free glands.

**Title:** Epidemiological Analysis of the 2014-2015 Ebola Outbreak in Liberia: Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Confirmed and Suspected Cases

**Research Question:** What were the demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed and suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases during the 2014-2015 outbreak in Liberia, and how did these factors influence the case fatality rate?

**Methods:** We analyzed 16,370 laboratory samples collected between April 4, 2014 and March 29, 2015, and identified 10,536 individuals, of whom 3,897 were confirmed positive for Ebola RNA. Demographic and clinical information were systematically collected through EVD laboratories.

**Findings:** Significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence were observed between confirmed and suspected cases tested negative for Ebola RNA. Young children and elderly and rural residents were at higher risk of death. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period.

**Implications:** These findings support future investigations and understanding of the outbreak in Liberia. Surveillance and reporting malfunctioned during the outbreak, resulting in inadequate data management, including missing and duplicate data.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to the understanding of the 2014-201 Ebola outbreak in Liberia, highlighting demographic and clinical characteristics of confirmed and suspected cases, which may inform future investigations and public health responses.

**Title:** Elucidating the Catalytic Mechanism of Tyrosinase: A Copper-Containing Monooxygenase through High-Resolution Cryo-Crystallography and Spectroscopic Analyses

**Research Question:** Despite extensive studies on tyrosase, a copper-containing monooxygen, the catalytic mechanism remains unclear at the atomic level. This study aims to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of tyrosase through high-resolution cryo-crystallography and spectroscopic analyses.

**Methods:** Cryo-crystal structures of tyrosase were determined at resolutions 1.16-1.70 Å, revealing a previously unknown step in the reaction: hydroxylation triggered by movement of CuA, inducing syn-anti rearrangement of copper ligands after μ2:2-pero-dopper (II) formation. UV-vis and Raman spectroscopic analyses confirmed Tyr residue conversion to quin through μ2:2-per-dopper (II) and Cu-dasiquin intermediates.

**Findings:** Movement of CuA to Cu-3 occurs prior to hydroxylation, suggesting Cu-3 as functional site, not artifact occupied only in product state. Binding of cie Tyr residue differs from genuine substrate. Proposed catalytic mechanism involves oxidation of copper and protonation triggering intermediates generation.

**Implications:** This study provides chemically reasonable atomistic postulate of tyrosase mechanism toward cie Tyr residue, preference determined by copper oxidation and proton state. Binding of cie residue may differ from genuine substrate.

**Conclusions:** High-resolution cry-crystallography and spectroscopic analyses reveal novel step in tyase reaction: hydroxy triggered by Cu movement, syn-anti rearrangement of copper ligands. Proposed mechanism involves oxidation and protonation triggering intermediates. This study contributes to understanding tyase catalytic mechanism, a copper-containing monxygen.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Dbp Helicase and Npa Complex in the Maturation of the 60S Ribosomal Subunit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

**Research Question:** The maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit in eukaryotes is a complex process that remains poorly understood, particularly the early stages. The first precursor to the 60S subunit, the pre-60 particle, contains 30 assembly factors (AFs), including the Dbp helicase, which drives conformational rearrangements. However, the mechanisms by which Db helic is targeted to the pre-ribosomal particles and its precise role remain unknown.

**Methods:** We investigated the association of Dbp helic with a complex of four AFs, Npa, Npa, Nop, and Rsa, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using tandem purifications of yeast extracts depleted of one component, we show Npa forms the backbone of the complex. We demonstrate that N and N directly bind Dbp and that N is essential for insertion of Db within 90 preribosomal particles.

**Findings:** By in vivo cross-linking (CR) analysis, we map Npa binding sites on 25 rRNA adjacent to the helices of the first and last secondary structure of 25 r. This supports the notion that N and Db function in formation/clustering of helices of subunit RNAs, creating the core of the ribosomal structure. N also cross-links to snoRNAs involved in decoding and peptid transfer modifications in the vicinity of binding sites on 25 r. Our data suggest Db hel and N complex play key roles in compaction of core 25 r and control sno-preRNA interactions.

**Implications:** The Db hel and N complex are essential for the maturation of the 60 ribosomal subunit, with N forming the backbone of the complex and facilitating the integration of Db within the initial 90 preribosomal particle. The absence of Db, the complex can form and associate with 90 prerib particles, but lacks enzymatic activity. We propose that the complex is necessary not only for stable integration of Db but also modulation of its enzymatic activities.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into the early stages of ribosome biogenesis in eukotes, highlighting the importance of Db and N in the formation of the 60 ribosomal subunit. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of ribosome biogenesis and the role of helicases in this process. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms of Db and N in the maturation of the 60 ribosomal sub.

**Title:** Adaptive Behavior in a Changing World: Unveiling the Role of Catecholamines in Learning Regulation

**Research Question:** How do environmental factors influence the rate of learning, and what brain mechanisms are involved in this process?

**Background:** Recent studies have examined the computational mechanisms underlying the impact of environmental factors on learning outcomes, but the brain mechanisms, particularly the neuromodulators involved, are largely unknown. Brain neurophysiological effects of catecholamines and dopamine on stimulus-evoked cortical responses suggest cateol systems are positioned to regulate learning, but direct evidence for a role is scant.

**Methods:** We employed pharmacology, scalp electrophysiology, and computational modeling (N=32) to investigate the role of cateolamines in learning regulation.

**Findings:** We found that the P3 component of EEG, an electrophysiological index of phasic cateolamine release in cortex, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of prediction-error magnitude on learning. P amplitude also mediated effects of two variables: capturing unexpectedness of outcome and uncertainty of pre-existing belief on learning. Pharmacological manipulation of cateamine activity affected learning following task changes, depending on baseline rate.

**Implications:** Our findings provide converging evidence for a role of cateol systems in learning regulation as a function of environmental change.

**Conclusions:** This research provides novel evidence for a role of cateol systems in learning regulation. Trial-to-trial variation in P amplitude, index phasic-evoked cateamine in cortex, mediated effect of prediction magnitude on learning, suggesting phasic cateamine response following surprising outcomes drives increases learning. The P is correlate phasic cateamine in cortex, supporting a role in incorporating unexpected into beliefs about environment. Absence of full mediation suggests additional effect on rate not mediated by P (see Discussion). We used correlational and pharmacological as independent approaches, providing converging regarding role cate in learning regulation.

**Title:** Implementation of EPIC, a Syndromic Surveillance System, in Rural Senegal: A Novel Approach to Infectious Disease Monitoring

**Research Question:** Can a homemade syndrom surveillance system, EPIC, be effectively implemented using data produced by Point-of-Care (POC) laboratories in rural Senegal to monitor infectious diseases?

**Methods:** From 2010 to 2016, two POC laboratories were established in rural Senegal. In parallel, a syndrom surveillance system, EPIC, was implemented to monitor infectious diseases using data produced by the P laboratory of the Tim hospital in Marseille, France. We aimed to describe the steps for implementing EPIC using data produced by two POC in rural Senegal. After improving EPIC, we monitored 15 pathogens routinely diagnosed in two P using the same methodology used in France.

**Findings:** Over 5 years, 2,577 de-duplicated patient-samples from 775 patients were tested in Diel and Ndi POC, with 739 deuplicated-samples found positive to at least one pathogen. Retrospective analysis of Diel anddi POC with EPIC generated 443 alarms. From January 2016, 316 de-duplicated-samples from 298 patients were processed in Niak P, with 56 de-samples positive to at least pathogen. Retrospective analysis Niak P with EPIC generated 14 alarms.

**Implications:** EPIC has successfully spread data produced by rural P in Senegal, West Africa, demonstrating scalability and versatility. Compared to other surveillance in Africa, EPIC's main asset is real-time monitoring of 27 tests for 15 pathogens (bacteria, viruses, parasites). Further improvements are needed to enhance EPIC network.

**Conclusions:** EPIC has successfully implemented in rural Senegal using P data. Initiatives like rural P are needed to improve global knowledge on infectious diseases. EPIC was first implemented in Tim hospital, France, to detect epidemiological events from routine P. Other systems have been developed to complete surveillance.

**Title:** Architecture-Dependent Collective Signaling in Endothelial Cells: A Mechanistic Insights into Calcium Oscillations and Contractility

**Research Question:** How do endothelial cells collectively respond to external stimuli, such as histamine, in diverse vascular structures, and what are the underlying mechanisms of intercellular signaling and functional implications?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of computational modeling and lithography to investigate the roles of endothelial cell arrangement in collective signaling and contractility under histamine stimulation. Endothelial cells self-assembled into microengineered networks, not individual monolayers, exhibited calcium oscillations. Pharmacological inhibition and modeling revealed that calcium oscillations depend on the number of neighboring cells via gap junction intercellular communication, providing a mechanistic basis for architecture-dependent signaling.

**Findings:** Histamine-induced calcium oscillations were confined to venules rather than capillaries, suggesting architecture dependence on response to histamine. Calcium oscillations attenuated hist-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and contraction, resulting in differential responses in architecture-dependent manner. Our results suggest endothelial cells sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to vascular architecture via collective signaling.

**Implications:** This study provides mechanistic insights into architecture-dependent calcium signaling in human umbil vein endothelial cells (HVEC). Histamine-induced signaling was monitored in individual cells, monolayers, self-assembled capillary networks, and lithography microengineered networks. Histamine (5μM) induced rapid followed slow cytosolic concentration increase in individual cells and monolayers. Hist-induced oscillations in networks compared individual cells monayers investigated architecture dependence. Micatter and pharmacological modeling elucidated effects number neighboring cells collective signaling. Experimental and models supported oscill occurrence negatively correlated number cells network. Hist mediates actin cytoskeleton, intercell gap formation, endothelial permeability, and dysfunction through calcium contraction.

**Conclusion:** This study elucidates architecture-dependent collective signaling in endothelial cells, providing mechanistic basis for calcium oscillations and contractility under histamine stimulation. Our results suggest endothelial cells sense and respond chemical stimuli according vascular architecture via collective signaling. This has implications for understanding diverse vascular structures and diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Antigenic Regions Outside the Conserved Domain in Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Specific Immunity

**Research Question:** What are the contributions of antigenic regions outside the conserved central domain (CCD) of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) G protein to the development of protective immunity against RSV disease?

**Methods:** We evaluated the immunogenicity, neutralization, and protective efficacy of RSV antigen sites outside the CCD using recombinant E. coli expressed ectomain (REG), CCD-deleted ectomain (REGCCD), N- and C-terminal subdomains, and antigen peptides in rabbits and mice.

**Findings:** REGCC, N, and C-terminal subdomains, and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound glycosylated Recombinant mammalian expressed ectomain (RM) and intact RSV particles, but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared to intact ectomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A Line 19. Viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was reduced in vaccinated animals compared to unimmun controls. Control viral loads post-R challenge correlated with serum binding to particles. Additionally, low Th2/Th cytokine ratios were found in lungs of REGCC vaccinated after challenge.

**Implications:** These data demonstrate the presence of multiple protective sites in RSV protein outside the CCD that contribute to the development of bacterially unglyated G protein as a safe and protective vaccine against R disease.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that antigen regions outside the conserved domain CCD of RSV G protein play a significant role in eliciting protective immunity against RSV. The REGCC, N, and C-terminal subdomains, and peptides generated antibodies that bound glycosylated RM and intact RSV particles, but showed minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared to intact ectomain. Vaccination with these regions resulted in reduced viral replication in lungs and nasal cavity, and correlated with serum binding to particles. Furthermore, low Th2/Th cytokine ratios were observed in lungs of REGCC vaccinated mice after challenge. These results highlight the importance of considering antigenic regions outside CCD for the development of effective RSV vaccine.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of RNA Processing in Target-Derived Signaling during Neuronal Specification in the Drosophila Ventral Nerve Cord

**Research Question:** How do RNA processing events contribute to the specification of neuronal identity in the Dophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) during embryonic development?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic and molecular approaches to investigate the role of RNA processing in the specification of the FMa neuropeptide neurons (Tv) in the VNC. Specifically, we used a FMa-GFP genetic screen to identify genes involved in Tv specification and found that two components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, b2 (72) and Pr8, play crucial roles in controlling FMa expression in Tv neurons.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that b2 and Pr8 control FMa expression in Tv neurons through two independent mechanisms: (1) axonal pathfinding to target tissue to receive BMP ligand and (2) proper splicing of genes in the BMP pathway, including tk and Medea. These findings highlight the involvement of RNA processing in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates a cell-specific role of b2 in controlling neuropeptide identity in Tv neurons, achieved through its role in three steps necessary for Tv specification: axon pathfinding, dim expression, and activation of BMP signaling. Notably, Tv neurons require target-derived retrograde signal mediated by BMP ligand to terminally differentiate and activate FMa gene, making FMa expression an excellent model for addressing molecular aspects of retrograde instructive signals during nervous development.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide new insights into the function of b2 and Pr8, previously known as ubiquitous components of the spliceosome, and highlight the importance of RNA processing in acquisition of neuronal fate. Specifically, we show that b2 regulates BMP signaling in Tv neurons at three points: axon pathfinding, expression, and splicing of tk and Medea. These results underscore the complex interplay between RNA processing and signaling in specification of neuronal identity in the CNS.

**Title:** Regulation of F-box Protein Abundance by a Novel Skp-Independent Pathway: Implications for Chromosome Stability and Stress Response

**Research Question:** How is the abundance of F-box proteins, a critical components of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, regulated, and what are the implications for chromosome stability and stress response?

**Methods:** We investigated the regulation of F-box proteins, specifically Met30, a substrate of the SCFMet ubiquitin ligase, in yeast. Using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, we identified a novel pathway for Met degradation that is independent of Skp, a central component of the SCF complex.

**Findings:** We found that Met degradation is mediated by the SC core components Cdc and Rbx, and the cognate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme C, in a process that does not require Skp. This pathway is critical for chromosome stability and defense against heavy metal stress.

**Implications:** Our results assign a new function to a subcomplex of cull-RING ligases, comprising Cdc/Rbx/C34, independent of Skp, and highlight the complexity of SC ubiquitin ligase regulation. The Sk-free F-box degradation pathway, previously described for Met, is distinct from this novel pathway, which targets F-box proteins dissociated from Skp.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism for regulation of F-box abundance, expanding our understanding of SC ubiquitin ligase function. The Sk-independent pathway is essential for chromosome stability and stress response, underscoring the importance of cull-R ligases in cellular homeostasis.

**Title:** Revisiting the Regulation of Kines-3 Motor KIF1: Dimerization and Activation in the Absence of Cargo

**Research Question:** How are Kines-3 motors, specifically KIF1, regulated in the absence of cargo to prevent futile ATP hydrolysis and motility?

**Methods:** We examined the dimer state and activity of native and recombinant KIF1 proteins to test the current model of cargo-induced dimerization for activation.

**Findings:** Unexpectedly, we found that both native and recombinant KIF1 proteins exist in a dimer, inactive state, contradicting the cargo-induced dimer model. Instead, we identified two distinct inhibitory mechanisms that autoinhibit dimer K1 motors. Successive truncations resulted in monomeric and dimer forms that undergo one-dimensional diffusion along microtubules, but only dimer motors exhibit ATP-dependent processive motility.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that K1 motors are uniquely suited for both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells.

**Conclusions:** Our results challenge the current model of cargo-induced dimerization for mammalian K1 motors, instead supporting an autoinhibition mechanism. Only dimer K1 motors undergo processive, ATP-driven motility, characterized by smooth, unidirectional movement along microtules with an average velocity comparable to vesicles in vivo. Both monomeric and dimer forms of K1 undergo 1D on microtules, indicating nonspecific binding that enhances processivity. Loss of K1 or Unc104 function impairs synaptic vesicle transport, highlighting the importance of understanding kines regulation for correct cargo delivery.

**Title:** Elucidating the Regulation of Seed Metabolism and Metabolic Variability in Tomato Introgression Lines: A Metabolite Profiling and Network Analysis

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the regulation of seed metabolism and estimate the degree of metabolic variability in a collection of 76 homozygous tomato introgression lines (ILs) grown in the field across two consecutive seasons.

**Methods:** Metabolite profiling and network analysis were applied to the collection of ILs to identify metabolite quantitative trait loci (QTL). Factorial ANOVA confirmed the presence of 30 QTL. Amino acid contents displayed high variability across the population with patterns similar across seasons, while sugars exhibited significant fluctuations. Integration of data for tomato peric metabolite profiling factorial ANVA identified the main factor for metabolic polymorphism to be the genic background rather than environment or tissue.

**Findings:** Analysis of coefficient variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in ILs than M82 tomato cultivar. Broad estimate heritability suggested the mode of inheritance of metabolite in seed differed from fruit. Correlation metabolic network analysis comparing seed with fruit showed seed displayed tighter interdependence metabolic processes. Amino acids in seed network played a central role maintaining interactions with other categories, sugars, and acids. Network identified six highly co-regulated amino acids, Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro. Interdependence confirmed by QTL mapping.

**Implications:**

1. Extensive regulation underlying seed metabolism
2. Tight coordination seed with fruit metabolism
3. Centrality amino module in seed network

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the value integrating metabolic analysis with QTL mapping. Metabolite profiling combined with genetic variability revealed regulatory mechanisms in seed metabolism. Network coupled with heritability and phenotypic plasticity highlighted differences seeds and fruit metabolic structure and modes inheritance.

**Title:** Structural and Functional Analysis of the N-Acetylglucosamine Binding Protein (Gbp) of Vibrio cholera Reveals Modular Interactions with Chitin, Mucin, and the Bacterial Surface

**Research Question:** How does the N-acetylucosamine binding protein (Gbp) of Vibrio cholera mediate interactions with chitin, mucin, and the bacterial surface, and what are the structural and functional implications of these interactions?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, and biochemical assays to determine the three-dimensional structure of Gbp and investigate its interactions with chitin, mucin, and the bacterial surface.

**Findings:** Gbp possesses an unusual, elongated four-domain structure with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains, while domains 2 and 3 possess structural homology to bacterial pili proteins. Gbp binds to GlcNA oligosacides, with domains 1 and 4 interacting with chitin in vitro, and domain 1 crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Bacterial studies show domains 2 and 3 bind the V cholera surface. Mouse virulence assays reveal only the first three domains of Gbp are required for colonization.

**Implications:** These results explain how Gbp provides structural and functional interactions between V cholera, intestinal epithelium, and chinous exoskeleton.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals the molecular basis of Gbp's ability to mediate interactions between V cholera and host surfaces, both in marine and mammalian environments. Gbp's modular structure allows it to bind chitin, mucin, and the bacterial surface, facilitating colonization. These findings have implications for understanding V cholera pathogenesis and development of novel therapeutics targeting Gbp.

**Title:** Activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ T Cells Compromise Regulatory T-Cell Suppression in Pulmonary Tuberculosis through CCR5 and PD-1 Pathways

**Research Question:** How do activated HLA-DR+ CD4+ T cells contribute to the loss of regulatory T-cell suppression in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and what are the underlying mechanisms?

**Methods:** We conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR- CD4+ T cells from TB patients to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways. We also performed antibody blocking experiments to confirm the role of CCR5 and PD-1 pathways in HLA-DR CD+ cell resistance to Treg suppression.

**Findings:** We found that HLA-DR CD+ cells are resistant to Treg suppression due to expansion of an activated subset identified by HLA-DR expression. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed putative mechanisms linked to IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22, PD-L, and chemokines CCL3, C4 expression. Antibody blocking confirmed HLA-DR+ cells, but not HLA-DR- cells, to be resistant to Treg mediated via CCR and PD1 pathways. Additionally, HLA-DR cells expressed higher levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines that regulate Treg through a counter-balancing relationship.

**Implications:** Our study provides novel insight into how activated HLA-DR CD+ cells contribute to disease inflammation by compromising Treg suppression in TB. HLA-DR+ cells are a potential marker of disease with implications for monitoring and response to therapy. CCR and PD1 are reported to promote Treg suppression, but we show their role in Te susceptibility to Treg in TB. HLA-DR cells also express higher Th/17 cytokines that negatively regulate Treg function.

**Conclusions:** Activated HLA-DR CD+ cells compromise Treg suppression in TB through CCR and PD1 pathways. Our data provide fresh insight into how HLA-DR cells may contribute to inflammation and loss of T-mediated homeostasis in TB.

**Title:** Investigating the Propagation of Prion Strains in Mice Lacking Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) Anchor

**Research Question:** Can mice lacking the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (tg- mice) faithfully propagate prion strains despite the deviant structure and location of anchorless PrSc, and what are the implications of this on prion propagation?

**Methods:** We investigated the propagation of R, ME, and 22 prions in tg- mice using the Cell Assay (CPA) to determine cell tropism and proteinase-resistant PrSc (PrPres) levels. We also analyzed homogenates of pr-infected brains from tg- and C57 mice by CPA.

**Findings:** R and ME prions propagated in tg mice gave rise to unusually high levels of Pr, likely due to greater stability of extracellular compared to intracellular Pr. In contrast, 22 prions did not propagate in tg mice. When R prions from wild-type brain were propagated in tg mice, a GPI-PrSc conformer adapted to the environment, and when transferred to wild-type, a novel conformation wild-type PrSc, designated S, was maintained. We also inoculated tg mice with various prion isolates and determined the trop of the resulting isolates by CPA.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that tg mice can propagate pr strains with deviant structure and location anchorless PrSc, leading to high levels of Pr. We propose that two conformations are separated by a high energy barrier abrogated in tg mice. The stability of extracellular Pr compared to intracellular Pr may contribute to the high levels of Pr in tg mice.

**Conclusions:** tg mice can faithfully propagate pr strains with deviant structure and locationless PrSc, leading to high levels of Pr. The stability of extracellular Pr compared to intracellular Pr may contribute to the high levels of Pr in tg mice. Our findings have implications for understanding prion propagation and the role of GPI anchor in prion biology.

**Title:** Conservation of BMP Signaling in Dorsal-Ventral Axis Patterning during Embryonic Development: Unraveling the Transcriptional Network

**Research Question:** How does the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway regulate dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development in Drosila, and what are the transcriptional mechanisms underlying this process?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to investigate the BMP-responsive transcriptional network in the early Drosila embryo, focusing on the dorsal-vent axis pattering of the ectoderm. We identified multiple BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling, and manipulated EGF levels using loss- and gain-of-function studies to reveal its role in BMP transcription.

**Findings:** Our results show that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP transcription, indicating a self-regulating property of the BMP network that balances its activity with the antagonistic EGF pathway to facilitate patterning. We identified key roles for Zelda and Zerküll transcription factors in establishing the expression domain and widespread binding of insulator proteins to Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. Analysis of embryos lacking BE-32 insulator protein reduced transcription of a BMP target gene and amniosa cells specified by BMP signaling.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a model for Mad-dependent activation and its relevance to BMP interpretation in vertebrates, highlighting the conserved role of BMP signaling in dorsal-vent axis patterning during embryonic development.

**Conclusions:** This study unravels the transcriptional network underlying dorsal-vent axis pattering of the ecterm in Dila, revealing a complex interplay between BMP and EGF signaling. The BMP pathway has a self-regulating property that balances its activity with the antagonistic E pathway to ensure correct patter. Our results have implications for understanding BMP-dependent transcription in vertebrates and highlight the importance of insulator proteins in regulating gene expression.

**Title:** Investigating the Evolution and Spread of Leishmania major in Tunisia: A Multi-Locus Microsatellite Typing Analysis of Human Isolates from Endemic Governorates

**Research Question:** To elucidate the evolution and population dynamics of Leishmania major in Tunisia, we conducted a multi-locus microsatellite typing of human isolates from endemic governorates Gaf, Kairan, and Sidi Bouiz, collected over two periods (1991-1992 and 2008-2012).

**Methods:** We employed a statistical and Bayesian-based approach to analyze the genotyping isolates collected in Sidi Bouiz in 199-199 and 200-201, revealing that over two decades, Leish parasites evolved into genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of 200-201 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L major populations did not spread from south to center Tunisia according to a geographical gradient, suggesting human activities as the source of disease expansion.

**Findings:** Our analysis suggests that human activities, reservoir dynamics, and environmental changes explain the disease progression. This study provides new insights into the evolution and spread of L major in Tunisia, improving our understanding of parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations.

**Implications:** Human isolates collected between 200-201 were used to assess population dynamics L according to geographical and chronological emergence of leishiasis epidemics in populations. Isolates in Sidi Bouiz governor in 199- and 200- were compared to provide information on evolution L populations over twenty years. Z incidence and genetic diversity have continuously increased, suggesting Leish adaptation to environment. Rapid anthropic modifications impacted sandfly, rodent, and Leish populations since 1990.

**Conclusion:** Our findings indicate a decreasing genetic gradient from Gaf to Kair and Sidi between 200-201. According to leishias chronology in Tunisia, Gaf is the oldest and well-established focus. However, we do not know if chronology corresponds to real spread. Despite limitations, study shows genetic differentiation between Gaf Sidi and Gaf Kair, but not Kair Sidi.

**Title:** Evaluating the Impact of Deworming and Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) Interventions on Helmin Infections in HIV-Infected Adults: A Cohort Study within a Randomized Trial

**Research Question:** Does deworming with albendazole and prazantel, with or without access to WASH, impact helmin infection prevalence in HIV-infected adults?

**Methods:** We conducted a cohort study within a randomized trial of empiric dewing of HIV-infected adults in Kenya. Helmin infections and intensity were diagnosed using semi-quantitative real-time PCR. We used a manual stepwise model approach to identify packages of interventions protective against STH infection, combined and each helmin species. Secondary analyses were conducted among individuals with no anthelmis exposure. Interaction terms tested for synergy.

**Findings:** Approximately 22% of 701 stool samples were helmin-infected, mostly of low to moderate intensity. Dewing with albazole reduced odds of STH infection (OR: 0.11, 95%CI: 0.05,0.20, p<0.001), adjusting for age and sex. WASH showed minimal benefit, but safe flooring offered additional protection (OR:0.34, 95%:0.20,0.56, p<0.001). Prazantel was protective for schistosiasis (OR:0.30,95:0.14,0.60, p=0.001). Among untreated individuals, safe flooring (OR:0.34,95:0.20,0.59, p<0.001) and latrine access (OR:0.59,95:0.35,0.99, p=0.05) reduced STH. No synergy or antagonism between anthelmic and W resources.

**Implications:** Dewing is effective in reducing helmin infections in HIV-infected adults. WASH offers minimal benefit, except for safe flooring. W reduces infections in those not treated with chemotherapy.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of dewing in reducing helmin infections in HIV-infected adults. WASH, particularly safe flooring, offers additional protection in those not treated with anthelmics.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Action of Lectin-Like Bacteriocins: Structural Insights from the Crystal Structure of LlpW, a Prototype Lectin-Like Bacterin from Pseudomonas putida

**Research Question:** How do lectin-like bacteriocins, produced by plant-associated bacteria, selectively kill closely related species, including phytopathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas species, and what is their mode of action?

**Methods:** We solved the crystal structure of LlpW, a prototype lectin-like bacterin from Pseudomonas putida, revealing an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MBL) domains and a C-terminal β-hair extension. Mutational analysis indicated that the intact sugar-binding pocket in the C-terminal MBL domain is crucial for bactericidal activity.

**Findings:** The C-terminal MBL domain (C-domain) adopts a fold similar to MBL domains from plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose oligosaccharides, while the N-terminal MBL (N-domain) adopts the same fold but is structurally divergent and lacks a mannose-binding site. Differential activity of engineered N-domain chimeras from Lp homologues with killing spectra disclosed the N-domain determines specificity.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the bacterin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacterotoxicity. LlpW, a bacteridal protein, fits the picture of MBL domains involved in defense mechanisms, challenging the identification of structural features that confer intraspecific bactericidal activity.

**Conclusions:** The structure elucidation of LlpW from P. putida unequivocally assigns bacterin to the MBL family, the first prokaryotic representative of a group of proteins composed of MBL domains. Our study provides insights into the mechanism of action of lectin-like bacterins and their potential role in plant defense against phytopathogens.

**Title:** Coordinated Regulation of Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis: Unveiling the Role of the SpoII-SpoQ Complex in Forespore Integrity

**Research Question:** How is the forespore transcription factor σG regulated during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, and what is the role of the SpoII-SpoQ complex in maintaining foresore integrity?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of bioinformatics, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to investigate the regulation of σG and the function of the SpoII-Spo complex during sporulation.

**Findings:** Our results show that σ activity requires the SpoII proteins encoded in the spoII operon and the foresore protein SpoQ, which reside in a multimeric complex spanning the membranes surrounding the foresore. We demonstrate that SpoIA shares similarity with ATPases of type II and IV secretion systems, and conserved ATP motifs are required for σ activity and spore formation. Furthermore, we show that SpoIA, SpoQ, and the ATP motifs in SpoIA are necessary to maintain fores integrity; in their absence, the foresore develops invaginations and collapses. Importantly, maintenance of fores integrity does not require σ, indicating that fores collapse is not a result of failure to activate σ and the program of foresore gene expression under its control.

**Implications:** Our findings support a model in which the Spo-Spo complex forms a novel secretion apparatus linking the cell and foresore, allowing the cell to nurture the fores and maintain σ activity during spore maturation. This putative secretion appears to be assembled from components of specialized systems found in Gram-negative bacteria. The SpoIA ATPases resemble those in type II and IV secretion systems, suggesting an enzymatic function for the complex.

**Conclusions:** We propose that the Spo-Spo complex plays a crucial role in maintaining fores integrity during sporulation, independent of σ activity. Our results provide new insights into the regulation of σ and the function of the Spo-S complex, shedding light on the complex interplay between the cell and fores during sporulation. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of sporulation in Bacillus and potentially other Gram-positive bacteria.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Architecture of Bipolar Disorder: A Genome-Wide Association Study and Meta-Analysis Reveals Replicable Signals in Exonic Regions

**Background:** Bipolar disorder (BD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition affecting approximately 1% of the global population, characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression, with a staggering 17% mortality rate due to suicide. Despite its high heritability, the genetic underpinnings of BD have remained elusive, with no genome-wide significant loci identified through family and population-based mapping strategies. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted promising candidates, but failed to reach genome-wide significance.

**Research Question:** Can we identify replicable genetic variants associated with BD using a genome-wide association study and meta-analysis approach?

**Methods:** We combined genotype data from 1,190 cases and 401 controls from the Bipolar Genome Study (GS) and 1,001 and 1,033 European ancestry controls from the GAIN initiative, totaling 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between the power to detect a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association in one study and replication in another.

**Findings:** We did not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci; however, across SNPs, we observed a significant association (P=1.5×10−7) between the power to detect effects calculated from previous GWAS and replication. To demonstrate this result is not a false positive, we analyzed replication rates in a meta-analysis of height and showed that, in large enough studies, associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD SNPs near exons exhibited greater replication probability, supporting enrichment of reproducible associations in functional regions of genes.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that common variation associated with BD near exons (±10 kb) could be identified in larger studies, providing a framework for assessing potential replication when combining results from multiple studies.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the feasibility of identifying replicable genetic signals in circumscribed regions of the genome not captured by single analyses at genome-wide significance. Our approach assesses the consistency of effects across loci by calculating power to detect in discovery study and comparing to observed associations in test study. This strategy can be applied in meta-analysis where results are present for large numbers of SNPs.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Cancer Proliferation: A Genome-Wide Analysis of Gene Expression and Growth Measurements

**Research Question:** Understanding the mechanisms of cell proliferation has been a long-standing goal of the scientific community, particularly in the field of cancer research. Previous genome-scale studies of cancer determinants have relied on knockdown screens to gauge their effects on growth, but this approach has limitations such as off-target effects, partial knockdown, and masking due to functional backups.

**Methods:** We employed a complementary approach by assigning a Cancer Prolifer Index (cPI) to quantify the association between gene expression levels and growth measurements across 60 cancer cell lines.

**Findings:**

* Genes essential in cancer knock screens exhibit significant positive PI values, while tumor suppressors exhibit significant negative PI.
* Cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production processes are positively associated with cancer, while migration is negatively associated with it, in accordance with the "grow or die" dichotomy.
* Analysis of non-cancerous proliferation indices (PI) across lymphoblast cell lines reveals marked differences between cancerous and nonancer proliferation, highlighting genes in translation and splice machineries as selective proliferation-associated.
* Cross-species comparison shows cancer proliferation resembles microorganisms while nonancer does not.
* Combining cancer and nonancer signatures leads to enhanced prediction of patient outcome and geneity in cancer.

**Implications:**

* Our results point to inherent differences between cancerous and nonancer determinants, which may contribute to future development of novel anti-prolative drugs.
* Genome-wide analysis of cancer based on expression and growth measurements of 126 genes across 60 cancer lines (NCI-60) identifies genes and processes related to proliferation.
* Analysis of 200 genes with highest PI shows enrichment in translation (ribosomal) and splice machineries, in accordance with previous studies suggesting these processes as targets in therapy.

**Conclusions:**

* We present first genome-wide analysis of cancer based on expression and growth measurements of 126 genes across NCI-60.
* Results show emerging PI signature highly relevant with functional correlates.
* Our analysis uncovers genes and processes associated with proliferation, positively or negatively, in various cancers.
* Analysis of tumor suppress genes and oncogenes shows significant PI values compared to other genes, testifying decreased functionality may enhance proliferation.
 Overall, our study highlights inherent differences between cancerous and nonancer determinants, contributing to future development of cancer-specific anti-prol drugs.

**Title:** Cardiac and Endovascular Cysticercosis: A Retrospective Series of 11 Cases and Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes of cardiac and endovascular cysticercosis (CE) in a cohort of 11 patients followed over a 15-year period (1995-2009).

**Methods:** A retrospective case series of 11 patients with cardiac and/or endovascular CE was conducted. Clinical manifestations included thoracic pain and dyspnea, although 2 patients were asymptomatic. Cysts were mostly located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Nine patients were previously diagnosed with disseminated CE. Echocardiography was the diagnostic method of choice, although serology, electrocardiogram, chest-ray, computed tomography/magnetic imaging, and histology aided diagnosis and follow-up. Nine underwent cardiac surgery and received long-term antiparas treatment for a median of 25 months (4-93).

**Findings:** One patient died intra-operatively due to cyst rupture and endovascular dissemination. Two died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis, due to pulmonary embolism (PE) and cardiac failure, respectively. One was lost to follow. Patients with cardiac involvement did not have complications after surgery and were considered cured. There was only recurrence requiring second operation. With vena involvement developed PE and presented multiple complications.

**Implications:** Cardiovascular CE is associated with a high risk of potentially lethal complications. Clinical manifestations and complications vary according to cyst location. Isolated CE may be cured after surgery, while endovascular extrard involvement is associated with severe complications. CE should be included in differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in endemic areas.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the importance of considering CE in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in endemic areas. Endovascular extrard CE is rare and associated with severe complications. Isolated CE may be cured with surgery, while endov extrard involvement requires combination of medical and surgical treatment.

**Title:** Essential Role of Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR) Domains in Toll-Like Receptors for Initiating and Propagating Eukary Innate Immune Signaling: Investigation of Staphylococcus aureus TIR (TirS) as a Novel Bacterial Invasion Mechanism

**Research Question:** What is the role of Staphylococcus aureus TIR (Tir) in modulating Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and its impact on the innate immune response during S. aureus infection?

**Methods:** We used a mouse model of S. aureus skin infection to evaluate the role of ir in modulating TLR signaling and virulence. Ectopic expression of ir in eukotic cells inhibited NF-kB activation through TLR2, T4, T5, and T9. We also investigated the localization of ir in S. aureus chromosomal cassette (SCC) and its association with fusidic acid resistance.

**Findings:** ir localized within SCC containing the fusC gene for fusid acid resistance but not always carrying the mec gene. Sub-inhibitory concentration of fusid acid increased ir expression. Epidemiological studies showed no link between ir and clinical presentation, but a selective advantage with SCC element SCC/ir. We found that ir modulates virulence through attenuation of inflammatory responses.

**Implications:** Our results support previous findings that ir interferes with TLR signaling and modulates virulence. This is the first description of a TIR homolog carried by a mobile element conferring resistance to antibiotics, suggesting a selective advantage for S. aureus pathogenicity. The host partner of ir has yet to be identified.

**Conclusions:** ir plays a crucial role in modulating the innate immune response during S. aure infection by inhibiting TLR signaling through My88, a general adaptor protein. We found that ir is a potent inhibitor of TLR, T4, T5, and T9, all dependent on My88. S. aure carrying ir induced increased virulence in My88 knockout mice. These results suggest that ir modulates inflammatory responses at the site of infection through My88 protein. This study highlights the importance of understanding bacterial strategies for immune evasion, such as manipulation of TLR signaling, and the role of ir in S. aureus virulence.

**Title:** Deciphering the Evolutionary Innovations through Spatial and Temporal Changes in Gene Expression: A Comparative Analysis of Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae Embryogenesis

**Research Question:** How do spatial and temporal changes in gene expression contribute to evolutionary innovations in embryonic morphologies between Drosophila melanogaster and Anophe gambia?

**Methods:** We analyzed whole-genome transcriptional datasets during embryonic development of Dophila melanaster and Anophe gambia to identify whole-genome changes in gene expression underlying their respective embryonic morphologies. Orthologous gene pairs were clustered based on coincident discordances in temporal profiles, revealing a cluster specifically expressed in mosquito serosa, redeployed later in cuticle synthesis. A striking difference in temporal expression of maternal genes was observed, with transcripts reducing at maternal-zyotic transition in Dophila sustained in Anophe.

**Findings:** Approximately 75% of ortholog gene pairs exhibited similar temporal profiles in divergent fly and mosquito embryos. Clustering concordant expression profiles revealed correspondence during development (Figure 1). Temporal expression datasets were aligned using warping and analyzed for discordant genes. A major cluster matched known involved in mosquito serosa function, redeployed in cuticle synthesis. Significant discordances were observed for maternally expressed genes in flies and mosquitoes, consistent with evolution of sharp maternalzyotic transition.

**Implications:** Gene clustering by temporal discord can be used for de novo identification of batteries underlying morphological diversity. This study provides a conceptual and computational framework for cross-organal alignments of species-specific transcriptional datasets, revealing distinctive patterning properties in Diptera embryos, including extraembry tissues and maternalzyotic transition (Figure 2).

**Conclusions:** This research demonstrates that spatial and temporal changes in gene expression can drive evolutionary innovations in embryonic morphologies between Dophila and Anophe. By clustering ortholog pairs based on temporal discord, we can identify gene batteries underlying morphological diversity. This approach can be used for extraction of functional sets from comparative datasets.

**Title:** Asymptomatic Carriage of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertue in Endemic Communities: A Cross-Sectional Study in Rural Papua New Guinea**

**Research Question:** We investigated the presence of Haemophilus duyi (H. duyi) and Treponema pallum subsp. pertue (T. pertue) DNA in asymptomatic individuals, flies, and household linens in an endemic setting in rural Papua New Guinea during a yaws elimination campaign.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in villages of Lih Island, Papua New Guinea. Asymptomatic participants were recruited from households with and without cases of ulcers. Swabs were taken from the skin of asymptomatic individuals, and flies and swabs of environmental surfaces. Specimens were tested by PCR for H. duyi and T. pertue DNA.

**Findings:** Of 78 asymptomatic participants with adequate specimens, H. duyi PCR positivity was identified in 16% and T. pertue PCR in 1%. In subgroup analysis, H. duyi positivity did not differ in participants exposed or not to a case in household (24% vs 18; p=0.76). Of cultures from asymptomatic, 2% yielded definitive H. duyi diagnosis. Of flies tested, 90 had H. duyi DNA and 50 T. pertue DNA. Of bed sheets, 33 had H duyi and 17 T. pert DNA.

**Implications:** This is the first demonstration of H. duyi DNA on asymptomatic skin and H. du and T.ue DNA in flies and fites. Ubiquity of H. du in environment contributes to spread.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that 20% of asymptomatic children in H. du-endemic communities have detectable H. du DNA on skin, with no evidence of cutaneous ulceration or symptoms. People from households with and without ulcer had similar positivity rates. PCR-positive participants were more likely to change lin less than once a week. Flies outside houses with ulcers had 90% H duyi and 50 T.ue DNA. Household visits of patients with ulcers had 57 H du and 5 Tue in ulcers, neither pathogen in 38.

**Title:** Refining Bioinformatics Core Competencies for Diverse Training Needs: A Framework for Educators and Practitioners

**Research Question:** What are the essential bioinformatics core competencies required for diverse populations in biomedical research and healthcare, and how can they be effectively integrated into training programs?

**Methods:** The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force conducted a multi-year process of community engagement to develop and refine a set of bioinformatics core competencies based on employer and training program surveys.

**Findings:** The refined competencies provide a framework for educators to share experiences and identify best practices in bioinformatics education, addressing divergent needs and expectations. A series of use cases illustrate the competencies' applications in diverse training contexts, demonstrating their value in defining, refining, and assessing bioinformatics mechanisms.

**Implications:** The competencies offer a basis for bioinformatics educators to design, refine, and evaluate their training programs, despite divergent goals and student populations. They are not a prescription for specific curricula or standards, but a foundation for shared experiences and collaboration.

**Conclusions:** The refined bioinformatics core competencies provide a conceptual framework for bioinformatics education, enabling educators to address diverse needs and expectations. The use cases highlight the competencies' value in defining, refining, and assessing bioinformatics mechanisms, illustrating their applications in various training programs and settings.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Developmental Arrest in the Third-Stage Larva of the Parasitic Nematode Strongyloides stercalis: A Comparative Analysis with Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** The developmental arrest of the third-stage larva (L3) of the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercalis, which infects over a billion people globally, remains poorly understood. Unlike other nematodes infecting humans, S. stercalis has a unique life cycle with both parasitic and free-living forms, allowing investigation of mechanisms of L3 arrest and activation.

**Methods:** We conducted a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome of S. stalis at seven developmental stages, generating 2.3 billion paired-end reads. We constructed expression profiles for S. stalis homologs of Caenorhabdis elegans dauer genes by BLAST searches of the S stalis genome and de novo assembled transcripts.

**Findings:** Intriguingly, genes encoding cyclic GMP (cG) pathway components were coordinately upregulated in L3. In contrast to C. elegans, S. stalis has a paucity of genes encoding insulin/IG-1-like (IS) ligands, several of which have abundance profiles suggesting involvement in L3 development. We identified seven S. stalis genes encoding homologs of C. elegans dauer TGFβ ligand, three of which are expressed in L3. Putative biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated L3 development.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that dauer pathways are present in S. stalis and may play a role in L3 development, but significant differences exist between species. Understanding mechanisms governing L3 development may lead to novel treatment and control strategies.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of S. stalis transcriptome at multiple developmental stages, identifying homologs of C. elegans dauer genes. Our findings support the hypothesis that d pathways are present in S stalis and involved in L3 development, but highlight species-specific differences. These results have implications for understanding parasitic nematode biology and development, potentially leading to novel control strategies.

**Title:** Bacterial Genotoxins Induced Nuclear Remodeling: A Gateway for mRNA Translation and Cell Survival in Response to Genotoxic Stress

**Research Question:** How do bacterial genotoxins, such as CDT and colactin, secreted by pathogenic bacteria, induce nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival in response to genotoxic stress?

**Methods:** We used co-culture experiments with CDT and colact-secreting bacteria, hepatic and intestinal cells, and xenograft-derived mouse models to assess nuclear remodeling in vitro and in vivo.

**Findings:** Our results showed that CDT and colact induced nuclear remodeling associated with the formation of cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus, corresponding to nucleoplasm reticulum (NR). The core of NR concentrated ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and main components of the complex CR involved in mRNA turnover. These structures are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with high ploidy, and MAP and calcium signaling.

**Implications:** Bacterial genotoxin-induced NR is a gateway for mRNA to be transported for local translation. Our findings offer new insights into the context of NR formation, a feature of many cancers, not only in response to therapies-induced DNA damage but also in response to genotoxic bacteria.

**Conclusions:**

* CDT and colact, two bacterial genotoxins, induce the formation of NR, a previously not reported during infections.
* The core of NR concentrates proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenated RNA, and subunits of the CR complex in mRNA turnover.
* Dynamic structures are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with high ploidy and MAP and calcium signaling.
* Insulation of ribonucleoproteins within NR is transient and protects cell from genotoxic stress.
* Bacterial genotoxin-induced NR is a gateway for mRNA to be transported for local translation.
* These findings may contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapies and chemotherapies inducing DNA damage.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Bacterial genotox, such as CDT and colact, induce nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival response to genotoxic stress.
* NR is a gateway for mRNA to be transported for local translation.
* Dynamic structures are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with high ploidy and MAP and calcium signaling.
* Insulation of ribonucleoprote within NR is transient and protects cell from genotoxic.
* These findings offer new insights into the context of NR, a feature of many cancers, not only in response to therapies-induced DNA but also in response genotoxic.

**Title:** Quantitative Evaluation of Maxillary Deformities in Leprosy Using Three-Dimensional Computed Tomography (3-CT)

**Research Question:** Can three-dimensional computed tomography (3-CT) be used to objectively evaluate maxillary deformities in patients with leprosy, and does it confirm previous paleopathological findings of maxillary regression?

**Methods:** Ten patients with lepro and five controls underwent 3-CT scans, and three-dimensional images of the maxilla were reconstructed using multiplanar reconstruction. The anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA) was measured, and the difference between MA of patients and controls was evaluated after compensating for individual skull size.

**Findings:** Three patients with lepromat leprosy showed marked atrophy of the maxilla (8.6-11.1-17.9mm), consistent with visual appearance of maxillary deformity and paleopathological findings. Precise bone defects of the max could be calculated for reconstructive surgery.

**Implications:** This study illustrates maxillary deformities in living patients lepro and confirms max regression in paleopathological studies. The use of 3-CT enables qualitative and quantitative evaluation of maxillary deformities.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the potential of 3-CT as a tool for evaluating maxillary deformities associated with lepro and other maxillary lesions, contributing to novel treatments for facial deformity and eliminating social prejudice attributed lepro.

**Title:** Adaptation to Stimulus Statistics in the Auditory System: A Key to Noise-Invariant Representations

**Research Question:** How does the auditory system represent sounds in a noise-invariant fashion in the presence of background noise, and what is the role of adaptation to stimulus statistics in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the extent of neuronal adaptation to mean and contrast of auditory stimulation as it ascends the auditory pathway by presenting synthetic and natural sounds, recording responses in inferior colliculus and primary fields of auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets, and comparing with a model of auditory nerve. We also presented complex natural sounds embedded in stationary noise and used a decoding approach to assess noise tolerance of neuronal code.

**Findings:** We found that strength of both forms of adaptation increases as ascends auditory pathway. To investigate whether adaptation stimulus contributes to construction of noise-invariant representations, we presented complex sounds in noise and found that code in periphery is affected by addition of noise, while cortical code is not. Noise tolerance is correlated with adaptation to stimulus, suggesting that populations showing strongest adaptation to statistics are most tolerant.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that increase in adaptation to statistics from nerve to cortex is important in construction of noise-invariant representations in higher brain. We also found progressive increase in noise of population representations, neuron-level changes in strength of adaptation and population changes in noise of decoding are correlated within and across centers, indicating adaptation to statistics may drive construction of noise-toler representations.

**Conclusions:** Adaptation to stimulus in auditory enables brain to build noise-invariant sound representations. As progresses through pathway, neural become more independent of level background. We found increase in strength of adaptation to altered statistics through pathway, and by level, populations represent signal in noiseoler, responding to features common clean and noisy conditions. Adaptation to statistics grows along pathway, populations shift from encoding low physical attributes to mean, and noise-independent information about stimulus, a major step towards context-in, categorical representations seen higher areas.

**Title:** Reorganization of the Yeast Interactome in Response to Heat Shock: A Novel Insights into Cellular Stress Adaptation Mechanisms

**Research Question:** How does the yeast interactome reorganize in response to heat shock, a well-characterized form of cellular stress, and what are the underlying mechanisms of this reorganization?

**Methods:** We analyzed the changes in protein-protein interaction weights of the yeast interactome from mRNA expression levels upon heat shock using a well-characterized protein-protein interaction subset of the BioGRID database. We calculated the weight of each protein-protein interaction in both resting and heat states.

**Findings:** Heat shock induced a significant decrease in both overlaps and connections of yeast interactome modules, with a 4.9-fold increase in weighted diameter. Key proteins of heat response centers became heat-induced local communities, providing residual connections after shock. The changes resemble a'stratus-culus' transition of interact structure, from globally connected (unstressed) to multifocal (shocked).

**Implications:** Our results suggest that heat induces partial disintegration of global organization of yeast interactome, which may be general in many stresses. Complex systems, such as proteins, social networks, and ecosystems, may decrease intermodular links, develop compact modules, and display partial disintegration in initial crisis phase.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides a model of general system-level adaptation to environmental changes. The partial disintegration of yeast interactome after shock is not an obvious consequence of heat-induced mRNA changes, but a non-trivial adaptation at system level. This finding appears at several network levels of topology. We identified bridges, intermod proteins, playing key role in remaining interact modules after shock, highlighting different behaviors. Our results provide novel insights into cellular behavior under stress, a well-character model of cellular dynamics.

**Title:** Efficacy and Safety of Amiodarone in Patients with Chagas Cardiomyopathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

**Background:** Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected condition with high prevalence and burden in Latin America. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with Chagas cardiomy, and amiodone has been widely used for this purpose.

**Research Question:** The aim of this study was to assess the effect of amarone in patients with Chagas cardiomy.

**Methods:** We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and LACS up to January 2018. Data from randomized and observational studies evaluating amar use in Chagasomy were included. Two reviewers selected studies, extracted, and assessed the risk of bias. Overall quality of evidence was accessed using Grading of Recommendations, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). We included 9 studies (3 before studies, 5 series, and 1 randomized trial). Two with a total of 38 had the full dataset, allowing individual patient (IP) analysis.

**Findings:** In 24-hour Holter, amar reduced the number of ventricular tachardia in 99.9% (95% 99.8-100%), ventricular beats in 93.1 (95%82.4-97.4), and incidence ventricular in 79% (RR 0.21, 95%0.11-0.39). Studies not in the IP analysis showed reduction ventricular beats (5), vent tachardia (6), and ventricular (1). Pooled incidence adverse effects with random meta-analysis amar was associated with corne microdeits (61.1, 19.0-91.5), gastrointestinal (16.6-34.2), bradycard (12.7,3-35.6), dermatological (10.4-21.3), and discontinuation (7.4-13.5).

**Implications:** Amar is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythm, but no evidence for endpoints (sudden death, hospitalization). Our findings support the use of amar, but balance benefits and harms at individual decision-making.

**Conclusion:** Although our review found amar associated with low brycard (7), conitant use amar and beta-blockers in Chomy may exacerbate brarrhythm. Other interventions with benefit patients Ch disease arrhythm. Recent meta-analysis primary am reduced risk sudden death by 34. In absence direct evidence Chomy, figures provide indirect estimate benefit our population.

**Title:** Investigating the Seasonal Patterns of Dengue Fever in Rural Ecuador: A Study of Climatic and Behavioral Factors

**Research Question:** What are the seasonal patterns of deng fever in rural Ecuador, and how do climatic and behavioral factors, such as temperature, rainfall, school schedules, and holidays, and day of the week, influence disease rates and healthcare-seeking behavior?

**Methods:** We analyzed 2009-2016 medical records of patients diagnosed with deng fever at two hospitals in rural Ecuador using Poisson generalized modeling to determine short and long-term patterns of deng fever, and the effect of day of the week and public holidays. A subset analysis examined the impact of school schedules on school-aged children, and a separate model evaluated the effect of climate on diagnosis.

**Findings:** The most important predictors of deng fever were annual sinusoidal fluctuations in disease, long-term trends, day of the week, and hospital. Seasonal trends showed peaks in case diagnoses during mid-March. Compared to average days, cases were more likely diagnosed on Tuesdays (RR: 1.26, 95% CI 1.05-1.51) and Thursdays (RR:1.25, 95 CI 1.02-1.53), and less likely on Saturdays (RR:0.81, 95 CI 0.65-1) and Sundays (RR:0.74, 95 CI 0.58-0.95). Public holidays were not predictors of deng diagnoses, except an increase on the day after Christmas (RR:2.77, 95 CI1.46-5.24). School schedules did not impact deng diagnoses in school-aged children. Climate variables included monthly precipitation, interaction between total and absolute temperature, interaction between precipitation and days, and three-way interaction between temperature, precipitation, and days.

**Implications:** This is the first report of long-term deng fever seasonality in Ecuador, one of few from rural, and one of few using daily reports. Results inform local prevention, public health planning, and global models of d fever trends.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to understanding of deng fever seasonality in rural Ecuador, highlighting the importance of climatic and behavioral factors on disease rates and healthcare behavior. Long-term trends and intra-annual patterns were significant, with peaks in mid-March, and increased diagnoses on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and decreased on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays, except Christmas, did not impact deng diagnoses. School schedules did not affect deng in school-aged children. Climate variables, such as precipitation, temperature, and days, influenced d diagnoses.

**Title:** Harnessing the Power of Innate Immunity: Transgenic Expression of Picornavirus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRP) for Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Protection

**Research Question:** Can transgenic expression of picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) in the absence of other viral proteins reconfigure mammalian innate immunity without triggering autoimmunity or chronic inflammatory sequelae?

**Methods:** We generated transgenic mice expressing RRP in the absence of other viral proteins and assessed their innate immune response to lethal viral challenge. We crossed these mice with defined knockout mice (Rag1, Mavs, Ifnar, If1, Tlr3) to determine the mechanism of action. Human cell models recapitulated key features with fidelity.

**Findings:** RRP-transgenic mice exhibited life-long, quantitative upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and profound resistance to lethal viral challenge. Mechanism operates via MAVS and is independent of the adaptive immune system. Human models showed analogous IS network induction and block to HIV-1 infection. RRP-mediated antiral mechanism operates at protein level, not secondary structure, and is well-tolerated despite massive IS elevations.

**Implications:** Our results provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiral protection. RRP-transgenic mice possess maximally upregulated innate transcriptome effecting robust antiral response, exceeding virus-induced gene induction. Activation of cell-intrinsic immunity produces type I interferons and antiral factors. Viruses isolate Rd activity during replication, but RRP-induced upregulation confers marked resistance.

**Conclusions:** Transgenic expression of RRP reconfigures mammalian innate immunity without autoimmunity or chronic sequelae. Our data reveal a powerfully augmented MAV-mediated state can be well-tolerated by mammalian immune system. R-transgenic mice are entirely healthy with normal longevity. These results provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiral protection.

**Title:** Testing the Independent Action Hypothesis in Plant Virus Infection: A Study on Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) Infection in Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum Plants

**Research Question:** Does the Independent Action Hypothesis (IAH) hold true for plant viruses, specifically Tobacco Etch Virus (TE) infection in Nicotiana tabum and Capsicum plants, and is the effective population size (Ne) of the virus dose-dependent?

**Methods:** We constructed two TE genotypes with different fluorescent markers and infected Nicotiana tabum (highly susceptible) and Capsicum annuum (less susceptible) plants with varying doses. We observed the number of primary infection foci, their distribution, and frequency of mixed-genotype infections.

**Findings:** The number of primary foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary foci with both genotypes were found at low frequency (<2%). The probability of a genotype infecting leaf systemically was ~1, but rare genotypes could be trapped by others. Mixed-genotype frequency was predicted by the independent model.

**Implications:** Independent action appears to hold for TE, and Ne is dose-dependent. The number of virions causing systemic infection can be small and approaches 1 at low doses. Dose-dependency in TE suggests that Ne estimates for different viruses are not meaningful unless dose effects are considered.

**Conclusions:** Our data indicate that primary foci are initiated by single virions, and systemic infection by single vir will occur at low doses. RNA virus Ne can be small, and genetic drift impact tremendous. Dose-dependency is relevant for experimental evolution with plant viruses. We speculate IAH may apply to mono-partite plant viruses, requiring consideration of mixed-genotype frequency at different doses.

**Title:** Bayesian Sparse Regression for Mapping of Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) Across Multiple Tissues: Unveiling Complex Regulatory Mechanisms of Gene Expression

**Research Question:** Despite the feasibility of global analysis of RNA expression in multiple tissues, few statistical frameworks have been developed to jointly analyze gene expression across tissues with simultaneous analysis of multiple genetic variants. This study proposes a novel Bayesian approach, Sparse Regression for eQTL mapping within tissues and across tissues.

**Methods:** We implemented a computationally efficient algorithm, Evolutionary Stochastic Search (ESS), coupled with Sparse Regression to analyze a set of 2,000 genes in four tissues, demonstrating its superiority over traditional methods in revealing the complexity of the eQ landscape at the systems-level.

**Findings:** Our approach identified a novel cis-eQ model for the Hopx gene, experimentally validated and undetected by conventional methods, and showed common regulation of gene expression across tissues for ∼27% of transcripts, providing a 5-fold increase in eQ detection compared to single-tissue analyses at 5% False Discovery Rate (FDR). This highlights the power of our method in uncovering complex regulatory mechanisms of gene expression.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a new opportunity to understand genetic control of gene expression while the generality of modelling makes it adaptable to other systems and humans, broadening analysis of intermediate and whole-body phenotypes.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that Sparse Regression coupled with ESS offers advantages in e mapping within and across tissues, uncovering polygenic regulation of expression, and identifying secondary trans-eQs than traditional methods. Our Bayesian variable selection addresses uncertainty in finding predictors, providing a list of eQs and assessing marginal contribution of each to gene variability. This approach enables efficient identification of genetic regulation across tissues, substantially increasing e detection of cis- and trans-effects at the same FDR.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Extrinsic Apoptosis through Mathematical Modeling and Experimental Validation

**Research Question:** How does the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TN-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), exhibit a variable delay in initiator caspase activity followed by rapid effector caspase activation, and what are the key factors controlling this snap-action switch between life and death?

**Methods:** We constructed a mathematical model based on mass-action representation of reaction pathways and trained it against experimental data from live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein and overexpression. The model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, enabling the study of switching mechanisms in detail.

**Findings:** Analysis of the model and experiments reveal that the duration of delay prior effector casase activation is determined by initiator casase-8 activity and rates of reactions immediately downstream the TR receptor. Sudden effector casase activation is achieved by permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. Pattern interactions among Bcl-2 family, partitioning Sm from its partner XIAP, and pore assembly mechanics are critical for snap control.

**Implications:** Failure in snap switching generates an indeterminate state predisposing cells to genomic instability. The model suggests parameter values represent order-of-magnitude estimates. Differing dynamics initiator and effector substrate cleavage raise the question where in extrinsic pathway a steady increase in C* is converted to snap signal.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the mechanisms of extrinsic apoptosis through mathematical modeling and experimental validation, providing insights into the snap-action switch between life and death. The model highlights the importance of initiator cas-8 activity and downstream reactions in determining the delay prior effector activation, and the role of Sm, Bcl-2 family interactions, and pore assembly in snap control. Further studies incorporating protein synthesis and signaling are needed to capture long-term outcomes.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Listeria monocytogen's Placental Infection: The Role of Internalin P (InP) and Afadin Interaction

**Research Question:** How does Lister monocytogen breach the placental barrier to infect the fetus, and what is the role of internalin P (In) in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between L monocytogen's internalin P (InP) and human afadin, a protein associated with cell junctions, using crystal structure analysis, cell culture experiments, and genetic manipulation.

**Findings:** We found that InP, but not similar L monocogenin L202, binds to afadin, a protein involved in cell junction formation. The structure of InP revealed a unique leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with a Ca2+-binding site. MDCK epithelial cells expressing In displayed decreased traction on deformable substrates, similar to AF-6 knock-out MDCK cells. L monocogen ΔinP mutants were deficient in forming actin protrusions from polarized epithelial monolayers, necessary for transcytosis. A similar phenotype was observed in bacteria expressing an in-frame InP deletion (InPΔRR) that disrupts interaction with af. However, af deletion in host cells did not rescue transcy defect.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that secreted In targets cytoplasmic af to promote L monocogen transcyosis across basal epithelial monolayers, contributing to crossing the basement membrane during placental infection. The abundance of potential InP partner in placenta and previous report of In role in L monocogen infection at maternal-fetal interface support hypothesis that In-af interactions are important in placental pathogenesis.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies af as a major partner for InP and demonstrates that In-af interaction enhances monocogen transcyosis, the ability to exit basal of infected polarized epithelial monol, consistent with contribution to placental infection. Our unbiased genetic screen in pregnant guinea pig model of listiosis previously identified L monocogen genes contributing to placental infection, one of which encodes In, a member of internal family proteins. L monocogen experiences multiple bottlenecks from trafficking to placenta to surviving placental immune to crossing trophlast monolayer and basement into fetal circulation. In attracted interest due to identification in screen L monocogen mutants defective in placental infection.

**Methods:** To better understand the T. pallum proteome during infection, we studied T. pallum s. pallum DAL-1 strain isolated from rabbits using mass spectrom techniques, including multidimensional separation and protein identification via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TO) and electrosprayization (ESI-LT-Orbit) tandem spectrometry.

**Findings:** A total 603 peptides were detected, corresponding to 557 T. pallum proteins at high confidence, representing 54% of predicted proteome. 114 of detected were previously annotated as hypothetical or uncharacterized, this is the first account of 106 of these at protein level. Detected proteins were characterized by predicted function and localization, allocated into wide range functional categories. Proteins as potential membrane and unclear annotations subjected additional bioinformatics analysis facilitate characterization. total 116 membrane proteins identified, 16 evidence outer localization. 12 proteins related paralog t gene family: TB, TC, TE, TG, TH, TI, TJ. Protein abundance semi-quantified label-free counting low correlation (r = 0.26) between microarray data.

**Implications:** This comprehensive description global T. pallum prote provides valuable insights in vivo expression, paving understanding pathogenic this enigmatic organism.

**Title:** Conformational Selection in the Cyclic AMP-Binding Domain of Protein Kinase A Revealed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

**Research Question:** How do the dynamics of the cyclic AMP-binding domain (CBD) of Protein Kinase A (PK) contribute to its activation by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)?

**Methods:** Nuclear Magnetic Reson (NMR) spectroscopy was used to investigate the conformational equilibria of the two-domain construct RIα (91–379) in its apo, c2, and C-bound forms.

**Findings:** Comparative NMR analyses revealed a double conformation selection model, where CBD samples both active and inactive states independently within a nearly degenerate free landscape. Binding of c eliminates this degeneracy, stabilizing the active conformation and inter-C contacts. The inter-C interface is dispensable for intra-C conformation selection but indispensable for full activation as it occludes C-sub recognition sites.

**Implications:** These results support a conformation selection model for c-dependent activation of PKα and highlight the critical role of CBD dynamics in its function. Conservation of structure does not imply conservation of dynamics, as structurally homologous c-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in residual profiles.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the mechanism of c-dependent activation of PK, shedding light on the role of CBD dynamics in its function. The conformation selection model provides a framework for understanding how PK responds to c stimuli, with implications for its regulation in various cellular processes.

**Title:** The Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) Regulates Mitochondrial Function and Macrophage Polarization in Response to Viral Infection

**Research Question:** How does the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (IS15) regulate mitochondrial function and macrophage polarization in response to viral infection?

**Methods:** We compared the proteomes of IS15- and IS15+ bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMD) after vaccinia virus (VAC) infection to identify components involved in IS and IS15 signaling.

**Findings:** Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation (OXOS) pathways were altered in IS- MD treated with interferon (IF). Mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive species (ROS) production were higher in IS+ MD than IS- MD following IF treatment, indicating IS-dependent mechanisms. IS depletion resulted in significant macrophage polarization change, with IS- macrophages showing a pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern typical of M1 phenotype, but blocked nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase activation. Following IF treatment, NO release was higher in IS+ macroph than IS- macro, concomitant with decrease in viral titer. IS- macroph were permissive for VV replication following IF treatment.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that IS governs the dynamic of mitochondria, specifically OXOS and mitagy, broadening its role as antiviral agent.

**Conclusions:** IS plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial function and macroage polarization in response to viral infection. Mitochondrial dysfunction and OXOS pathways were altered in IS- MD treated with IF, while IS+ MD showed increased mitochondrial respiration, ATP, and ROS production. IS depletion resulted in macroage polarization change, with IS- macro showing pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern but blocked NO production. Following IF treatment, NO release was higher in IS+ macro than IS-, concomitant with decrease in viral t. IS- macro were permissive for V replication following IF treatment. These findings highlight the importance of IS in regulating mitochondrial function and macroage polarization in response to viral infection.

**Key findings:**

* IS regulates mitochondrial function and macroage polarization in response to viral infection
* Mitochondrial dysfunction and OX pathways altered in IS- treated with IF
* IS+ showed increased mitochondrial respiration, ATP, and ROS production
* IS depletion resulted in macroage change, with IS- showing pro-inflammatory pattern but blocked NO production
* Following IF, NO release higher in IS+ than IS-, conitant with decrease in viral
* IS- permissive for V replication following IF

**Title:** Differential Phosphorylation of HIV-1 V Protein Regulates Its Fate as an Adaptor or Substrate of Ubiquitin Ligases

**Research Question:** How does the phosphorylation of HIV-1 V protein regulate its fate as an adaptor or substrate of ubiquitin ligases, and what are the implications for viral replication and release?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of phosphorylation of HIV-1 V in regulating its interaction with the SCβCP ubiquitin ligase complex and subsequent degradation of cellular targets, including β-caten and Iκα. We identified a novel phosphorylation site, serine 61, adjacent to the βCP-binding motif, which triggers V degradation by a βCP-independent process. Mutation of V S61 in the HIV-1 provirus extended the half-life of the protein and increased release of HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells.

**Findings:** Phosphorylation of V on serine 61, adjacent to the βCP-binding motif, triggers V degradation by a βCP-independent process. Mutation of V61 in the HIV-1 provirus extends the half-life of the protein and increases release of HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells. The S61 determinant of V degradation is conserved within HIV-1 isolates.

**Implications:** Our results highlight a mechanism where differential phosphorylation of V determines its fate as adaptor or substrate of ubiquitin ligases. Conservation of V degradation determinant, despite negative effect on virion release, suggests a role in overall HIV-1 fitness. This implies that V is recognized by an E3 ubiquitin ligase other than βCP, as illustrated in the model in Figure 6.

**Conclusions:** Phosphorylation of HIV-1 V regulates its fate as adaptor or substrate of ubiquitin ligases, with implications for viral replication and release. Mutation of S61 in HIV-1 provirus extends half-life and increases release of HIV-1 particles, suggesting a selective advantage. Conservation of V degradation determinant within HIV-1 isolates suggests a role in overall fitness.

**Title:** Coordinating Tissue Patterning with Whole-Body Development: Unveiling the Robustness of the Adult Phenotype**

**Research Question:** How is tissue patterning in the wing imaginal discs of Drosoph larvae coordinated with whole-body development, and what are the implications for the robustness of the adult phenotype?

**Methods:** We developed a staging scheme to describe the progression of patter in the wing discs over time, based on the expression of canonical patter genes, and linked it to three whole-body events: moulting, larval wandering, and pupation. We used this scheme to explore how patter changes in response to alterations in temperature and hormone synthesis that drive developmental progression.

**Findings:** Our results show that patter in the disc aligns at moul and pupation, indicating these events represent developmental milestones. Between these milestones, patter shows greater variability in response to changes in temperature and physiology. Notably, discs from wandering larvae exhibit greater variability in patter, suggesting that this stage is not a developmental milestone. Furthermore, our data reveal that patter remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that tissue patter is coordinated with whole-body development, aligning at key milestones. This suggests that the adult phenotype is robust against environmental and physiological variation. Our work provides insight into how individual tissue development is coordinated with the body as a whole, highlighting the importance of developmental milestones in patter.

**Conclusions:** We propose two hypotheses to explain how patter is coordinated with whole development: (1) patter is tightly coordinated with whole development over time, and (2) patter aligns at developmental milestones. Our data support the second hypothesis, showing that patter aligns at moul and pupation, but not wandering. The robustness of the adult phenotype is achieved by coordinating patter with whole development at these milestones, allowing it to cope with environmental and physiological variation.

**Title:** ESCRT Regulator Did2 Coordinates Endosomal Maturation and Long-Distance Transport in the Fungal Hypha of Ustago maydis

**Research Question:** How does the ESCRT regulator Did2 regulate endosomal maturation and long-distance transport in the fungal hypha of Ustago may, and what are the implications of its loss on cellular processes?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of ESCRT regulator Did2 in endosomal maturation and long-distance transport in the fungal hypha of Ustago may using a combination of molecular and cellular biology techniques, including microscopy, and biochemical assays.

**Findings:** Our results show that loss of Did results in defective vacuolar targeting, less processive long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. Importantly, late endosomal Rab7 and vacuolar protease P1 exhibit increased shuttling on aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Moreover, molecular motors fail to attach efficiently explaining disturbed processive movement, and endosomal RNP protein Up1 is hardly present on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that ESC regulator Did2 coordinates endosomal maturation and provides correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long transport. Endosomal maturation and fusion with vacuoles depend on functional ESC machinery for vacolar sorting. Loss of Did results in aberrant localization of endosomal proteins and decreased processivity of endosomes as a whole. We discovered a link between ESC complex and endosomal transport, but not a direct link as proposed in D. melanogaster, rather an indirect affecting loading of mRNPs on endosomes. Endosomal maturation is crucial for cellular recycling and extensive growth in polar cells like neurons and fungal hypha.

**Conclusions:** ESC regulator Did2 plays a crucial role in determining membrane identity of early endosomes in polar cells, ensuring correct function in long transport of important cargos like mRNAs and septins. Loss of Did is essential for undisturbed polar growth of hypha, suggesting a functional role in microtub-dependent transport. Our study highlights the role of ESC-III regulator in polar cells dependent on long transport. As ESC component, Did is localized on endosomes in different organisms, and R4-mediated transport mRN is crucial for subcellular localization of encoded proteins.

**Title:** Divergent Ligand Binding Properties and Regulatory Mechanisms of Adenine Riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulificus**

**Research Question:** How do adenine riboswitches in Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulificus regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels, and what are the differences in their ligand binding properties and regulatory mechanisms?

**Methods:** We investigated the ligand binding properties and regulatory mechanisms of aden riboswitch in B. subtilis and V. vulificus using a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches, including transcriptional and translational assays, and kinetic and thermodynamic modeling.

**Findings:** Our results show that aden ribos in B. subtil and V. vulus exhibit distinct ligand binding properties and operate under different regulatory regimes, kinetic versus thermodynamic. The B. subis ribos fully depends on co-transcriptional binding of adenine to function, whereas V. vulus rib can bind aden after transcription is completed and still regulate translation. Furthermore, the rate of transcription is critical for B. subis rib to perform efficiently, consistent with co-transcription regulation. In contrast, V. vul rib can regulate post-transcriptionally without transcription-translation coupling.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the nature of gene control, transcription or translation, has a significant impact on ribos regulatory mechanisms. While guanine ribos negatively regulate expression by attenuating transcription, aden-specific activate expression at the level of transcription and translation. Our results are consistent with a thermodynamic model where lig binding and rib regulation can occur post-transcription, and transcription-translation is not required for efficient control. In contrast, a kinetic regime is proposed for B. rib that needs to bind aden co-transcription to activate transcription.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals divergent ligand properties and regulatory mechanisms of aden ribos in B. subtil and V. vul, highlighting the complexity of ribos regulation in gene expression. These findings have implications for understanding the role of ribos in bacterial gene control and potential applications in biotechnology.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Primer-Dependent Initiation (PDI) in Bacteria: A Regulatory Mechanism Modulating Biofilm Formation in Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholera

**Research Question:** What is the physiological role of Primer-Dependent Initiation (PDI) in bacteria, particularly in Escheria coli and Vibrio cholera, and to what is the extent does it occur in other bacteria?

**Methods:** We employed high-throughput sequencing of RNA 5' ends (5 RNA-seq) to investigate the occurrence of P in E. coli and V. cholera. Comparative analysis revealed a striking similarity in the pattern of P between the two organisms, with P detected in stationary phase, not exponential phase, and preferentially at promoters carrying T-1+1 and G-1+ start regions.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate a physiological role for P in E. coli as a regulatory mechanism modulating biofilm formation. P from T-1+ and G-1 start regions produces full-length transcripts emanating from position -1, carrying 5' hydroxyl and beginning with sequence 5-UA and 5-GG, respectively. We propose a growth-dependent process that preferentially generates 5-UA and 5- oligonucleotides in E. coli and V. cholera.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that P may be widespread among Gammaprotebacteria and that the extent of P relative de novo initiation fluctuates as a function of growth state.

**Conclusions:** This study establishes P as a regulatory mechanism modulating biofilm in E. coli and reveals a striking similarity in the pattern of P between E. coli and V. cholera. We propose that P occurs through a growth-dependent process leading to the preferential generation of 5-UA and 5 oligonucleotides in both organisms. These results, coupled with prior analyses, support an emerging model that P may be widespread in bacteria.

**Title:** Parental Genome Imbalance Deregulates Embryo Growth and Reproductive Isolation in Arabidopsis through Imprinted Genes

**Research Question:** How does parental genome imbalance affect the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis and contribute to reproductive isolation between emerging species?

**Methods:** We investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes FERTIZATION INDEPENDENT SE2 (F2) and FLOW WINGEN (WA) controlled by DNA methylation and MEA (ME) and PES (HE) controlled histone methylation in Arabidopsis.

**Findings:** Genome imbalance deregulated the expression of F2 and P1 in an antagonistic manner. Increased dosage of inactive alleles caused loss of imprinting of F2 and ME. F2 controls histone methylation, which represses ME and P1 expression, but changes in P1 and ME expression could not be fully accounted for by fluctuations in F2 expression. Our results show parental genome imbalance deregulates imprinting mechanisms independent of known regulators.

**Implications:** The complexity of regulations between expressed and silenced alleles of imprinted genes in response to parental imbalance does not support simple models derived from parental hypothesis.

**Conclusions:** Parental genome imbalance deregulates imprinted genes in Arabid through mechanisms independent of known regulators of imprinting. This study provides evidence for parental conflict theory in plants and supports the role of genome imbalance in reproductive isolation between emerging species.

**Title:** Deciphering the Functional Connectivity of the Brain through Oscillatory Dynamics: A Novel Insights from Reverse-Engineered Networks

**Research Question:** This study investigates the functional aspects of brain oscillatory dynamics, focusing on what they reveal about brain connectivity, rather than how they emerge or are necessary for neural function.

**Methods:** We employed mathematical techniques for inverse problems to reverse-engineer networks that generate dynamics similar to EEG/MEG recordings, including spindles and sharp waves on a non-oscillatory background. We reconstructed networks for normal and diseased brains (epileptic and schizophrenic) with altered oscillatory activity.

**Findings:** Reconstructed networks display similar topological features (e.g., structural motifs) and dynamics. Diseased networks show alterations in functional connectivity and dynamics. Complexity, quantified by Tononi, Sporns, and Edelman, is a good indicator of brain fitness, with diseased brains displaying lower complexity.

**Implications:** Our results have implications for the neurobiology of health and disease, suggesting that oscillatory dynamics convey information about functional, not anatomical connectivity. Complexity may be a marker of brain fitness, with diseased states displaying lower complexity.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of reverse-engineered networks to reveal functional aspects of brain connectivity, providing new insights into the neurobiology of health and disease.

**Title:** Population Structure and Genetic Analysis of the Hispanic Cohort in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA): Implications for Genetic Association Studies

**Research Question:** To investigate the population structure and genetic diversity of the Hispanic cohort in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (ESA) and its implications for genetic association studies.

**Methods:** We analyzed 60,000 SNPs for linkage disequilibrium in 1,374 unrelated Hispanic individuals from the MESA with self-identification corresponding to Central America (n=93), Cuba (n=50), the Dominican Republic (n=203), Mexico (n=708), Puerto Rico (n=192), and South America (n=111). We used principal components (PCs) of ancestry from the Hap phase and Human Diversity Panel (HGDP) to quantify Caucasian, African, Native, and American origins. The third and fourth PCs revealed an axis aligning with South-N geographic location of HG Native samples and separating MESA Mexican Central/South samples.

**Findings:** Using k-means clustering from the first four PCs, we defined four subgroups of the M Hispanic cohort showing agreement with self-identification labeling as Dominican/Cub, Mexican, Central/South, and Puerto. We performed stratified association analysis of triglycerides for selected SNPs in LPL and TR1 regions, previously reported in Caucasians but unconfirmed in Hispanics. We found significant evidence for association in both genes, highlighting the importance of considering population structure and genetic heterogeneity in Hispanic studies.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate the diversity and complexity of the Hispanic population, underscoring the need for stratified analysis in genetic studies. The four subgroups identified align with self-identification and geographic location, underscoring the importance of accounting for population structure in genetic studies. The significant association of L and TR1 genes in trigides in Hispanics, previously reported in Caucasians but not confirmed, highlights the importance of considering genetic heterogeneity in association studies.

**Conclusion:** This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Hispanic cohort in MESA, highlighting the diversity and complexity of the population. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering population structure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic studies, underscoring the need for stratified analysis. The significant association of L and TR genes in trigides in Hispanics, previously reported in Caucasians but not, highlights the importance of considering genetic heterogeneity association. This study contributes to the understanding of the Hispanic population and implications for genetic studies.

**Title:** Elong Complex Interacts with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen to Regulate Transcriptional Silencing and Genome Stability

**Research Question:** How does the Elong complex, a histone acetyltransferase, interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to regulate transcriptional silencing and genome stability in proliferating cells?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Elong, the catalytic subunit of the six-subunit Elong complex, in transcriptional silencing and genome stability using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We analyzed reporter gene silencing at the chromosome VI telomere and HMR locus, as well as sensitivity to DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) and damaging agent methylmethanesulfate (MS) in cells lacking Elp. We also examined the genetic interactions between Elp and other subunits of the Elong complex, as well as mutations in Elp that compromise Elong complex formation.

**Findings:** Deletion of Elp resulted in loss of silencing and increased sensitivity to HU and MS. Moreover, Elp is required for S-phase progression in the presence of H. Epasis analysis revealed that elp mutant, itself sensitive to MS, exacerbates MS sensitivity of cells lacking histone chaper Asf, C-1 and H lysine acetylase R109. Elp has specific genetic interactions with POL, encoding PCNA, which binds Elong complex in vivo and vitro. These results uncover a novel role for intact Elong in transcription silencing and genome stability, linked to DNA and repair PCNA.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate conserved Elong functions in multiple processes. Histone chaper proteins bind histones and promote nucleosome assembly during replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Elong, a histone acetylase, interacts with PCNA to regulate transcriptional silencing and genome stability. This pathway is linked to DNA and repair protein PCNA. Our results suggest Elong plays a critical role in transcriptional silencing and genome stability in proliferating cells.

**Conclusions:** Elong, a histone acetylase, interacts with PCNA to regulate transcriptional silencing and genome stability in proliferating cells. This pathway is linked to DNA and repair protein PC. Elong plays a critical role in transcriptional silencing and genome stability in proliferating cells. Our findings have implications for understanding conserved Elong functions in multiple processes. Histone chaper proteins bind histones and promote nucleosome assembly during replication, DNA, repair, and transcription.

**Research Question:** Can a machine-assisted triage method improve the efficiency and precision of biomedical knowledge curation by leveraging deep learning techniques to classify and rank publications?

**Methods:** We developed a machine-assisted triage method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on a gold-standard dataset of curated publications from UniProt/Swiss-Prot and NHRIEB GWAS Catalog. We evaluated our method on real-world curation of UniProt/Siss-Prot and GW Catalog, comparing its performance to query-based methods.

**Findings:** Our machine-assisted triage outperformed current query-based methods, achieving 1.81 and 2.99 higher precision on UniProt/Siss-Prot and GW Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. Our method retrieved additional relevant publications that query-based UniProtiss- could not.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that machine-assisted triage can make the process more efficient, allowing human curators to focus on challenging tasks and improve knowledge bases.

**Conclusion:** This study introduces a novel application of deep learning to speed up real-world triage for biomedical literature, leveraging CNNs to classify and rank publications. Our method achieved high performance on different datasets, including UniProt/Siss-Prot and GW Catalog, and outperformed query-based methods without compromising recall. Our results show that machine-assisted triage can be implemented in production, enhancing the quality of knowledge bases.

**Title:** Gain-of-Function Mutations in KCNJ2-Encoded Kir2.1 Channels Underlie Variant 3 (SQT3) of the Short QT Syndrome Associated with Atrial Fibrillation (AF): Insights from Physiologically-Detailed Human Atrial Computer Models

**Research Question:** This study investigates the mechanistic link between SQT mutations and atrial arrhythmogenesis, and potential ion channel targets for treatment of SQT, using physiologically detailed human atrial computer models.

**Methods:** A contemporary model of human atrial action potential (AP) was modified to recapitulate functional changes in IK due to heterozygous and homozygous forms of D172 and E299 Kir2.1 mutations. Wild-type (WT) and mutant formulations were incorporated into multi-scale and heterogeneous tissue models. Effects on AP duration (AP), conduction velocity (CV), effective refractory period (ERP), tissue excitation threshold, and rate-dependence, as well as wavelength re-entry (WL) were quantified.

**Findings:** The D172 and E299 Kir.1 mutations produced distinct effects on IK and AP shortening. Both mutations decreased WL through a reduction in ERP and CV. Stability of reentrant excitation in 2D and 3 tissue was mediated by changes tissueability and AP in conditions. Combined block of IK and IK was effective in terminating re associated with heterozygous D172, whereas IK block alone may be safer for E299. Combined of IK and IK produced synergistic antiarrhythmic in both forms of S3.

**Implications:** This study provides mechanistic insights into atrial arrhythm with S3 Kir.1 mutations and highlights pharmacological strategies for management of S-linked AF.

**Conclusion:** Mechanisms underlying initiation and maintenance of atr arrhythm at cellular and organ levels arising from interactions genetic and electrical heterogene in humania have yet to be investigated using anatom-detailed, 3 phenically-accurate models S3 mutant IK. This study fills this gap by incorporating heterogeneity human atr electrophiology, which has been found to be intrinsic of the atria. Differences in IK I-K relationship by S3 were investigated, manifesting in the way mutations affected AP. S3 prob identified who was heterozygous for D Kir2.1 has shown increased IK shortened AP and stabilised in computational models human atr electrophiology. Increased IK from E Kir.1 has been proarrhyth at cellular and tissue levels. However, atr are characterised by electrical heterogeneity, which has generated arrhythm substrate in silico.

**Title:** Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Modulate Immune Response and Attenuate Chag Cardiomyopathy in a Mouse Model of Trypanosoma cruzi Infection

**Research Question:** Can adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) alter the course of Chagas disease and attenuate cardiomyopathy in a mouse model of Trypanosoma cruzi infection?

**Methods:** Mice were infected with T. cruzi and injected with ASC intraperitoneally at 3 days post-infection (dpi). Bioluminescence tracking showed ASC remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days, with most migrating to abdominal subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. Parasitemia, cardiac inflammation, and fibrosis were measured at 30 dpi.

**Findings:** ASC injection resulted in significant reduction in parasitemia, followed by decrease in cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. Cytokine release from heart cells exposed to T. cruzi antigens showed anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated mice, while splenocytes produced pro-inflammatory response, important for parasite control in placebo and ASC groups. However, splenocytes from ASC released higher IL-10 at 60 dpi. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed right ventricular (RV) dilation prevented in ASC-treated mice.

**Implications:** Injection of ASC after T. cruz infection prevents RV remodeling through modulation of immune response, promoting parasite control and heart protection from damage.

**Conclusion:** Adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells interact with the immune system, contributing to control myocardial damage. This study demonstrates ASC administration after T. cruz infection alters disease course and attenuates pathology in a mouse model of chag cardiomy.

**Background:** Chagas disease, caused by T. cruzi, is endemic in Central and South America, with increasing non-vector transmission in developed countries. Immunosuppression in transplanted patients lead to disease reactivation. Balance between parasite replication and inflammation leads to persistence and chronic stages. This study shows ASC administration after T. cruz infection prevents RV remodeling through modulation of immune response, promoting parasite control and heart protection.

**Discussion:** Four mechanisms are responsible for chag cardiopathy: parasite persistence, inflammation, autoimmunity, dysonomia, and microvascular lesions. Latter are consequences of myocardial damage induced by parasite. Recent work shows parasism at 15 post-infection higher in adipose than heart and spleen.

**Title:** Optimization of Retrograde Pathway Inhibitors for the Treatment of Leishmaniasis: Enhanced Potency of Analogues of Retro-2

**Research Question:** Can structural analogues of Retro-2, a retrograde pathway inhibitor, exhibit superior potency in inhibiting Leishmania infections compared to the parent compound?

**Methods:** We evaluated the efficacy of two optimized analogues of Retro-2, DHZ36 and DHZ36.1, on Leishmania amazonensis infection in macrophages and axenic cultures.

**Findings:** DHZ36 and DH36.1 exhibited EC50 values of 13.63±2.58μM and 10.57±2.66M, respectively, significantly lower than the EC50 of Retro-2 (40.15μM). Moreover, these analogues reversed Leish-induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells and killed Leish parasites in axenic cultures.

**Implications:** These results validate and extend the structure-activity relationship of Retro-2, suggesting that the retrograde pathway is crucial for Leish infections. The DHZ analogues are non-toxic to mammalian cells, indicating that the pathway is more sensitive in Leish.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that optimized analogues of Retro-2, DHZ36 and DH36.1, exhibit superior potency in inhibiting Leish infections compared to the parent compound, Retro-2. Their ability to kill Leish parasites in axenic cultures is a desirable attribute for treating Leish infections.

**Title:** Predicting Nucleosome Sensitivity for Transcription Factors: A Novel Insights into Gene Regulation of Ly49 Expression

**Research Question:** Can we develop a computational method to evaluate nucleosome sensitivity for transcription factors across a given genome and apply it to predict the role of nucleosomes in regulating Ly49 gene expression?

**Methods:** We developed a computational method to predict nucleosome sensitivity for transcription factors based on the presence of binding sites within nucleosome boundaries and lack of 10 bp periodicity. We applied this method to the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1 (AML-1) transcription factor, a regulator of immune gene expression, and identified it as potentially sensitive to nucleosomal regulation within the Ly49 gene family.

**Findings:** Using MNase-Seq to generate a nucleosome map of chromosome 6, where the Ly49 gene is located, we found specific depletion of nucleosomes at AML-1 binding sites in expressed Ly49 compared to silent Ly genes. Our data suggest nucleosome regulation contributes to Ly gene expression.

**Implications:** This method predicting nucle sensitivity could aid in dissecting the role of nucleosomes in gene regulation. Whole-chromosome analysis revealed many transcription factors display nucle coverage and lack 10 periodicity, suggesting potential nucle-sensitivity on a genome scale. This was confirmed in a cell line with expressed Ly49, showing preferential nucleosome depletion at AML-1 sites compared inactive Ly genes.

**Conclusions:** We propose that nucle-based regulation contributes to Ly gene expression. Future studies will investigate nucle sensitivity AML-1 binding at non-Ly genes to determine ubiquity of sensitivity. In a cell naturally expressing Ly, AML-1 sites are preferentially depleted nucleosomes promoter/enhancer regions expressed Ly genes compared unexpressed genes, implicating nucle positioning in Ly regulation in vivo.

**Title:** Regulation of Cell Cycle Progression and Genome Duplication by Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs): Unraveling the Role of CDK-Activating Kinase (CAK) and Phosphatases

**Research Question:** How do cyclin-dependent kinases (CDs) orchestrate cell cycle progression and genome duplication, and what is the role of CD-activating kinase (CA) and phosphatases in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a chemical-genetic approach using analogue-sensitive CD7 (as) mutant H116 cells, which can be specifically inhibited by adenine analogs, to investigate the role of CD7 in CD4 and CD6 phosphorylation.

**Findings:** CD7 inhibition prevented phosphorylation of CD4, but not CD6, which was partly dependent on binding to p21. In response to CD7 inhibition, p21 binding to CD increased concomitantly with disappearance of phosphorylation at S130, catalyzed by CD and CD2. S130 mutation of p prevented CD phosphorylation and inhibition of CD6 and CD impaired phosphorylation of p and p-bound CD.

**Implications:**

1. CD7 plays a crucial but indirect role in phosphorylation/activation of CD and CD6.
2. Existence of CD-activating kinase(s) other than CD7.
3. Novel CD-dependent feedback mediated by p phosphorylation of CD and CD2 sustain CD activation, p inactivation, and restriction passage.

**Conclusions:**

Our study reveals a novel mechanism of CD regulation of cell cycle progression and genome duplication by CD, highlighting the importance of CD-activ kinase and phosphatases in this process. CD phosphorylation of CD is a highly regulated step, catalyzed by CD and CD, whereas CD is constitutively active. CD7 inhibition prevents phosphorylation of CD, but not CD, which is partly dependent on binding to p. Our findings suggest a complex interplay between CD, CD, and phosphatases in regulating cell cycle progression and genome duplication.

**Title:** DUET, a PHD Finger Protein, Regulates Meiotic Gene Expression and Microtubule Organization during Male Meiosis in Arabidopsis

**Research Question:** What is the role of DU, a PHD finger protein, in regulating meiotic gene expression and microtub organization during male meiosis in Arabidopsis?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of DU, a PH finger protein essential for Arabid male meiosis, as a transcription regulator of meiotic gene expression and microt organization during meiosis.

**Findings:** We found that DU binds to H3me in vitro and that this interaction is critical for its function during meiosis. DU is required for proper microt organization during meiosis, independently of its function in me I. We identified two genes, TDM and J, critical for cell transitions and spindle organization in me, as targets of DU, with T being a direct. DU regulates microt organization and cell transitions during me, and as a direct activator of the meiotic gene T. Profiling showed reduced expression of a subset of known me genes in du mutant.

**Implications:** Our results reveal DU as a transcription regulator during me in Arabid, and that binding its PH finger to Hme is critical for function. DU expression is confined to diene, and functions of targets in me I and II are reminiscent of control by transcription factors in yeast. T, whose expression in me depends on DU, is not detected in female me, suggesting DU might activate me genes contributing to sexual dimorphism in me cycle and spindle organization. Our also suggest a developmental for Hme in Arab reproduction.

**Conclusions:** DU, a PH finger protein, regulates meiotic gene expression and microt organization during male me in Arabid. Its binding to Hme is critical for function, and expression is restricted to diene. DU targets T and J, required for me transitions and spindle organization, are lost in du mutant. Our findings provide insight into meiotic regulation in multicellular eukotes, where few transcriptional regulators have been identified.

**Title:** Fragile X-Associated Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) Pathogenesis: A Novel Insights into the Role of R62 in CG-Mediated Neurodegeneration

**Research Question:** What is the role of R62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 helicase, in modulating CG-mediated neurodegeneration in Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FAS)?

**Methods:** We employed a proteomic approach to identify proteins interacting with α, the CG-binding protein, and found R62 as a key modulator of CG-mediated neurodegeneration. We investigated the effects of Fragile XCG repeats on R62 expression, leading to nuclear accumulation of Hsp transcript and other mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses.

**Findings:** Fragile XCG repeats decreased R62 expression posttranscriptionally, leading to nuclear accumulation of H70 transcript and additional mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. This suggests impaired nuclear export of these mRN contributes to FAS pathogenesis.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that R62 plays a crucial role in modulating CG-mediated neurodegeneration, and its decreased expression due to Fragile XCG repeats leads to nuclear accumulation of mRN, potentially contributing to FAS pathogenesis.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying FAS, highlighting the importance of R62 in regulating CG-mediated neurodegeneration. Our results suggest that impaired nuclear export of mRN, such as H70, due to decreased R62 levels, may contribute to FAS pathogenesis. These findings have implications for understanding and developing therapeutic strategies for FAS, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting Fragile X premutation carriers.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Pseudomonas aeruginosa's Exopolysaccharide in Biofilm Formation and Dispersal

**Research Question:** How does Pseudomonas aeruginosa form and maintain its extracellular matrix during biofilm development, and what is the role of exopolysacide in biofilm structure and dispersal?

**Methods:** We employed direct visualization techniques to study the product of the polysacide locus (Psl) at various stages of biofilm development, including attachment, maturation, and dispersal.

**Findings:** During attachment, P is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and matrix assembly, which holds bacteria in the biofilm on the surface. Chemical dissociation of P from the bacterial surface disrupted the P matrix and bio structure. During maturation, P accumulates on the periphery of 3D-structured colonies, resulting in a P-free matrix cavity in the colony center. At dispersal, cells appear in the matrix, and dead and extracellular DNA (eDNA) are concentrated in the P-free area. Deletion of genes controlling cell death and autolysis affects matrix and colony formation.

**Implications:** Our data provide a mechanism for Pseudas aerugin to build a matrix and subsequently a cavity for cell dispersal. Direct visualization reveals P as a key matrix component, opening avenues for therapeutics of bio-related complications.

**Conclusion:** Pseudas aerugin biofilm is a paradigm for studying biofilms, and our findings highlight the critical role of exopolacide in biofilm formation and dispersal. Exopolides, a main component of extracellular matrix in animal and plant tissues, are also important in microbial biofilms. Our data indicate P as a scaffolding component of Pseud aerugin bio matrix, likely playing a role in persistence.

**Title:** Comprehensive Genomic Characterization of Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX) and Patient-Derived Organoids (PDO) Models of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC): Implications for Therapeutic Development

**Research Question:** Can patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) models accurately recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and validate patient-specific sensitivities to therapeutics?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and PDX from primary PDAC and metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 trios of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PD models and paired tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy variations.

**Findings:** Tumour-model comparisons displayed single-gene concordance across major PD driver genes, but poor agreement across greater mutational load. Genome and chromosome-centric analysis of structural (SV) events highlighted unrecognized concordance across clustered SV events. Ploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy changes; however, ploidy-correct copy states suggest agreement between donor pairs.

**Implications:** Our investigations highlight that PDX and PDO may serve as tractable transplant systems for probing molecular properties of PD, but may best serve selective analyses across levels of genomic complexity. Donor comparisons, particularly heterogeneous tumours, including PD, benefit from next-generation sequencing technologies encapsulating facets of disease at molecular level.

**Conclusions:** This study presents the first quantitative assessment of whole-genome comparisons human PD (primary and metastasis) and model systems. Organoids exhibit ductal and stage characteristics, recapitulating full PD tumorigenesis, posing opportunity for probing PDO at genomic level. Genomic analysis of PDO remains missing to identify whether models recapitulate tumours molecular, necessary before widespread therapeutics. Our findings indicate P and PDO recapitulate primary and metastatic disease at level simple mutations in genes, but not across greater annotated mutations.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Patient-derived xenografts (P) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) models may serve as tractable systems for probing molecular properties of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PD)
* However, these models may best serve selective analyses across levels of genomic complexity
* Donor comparisons, particularly heterogeneous tumours, benefit from next-generation sequencing technologies encapsulating facets of disease at molecular level
* Genomic analysis of PDO remains missing to identify whether models recapitulate tumours at molecular, necessary before widespread therapeutics
* PDX and PDO recapitulate primary and metastatic disease at level simple mutations in genes, but not across greater annotated

**Title:** Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies Novel Susceptibility Loci for Breast Cancer in East-Asian Women

**Research Question:** What are the genetic factors contributing to the etiology of sporadic and familial breast cancer, and can we identify novel susceptibility loci for breast cancer in East-Asian women?

**Methods:** We conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. We analyzed 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324, evaluated 5,365 SNPs in 3,972 and 3,852, and 94 SNPs in 5,203 and 5,138, and the top 22 SNPs in 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 and 9,934).

**Findings:** Our study provides strong evidence for a novel breast susceptibility locus represented by rs9482, near the TGF-activated (TAB) gene in chromosome 6q25.1, and identifies possible loci in the ESR gene and 11q.24.3. rs9482 showed consistent association with breast risk across all four stages, with a P-value 3.8×10-12 in combined analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (95 CI) were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for A/G and A genotypes, respectively, compared to G genotype. rs9381 (P=1.9×10-6 from combined) located in intron 5 of ESR and rs710 (P=4.6×10-7) at 11.24.3 also showed consistent association in each stage.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of genetic factors in breast cancer etiology and identifies novel susceptibility loci for breast in East-Asian women. Our findings provide valuable resources for future studies to identify additional loci for breast cancer.

**Conclusions:** Genome-wide association studies have identified 20 common susceptibility loci for breast, but newly-identified factors explain less than 30% of heritability. Our study represents the largest breast genetic association in East women and will continue to provide resources for novel loci breast cancer.

**Title:** Cryptocococcal Meningitis in HIV-Positive Patients: Unveiling the Genetic Markers of Virulence and Outcome in a South African Cohort

**Research Question:** What are the genetic markers of virulence and outcome in Cryptocococcus neoformans isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa, and how do they correlate with clinical parameters of disease?

**Methods:** We studied a cohort of 230 Cryptoccus neoans isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and in vitro phenotypic virulence assays, correlating data with clinical and fungal markers of disease.

**Findings:**

* High genetic diversity and locus variability were observed in South African isolates compared to globally distributed types, with 50 sequence types grouped into main types VNI, VNII, and VNB, and 72% of isolates into 7 high-frequency sequence types.
* Spatial analysis showed no clustering of patients' cryptococcal genotype, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent acquisition.
* Comparison of MLST data with clinical parameters revealed a relationship between genetic lineage and outcome, with VNB lineage having worse survival (HR 3.35, CI 1.51-7.20, p=0.003), maintained after adjusting for prognostic indicators and treatment.
* Phenotypic analysis of a subset 89 isolates showed lineage-associated virulence, with VNII displaying increased lase activity (p=0.001) and ex vivo CS survival (p=0.000).

**Implications:**

* Cryptoccus neoans is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen, with lineage playing a role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection.
* Understanding genetic diversity in Southern Africa will support investigation into how diversity is structured across environments, assessing risks of different ecotypes to infection.

**Conclusions:**

This study highlights the importance of genetic diversity in cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-positive patients in South Africa, with 50 sequence types in 230 isolates, and 18 novel STs in Cape Town alone. ML profiling revealed genetic diversity, with 7 high-frequency types containing 9-33 isolates, showing differences in survival between ST-infected patients, but not statistically significant due to small sample size. ML has been used to analyze evolutionary relatedness, showing disproportionate diversity in southern Africa compared to global isolates.

**Title:** Elucidating the Evolution of a Novel Signal Transduction Pathway: The White Pherone Response in Candida albicans

**Research Question:** How do signal transduction pathways evolve, particularly in organisms with few examples of newly evolved pathways?

**Methods:** We constructed an overexpression library of 107 transcription factors and performed mutational analyses to identify the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of the newly evolved signal transduction pathway regulating the pherone response in Candida albicans.

**Findings:** The elucidation of Tec1, a transcription factor, establishes a comprehensive description of the pherone pathway in the white phenotype of C. albicans, providing a unique perspective on how signalduction pathways may evolve. Three portions of this new pathway appear to have been derived from different ancestral programs functional in C. alb. The upstream, including receptors, trimer G complex, and MAP cascade, was derived from the opaque pherone pathway; Tec, the factor targeted by MAP, was from filamentation; and white-specific targets from biofilm.

**Implications:** The evolution of the pherone pathway provides a paradigm for how signalduction pathways evolve. This study highlights the importance of identifying and interpreting origins of components in new or "young" signalduction pathways. Candida alb, an opportunistic human pathogen, has a young pathway with insufficient time to duplicate or modify components in response to selective pressures.

**Conclusions:** The evolution of the white phone pathway in C. alb affords a glimpse into the evolution of a signalduction, providing at least one paradigm for how pathways may evolve. Given the high divergence of transcription sites in yeast evolution, Tec activates genes in shared with opaque pher response and membrane processes, including adhesion and biofilm. The white and opaque pathways differ in C. alb, sharing components with S. cerevisiae haploid pher pathway from transcription activator.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Selection in Shaping Bacterial Genomic GC-Content: A Comparative Analysis of Synonymous Polymorphism in 149 Bacterial Species

**Research Question:** Does selection play a role in shaping bacterial genomic GC-content, or is it solely a consequence of mutation bias?

**Methods:** We analyzed synonymous polymorphism datasets from 149 bacterial species across 8 phyla, 15 classes, and 77 genera, with at least 8 sequences per species and 10 synonymous polymorphisms at 4-fold degenerate sites, and nucleotide diversity for GC→AT mutations < 0.1.

**Findings:** We observed a significant excess of GC→AT mutations in GC-rich bacteria, whereas AT-rich bacteria showed the opposite pattern, across diverse phylogenetic species. This excess cannot be attributed to mutation bias, as it would imply GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content, an unsustainable pattern. Translational selection and gene conversion are also unlikely explanations, as optimal codons are AT-rich, and excess GC→SNPs observed in datasets with no recombination evidence.

**Implications:** Our results suggest selection increases GC-content in many species. Since GC-content correlates with genomic-content, we conclude selection acts on base composition in bacteria.

**Conclusions:** This study challenges the notion that genomic-content is solely a consequence of mutation bias. Instead, our findings indicate that selection plays a crucial role in shaping bacterial genomic composition. The excess of GC→ mutations in GC-rich bacteria and AT→ mutations in AT-rich species across diverse phylogen species supports this conclusion. This has significant implications for understanding bacterial evolution and adaptation.

**Title:** Mapping Soil-Transmitted Helminth (STH) Prevalence in Kenya: A Bayesian-Time Geostatistical Approach

**Research Question:** What is the spatial distribution of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) prevalence in Kenya, and how has it changed over time?

**Methods:** Observed prevalence data for hookworm, Ascaris lumicoid, and Trichuris trichi were assembled from 106,370 individuals from 945 cross-sectional surveys between 1974 and 2009. Ecological and climatic covariates were extracted from high-resolution satellite data and matched to survey locations. Bayesian-time geostat models were developed for each species and used to interpolate the probability of infection exceeding 20% threshold across the country for 198 and 2009. Maps for each species were integrated to estimate combined ST prevalence using the law of probability and a correction for associations. Population data were combined with models to estimate population at risk and requiring treatment in 2009.

**Findings:** Most areas in 2009 had low endemicity below 20%, with areas ≥20% located around shores of Lake Victoria and coast. Comparison of predicted distributions 198 and 200 show STH prevalence decreased over time. Estimated 2.8 million school-age children live in districts warranting mass treatment.

**Implications:** Bayesian-time geostat models can reliably estimate combined STH prevalence, suggesting a quarter of Kenya's school children live in high-prevalence areas warranting mass treatment. As control reduces infection, models can refine decision-making in helth control.

**Conclusion:** This study presents a new approach to mapping STH prevalence in Kenya using Bayesian geostat, providing accurate maps for intervention at policy-relevant scales. Our results show STH prevalence has decreased over time, with 2.8 million school-age children in districts warranting mass treatment. This study demonstrates the utility of Bayesian geostat in predicting STH, facilitating targeted control programs and future data collection.

**Title:** CD1-Restricted NKT Cells Contribute to Innate Immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection**

**Research Question:** The role of innate lymphocytes in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection remains controversial, particularly the contribution of CD1-restricted NKT (iNKT) cells.

**Methods:** We established an in vitro system to study the interaction between splenocytes from uninfected mice and M-infected macrophages. Interferon-γ was produced when splenocytes were cultured with M-infected macrophages, and bacterial replication was suppressed. This control was dependent on CD1-restricted NKT cells, which required CD1 expression by infected macrophages and IL-12 and IL-18.

**Findings:** iKT cells, even in limiting quantities, were sufficient to restrict M replication. Adoptive transfer of primary splenic iKT cells from uninf mice significantly reduced bacterial burden in the lungs of mice infected with virulent M by aerosol route, demonstrating a direct bactericidal effect.

**Implications:** This study provides evidence that CD1-restricted N cells mediate protection against M in vivo.

**Conclusions:** CD-restricted N cells play a crucial role in innate immunity against M infection. Their activation and control of bacterial replication is dependent on IL-12 and IL-18. Our finding that iKT protect against aerosol M infection is the first evidence that CD-restricted cells mediate protection against M in vivo.

**Title:** Spatial and Temporal Control of Transglutaminase Activity during Bacillus subtilis Spore Coat Assembly

**Research Question:** How is the activity of transglutase (Tgl) controlled during Bacillus subtilis spore coat assembly, given its lack of regulatory factors and potential for unwanted cross-linking reactions?

**Methods:** We investigated the localization and activity of Tgl during spore coat formation using biochemical and biophysical approaches, including substrate-dependent localization, SAXS, and in vitro cross-linking assays.

**Findings:** We show that substrates assembled onto the spore coat prior to Tgl production govern its localization to the developing sp surface, with glutamyl (Q) and lys (K) substrate sites crucial for recognition. The first step in the reaction, interaction with substrates and acyl-enzyme intermediate formation, determines T localization. Consistent with a "spotting" activity, T cross-links pre-assembled complexes in vitro and becomes part of cross-linked products.

**Implications:** The substrate-dependent localization of T ensures proper temporal and spatial control of spore protein cross-linking, specificity, and extent of action. This mechanism may control Tgl activity in other spore-forming bacteria. T, a simple TGase, embodies minimal structural requirements for cross-linking.

**Conclusions:** The dependency of T on substrates spatially and temporally restricts its activity, ensuring pre-assembled complexes are cross-linked at the spore surface. Our results suggest that substrate localization is the primary mechanism to control Tgl activity during spore assembly.

**Title:** Mapping the Spatial Distribution and Risk Factors of Opisthorchis viverrini Infection in Champas Province, Lao PDR: A Bayesian Geostatistical Approach

**Research Question:** This study aimed to map the distribution of Opisthoris vivini, a foodborne trematode species causing biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma, in Champas province, Lao PDR, identify underlying risk factors, and predict prevalence at non-survey locations.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was conducted in 51 villages in Champas province in 2007. Demographic, socioeconomic, water, sanitation, and behavior data were combined with remotely sensed environmental data into a geographical information system. Bayesian geostatistical models were employed to identify risk factors and investigate spatial pattern of O. vivini. Bayesian krig was used to predict infection at non-survey locations.

**Findings:** The prevalence of O. vivini among 3,371 participants with complete records was 61.1%. Geostat models identified age, Lao ethnic group, educational attainment (farmer, fisherman, animal breeder), and unsafe water source as risk factors. History prazant treatment, access sanitation, and distance to freshwater were protective. Spatial patterns O. viv were governed by environmental factors, predictive identifying two risk profiles: low in mountains and high in Mekong corridor.

**Implications:** This study provides the first risk map of O viv infection in Champas province, crucial for targeting control efforts. Infection O viv is associated with exposure to intermediate host, human behavior, culture, and sustained by lack of sanitation.

**Conclusion:** This study offers new insight into O viv distribution in Champas province, emphasizing environmental factors predict viv prevalence. Bayesian methods incorporate spatial data structure, offering unique features over classical approaches. Spatial models accurately explained risk variability compared non-spatial counterparts. Our results confirm high focality O viv at small scale.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Drains as Larval Habitats in the Transmission of Lymphatic Filariasis and Malaria in Dar es Salaam: A Spatial Analysis of Anopheles and Cule Larvae Presence

**Research Question:** What is the importance of drains as larval habitats in the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria in Dar Sala, and what factors contribute to the presence of Anophe and Cule larvae in these habitats?

**Methods:** We analyzed data collected by the Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special survey conducted in 2006 on mosquito larval habitats in Dar Sala. Focusing on drains, logistic regression was used to evaluate factors impacting the presence of Anophe and Cule larvae. Spatial variation in proportion of habitats containing larvae was assessed through Moran's indicator of spatial association.

**Findings:** More than 70% of larval habitats in Dar Sala were human-made. Aquatic habitats associated with agriculture had the highest proportion of Anophe larvae and second of Cule presence. However, majority of habitats (42%) and 43 (1,364/1,149) of culicine and 33 (320/976) of aneline were drains. Compared to drains with flowing water, odds of Anophe and Cule larvae were 8.8 and 6.3 (p<0.001) times larger in stagnant water. Positive association was found between vegetation and mosquito presence (p<0.001). Proportion of habitats with larvae was spatially correlated.

**Implications:** Restoring and maintaining drains in Dar Sala has potential to eliminate more than 40% of larval habitats treated with laricides by UMCP. Importance of human-made larval habitats for lymphatic filasis and malaria underscores need for synergy between control efforts.

**Conclusions:** Our results provide evidence that drains are common habitat and most containing Anophe and Cx larvae in Dar Sala. However, not preferred by species, since small proportion contained. In contrast, fewer aquatic associated with agriculture more likely found larvae of both species. Majority of larval in Sala are human-made. Drains, pits, and foundations under construction comprised 55 of Anophe and 69 Cx larvae. Characteristics of drains associated with Anophe and Cx larvae discussed and opportunities for coordinated effort to foster synergy between programs control LF and malaria in Sala.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Dengue Virus Replication: Elevated HMG Activity Mediated by AMPK Inhibition Enhances Cholesterol Accumulation in Endoplasmic Reticulum for Replicative Complexes

**Research Question:** How does Dengue virus (DENV) infection modulate host lipid metabolism to facilitate replicative complex formation?

**Methods:** We employed enzymatic assays, ELISA, and Western blotting to investigate the activity of HMG (3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in DENV-infected cells.

**Findings:** Elevated HMG activity was observed in DENV-infected cells, associated with AMPK inactivation. Metformin, an AMPK activator, declined HMG activity, suggesting AMP inactivation mediates enhanced HMG activity. AMPK phosphorylation was reduced in DENV cells at 12 and 24 hours post-infection. HMG and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, indicating a role for HMG and AMP activity in replicative complex formation. Metform and lovastatin, HMG inhibitor, altered co-localization and replicative complex formation, suggesting active HMG is required for replicative formation. Metform showed dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV cells, while compound C, AMP inhibitor, augmented viral copies and infected cells.

**Implications:** DENV infection increases HMG activity through AMP inhibition, leading to cholesterol accumulation inoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complex formation. This study provides new insights into host lipid metabolism during DENV replicative cycle and identifies potential antiviral targets for replication.

**Conclusions:** Elevated HMG activity in DENV cells is mediated by AMPK inhibition, not increased PP2 activity. Inhibition of phosphatase showed antiv effect in HMG-independent manner. These results suggest DENV infection activates HMG through AMP inactivation, leading to cholesterol accumulationoplasmic retic for replicative formation.

**Title:** Bridging the Gap between Kinetics and Thermodynamics: Unveiling the Energy Landscape of tRNA Translocation in the Ribosome

**Research Question:** Can we establish a quantitative bridge between kinetic and thermodynamic measurements of tRNA translocation in the ribosome by analyzing the diffusion of molecular assemblies across the energy landscape?

**Methods:** We employed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 70S ribosome (2.1 million atoms, 1.3 microseconds) to investigate the conformational events associated with tRNA translocation. Starting from a pre-translocation configuration, we identified sets of residues that undergo collective rearrangements implicated in ribosome function. Estimates of diffusion coefficients along these coordinates were used to convert between experimental rates and energy measures of the landscape.

**Findings:** Our analysis, in conjunction with previously reported rates of translocation, provides an upper-bound estimate of free-energy barriers with translocation. We found that the ribosome undergoes a superposition of slow, large-scale collective movements and rapid fluctuations during tRNA translocation. Residues that undergo coordinated displacements, reminiscent of rigid body movements, were identified, including 30-body rotation, 30-head swivel, and tRNA displacements. These motions are essential for substrate translocation.

**Implications:** This study provides a unifying framework for understanding tRNA translocation in the ribosome, bridging the gap between kinetic and thermodynamic measurements. Our results indicate that the ribosome functions as a "thermal machine", where random fluctuations lead to large-scale diffusive configurational rearrangements. This framework can be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions of any number of intermediates and states.

**Conclusions:** We have established a quantitative bridge between kinetic and thermodynamic measurements of tRNA translocation in the ribosome by analyzing the diffusion of molecular assemblies across the energy landscape. Our results provide an upper-bound of free-energy barriers with translocation and highlight the importance of collective motions in ribosome function. This study paves the way for a deeper understanding of ribosome dynamics and its role in protein synthesis.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Landscape of Medullary Thyroid Cancer: Identification of Oncogenic Mutations and Potential Therapeutic Targets**

**Research Question:** The genetic underpinnings of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) remain poorly understood, despite the identification of some oncogenic mutations. This study aimed to explore the genetic profiles of MTC by sequencing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from M patients.

**Methods:** Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were sequenced on the Ion Ampli Cancer Panel 2. We discovered 101 mutations in 18 genes in MTC samples. The most common mutation was in the proto-oncogene, occurring in 47 cases, followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (14), serine/threon kinase 11 (11), v-Hardyuckerman 4 sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (6), mut homolog 1 (4), Kiest sarcoma viral oncogene hom (3), and proto-oncogene (3).

**Findings:** We evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-ap fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two of 98 cases were positive for ALK FISH. To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5 fusion partner of AL, customized cancer sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of two patients. Glutaminefructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GF1)-ALK and echod microtubule-associated protein 4 (E4)-ALK fusions were identified. Additional analysis by Sanger sequencing confirmed GF1-ALK, indicating the fusion result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. Notably, a metastatic M case harboring E4ALK showed a dramatic response to AL inhibitor crizotin.

**Implications:** Our results suggest several mutations in MTC and the first identification of AL fusions in M. The E4ALK in M may be a driver and valid target of AL inhibitors, while GF1 may be a candidate for molecular therapy.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to the understanding of MTC by identifying genetic mutations and AL fusions. Our findings have implications for the development of targeted therapies for M.

**Title:** Asymptomatic Leishiasis: A Hidden Threat to the Goal of Visceral Leishiasis (VL) Elimination Initiative in Asian Countries

**Research Question:** What is the role of asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) in endemic areas, and what is the rate of seroconversion and disease progression to symptomatic VL/PK among asymptomatic individuals?

**Methods:** An active survey was conducted in eight tribal villages to detect asymptomatic leishiasis using r39-based diagnostic kits, followed by three years of follow-up to observe seroconversion and disease pattern. Out of 289 total population, 260 were screened, 185 had antileishial antibody, 96 with history of VL/PDL, and 89 without history. 79 were classified as asymptomatic leishias, 10 active VL with a ratio 7.9:1.

**Findings:** Among 79 asymptomatic cases, 2 were lost to follow-up, 8/77 (10.39%) transformed to disease, 62/77 (80.52%) seroconverted, and 7 (9.09%) remained ser-positive after three years. Progression to disease among asymptomatic individuals occurred up to three years after baseline. If no VL/PK cases for two years, does not mean area free from leishias, as sympt VL/PK may appear after three with asymptomatic cases.

**Implications:** Asympt individuals need attention for VL elimination program initiated by endemic countries. Infection rate varies regionally, 3.16% (79/97) asympt leishial among screened, lower than 5.62-13.8% studies in Bihar. Ratio asymptomatic symptomatic 7.9:1. Individuals with no signs/symptoms VL/PK positive antileishial classified asymptomatic. Asympt who seronegative during follow-up referred seroconversion, developed signs VL/PK disease progression.

**Conclusion:** Asympt leishis a significant challenge to VL elimination goal in Asian countries. Asympt individuals need attention for VL program initiated by endemic countries. If allowed to stay community, chance epidemic future.

**Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Genome Instability Induced by Ty Retrotransposon 912 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Amplification (MLPA)

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of genome instability induced by the retrotransposon Ty912 in Saccharomy cerevisiae, focusing on the formation of genome-wide chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) and aneuploidy.

**Methods:** We employed Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Amplification (MLPA) to analyze a large numbers of Gs induced by the presence of Ty912 in a wild-type strain of S. cerevisiae.

**Findings:**

1.  The distribution of translocations induced by Ty in the wild-type strain was non-random, with a majority of translocations mediated by six hotspots on four chromosomes, despite 254 potential targets in the S. cerevisiae genome.
2. Majority of Ty-mediated translocations resulted from RAD-dependent recombination, but a number of non-recipro trans mediated by RAD-independent recombination between Ty elements.
3. RAD-independent trans did not require Rad51 or Rad59 homolog pairing or Rad1-10 endonuc complex.
4. Defects in ASF-RT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3) resulted in increased Gs and whole-chromosome duplications and anup that tended to occur with Gs.

**Implications:**

1. MLPA is a versatile technique for rapid analysis of Gs, facilitating genetic analysis of pathways that prevent and promote Gs and anup.
2. Ty preferentially recombines with regions of high sequence homology.
3. Four chromosome arms (III, V, XIV, and X) are hotspots for HR events in Ty-mediated translocations.
4. RAD-dependent HR primarily mediated by RAD51 and RAD in S cerevis.

**Conclusions:**

1. Ty-induced Gs in S cerevis result from RAD-dependent and RAD-independent mechanisms.
2. RAD-independent trans do not require Rad51 or Rad59 or Rad1-10.
3. Defects in ASFRT-109 acetylation lead to increased G and anup.
4. MLPA is a valuable tool for studying G and an in S cere.

**Title:** Semi-Definite-Based Underestimation (SD) Algorithm for Protein-Protein Docking: A Novel Approach to Efficiently Exploring the Free Energy Landscape of Complexes

**Research Question:** How can we efficiently explore the free energy landscape of protein-protein complexes to predict accurate docking predictions?

**Methods:** We introduce Semi-Definite-Based Underestimation (SD), a novel algorithm that minimizes funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions (SE(3) while accounting for flexibility of interface chains. SD employs a quadratic underestimation of local minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias sampling. However, direct application to rotational and translational space (SE(3) is challenging due to its geometry. We propose a strategy using independent variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance, and angular descriptors of relative orientations.

**Findings:** Our results on standard docking benchmarks show that the free energy landscape is a funnel in a broad neighborhood of the native state, and SD generates predictions with less than 5 Å ligand Cα-root-mean deviation, achieving a 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods.

**Implications:** The successful application of SD to protein-protein docking validates the assumption that the energy landscape is a funnel in some neighborhood of the native. However, direct application in SE(3 space fails to yield useful underestimators due to energetically favorable distances when proteins are in contact but not overlap. Our method explores the energy surface spanned by encounter complexes, showing similarity to macromolecular association through collisions.

**Conclusions:** The SD algorithm efficiently explores the free surface of encounter complexes corresponding to local energy minima, producing high-quality docking predictions and substantial efficiency gains compared to Monte Carlo methods. By fixing the receptor position and orientation, our method minimizes the free energy function with respect to side chains in the interface using local methods. Although guaranteeing probabilistic convergence to the global minimum under certain conditions, practical docking problems do not satisfy these conditions. Our results demonstrate the potential of SD for protein-protein docking, addressing the central problem of parameterizing the search space and applying to unbound structures.
