**Title:** Quantifying the Progress towards Elimination of Gambian Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo: A Stochastic Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** Despite the significant decline in reported cases of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (H) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over the past two decades, pockets of infection remain, necessitating a quantitative assessment of regional progress towards elimination and targeted intervention focus areas.

**Methods:** We employed a previously developed stochastic model for HAT in the DRC, which was fitted to case data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kivu province, using a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology. The model captured spatial heterogeneity in cases, predicting Kinamba II, with approximately one-third of the zone's cases, would be the last to achieve elimination.

**Findings:** Under current intervention strategies, Kinamba II is expected to achieve elimination in the next year. Deterministic model fitting via MCM was computationally faster but produced indistinguishable posteriorization from stochastic MCM, suggesting deterministic fits for larger areas, with stochastic projections for parameter variation and elimination estimations.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates a mechanistic stochastic model can be fitted to health data in DRC, providing a framework for detailed calibration and projections of future H infections under various scenarios. Unlike previous studies, we modelled villages, our approach considers health areas of approximately 10,000 people, capturing heterogeneity and focal nature of H infections.

**Conclusions:** Our results highlight the importance of quantifying regional progress towards elimination, informing targeted interventions, and resource allocation. The stochastic model's ability to capture parameter variation in reporting and elimination estimations underscores the need for both deterministic and stochastic approaches in public health modeling.

**Title:** Spatial Analysis of Tumor Microenvironments to Predict Patient Outcomes and Identify Key Interactions: A Novel Approach using Spatial Functions and Random Forest Models

**Research Question:** Can we develop a novel approach to summarize spatial relationships in tumor microenvironments (TMEs) and predict patient outcomes, such as survival and treatment success with immunotherapies, by identifying key interactions between tumor and immune cell populations?

**Methods:** We propose an approach using spatial functions and random forest models to analyze ME data from multiplex ion images of triple negative breast and lung cancer patients. Our method involves summarizing spatial relationships in ME using spatial functions and applying functional analysis and random models to predict outcomes and identify important interactions.

**Findings:** Our approach is shown to be effective in identifying spatial interactions while controlling false discovery rate in simulated experiments. We applied the method to two real data sets of multiplex ion images in TNBC and lung cancer. For TNBC, we compared "compartmentalized" and "mixed" groups based on tumor-immune cell interactions. Our method produced functions for cell-cell interactions, reduced dimension using principal components, and combined with patient data to predict outcome.

**Implications:** This novel approach can be used to compare ME between patient groups, identify differences in cell phenotypes, proteins, or mixtures, and predict patient group using ME data. Our method is robust to overfitting and false discovery, demonstrated on simulated data with marked point patterns.

**Conclusions:** We present a novel method for analysis of rich spatial ME data, comparing ME and clinical data from different patients, developing a model to identify differences between groups and predict patient using ME data. Our approach can be applied to various technologies, each with benefits and trade-offs. Comparing ME, spatial relationships between cell types, e.g. tumor and immune, often predictive patient outcomes and guide interventions.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Synaptic and Structural Plasticity on Neural Network Dynamics: A Computational Study of Synchronization and Desynchronization**

**Research Question:** How do synaptic and structural plasticity mechanisms influence neural network dynamics, particularly during synchronization and desynchronization processes, and how are they affected by external perturbations?

**Methods:** We employed a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different plasticity mechanisms: (i) spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), (ii) homeostatic structural plasticity (SP), (iii) a combination of ST and SP without weight-dependent pruning, and (iv) a combination of ST and SP with weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate diverse timescales of neuronal firing, we introduced a stochastic synaptic plasticity (SP) model.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that structural reorganization enhances network synchrony, particularly when weaker connections are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning. Strengthening contacts from neurons with higher firing rates to those with lower rates and weakening in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led reorganization results in emergence of degree-degree correlations and assortativity. We compared stimulation-induced desynchronization in ST-only model with desynchronization models (iii and iv). Latter require significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization.

**Implications:** These findings may inform preclinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive modalities aiming at long-lasting relief of symptoms, e.g., Parkinson's disease.

**Conclusions:** Our study captures interactions of neuronal dynamics, synaptic, and structural while maintaining distinct timescales by employing STDP, connected spiking synaptic change, SP connected neuronal activity, and weight-dependent pruning. We investigate the effect of distinct plastic mechanisms on network states and co-evolution of activity and structure. Computationally, stimulus responses of networks with ST differ from responses with fixed strength, i.e., synaptic weights [21, 23, 24, 33, 62,63]. Our stochastic SP method produces dynamics similar to Butz and van Oen SP (BOSP), computationally faster and neuroscientifically informed.

**Title:** Coordinated Regeneration of Neurons and Glia in Planarians: A Novel Mechanism of Patterned by Delta-Expressing Neurons and Notch-Expressing Progenitors

**Research Question:** How do planarians regenerate large regions of their nervous system, including neurons and glia, and what are the mechanisms underlying this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians, focusing on the role of Delta-2-expressing neurons and Notch-1-expressing progenitors.

**Findings:** We found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing Delta-2 at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems, while glia are specified from Notch-1-expressing mesodermal phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of Delta-2 or Notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but not other phagocytic cell types. Loss of Delta-2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation associated with them, whereas transplantation of Delta-2-express photoreceptors formed glia at ectopic locations.

**Implications:** Our results suggest a model where Delta-2-express neurons instruct phagoc progenitors to differentiate into glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types.

**Conclusion:** We propose a model where patterned expression of Delta-2 in neurons interacts with Notch-express phoc progenitors to accomplish regeneration of planarian neurons and glia. This hypothesis presents a solution to the challenge of coordinated regeneration between neurons and glia, where Delta-2 on neurons and Notch on phoc progenitors specify progenitors to gl fate and differentiate. The modular nature of this mechanism facilitates evolution of new gl configurations in the nervous system by any neuron acquiring or losing Delta- and accessing phoc progenitors.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of γδ T Cells in the Development of Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies against HIV-1: Implications for Vaccine Strategies

**Research Question:** Do γδ T cells play a crucial role in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms and implications for vaccine strategies?

**Methods:** We longitudinally evaluated the frequency and phenotype of γδ T cells from pre-HIV acquisition to acute HIV infection (AHI) in 217 individuals previously characterized as 'broad' and 'non-road' neutralizers, and their association with viral replication and broadly neutralizing antibody (bAb) elicitation.

**Findings:** We found significant differences in γδ cell surface marker expression between participants who developed neutral breadth and those who did not. Activation of γδ cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and was associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on V1δ T and CD57 on V2 T cells were higher in broad neutralizers during AHI and associated with development of neutral breadth later. Moreover, levels of CD16 on V1 T were associated with early Env-specific IgM production. Conversely, V1 T expansion occurred during chronic infection (CH) and was not associated with viral load.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that γδ cells may promote the development of neutral breadth, which has implications for vaccine strategies targeting these cells to improve induced humoral responses, especially broad and potent neutralizing to HIV-1 Env.

**Conclusion:** Understanding the mechanism by which γδ cells promote broadly neutralizing could help develop strategies targeting these cells to improve induced humoral responses. This study evaluated the frequency and phenotype of γ T longitudinally from pre-HIV and during A in participants with or without neutral breadth, allowing to evaluate the contribution of γ cells to control viral replication and promotion of humoral responses. The frequency V2 T was lower at 18 post-HIV positive in participants that developed breadth, reflecting higher VL in those. CD levels on V1 and V2 as well as CD on V2 were higher in that developed breadth.

**Key Takeaways:**

* γδ cells may play a crucial role in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1
* Activation of γ cells within the first weeks of HIV acquisition is associated with viral load
* Expression of CD16 on V1 and CD57 on V2 cells is higher in broad neutralizers and associated with development of breadth
* Levels of CD on V1 are associated with early Env-specific IgM production
* V expansion during chronic infection is not associated with viral load

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Bispecific Antibody Binding to Enhance Metastasis Inhibition: A Quantitative Modeling of Bispecific Antibody- Receptor Interactions

**Research Question:** How do bispecific antibodies (Bs) targeting interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptors (IL-6R and IL-8) inhibit metastasis, and what are the underlying mechanisms of their binding and inhibition?

**Methods:** We developed a quantitative model of the bispecific antibody BS, BS1, targeting IL-6R and IL-8, implicated in a synergistic pathway driving metastasis. The model consisted of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each receptor, antibodies, and antibody-receptor complexes. We simulated monovalent and bivalent interactions between antibody constructs and IL-6, IL-8 receptors to establish how properties and conditions impact binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antody) complex formation.

**Findings:** Our simulations demonstrated that the balance of complex types drives inhibition, providing generalizable predictions for therapeutic design. We found that when IL-6 and IL-8 are present in a 1:1 ratio, bispecific binding is similar to the combination of anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-8 monospecific antibodies. However, when IL-6 and IL-8 are present in a 2:1 ratio, bispecific binding is significantly enhanced. The level of receptor expression is a key determinant of bivalent binding, while the relative amount of target receptors is critical for bis antibodies.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and receptors is a promising approach to inhibiting metastasis and cancer lethality. Bispecific antibodies have tremendous potential, but elucidating mechanisms of binding is crucial for maximizing efficacy. Our model provides insights into affinity and avidity effects, guiding therapeutic design.

**Conclusions:** Bispecific antibodies targeting IL-6 and IL-8 receptors can inhibit metastasis by forming binary and ternary complexes. The balance of complex types drives inhibition, impacting therapeutic efficacy. Our findings provide generalizable predictions for effective design, highlighting the importance of receptor ratio and expression in bispecific binding.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of ZYG-8 in Centrosomal Spindle Assembly and Dynamics in Caenorhabditis elegans Oocytes

**Research Question:** How do centrosomal spindles assemble and maintain stability in oocytes, particularly in the absence of centrioles, and what is the role of ZYG-8, a conserved doubleort-family kinase, in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of ZYG-8 in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes using RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete the protein and analyze spindle morphology, microtule dynamics, and motor activity.

**Findings:** ZYG- depletion resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects, and experiments with monopolar spindles revealed excess outward forces within the spindle, suggesting Z-8 regulates the force-generating motor BM-1/kines-5. Moreover, Z- is required for microtule dynamics within the oocyte and kinase activity is necessary for both meiosis and mitosis.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal new roles for Z- in oocytes and provide insights into how centomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis. We propose that Z- plays at least two roles: 1) regulates microt dynamics to facilitate proper turnover of microtules within the spindle, and 2) influences activity of motors that walk along microtules to tune forces and stabilize the spindle.

**Conclusions:** Z- contains a microtule-binding doubleort domain and kinase domain. Previous studies demonstrated Z- is required for proper spindle positioning in mitotically dividing embryos and modulates microule dynamics in mitosis. Here, we show Z- is required for assembly and stability of oocyte spindle, and kinase activity is necessary for functions in both meiosis and mitosis. Our studies provide new insights into functions of doubleort-family protein in division and shed light on how forces are balanced within centomal spindles, stabilizing the bipolar structure.

**Title:** Elucidating the Interplay between Genetics, Metabolomics, and Type 2 Diabetes: A Comprehensive Insights from the UK Biob and Estonian Biob Datasets

**Research Question:** To investigate the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and type 2 diabetes (T2) in the UKob and Estonianob datasets, and elucidate the extent to which T2 affects metabolite levels and their genetic regulation.

**Methods:** We integrated large-scale T2 genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the DIANTE meta-analysis with metabolomics data from the UKob and Estonianob datasets, comprising 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids (HDL, ID, LDL, VLDL) and lipoproteins. Using Mendelian randomization analyses, we identified 79 metabolites with causal association to T2, spanning lipid-related classes except glucose and tyrosine. Additionally, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis to describe metabolites consistently replicated in the Estonianob dataset, which showed genetic loci in different regions attenuated in T2 cases compared to controls.

**Findings:**

* 79 metabolites are causally associated with T2, twice as many metabolites are affected by T2 liability, spanning all classes including branched amino acids.
* 165 metabolites are associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2 complications, with few discriminating between complication classes.
* 40 metabolites not causally linked to T2 in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to complication occurrence.

**Implications:**

* This study provides a map of T2 consequences on metabolite levels and genetic regulation, enabling better understanding of T2 trajectory to complications.
* T2 seems to impact genetic regulation of metabol levels, rather than vice versa.
* Genetic variants associated with metabol profiles in T2 patients are not associated with T risk in general population.

**Conclusions:**

This study elucidates the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2, providing insights into T consequences on metabolite levels and regulation. Our findings suggest that T2 affects genetic regulation of metabol levels, rather than vice versa, and that genetic variants associated with metabol profiles in T patients are not associated with risk in general. These results have implications for understanding T trajectory to complications and developing targeted therapies.

**Title:** Elucidating the Genetic Basis of Staphylococcus aureus Tolerance: A Novel Insights into the Host-Pathogen Interaction**

**Research Question:** What are the genetic factors contributing to the tolerance of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection in mice, and how do they impact the host-pathogen interaction?

**Methods:** We employed a cross-breeding strategy to generate F1 and F2 populations from Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)-susceptible (CC061) and -tolerant (CC024) mice to investigate the genetic underpinnings of tolerance. We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) peak on chromosome 7 associated with survival and weight change after MRSA infection, where the WSB/EJ allele in CC mice contributed to the tolerant phenotype. Two genes, Car1 and Car2, with high-impact variants in this region, were identified as receptors for complement C5a, anaphylatoxin, which can trigger a massive immune response.

**Findings:** The F1 and F2 generations exhibited 65% and 55 survival rates, respectively, following a complex inheritance pattern for the CC increased survival phenotype. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than their parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. We identified a QTL peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection, where the WSB/EJ allele in CC mice contributed to the MR tolerant phenotype. Two genes, Car1 and Car, with high-impact variants in this region, were identified as receptors for complement C5 anaphylato, which can trigger a massive immune response.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that genetic factors in CC mice contribute to tolerance to MRSA infection, despite high colonization in organs. We hypothesize that C5 may have altered binding variant in CC mice, reducing cytokine damage and resulting in ability to tolerate higher pathogen burden and longer.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the genetic basis of S. aureus tolerance, highlighting the importance of host-pathogen interaction. The identified QTL on chromosome 7 and genes Car1 and Car contribute to the tolerant phenotype in CC mice. These findings have implications for understanding S. aureus infection and developing therapeutic strategies to enhance host tolerance.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Gene Regulatory Networks on Adaptive Evolution: A Quantitative Trait Modeling and Simulation Study

**Research Question:** How do gene regulatory networks influence the availability of beneficial alleles and the distribution of fitness effects during adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum?

**Methods:** We employed a forward genetic simulation approach to model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple regulatory network, the autoregulation motif, and measured adaptive walks towards a phenotyp optimum in both additive and network models.

**Findings:** Contrary to the expectation from adaptive theory, both models harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles. The network model exhibited a complex bimodal distribution of fitness among mutations, with a considerable density of deleterious coefficients, reminiscent of the cost of complexity where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Our results suggest that interactions from genetic networks generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness.

**Implications:** This study highlights the underexplored area of genetic influence on adaptation, particularly in the study of distribution of fitness effects. We observed similarities between network and additive models in aspects of adaptive walks, including the number of steps and distribution of effects among fixations and beneficial mutations. However, network models were starved of large-effect mutations more than additive as the walk progressed, and approached the optimum more slowly.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the importance of considering gene networks in models of adaptation. Our approach combines biological realism with existing tools for the evolution of quantitative traits, allowing us to evaluate the shape of distribution among beneficial mutations during adaptive walks. We found stark differences from classical expectations in some cases, emphasizing the need for a more nuanced understanding of genetic influence on adaptation.

**Title:** Bayesian Integration in Cortical Circuits: A Novel Dynamics of Conductance-Based Neurons and Synapses for Optimal Information Processing

**Research Question:** How do cortical circuits integrate information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior, and what is the biological implementation of the required computations?

**Methods:** We propose a novel Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses, suggesting they are equipped to optimally perform information integration. We model apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials, parametrized by local quantities, effective potentials and conductances.

**Findings:** Under these assumptions, the somatic compartment naturally computes the posterior. We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their reliabilities. Our theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration, illustrated with simulations. We make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and plasticity.

**Implications:** Our conduct-based Bayesian view predicts neuronal properties differing from classical models. Somatic membrane reflects prior in absence of sensory input, allowing dendritic to adjust reliability. We derive somatic dynamics and plasticity via stochastic ascent on posterior distribution. Simulations demonstrate learning multisensory integration.

**Conclusions:**

Our novel Bayesian view of conductance-based neurons and synapses provides a framework for optimal information integration in cortical circuits. By representing priors in apical and likelihoods in basal dendrites, the somatic naturally computes posterior. The derived plasticity rule enables neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by reliability. This theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multiensory integration and makes experimentally testable predictions on dendritic integration and plasticity. Our approach offers a new perspective on the biological implementation of Bayesian computations in the brain.

**Title:** Large-Scale Domain Annotation of Proteomes using Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) and AlphaFold Predictions: Implications for Protein Classification Strategies

**Research Question:** Can large-scale domain annotation of proteomes using Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) from AlphaFold predictions aid in the development of biological insights, and what are the implications for protein classification strategies?

**Methods:** We employed EC as a basis for classification to describe and catalog domains from 48 proteomes in the AlphaFold Database, resulting in the classification of 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins comprised of 226,424,000 amino acid residues. We examined the populations of homologous groups in eukaryotes and bacteria, and enumerated highly populated domains shared between the two, such as Rossm, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains.

**Findings:** eukotes showed a higher proportion of disordered regions and unassigned domains, as well as repeated globular and small proteins, while bacteria had a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned. We compared the sampling of homolog groups from the whole proteome against our EC reference and found that structure-based predictions enriched groups previously unannotated by sequence classifications. The resulting domains from proteomes provided biological insights for their respective organisms and were made available on the EC website.

**Implications:** The flood of protein predictions after AlphaFold release prompted us to examine the behavior of domain classification on broad proteomes. The division into easily classified domains, difficult-to-recognize homology, or unstructured, or no domains will continue to be a strategy for large datasets. We classified 48 proteomes in AF, including zebraf, flies, and E. coli. The classification rate for eukotes was lower, likely due to prediction and contextual errors. On average, DP returned 98% of residues (Fig 1). The access to previously unclassifiable proteins diminished the gap between structural and sequence classification. We illustrated homolog groups enriched by domains and sequence annotations to estimate the degree structure expanded our knowledge of unknown domains.

**Conclusions:** Large-scale domain annotation proteomes using EC and AlphaFold can aid biological insights and inform protein classification strategies. The division of proteomes into easily classified, difficult-to-recognize, or unstructured domains will continue to be useful for large datasets. The access to previously unclass proteins reduced the gap between structural and sequence classification, and expanded our knowledge of unknown domains.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of BK Polyomavirus Replication: A Novel Insights into the Role of Host Cell Cycle in Viral Expression and Replication**

**Research Question:** How does BKomavirus (BKPy) utilize the host cell cycle to facilitate its replication and expression, and what are the implications for antiviral therapy?

**Methods:** We employed single-cell analysis to investigate the expression of BKV T antigen (TAg) throughout the cell cycle, revealing that robust TAg expression is required for host DNA replication. Using inhibitors that selectively target host replication, we demonstrated that TAg expression and viral production rely on initial S phase. We also examined the role of host cell cycle regulators in BKV replication, finding that subsequent rounds of DNA replication rely on canonical machinery despite infection.

**Findings:** Contrary to the current model, where TAg is expressed early and pushes cells into S for replication, our data supports a new model where BKV requires initial S to replicate, aligning with other small DNA viruses like papilloma and adenoviruses. Robust TAg expression was observed in ≥4 cells, suggesting BKV production depends on initial phase. Chemical inhibition of host replication showed that viral replication relies on initial S. BKV is unique in re-replicating host DNA, with re-replication required for replication.

**Implications:** These findings change our understanding of BKV life cycle, requiring initial S for robust T expression and production. Late gene expression of VP/3 followed robust TAg, suggesting infectious virions form in replicating cells. This challenges the current model, where TAg precedes late proteins, but replication occurs after 4N.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a novel mechanism of BKom replication, where robust TAg expression depends on initial host S and BKV primarily replicates during re. Understanding these molecular events will aid in identifying therapeutic targets against BKV, a major cause of kidney transplant failure with no antiviral.

**Title:** FIO: A Novel Transcriptome-Wide Association Fine-Mapping Method for Binary Traits

**Research Question:** Can a novel transcriptome-wide association fine-mapping (TWAS) method be developed to identify causal genes associated with binary traits by jointly modeling all genes on an entire chromosome, accounting for gene expression correlation among genes in linkage disequilibrium (LD)?

**Methods:** We introduce FIO, a TW fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits, employing a probit model to link genetically regulated expression (GRe) of genes to outcomes while accounting for GRe among genes on a chromosome. Unlike existing approaches, FIO models all genes on a chromosome to capture correlations not captured by small genomic regions, potentially increasing power.

**Findings:** In extensive simulations and analyses of six binary traits in UK Biobank, FIO reduced the size of causal sets by 27.9%-36.9% over existing methods. Leveraging improved power, FIO prioritized multiple genes associated with diseases, including GATA for asthma, ABC2 for gout, and SHB for hypertension.

**Implications:** FIO represents an effective tool for TW fine-mapping binary traits, addressing limitations of existing methods. Jointly modeling genes on a chromosome may capture correlations not captured by small regions, increasing power.

**Conclusions:** FIO, a novel TW fine-m method for binary traits, offers calibrated statistics and high power. Unlike existing approaches, FIO models the binary outcome through probit and all genes on a chromosome to account for GRe within and between blocks, reducing error and enhancing precision. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) algorithm for inference makes FIO scalable to large datasets.

**Title:** Protein Sequestration as a Key Defense Mechanism against Oxidative Stress-Induced Protein Aggregation

**Research Question:** How do the Hsp42 and Btn proteinqueases maintain proteostasis during oxidative stress conditions?

**Methods:** We investigated the roles of H42 and Btn proteinases in sequesting misfolded proteins during oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure.

**Findings:** Our results show that H42 and Btn are required for tolerance to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. They act to sequest oxidized proteins into proteasome quality control (PQC) sites following ROS exposure, and their absence leads to accumulation of protein aggregates. Overexpression of H104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance. We identified the Sup35 translation factor as an in vivo sequease substrate and show that H and Btn act to suppress oxid-induced formation of the [PS+] prion, an amyloid form of Sup35.

**Implications:** Our data identify protein sestration as a key antioxidant mechanism that mitigates the consequences of protein-induced aggregation.

**Conclusions:** Protein sestration is a defense mechanism that prevents dysfunction and toxicity associated with protein misfolding diseases. We show that Btn and H42 are key chaperones required for oxidant that sequest misfolded proteins into PQC sites following ROS exposure. The sequestration of aggregates is an important strategy that prevents dysfunction and toxicity associated with protein misolding diseases. Our data show that Btn and H42 mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, implicating a functional role for sestration in oxidant tolerance. Together, our data demonstrate that Btn and H42 act to protect against amorph and amyloid protein aggregation during oxidative conditions.

**Title:** Identification of Novel Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) Regulating Glioblastoma (GB) Invasion via CRISPR-Interference (CRPR) Screen

**Research Question:** What long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a role in glioblastoma (GB) invasion, and can they be targeted for therapeutic intervention?

**Methods:** We conducted a large-scale CRISPR-interference (CRPR) screen of 2,307 candidate lncRNAs to identify those associated with glioma cell invasion in vitro. We used CRPR to knockdown lRNAs and evaluated invasion capacity in Matrig cell lines. Top candidates were validated using CRPR and oligonucleotide (AS)-mediated knockdown in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Atlas (TCGA) and Genotypeissue (GT) Expression analysis. Mediators of lRNA effect were identified via differential expression following lRNA knockdown and rescue experiments.

**Findings:** Forty lRNAs were significantly associated with 33-83% decrease in invasion (p < 0.01) upon knockdown. Top candidate, LINC45, demonstrated 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knock, while L45 expression was associated with patient survival and tumor grade (p < 0.0001). RNA analysis of L45 knock revealed WAS3, implicated in tumor studies, was highly correlated with lRNA, while WAS knock was associated with significant decrease in invasion. WAS overexpression rescued invasive function lost with L45 KD.

**Implications:** CRPR screening identified L45, a previously unannotated lRNA, as critical to GB invasion. Expression is associated with tumor grade and survival. RNAq and mechanistic studies suggest this novel lRNA regulates via WAS3.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first large-scale CRPR screen of lRN implicated in glioblast invasion. We identified L45 as significantly associated with glioma cell invasion across three tumor lines. Our results highlight the potential of CRPR as a tool for identifying novel lRNAs affecting glioma invasion and therapeutic targets.

**Title:** Unveiling the Brain's Probabilistic Models of Auditory Sequences: A Novel Clustering Approach to EEG Data Analysis

**Research Question:** How does the brain assign probabilistic models to sequences of auditory stimuli, and what classes of models does it use to perform this task?

**Methods:** We employed a novel clustering procedure to analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain. This approach allowed us to identify the regularities in the brain's model of the sequence.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the brain uses the recurrence of regular auditory stimuli to build a model of the sequence. Specifically, we extracted from EEG data the fingerprints of the putative model the brain assigns to the sequence of auditory stimuli, suggesting that the brain relies on the occurrence of strong beats in the stochastic sequence to select a model of random stimuli.

**Implications:** This study addresses the long-standing issue of identifying the classes of models used by the brain to organize sequences of regularities of stimuli. Our findings provide evidence that the brain uses recurrence of auditory stimuli to build a model, rather than assuming a particular class of models as previously proposed. This has significant implications for understanding how the brain processes auditory information and generates expectations.

**Conclusions:** Our novel clustering approach to EEG data analysis reveals the brain's probabilistic model of auditory sequences, shedding light on the long-standing question of how the brain organizes regularities of stimuli. We demonstrate that the brain uses recurrence of strong beats in the sequence to select a model of random stimuli, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms of auditory processing. This study contributes to the understanding of the brain's probabilistic models of sequences, a fundamental aspect of cognition and perception.

**Title:** Overcoming the Limitations of Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Analysis in Solid Tissues: Introducing Cell-Specific Weighting Coefficients

**Research Question:** Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at single resolution, but fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size and dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression, particularly in heterogeneous tissues requiring dissociation for analysis. This discrepancy exists between bulk RNA-seq results and reconstituted bulk-seq using sc-se data.

**Methods:** We propose a computationally calculated coefficient, cell-specific weighting factor (cWF) to address these limitations. We introduce the concept and method of computing cWF for 76 cell types across 10 solid organs and validate its fidelity by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk-se data using sc-se data and c.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that c effectively predict aging progression, implicating diagnostic applications and association with aging. Our study provides a method to solve critical sc-se analysis of complex tissues.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest diagnostic and biological significance of c. We validate c by five methods: 1) reconstitution, 2 deconvolution of whole-se using composite-sc data, 3 comparison to experimentally measured transcriptcontents, 4 independence from cell ratios, and 5 prediction unmatched-se and-sc data.

**Conclusions:** This study addresses limitations of sc-se in solid tissues by developing method to compute c to offset transcript size and dissoci/processing problem. We calculate c for 76 across 10 and illustrate utilities. Our method provides accurate reconstitution and deolution of-se data using weighted by c, recapitulating experiment-determined mRNA-differences.

**Title:** Radial Multivariable Mendelian Randomization: A Novel Approach for Visualizing and Addressing Pleiotropy in Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Analyses

**Research Question:** Can we develop a novel approach to visualize and address pleiotropy in multivar Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analyses, a statistical method that estimates the direct effects of multiple exposures on an outcome using genetic variants as instrumental variables?

**Methods:** We propose Radial MR, a formulation of MVM that visualizes the effect of each exposure within an analysis and allows for the identification of pleiotropic variants. Radial MR includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs that violate one or more assumptions of MVM. We developed the Radial MR package, a software implementing the methods, and demonstrated its effectiveness through simulations and analyses.

**Findings:** Radial MR effectively visualizes causal estimates and provides diagnostic information on the underlying assumptions of MVM. We applied Radial MR to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease (CHD) and showed that removal of outlying SNPs decreased bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy.

**Implications:** Radial MR facilitates the assessment of pleotropic associations between genetic variants and phenotypes using GWAS data, allowing for effective visualization of outliers and direct estimation of multiple exposures. Our approach addresses the multidimensional nature of MVM analyses, making it a valuable tool for exploring features of M analyses.

**Conclusions:** Radial MR is a novel approach for visualizing and addressing pleiotropy in MVM analyses, enabling the identification of pleotropic variants and removal of outlying SNPs. The Rad MR package provides a range of tools for exploring features of M analyses, making it a valuable resource for researchers. Radial MR effectively visualizes causal estimates and provides diagnostic information on the assumptions of M, making it an essential tool for M analyses.

**Title:** Multiscale Analysis of Drosoph melanogaster Behavior Reveals Novel Insights into Circadian Rhythms and Health Indicators

**Research Question:** How do Drosoph melanogaster exhibit behavioral patterns across different timescales, from seconds to days, and how do these patterns relate to circadian rhythms and health indicators?

**Methods:** We recorded 47 individual D. melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days in featureless arenas on sucrose-agar media using a deep learning framework, SLE, to produce a full-body pose dataset of nearly 2 billion instances. We identified stereotyped behaviors, such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion, and used ethograms to explore flies' behavior across time and days.

**Findings:** We found distinct patterns in stereotyped behaviors, including trends in grooming modalities, probis extension, and locom speed, providing new insights into D. melanog circadian cycle. Notably, the hour after dawn was a unique point in flies' daily pattern, tracking with behavioral composition correlating with locom speed and time spent resting. Our high-resolution data revealed differences in morning and evening activity peaks, primarily in grooming behavior, and daily patterns in measured behaviors, including grooming, probis extension, and locomotion.

**Implications:** This study provides a clearer picture of D. melan behavior across timescales, revealing novel features of unexplored biological mechanisms. We found a decline in probis extension and locomotion as time spent in idle increased across days, with the hour after dawn tracking behavioral health. Our data also showed differences in morning and evening peaks, primarily in grooming, and daily patterns in measured behaviors, including grooming, probis, and locomotion.

**Conclusions:** Investigating interactions between timescales requires an organism with broad behaviors and short lifespan, allowing capture of breadth of times. D melanogaster have rich behaviors, many spontaneous and simple environments. Previous studies used coarse metrics, such as D Activity Monitors, showing peaks locom activity around morning and evening, anticipating lighting changes. We recorded freely moving D melanaster constant illumination, tracking 14 parts using SLE and MotionMapper, unsupervised method, developing definitions stereot states, grooming, locom, and probis extension.

**Title:** Unveiling Novel Functions of the Conserved Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Nonreceptor PTP-22 in Caenorhabditis elegans: A Role in Molting, Cell Adhesion, and Cytoskeletal Regulation

**Research Question:** What are the novel functions of the conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor P-22 (PTP-22) in Caenorhabitis elegans, beyond its previously established role in immunoregulation?

**Methods:** We employed a non-bi genetic screen to identify genes that interact with P-22, a conserved tyine phosphatase nonceptor, and found that loss of P-22 phosphat activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved N-related kinases NE-2 (NE/NEK) and NE-3 (NE/NE). To understand the functions of P-22, we carried out proximity labeling studies to identify interactors of P-22 during development and identified the CDC guanine nucleotide exchange factor DN-1 (DN) as an in vivo partner of P22. Consistent with this interaction, loss of DN- also suppressed ne-associated molting defects.

**Findings:** Our studies revealed novel roles for P-22 in nemode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. P22 was found to interact with the N-related kinases NE-2 and NE-3, which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation. Proximity labeling studies implicated P22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesomes, suggesting that P22 plays a broad role in maintaining tissue integrity. Localization and proximity also implicated P22 in functions connected nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline, where nearly one-third of identified P22 interactors are known gran components.

**Implications:** These findings highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions and suggest that P22 plays a conserved role in molting, adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation in C. elegans. The interaction between P22 and N-related kinases may exert opposing effects on common substrates or act distinct components within a discrete pathway. These results implicate P22 in cell adhesion, although functions beyond the immune system remain largely unexplored.

**Conclusions:** This study establishes P22 as an effector of C elegans molting and identifies novel functions in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal regulation, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. The interaction between P22 and N-related kinases suggests a complex regulatory mechanism in molting and adhesion, warranting further investigation.

**Title:** Spatio-Temporal Mapping of Artemisinin Resistance in Southeast Asia: A Critical for Malaria Elimination Efforts

**Research Question:** How does the prevalence of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia change over time and space, and what are the implications for malaria elimination efforts?

**Methods:** We used a comprehensive dataset from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network (WWARN) on non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch13 (K) gene, associated with artem resistance, and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artem resistance.

**Findings:** Our maps show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 202, with the most change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The model provides insights into spatial and temporal trends of artem resistance not possible with data alone, enabling improved decision support on unprecedented spatial resolution.

**Implications:** Predicting spatio-temp patterns and extents of artem resistance at the subcontinent level provides critical information for malaria goals in Southeast Asia.

**Conclusions:** This study provides the first spatio-temporal maps of artem resistance in Southeast Asia, enabling monitoring, targeting of strategies, and elimination efforts. Fine-scale predictive maps do not exist for artem within Asia, but molecular markers associated with resistance offer a way forward. With significant data on K markers, predictive spatio-temp maps are presented for the changing landscape of artem derivatives across the Greater Mekong Subregion. These maps estimate resistance for locations with no data, guiding agencies to prioritise surveillance, policies, and prevent further spread.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Autoinhibition in FI-Containing Proteins: NLR1 and CARD8 in the Inflamome Signaling Pathway**

**Research Question:** How do NLR1 paralogs and CARD8, components of the inflamome signaling pathway, form autoinhibitory complexes and regulate the innate immune response?

**Methods:** We employed biochemical approaches to characterize the autohibitory complexes of CARD and rodent NLR1 variants, including murine NLR1 (mLR1) and rat NLR1 (rLR1), revealing distinct mechanisms of NT-CT and FLCT interactions.

**Findings:** Both NLR paralogs and CARD form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FLCT interactions, with distinct mechanisms. The linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 (mLR1) plays a crucial role in forming NT-CT autohibitory, while the Z5 of rat NLR (LR) and CARD mediates NT-CT interaction. Additionally, we explored the involvement of protease dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and significance of domain.

**Implications:** Our study enhances understanding of the regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in inflame inhibition and activation, underscoring the complexity of interactions within the immune response.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that NLR paralogs and CARD exist in a steady state characterized by formation of NT-CT and FL- autohibitory, suggesting conserved mechanism among FI-containing proteins. NLR1 and CARD can be activated by pathogenic proteases through "functional degradation", where proteases cleave NT, leading to degradation of both NT and FL, liberating CT for inflame assembly.

**Key findings:**

* NLR1 parogs and CARD form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FLCT interactions with distinct mechanisms
* Linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR plays essential role in NT-CT autohibitory
* Z5 of rat NLR and CARD mediates NT-CT interaction
* Dipeptid peptidase 9 (D9) interacts with NT of NLR1 and CARD through Z5 subdomain, forming NT-D9-CT complex
* D9 cannot bind to NT of human NLR1
* D9 involved in NT-CT of rodent NLR and CARD, but does not influence inhibitory activity on CT

**Title:** The Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum-1 (Rer1) in Regulating Protein Homeostasis and Cell Survival in the Drosophila Wing Epithelium

**Research Question:** How does the Endoplasm Reticulum-1 (er) protein regulate protein homeostasis and influence cell survival in the developing Dophila wing epithelium?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of er1 in regulating protein homeasis in the Doph wingel using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We generated er mutant flies and analyzed the effects of er loss on protein homeasis and cell survival. We also examined the role of er in My-induced overgrowth and found that er levels are upregulated upon My-overexpression.

**Findings:** Our results show that loss of er leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukary initiation factor 2 (eIF2), indicating onset of prote stress in the endoplasm reticulum (ER). This is consistent with the proposed function of er as a regulator of ER homeasis. Furthermore, we found that er mutant cells are identified as "losers" and eliminated through cell competition when surrounded by wild-type cells. We also found that er levels are upregulated upon My-overexpression, which alleviates prote stress and supports My-driven overgrowth.

**Implications:** These findings demonstrate that er acts as a novel regulator of protein homeasis in Doph and reveal its role in competitive survival. Our results suggest that er provides cytoprotection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating prote stress, thereby supporting overgrowth. This study provides evidence for the conserved function of er in regulating homeasis across species, including yeast, worms, and mouse cortex.

**Conclusion:** In summary, our study reveals the function of er in regulating protein homeasis and survival in the Doph wingel. We show that er is localized to the ER and Golgi compartments and loss er activates PER-mediated phosphorylation of e2, indicating prote stress in the ER. Our results are consistent with the proposed function of er as a regulator of ER homeasis. We also found that er levels are upregulated upon My-over, which alleviates stress and supports overgrowth. These findings highlight the importance of er in regulating homeasis and survival in the developing wingel.

**Title:** Loss-of-Function Mutations in the Checkpoint Kinase Gene CHEK2 are Associated with Increased Risk of Breast and Other Cancers: Functional Characterization of Non-Synonymous Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) using Yeast Complementation Assay

**Research Question:** How do non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of the checkpoint kinase gene CHE2 (CHE2) impact its function and contribute to cancer risk?

**Methods:** We employed a high-throughput deep mutational scanning (DMS) approach to test the ability of 4,887 possible SNVs in the CHE2 open reading frame to complement the yeast ortholog of CHE2, RAD53. A comprehensive library of CHE coding variants was generated using error-prone PCR, screened en masse for rad complementation, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified complementors in selected yeast.

**Findings:** Among non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein function, while 2,417 were tolerated. Our results correlate with previous structure-function data and provide an additional functional assay for variants of uncertain significance in clinical databases.

**Implications:** This approach can help predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants of uncertain found in screening and be applied to other cancer genes. Yeast complementation has been used to assess protein function of several CHE2 pathogenic and likely-pathogenic variants, including the founder mutation c.110del, which failed to complement rad mutants.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that rad complementation correlates with known function and pathogenicity, allowing us to functionally classify 3,187 amino changes from non-syn SNVs. We refer variants reducing CHK function in yeast as "damaging" and those functionally indistinguishable from wild as "tolerated". This method can be used to predict function of CHE2 variants uncertain in screening and applied to other cancer genes.

**Title:** Regulation of Epigenetic and Phenotypic Diversity in Streptococcus pneumoniae by the Spx1-TA Toxin-Antoxin System

**Research Question:** How does Streptoccus pneumoniae control the epigenetic and phenotypic diversity through the inversion of hS genes in the opacity determinant (cod locus?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the Spx1-TA toxin-antoxin system in regulating hS inversions and epigen and phenotypes in S pneumoniae.

**Findings:** We discovered a novel type II toxin-antoxin system in S pneumonia, Spx1-TA, where toxin TenA is transcriptionally repressed by antitoxin Spx1. Overexpression of Ten led to growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S pneumonia, while antitox Spx1 repressed the transcription of the sp1A-ten operon. Spontaneous variations in the AT-nucleotide repeat in the promoter region of the sp1A-ten operon act as a genetic switch generating pneumoccal subpopulations with epetic and phenotyp diversity.

**Implications:** The Spx-T system regulates epigen and phenotypes by targeting pneumoc protein synthesis. Ten binds to ribosome factor Rim, reducing ComX expression, and enhancing invertase psA transcription, favoring transparent colony-associated hS configurations. Moderate Ten expression reshapes pneumoc epigen and colony.

**Conclusions:** The Spx-T system is a previously uncharacterized type II toxin-antoxin, with Ten repressed by antit S1. Spontaneous variations in the AT-nucle repeat region of the spA- operon act as a programmed switch generating pneumoc subpopulations with epetic and phen diversity. This study reveals a new mechanism of epetic adaptation in S pneumonia.

**Title:** Generalized Contrastive Principal Component Analysis (gcPCA): A Hyperparameter-Free Dimensionality Reduction for Comparative Analysis of High-Dimensional Biological Data

**Research Question:** How can we develop a dimensionality reduction technique that enables the comparison of two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one?

**Methods:** We propose Generalized Contrastive Principal Component Analysis (gcPCA), a hyperparameter-free approach that addresses the limitations of traditional contrastive PCA, which requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions with no way of knowing which is correct, and treats foreground and background conditions differently.

**Findings:** We demonstrate the role of the hyperparameter in contrast PCA and explain how gc avoids this requirement. We provide an open-source gcPCA toolbox with Python and MATLAB implementations of variants tailored for different scenarios. Analyze high-dimensional biological data using gc, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II in single-cell RNA sequencing.

**Implications:** gcPCA is a fast, robust, and easy-to-use method facilitating analysis of high-dimensional datasets to gain insights into complex biological phenomena.

**Conclusions:** gc addresses the limitations of contrast PCA, enabling comparison of two conditions symmetrically and eliminating the need for hyperparameter tuning. gc provides a valuable resource for the analysis of diverse high-dimensional data.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the abstract:

**Background:** High-dimensional data are ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and comparing datasets under different conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns in one is desirable. Traditional dimensionality techniques cannot accomplish this as they operate on one dataset. Contrast PCA was proposed to address this, but has little adoption due to hyperparameter requirement and unequal treatment of conditions.

**Methodology:** We introduce gc, a hyper-free approach that solves these problems. First, we explain the role of hyper in PCA and how gc avoids it. Then, we provide an open-source gc toolbox with Python and MATLAB implementations for different scenarios.

**Results:** Analyze high-dimensional data using gc, revealing unsup detection of hippocal replay and heterogeneity of type II in single-cell sequencing. gc is fast, robust, and easy-to-use, facilitating insights into complex phenomena.

**Significance:** gc provides a valuable resource for the analysis of high-dimensional data, addressing limitations of contrast PCA.

**Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of B Cell Receptor Signaling in B Lymphomas: A Semi-Quantitative Modeling and Network Analysis of BCR Signaling in Burkitt Lymphoma Cells

**Research Question:** How does B cell receptor (BCR) signaling contribute to the survival and maturation of B cells, and how is it deregulated in B lymphomas, particularly in the context of proximal B signaling and downstream effector pathways?

**Methods:** We employed a semi-quantitative modeling approach to analyze BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells, unveiling feedback and cros structures in the BCR network, including negative cros from p38 to ME/ERK.

**Findings:** Our models revealed a comprehensive network of BCR signaling, including a negative cros from p38 to MEK/ER, which was verified by phosphoproteomics on ERK and ERK sites in different BL cells. Notably, the BL-2 network was transferable to BL-41 cells, and also modeled BCR signaling in diffuse large cell lymphoma lines with aberrant B signaling (HBL-1, OCIY), indicating that B aberration does not cause major rewiring.

**Implications:** This study establishes a semi-quantitative network of BCR, which can be used as a starting point for cell-specific, individual networks, supporting the view that our model reflects common intracellular signaling of B-cell. Phosphoprote analyses of interventions support key insights of this model. Moreover, the BL-2-derived network forms a solid base to describe signaling in DLBCL with aberrant B signaling.

**Conclusions:** Despite discovering feedback and cros in ER and p38 signaling, no cellular dependency was found in studied lines. However, conserved motifs across B lymphomas suggest that insights may apply to other lymphomas. Importantly, extending the network modeling procedure discovered novel connections: positive c from mTOR to JNK, positive from GSK to ZAP, and negative from p38 on RAF/ME/ER. Our semi-quantitative model of BCR in BL-2 assesses if the network describes B signaling in a general.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Notch Signalling in Angiogenesis: A Novel Insights into DLL4 and JAG1 Interactions

**Research Question:** How do the Notch ligands DLL4 and JAG1 regulate angiogenic sprouting, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms of their opposing actions?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches to investigate the control of Notch receptor activity by DLL and J1, focusing on their roles in angiogenic sprouting.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that DLL4, rather than J1, induces Notch1 receptor activation, and that J1 directly blocks DLL-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a J1/DLL complex. We propose a new model of Not signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells necessary for sprouting angiogenesis.

**Implications:** Our work uncovers a previously overlooked role for heteromeric J1/DLL complexes, enabling angiogenic sprouting by regulating endothelial cell differentiation into tip and stalk cells. We argue that hetereric J1/DLL complex, formed when ligands are expressed in the same cell, relieves Notch receptor inhibition, enabling efficient Notch signalling. Our results suggest that two factors underlie the mechanism by which J1 antagonizes DLL to enable tip and stalk cell selection in angiogenic sprouting.

**Conclusions:** Consistent with experimental findings, DLL homomers and DLL-J1 heteromers mediate Notch cis-inhibition. Angiogenic sprouting involves a regulated interplay between Not signalling and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEF) receptor (VEF) signalling. Based on new results, we elaborate DLL/J1-Not signalling model and propose a theoretical DLL1-Not-VEF signalling model. We present a model of Not signalling incorporating the finding that J1 directly antagonizes DLL through formation of hetereric DLL-J1 complexes, underlying observed effects of J1 and DLL in sprouting angiogenesis.

**Significance:** This study advances understanding of Not signalling through mathematical coupled in silico modelling of molecular and cellular processes. Existing models have addressed distinct roles of J1 and DLL in angiopatterning. Our work highlights the importance of hetereric J1/DLL complexes in angiogenic patterning and provides a framework for further investigation of Not signalling mechanisms.

**Title:** Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM): A Bayesian Nonparametric Clustering Algorithm for Uncertain Data

**Research Question:** How can we develop a clustering algorithm that incorporates uncertainty associated with data points to improve the accuracy of clustering results in bioinformatics and other fields?

**Methods:** We propose Dirich Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM), an extension of Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that utilizes uncertainty associated data. We evaluate DPM on simulated data and immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to sample size.

**Findings:** DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data and separates autoimmune diseases from other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. Additionally, we introduce a procedure for summarizing gene expression datasets using gene signatures, incorporating variability across genes within individuals. We apply DPM to three public expression datasets with IMD, replicating associations between disease and clusters.

**Implications:** This work has two-fold significance. Firstly, we demonstrate that uncertainty should inform clustering and present a method, DPM. Secondly, we introduce a procedure for using gene signatures in new datasets, showing its value in summarizing expression data with IMD using DPM.

**Conclusions:** Our clustering by GWAS features recapitulates known relationships in IMD and suggests uses for clustering uncertainty, such as polygenic scores. Our method of summarizing gene expression extends signatures, accounting for variability, crucial in complex datasets. Ignoring uncertainty led to clusterings not associated with disease. Gene signatures linked to IMD, we cluster patients with three datasets, replicating associations. Bayesian methods offer advantages in conveying uncertainty and inferring clusters, we adapt Dirich process model to uncertain data, Dirich Process Mixtures Uncertainty (DPM). Accounting for uncertainty alters clustering and demonstrates performance on simulated and real applications. We consider IMD using GWAS statistics, where uncertainty varies systematically with sample size.

**Title:** Investigating the Shape-Dependence of Primate Vision in Deep Neural Networks: A Study on the Bias towards Color and Texture Features

**Research Question:** Why do deep neural networks, despite their remarkable success in modeling the primate visual system, fail to account for the shape-dependence of primate vision, relying heavily on features like color and texture instead of shape?

**Methods:** We designed simple artificial image datasets where shape, color, and texture can be used to predict the image class. We trained networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations, demonstrating that some architectures are unable to learn shape, while others can use shape but are biased towards other features.

**Findings:** Our results show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between weight updates in mini-batch gradient descent, suggesting different algorithms with sparser, more local changes are required to make networks sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the need for changes in the learning algorithm rather than network architecture to enable deep networks to recognize shapes. We argue that the bias arises from the dynamics of gradient learning, specifically the way gradients for color and texture align with classes. Breaking this alignment requires changing the gradients, except for spConvNet, all convolution networks show bias for color or texture over shape.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that convolution networks can classify our datasets by shape but fail to learn shape-based if another feature (color or texture) is sufficient to predict the class. Humans rely on shape, while networks prefer other features like color or size. Our analysis on ConvNet shows that bias arises from the dynamics of gradient learning, specifically the way gradients for color and texture align with classes. Reducing this alignment enables networks to learn shape-based classification.

**Title:** Multiscale Modeling of Hepatic Stellate Cell Dynamics during Liver Fibrosis and Reversion: A Novel Insights into the Regulatory Role of Inactivated Hepatic Stellate Cells

**Research Question:** How do hepatic stellate cells (HSC) contribute to the development and progression of liver fibrosis, and what is the role of inactivated hepatic stellate cells (iSC) in liver homeostasis?

**Methods:** We developed a multiscale model using the Kappa language to study HSC dynamics during liver fibrosis and reversion. The model represents HSC as agents with seven physiological states interacting with TGFβ molecules, which regulate H activation and secretion of type I collagen, the main ECM component. We validated the model using experimental data from a mouse model of CCl-induced liver fibrosis and analyzed RNA sequencing from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated liverrosis.

**Findings:** Simulation studies revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fib progression and reversion. Inactivation eliminates activated HSC during reversion, while reactivation of iSC sustains fibrosis. We demonstrated the model's sensitivity to Tβ parameters, suggesting adaptability to various pathophysiological conditions. The model predicts accumulation of iSC during chronic liver disease, confirmed by RNA sequencing data from NASH patients.

**Implications:** Our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease, exploring the regulatory role of iSC in liver homeostasis. The model can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the applicability of Kappa to multiscale modeling using tokens and counters to represent molecules and dynamics of cell phenotypes. We developed the first model of HSC during liverosis and reversion, highlighting the regulatory role of H in loops during fib and the accumulation of i during chronic disease. Our findings identify iSC as novel markers of fibrosis progression and provide insights into the fate of i during liverosis and re. The model can be used to explore the role of i in liver homeasis and develop new therapeutic approaches for liver disease.

**Title:** A Novel Meta-Analysis Framework for Estimating Total Mediation Effects of High-Dimensional Omics Mediators in Large-Scale Genomic Consortia

**Research Question:** How can we develop a novel meta-analysis framework to estimate the total mediation effects of high-dimensional omics mediators in large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOP) program, while accounting for inter-study heterogeneity?

**Methods:** We leveraged the established asymptotic standard error of the R-squared (R2)-based effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators to develop a novel meta-analysis framework requiring only summary statistics, allowing for inter-study heterogeneity. We applied the proposed method to 5 TOP studies with 580 participants to estimate the mediation of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

**Findings:** Our simulations showed that the developed method was computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of pooled-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity. The proposed method is available in R package Meta2 on GitHub.

**Implications:** This novel meta-analysis can uniquely evaluate and account for effect heterogeneity across studies due to, for example, varying genomic platforms. We applied the method to 5 TOP studies with 580 participants to estimate the mediation of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood and sex-related high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.

**Conclusions:** The proposed meta-analysis can be an appealing alternative to analysis of entire dataset once in terms of computational feasibility and evaluating heterogeneity across factors for diseases and genomic technologies, as demonstrated in application to FHS and MESA cohorts. Our method can not only characterize overall effect but also individual mediators. We adjusted for BMI, sex, age, smoking, status, race/ethnicity, expression platform, source, and top 10 PCs pooled expression covariates. The analysis led to different estimates and 95% CIs for total effects from meta-analysis due several reasons.

**Title:** Personalized Driver Gene Identification in Cancer: A Novel Approach to Overcoming Heterogeneity with PWH

**Research Question:** Can a novel computational method, PWH, accurately identify personalized driver genes in cancer patients by leveraging the impact of mutated genes on downstream expression across a cohort of patients sharing co-mutations and gene profiles?

**Methods:** We developed PWH, an integrated genome/transcript analysis approach to prioritize mutated genes in a single patient based on their influence on abnormal expression across a group of patients with shared co-mutations and gene profiles. We tested PWH on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA and compared its performance with existing methods.

**Findings:** PWH excelled in identifying known drivers and tumor-specific drivers across five cancer types, outperforming individual-level and cohort methods. Our results demonstrated PWH could identify both common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles improved tumor stratification, providing insights into heterogeneity and a step toward personalized treatment. We validated one predicted novel driver, low-density lipoprotein-related protein 1 (LRP1), promoting cell proliferation in vitro assays.

**Implications:** PWH addresses an overlooked aspect of existing methods: patients with same driver mutations share carcinogenic mechanisms, unlike those with same passengers. Incorporating higher-order gene-gene relationships holds promise for personalized prediction. Integrating all alterations improves driver identification. Despite limitations, PWH demonstrated reliable performance, promising discovering obscured variants by heterogeneity. Future, we expect PWH to aid optimal treatment development.

**Conclusions:** PWH is a novel approach identifying personalized genes by leveraging biological networks across samples. We hypothesize same cancer types share molecular characteristics and mechanisms. Leveraging samples from same type, closely resembling target, improves prediction. PWH requires cohort from TCG, somatic and expression, and interaction. For each type, we collected predicted genes and compared PWH with other methods on overlap with known drivers. The number of tumor-specific genes identified is illustrated. Our results demonstrate PWH outperforms existing methods, identifying both common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles improve stratification, understanding heterogeneity, and toward personalized treatment.

**Title:** Calibration of the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) Model using a Global Optimization Approach: A Scalable and Efficient Solution for Estimation of Pathological Brain Areas in Drug-Resistant Epilepsy

**Research Question:** This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of calibrating the Virtual Epileptic (VE) model, a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities, using a global optimization approach. The objective is to develop a resilient and efficient solver capable of leveraging parallel computing across various platforms, from desktop workstations to supercomputers, to accurately capture seizure dynamics and generate simulations resembling intracranial EEG recordings.

**Methods:** We employed a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm, SaSS, capable of parallel computation to yield high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. Extensive benchmarking on synthetic data demonstrated the proposal's scalability and superior performance against parallel solvers. Additionally, a Bayesian framework was used for hyperparameter tuning, resulting in significant gains in accuracy and computational cost. An uncertainty quantification phase was added to assess variability in estimated parameters across problems.

**Findings:** Our results show that the proposed approach successfully solved different configurations of VE models, outperforming other parallel solvers in terms of scalability and performance. Bayesian optimization further enhanced accuracy and reduced computational cost. Uncertainty quantification enabled assessment of variability in estimated parameters across problems.

**Implications:** This study has the potential to improve estimation of pathological areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making. By accurately capturing seizure dynamics and generating simulations, this technique offers a platform to optimize surgical strategy and aid decision-making. The VE model-based approach relies on estimating parameters in high-dimensional space to identify brain networks involved in seizure generation and propagation.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of calibrating VE using a global optimization approach. The scalable and efficient solver leverages parallel computing, achieving high-quality solutions without excessive time. Results show the potential to improve estimation of pathological areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making. The VE model offers a platform to optimize surgical strategy and aid decision-making, capturing seizure dynamics and simulations resembling intracran EEG.

**Title:** Unraveling the Dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Replication in Rabbits: A Novel Insights from Mathematical Modeling and Experimental Approaches

**Background:** Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health concern with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. While pulmonary TB is well understood to be caused by Mtb growth in the lung, quantitative estimates of Mtb replication and death rates in lungs of infected animals, such as rabbits, remain largely unknown.

**Research Question:** We investigated the replication dynamics of a novel, virulent clinical M isolate of the Beijing lineage, H878, carrying an unstable plasmid, p10, in rabbits.

**Methods:** In vitro experiments showed that p10 is more stable in H878 than the commonly used laboratory-adapted M strain H37R (segregation coefficient = 0.1 in H878 vs. 0.18 in H37R). We infected rabbits with H878-p10 and measured plasm-bearing bacteria in lungs over 112 days post-infection.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, the percent plasm-bearing cells increased between 28-56 post-in and remained stable 84-112 post-in, despite a large increase in bacterial numbers at late times. Mathematical modeling suggested a non-monotonic change in percent plasm-bearing can be explained by a lung Mtb population consisting of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics: a major expanding and controlled/eliminated, and a smaller expanding at times, causing a counterintuitive increase in percent plasm-bearing.

**Implications:** A model with kinetically homogeneous M population could not explain the data, even when run stochastically. Given H878 forms circumscribed granomas, our results suggest bacterial dynamics in subsets of granomas. Our predictions can be tested in future experiments following H878-p10 dynamics in granomas over time.

**Conclusions:** Our data and mathematical-based analyses illustrate differences in M dynamics between rabbits and mice, confirming the "rabbits are not mice" observation. H878-p10 in rabbits undergoes more replications than H37v in mice, highlighting differences between M strains and species. Alternative approaches used to describe H37v dynamics in mice could not explain H878 growth in rabbits. Future work will focus on correlating replication and death rates with immune response in granomas, opening avenues for research on M growth in granomas.

**Title:** Glycan Modeling with GlyTreeer: A Novel Computational Approach for Accurate Glycan Structure Prediction and Design

**Research Question:** Can a novel computational algorithm, GlyTreeer, accurately predict and design glycan structures for glycoproteins, overcoming the challenges of experimental determination of carbohydrate polymers?

**Methods:** We developed GlyTreeer, a glycan modeling algorithm that builds glycans layer-by-layer using kernel density estimates (KDE) of glycan conformations from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. We benchmarked Glyer on a test set of glycan structures varying in length and complexity.

**Findings:** Glyer predicted glycan structures agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and density-guided building. Employing Glyer, we designed de novo glycan into a nanoparticle to shield protein regions from antibody recognition, experimentally verified.

**Implications:** This work informs glycoprotein prediction, glycan masking, and aids computational structure determination and refinement. Glyer outperforms existing methods by simultaneously sampling glycan chemistries, branching, and kinematics to build glycans into density.

**Conclusions:** Glyer is a robust tool for glycan modeling and design, demonstrating high accuracy in both de novo and density-guided modeling. Glyer's ability to predict glycan structures and build into density will aid glycoprotein structure determination and refinement. Future work will integrate Glyer with Rosetta protocols and deep learning for robust analysis and design.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of the Ubiquitin Ligase-Substrate Pair SCF23-Ace in Regulating Fungal Development and Cellulase Gene Expression in Penicillium oxalicum

**Research Question:** How does the ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair SCF23ce regulate fungal development and cellulase gene expression in Penicillium oxum, and what is the role of the transcription factor Ace1 in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of molecular biology techniques, including RT-qPCR, transcriptome analysis, and protein-protein interaction studies to identify the ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair SC23ce in P. oxum and elucidate its role in regulating fungal development and cellulase gene expression.

**Findings:** We identified the ubiquitin lig-substrate pair SC23ce in P. oxum, which recognizes and activates the transcription factor Ace within the nucleus. Ace is a ubiquitinated protein that negatively regulates cellulase gene expression in various fungi. Contrary to our initial assumption, deletion of the Pbx gene resulted in significant upregulation of cellulase genes, indicating that Ace is a direct substrate of the SC23 complex. Among 44 interacting proteins, three transcription regulators were identified, including Zn2C6 class fungal transcription factors P_90, P78, and P48. Critical components of the ubiquitin-proteasome are vital for fungal growth, development, and enzyme synthesis in Aspergillus, Neurospora, and Trichma. During mycelial growth, 20% of proteins in Asg nidans become ubiquinated.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of the ubiquitin lig-substrate SC23 in regulating fungal development and cellulase expression in P. oxum, and the role of Ace in this process. Our findings propose a model of Pbx-Ace regulating Ace transcription, where Pbx activates Ace, allowing it to regulate target genes with different effects under signals.

**Conclusions:** The ubiquitin lig-substrate SC23 plays a crucial role in regulating fungal development and cellulase expression in P. ox, and Ace is a direct substrate of the SC complex. Pbx acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating Ace, allowing it to regulate target genes with different effects under signals. Accumulated Ace protein is dysfunctional and no longer binds promoters of target genes, including cellulase cb1, eg1, x11, and pigmentation abB. This study provides insights into the regulatory mechanism of cellulolytic enzyme expression in P. ox, a model system for elucidating this process.

**Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Basement Membrane Diversification: Unveiling the Role of Parallel Secretory Routes and Cell Polarity Axes

**Research Question:** How do basement membranes (BM) diversify during organogenesis, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation?

**Methods:** We investigated BM formation in Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium, focusing on protein secretion routes and cell polarity.

**Findings:** We identified two parallel secretory routes for BM proteins, mediated by Rab10 and Rab8, which are essential for fibril and homogenous BM formation, respectively. Rab10 promotes lateral planar-polarized secretion, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion. The dystroph-associated protein complex (DAP) and Rab10 co-localize in a planar-polar tubular compartment, with DAP required for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards Rab10. The exocyst complex plays a dual role, interacting with dystroph to limit planar polarization and required for Rab8 route.

**Implications:** Our study reveals mechanistic aspects of BM secretion and how diversity emerges from spatial control of distinct routes. We propose parallel secretory routes orchestrated by Rab proteins with cell sites defined by polarity as a mechanism for BM diversification during development.

**Conclusions:** BM diversification is due to Rab10-driven lateral planarized secretion and Rab8 basal secretion. DAP is part of the same compartment as Rab10, influencing planar polarization. The exoc complex is required for homogenous BM formation. BM secretion and diversification are essential for development. Our work provides mechanistic insights into BM secretion in epithelial cells, demonstrating diversification can arise from different routes with exit sites. These routes are integrated in different polarity axes (apical, basal, planar). The synergic effect of Rab8 and Rab10 suggests redundancy in addressing BM proteins.

**Title:** Enhancing HIV-1 Resistance Prediction to Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies (bnAbs) with Multi-Task Learning: Overcoming Challenges and Unlocking Therapeutic Benefits

**Research Question:** Can machine learning models, specifically multi-task learning (MTL), improve the prediction of HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) and address the challenges of underrepresentation of HIV-1 subtypes and combinations of bnAbs?

**Methods:** We developed a novel multi-task learning model, named Language-Based Universal Model (LBUM), trained on Env sequences with neutralization data and fine-tuned with both non-bnAb and bnAb data. We compared LB to classical machine learning algorithms, Random Forests (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machines (GB).

**Findings:** Our results show that multi-task learning:

1. **Mitigates bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes**, improving model generalizability across subtypes.
2. **Learns patterns of co-resistance between antibodies**, providing tools to predict epitopes and select optimal bn combinations.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates the potential of multi-task learning in addressing key challenges in HIV-1 vaccine research. Our model, publicly available at https://github.com/ia/LBUM, can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.

**Conclusions:**

1. Multi-task learning outperforms classical machine learning algorithms in predicting HIV-1 resistance to bnAbs.
2. Our model addresses underrepresentation of HIV-1 subtypes and combinations of bn.
3. Provides tools to predict epitopes and select optimal bn combinations.

**Future Directions:**

* Increase model size and diversity of training data to further improve performance.
* Adapt to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.

**Title:** Pathway-Based Predictive Models for Multiple Myeloma: A Novel Strategies for Therapeutic Decision-Making

**Background:** Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow, with varying treatment effects between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for informed decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that pathway dysfunction is closely associated with disease progression.

**Research Question:** Can pathway-based predictive models, incorporating pathway information, outperform gene-based models in MM?

**Methods:** We employed two strategies: pathway score method and grouplasso using pathway information. The former converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for fitting. We considered three methods for pathway calculation (ssSEA, GSVA, and z-scores) and 14 sources providing pathway information. Implemented methods in microarray data (GSE324) and obtained candidate model with best performance in validation. Compared candidate with gene-based and published models in external data. Investigated effects of missing values on prediction.

**Findings:** Grouplass incorporating pathway (VAX) outperformed gene in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including V pathways, was more predictive for MM. V also outperformed previously published models. New model was more resistant to missing values, and presence <5% did not deteriorate accuracy using imputation.

**Implications:** Pathway-based models using grouplass were competitive to gene-based for MM. These were documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM), where imputation was integrated to facilitate future validation.

**Conclusion:** Our study demonstrated advantage of pathway-based models in clinical prediction. Workflow can serve as guide for future studies incorporating prior knowledge into predictive models. Pathway-based models are stable and interpretable than gene models. Most predictive were based on immune pathways, consistent with MM being cancer of plasma cells producing antibodies, critical component of adaptive system.

**Title:** Unveiling the Regulatory Mechanisms of Mitochondrial Fission: A Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Modeling of Drp-Dependent Mitochondrial Fission

**Research Question:** Mitochondrial fission, the process of mitochondrial division into daughter organelles, is crucial for cellular homeostasis and energy production. However, its dysregulation is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. Understanding the molecular mechanisms coordinating this complex process is essential. This study aims to develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of Drp-dependent mitochondrial fission to identify parameters regulating the total fission rate (TFR) as a function of time.

**Methods:** A system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) was developed to model Drp-dependent mitochondrial fission following cellular injury, focusing on the concentration of Drp in the cytosol. The model was nondimensionalized, resulting in four dimensionless parameters. The total fission rate (TFR) and cumulative fission (TF) were found to depend strongly on a single parameter, μ, representing the maximum rate of disassembling of oligomers.

**Findings:** The nondimensional system underwent a Hopf bifurcation with parameter μ = k + k - M, where M is the concentration of mitochondrial fission factor, k+ and k are association and dissociation constants between oligomers and Dr1-M complexes on the outer membrane. Surprisingly, TF did not monotonically increase with μ; instead, it increased to a point and then decreased as μ continued to increase. This non-monotonic dependence on μ suggests targeting k, k, or M may have non-intuitive impacts on fission.

**Implications:** Understanding the impact of regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist future therapeutic selection. The lack of literature on association and dissociation rates between Dr1 and M, oligomerization on the OMM, and fission rate motivated investigation of different parameter choices to identify regulatory parameters fine-tuning fission.

**Conclusion:** Mitochondrial fission is a critical for cellular homeostasis and energy production. This study's nonlinear dynamical model of Drp-dependent fission identified μ as a key regulatory parameter for mitochondrial fission. The non-monotonic dependence of TF on μ suggests targeting k, k, or M may have non-intuitive effects on fission. Further investigation of these parameters may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for regulating mitochondrial fission and improving cellular health.

**Title:** CRISPR-based Gene Drives Offer Promising Prospects for Controlling Disease-Transmitting Vectors and Agricultural Pests: Mitigating Resistance through Functionally Constrained gRNAs

**Research Question:** Can a CRISPR-based gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosophila suuk, a notorious pest, be developed to mitigate the rapid evolution of resistance?

**Methods:** We constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene system targeting the T2 gene in D. suuk and tested its effectiveness in D. melanogaster. We also introduced promoter-C9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency and investigated the impact of genetic polymorphisms in wild populations on the spread of gene alleles.

**Findings:** Our study revealed a low level of homing in the germline, but feeding octamine restored egg-laying defects in T2 mutant females, allowing easier maintenance than other drive targets. In D. melanogaster, similar systems showed improved homing efficiency with promoter-C9 transgenes. However, genetic polymorphisms in wild populations limited the spread of gene alleles and profoundly influenced Cas9 activity.

**Implications:** This study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing female infertility caused by the drive, offering a valuable tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects.

**Conclusions:** Our research demonstrates the robust use of CRPR/C9 genetic tool to construct GD systems targeting haplos female fertility T2 in the pest D. su and model D. melanaster. The drive on D. su, an economic pest, is meaningful. Gene drive is a novel engineering tool controlling disease vectors and pests, and CRPR/C9-based has broad prospects due to specificity and flexibility. To mitigate resistance, we employed functionally constrained gRNAs targeting T2, inducing non-mutations at desired sites, reducing selective pressure for resistance. Our system's key feature is rescuing female sterility by feeding octamine, inexpensive.

**Title:** Energy-Constrained Learning: Unveiling the Metabolic Cost of Synaptic Plasticity in Neural Networks**

**Research Question:** What is the metabolic cost of synaptic plasticity in neural networks, and how can it be optimized to reduce energy consumption while maintaining learning performance?

**Methods:** We investigated the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks using a parsimonious model, proposing two plasticity algorithms that save energy: 1) modifying only synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses forming a path through the network.

**Findings:** Our results show an approximate square relation between energy and size, E ∝ N^0.43, indicating that large networks learn faster but use more energy. Restricting plasticity saves energy while incurring slightly worse learning time. We also found that only allowing plasticity in a subset of synapses using a random mask drawn from a Bernoulli distribution leads to further savings.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the brain has evolved to learn using little energy possible, and that restricting plasticity helps save metabolic costs associated with synaptic plasticity. This may lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a match between artificial and biological learning. Moreover, the algorithms can benefit hardware as electronic storage is energetically costly.

**Conclusions:** We introduce an energy measure that assumes energy is used solely by synaptic updates, and propose two algorithms to reduce energy consumption: 1) modifying only synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses forming a path through the network. Our results show that restricting plasticity can save energy while incurring slightly worse learning. Future studies can adapt the algorithms to task or architecture and find efficient synaptic modification during transfer.

**Title:** Overcoming Fitness Defects in Streamlined Genomes through Laboratory Evolution: A Study on Acinetobacter bayi AD1x Strains

**Research Question:** Can laboratory evolution overcome fitness defects in streamlined genomes of Acinetobacter bayi ADx strains with large deletions of non-essential genes?

**Methods:** We investigated six variants of Acinetacter bayi AD1x, each with deletions of 22-42 kilobase and two larger deletions of 70-293 kilobases, and evolved replicate populations in chemically defined and complex media for ~300 generations. Genomes of endpoint isolates were sequenced.

**Findings:** Fitness increased in all cases except two, which failed to improve in one environment. Mutations in protein-coding genes and small RNAs were associated with environments and deletions. Global transcription regulators (ribonuclease D, csrA, and hfq) were mutated across strains, with varying effects on function and fitness.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate that fitness lost during streamlining can be regained through evolution, often through combination-specific and regulatory adjustments. Mutations in regulatory network compensate for earlier deletion in ADx ancestor, restoring csr function.

**Conclusions:** Laboratory evolution can recover lost fitness after genome reduction. Our study validates evolution as strategy for improving reduced-genome strains, illuminating path for minimal-genome engineering.

**Title:** Development of a Self-Cleaving Ribozyme-Based Tool for Precise Regulation of Endogenous Gene Expression in Zebraf

**Research Question:** Can self-cleaving ribymes be used to control the expression of endogenous genes in vertebrates, specifically in the zebraf model?

**Methods:** We developed a self-caving ribyme, T3H48, and inserted it into the intron of the alb gene in zraf using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy. We also created a base-edit version of the ribyme to inactivate it. Additionally, we generated a Flase and Cre-activatable version, called Ribo, to control the expression of the alb gene.

**Findings:** Insertion of T3 in the intron resulted in rapid pre-mRNA cleavage and up to 20-fold reduction in expression. The ribyme displayed superior activity compared to other ribymes. Activation of Ribo induced mRNA knockdown and recapitulated the alb mutant phenotype. Furthermore, Cre and Dre-controllable Gal/UAS in the RFlip cassette allowed for independent expression of the target gene.

**Implications:** This study introduces RFlip as a flexible tool for controlling endogenous expression in vertebrates, an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies. The zraf model allows efficient screening of genetic tools due to its externalization and rapid development.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the feasibility of using selfaving ribymes to modulate endogenous expression in vertebrates, specifically in zraf. The RFlip cassette offers a new approach for functional genomics in vertebrates.

**Title:** "aiSEG: A User-Friendly Software for Nucleus Segmentation in Bright Field Images without Fluorescent Labeling"

**Research Question:** Can a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based software accurately segment nuclei in bright field (BF) images without the need for fluorescent labeling, thereby eliminating the need for transgenic dye labeling, freeing up imaging channels, reducing phototoxicity, and speeding up imaging?

**Methods:** We introduce "aiSEG", a user-friendly CNN-based software for segmenting nuclei in BF images. We evaluated its performance on nucleus segmentation in primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities, including hand-curated and novel data sets with 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images.

**Findings:** aiSEG accurately segments nuclei from challenging BF images, similar to manual segmentation, retaining biologically relevant information for quantification of biosensors signaling pathway dynamics. It is adaptable to new cases with only 32 images required retraining. SEG is accessible through command line and graphical user interface, agnostic to computational environments, and does not require user coding experience.

**Implications:** This approach eliminates the need for fluorescent labeling, freeing imaging channels, reducing phototoxicity, and speeding up imaging. It retains biologically relevant information for quantification of biosensors signaling dynamics. SEG is adaptable to new cases with only 32 images required retraining.

**Conclusions:** aiSEG is a user-friendly software for segmenting nuclei in BF images without fluorescent labeling, accessible to users with no prior experience. We demonstrate its utility in challenging conditions, including low magnification and live imaging of primary cells, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells lacking large cytoplasm. SEG utilizes generic segmentation approach not limited to microscopy.

**Title:** Humans Favor Slower Features in Reinforcement Learning: Evidence for a Bias in Reward-Predicting Properties

**Research Question:** Do humans rely on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predict features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments? Specifically, do humans learn more efficiently when task-relevant features change on a slower timescale than noise?

**Methods:** We designed a novel decision-making task where participants (N=295) learned to predict rewards from two-dimensional bandits with either slowly or quickly changing features. Across two experiments, including a preregistered replication, participants accrued more rewards when the relevant feature changed slowly and the irrelevant quickly, compared to the opposite.

**Findings:** We found that participants learned the value of stimuli faster when the reward-predict feature changed slowly and the irrelevant feature quickly, compared to when the opposite. However, there was no difference in generalization to unseen features between conditions. Using a set of function approximation Kalman models, we revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted their learning to the relevance and speed of the feature. The improvement in performance for slow bandits compared to fast bandits was positively correlated with the adjustment of learning rates.

**Implications:** Our results provide evidence that humans favor slower features in reinforcement learning, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward. This challenges the notion that humans rely on slown to identify potentially relevant features during learning.

**Conclusions:** This study extends research on slown prior humans and suggests it aids learning states in a reinforcement domain. Our findings have implications for understanding how humans learn and adapt to changing environments, particularly in situations where features evolve on a slower timescale than noise.

**Title:** Identification of Retroviral Factor 1 (Res1) as a Novel Tumor Suppressor and Metastasis Modifier in ER-Negative Breast Cancer

**Research Question:** What is the role of Retroiral Factor 1 (Res1) in the progression and metastasis of ER-negative breast cancer?

**Methods:** We employed a systems genetics approach to identify genes associated with metastasis in ER-negative breast cancer and extended our previous studies to identify Res1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene. We used CRISPR gene trap mouse models crossed with the Polyoma Middle-T antigen engineered mouse (PyMT-Py) to investigate the effect of Res1 reduction on tumor growth, survival, and metastasis.

**Findings:** Reduction of Res1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened overall survival, and increased incidence and number of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Analysis of matched primary and metastatic tissues revealed loss of wild-type Res1 in tumor tissue, suggesting Res1 is a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed Res1 role in transcriptional control through association with G-quadruplex sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis.

**Implications:** Loss of Res1 enhances tumor progression in ER breast cancer through alterations in transcriptional and translational control.

**Conclusion:** This study identifies Res1 as a novel tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in ER-negative breast cancer, expanding our understanding of metastasis biology and potential targets for intervention.

**Title:** Investigating the Roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in Meiotic Recombination: A Genome-Wide Mapping of Meiotic Progeny Reveals Distinct and Shared Functions

**Research Question:** How do the DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 regulate meiotic recombination, and what are their genome-wide roles in this process?

**Methods:** We employed two strategies to characterize the functions of Mec and Rad in meiotic recombination: deletion of the mismatch protein Msh2 and control of meiotic prophase length via the Ndt transcription factor. We mapped meiotic recombination patterns at high resolution across the S. cerevisiae genome in radΔ and mec-m (meiotic null) backgrounds.

**Findings:** Loss of Rad24 reduced spore viability and recombination frequency, consistent with previous studies. In contrast, deletion of Mec increased recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB interference, and had less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, multichromat events initiated by closely spaced DSBs occurred more frequently in the absence of either Rad or Mec, suggesting loss of spatial regulation at the level of D formation. Both Mec and Rad have roles in spatial regulation of crossovers (COs). Loss of either Mec or Rad resulted in more random CO distributions, suggesting reductions in global manifestation of interference.

**Implications:** Our results highlight shared roles in CO regulation and separable functions for Rad as a pro-CO factor and Mec as regulator of recombination, loss of which helps suppress broader defects in CO caused by abrogation of DDR.

**Conclusions:** Mec and Rad have distinct and shared roles in meiotic recombination, with Rad acting as a pro-C factor and Mec regulating recombination frequency. Loss of either helps suppress broader defects in CO caused by abrogation of DDR. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of meiotic recombination and highlight the importance of spatial regulation of DSB formation and CO.

**Research Question:** Can a comprehensive in silico-scale metabolic model of Pneumystiro growth and metabolism identify metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder its growth in vitro, providing a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro?

**Methods:** We developed a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of Pneumyst growth and metabolism using published data and literature, bioinformatics tools, and Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement approaches to predict metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of Pyst growth medium. We validated the model and employed it to make predictions regarding Pyst growth and metabolism.

**Findings:** Our model revealed insights into the biology of Pyst and provided a strategy to overcome the challenge of culturing this pathogen vitro. Specifically, we:

1. Identified metabolic requirements and imbalances that prevent Pyst growth in vitro.
2. Predicted critical components of Pyst medium and suggested supplements to enhance growth.
3. Demonstrated the model's potential in replicating gene knockout experiments and developing antifungal targets.

**Implications:** Our study addresses the major bottleneck in Pyst research, enabling:

1. Experimental validation of hypotheses generated by the model.
2 Comparison of Pyst growth in vitro and vivo (in host) as control.
3 Development of a genome-scale model for mouse-specific pathogen Pystina.
4 Identification of novel antifungal targets.

**Conclusions:** Our in silico metabolic modeling offers an alternative approach to overcome the challenge of culturing Pyst vitro, providing a powerful tool for dissecting the biology of this deadly fungal pathogen. The model's potential in replicating gene experiments and predicting metabolic fluxes highlights its value in antifungal drug development. Our study opens opportunities to release the major bottleneck in Pyst research, enabling diagnosis, and treatment of life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised and transplant patients.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of YAP/TA in Cancer Proliferation: A 3D Modeling of the Hippo-Y/TA Pathway and Cell Interactions

**Research Question:** Can increased levels of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP) with transcriptional coactivator with PD binding motif (TAZ) (Y/TA) alone overcome the inhibitory effect of the Hippo pathway and induce sustained proliferation in cancer cells under high-density conditions?

**Methods:** We developed a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hipp-Y/TA pathway, introducing a novel component that reflects cell density dynamics into the Hipp pathway. We simulated cell interactions using molecular dynamics (MD) equations with adhesion and repulsive forces between cells and frictional forces on each cell, assuming Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with a soft core to secure each cell's domain. We modeled cell cycles of mitotic and growth under cell influence of kinetics.

**Findings:** Our simulations showed that a twofold increase in Y/TA levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling continuous proliferation under high-density conditions.

**Implications:** This model, integrating cell interactions and the Hipp-YTA pathway, may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YTA levels, developing drugs to suppress abnormal proliferation of cancer, and determining drug dosages.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest that increased YTA alone can bypass the inhibitory effect of the Hipp pathway and maintain growth, contributing to unchecked proliferation in cancer cells. This model provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of density and YTA concentration on proliferation, shedding light on the proliferative characteristics of normal and cancer cells.

**Title:** Elucidating the Sequence Grammar of Low-Complexity Domains in Biomolecular Condensates: An Energy Landscape Framework for Condens Dynamics and Material Properties

**Research Question:** How do low-complexity domains (LCD) in proteins govern the dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condens, and what are the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences?

**Methods:** We employed a novel energy framework, the Free Landscape of Stickers (ELS), which operates on a continuous "stickiness" scale to investigate the effects of low-complex sequence patterns on condens dynamics and material properties. We characterized sequences by Wasserstein distance relative to shuffled or random counterparts, generating patterns from fully periodic to random.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Notably, minimum periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condens, preventing transitions to glassy or solid states. We demonstrate that the ELS framework explains recent findings on prion domains and predicts alterations in condens viscoelasticity.

**Implications:** Our study addresses a critical gap in understanding the role of sequence complexity governing dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condens. The ELS provides a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded properties, where features of landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable. Using ELS, we dissect the complexity of LCD quantified by periodicity and disorder in sticky regions impact dynamics and properties of condens.

**Conclusions:** This work elucidates the molecular grammar of LCD governing condens dynamics, essential for uncovering biological functions and evolutionary forces shaping these sequences. The ELS framework offers a systematic approach to program condens viscoelastic by altering periodicity and stickiness of LCDs. Our findings provide insights into sequence-encoded properties biomolecular condens, advancing understanding their dynamics and functional roles.

**Title:** The Role of Myosin II and Shh Signaling in Ectodermal Organogenesis: Unveiling the Mechanisms of Epithelial Invagination

**Background:** The formation of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesyme as the organ takes shape. Signaling by secreted molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis, but the mechanisms leading to cell rearrangement and tissue changes remain unclear.

**Research Question:** What is the role of Myosin II and Shh signaling in dental epithelial invagination?

**Methods:** Using the mouse as a model, we investigated the role of Myosin II and Shh signaling in dental epithelial invagination.

**Findings:** We found that Myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the supasal layer. Sh signaling controls these processes by activating My II via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AK and My II also rescues defects caused by inhibition of Sh.

**Implications:** Our results support a model in which Sh signals through My II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination.

**Conclusions:** Sh signaling is transmitted through My II to maintain cell-cell adhesion and promote convergent cell movement driving epithelial invagination. This is achieved by strengthening cell adhesion at adherens junctions and enabling persistent convergent movement in the supasal layer, where cells at the periphery of the tooth move towards the mid. Sh acts through PIK/AKT to activate My. The Sh-PI/A-My axis promotes cell adhesion and movement propelling invagination. My II generates forces and maintains intercellular adhesion, perturbations in My mutants impede convergent narrowing and invagination.

**Future Directions:** Studies will determine the role of cell-cell adhesion and contribution by junctions, tight junctions, and desmos in cellular rearrangement during these processes.

**Title:** Leveraging Transfer Learning for Single-Cell Omics: A Deep Graph Convolutional Network (scGCN) for Integrating Large-Scale Single-Cell RNA and Chromatin Accessibility Data

**Research Question:** How can we effectively transfer labels from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scAC-seq) data to empower the exploration of single-cell omics, while preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic heterogeneity?

**Methods:** We propose a novel deep transfer learning-based graph convolutional network, scGCN, to integrate large-scale single-cell RNA and chromatin accessibility data, addressing the limitations of current transfer methods in preserving biological variation and heterogeneity. scGC leverages a multi-stage transfer strategy to integrate gene expression and chromatin data into a unified multi-omics cell atlas.

**Findings:** scGC achieves high transfer accuracy and knowledge across modalities, integrating mouse data from ATAC-seq and C-seq, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in preserving cell heterogeneity. Our results show that scGC outperforms existing methods in preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic heterogeneity.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of leveraging transfer learning and generative models to reduce domain discrepancy and improve robustness in single-cell data integration. scGC enables the analysis of larger atlas-level single-cell multiomics, combining different types of measurements, even unpaired data.

**Conclusions:** scGC is a novel transfer learning-based graph convolution network that integrates and analyzes large-scale single-cell multi-omics data, effectively combining gene expression and chromatin data. The model aggregates cell relationships and gene expression with convolution, based on kinetic relationships between regulatory mechanisms sc-seq and scACq. We explore MKMD-based adaptation for transferable features, leveraging domain-specific effects, and multiple kernels for adapting representations, enhancing effectiveness between embeddings sc-se andACq. Our results demonstrate scGC accurately transfers cell annotations across datasets, tissues, species, and molecular layers, sc-se andACq.

**Key contributions:**

* Propose a novel transfer learning-based graph convolution network, scGC, integrating large-scale single-cell RNA and chromatin data
* Achieve high transfer accuracy and knowledge across modalities, integrating AT-se and C-se data

**Title:** Elucidating the Specificity of Nuclear Localization Sequences (NLS) in Mc3, a Subunit of Replicative DNA Helicase: Implications for Cell Growth and Chromatin Loading

**Research Question:** What is the specificity of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of Mc3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase, and how does it interact with importin to facilitate nuclear import and chromatin loading?

**Methods:** We employed mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF) modeling to investigate the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS of Mc3 and its interactions with importin. We also examined the effects of disrupting these interactions on nuclear import, chromatin loading, and cell growth.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that the positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mc3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mc, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the M complex and poor growth. We identified specific residues P2 and P3 within the NLS of Mc as critical for its function, as mutations at these positions resulted in defective import, chromatin association, and impaired growth. Unexpectedly, the Mc3-SV40-NLS mutant failed to support nuclear import, despite AF predicting similar contacts with Kap at P2 and P.

**Implications:** Our study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting monopart NLS, which lack a universally conserved sequence but retain shared characteristics between NLS of Mc3 and SV40 T antigen. Further characterization of Mc's N will elucidate cell cycle-dependent nuclear import and loading, refine predictions of putative NLS in many proteins. Nuclear import of Mc and chromatin loading are essential for growth, highlighting the importance of our findings.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS for nuclear import and chrom loading of Mc. Mutations at P2 and P resulted in defective import, chromatin association, and impaired growth, underscoring the critical role of these residues. Unexpectedly, the Mc3-SV-NLS mutant failed to support import, despite predicted contacts with Kap at P and P. Further biophysical studies are needed to characterize Mc mutations and their effects on nuclear import.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Ataxin-2 in Translational Control and RNP Granule Assembly: Implications for Neurodegeneration**

**Research Question:** How does Atin-2, a protein implicated in spinocerebell ataxia type II (S2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinsonism, regulate translational control and RNP assembly, and what are the implications for neurodegeneration?

**Methods:** We employed a series of experiments on Drosoph and human Atin-2 proteins using Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE), co-localization immunoprecipitation, and transgenic Dophila models to investigate the role of Atin-2 in translational control and RNP assembly.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that the poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 motif of Atin-2 is a major determinant of mRNA and protein content in Atin-2 RNPules. Experiments with transgenic Dophila show that the At-LS domain protects against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions support At- induced cytotoxicity.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that Atin- interactions are remodelled during translational control, with structured and non-structured interactions contributing differently to specificity and efficiency of RNP condensation as well as neurogeneration.

**Conclusions:** This study advances our understanding of At- function in translational control and R assembly, highlighting the importance of P2 motif and IDR interactions in At- induced cytotoxicity and neurogeneration. Our results propose a model for At- interactions in translational control and RNP assembly, with implications for ALS and related conditions.

**Title:** Regulatory Networks Upstream of Skeletal Muscle Fate Determinants Differ in Anatomical Locations: A Comprehensive In Vivo Characterization of Muscle Stem Cell Heterogeneity Along the Body Axis

**Research Question:** Despite significant efforts to elucidate the cascade of events underlying the emergence and maintenance of stem cells in specific muscle groups, the understanding of this process remains unresolved and debated. This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal roles of Pit2 and Pax in the emergence and maintenance of the progenitor population using genetically modified and traced mice.

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetically modified and lineage mice to examine the functional roles of Pit and Pax in myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal stages in vivo. Our analysis provided a qualitative and quantitative characterization of myogenesis and identified differential states, dynamics, and establishment of quiescence in muscles compared to limb muscles.

**Findings:** Our results showed that Pit becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the stem cell pool in extraocular muscles (OM) despite being a major regulator during early development. Constitutive inactivation of Pax postnatally led to a loss of stem cells in OM compared to limb. We propose a relay between Pit, and Pax for OM cell maintenance. Moreover, stem cells in OM adopt a quiescent state earlier than limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in adult, yet OM have a higher content of stem cells per pre- and postnat. In contrast, limb cells proliferate in the md mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, less stem cells were present in OM of the md mouse compared to controls and were not proliferative.

**Implications:** Our study provides a comprehensive characterization of stem heterogeneity along the body axis and brings insights into the sparing of OM during muscular dystrophy. The findings suggest that Pit and Pax play distinct roles in the emergence and maintenance of stem in different anatomical locations, and that stem in OM adopt a quiescent state earlier than limb and do not proliferate in adult, yet have a higher content of stem cells pre and postnat. The study also highlights the importance of Pit and Pax in maintaining stem in OM, particularly in the context of muscular dystrophy.

**Conclusion:** This study provides a comprehensive characterization of stem cell heterogeneity along the body and highlights the importance of Pit and Pax in the emergence and maintenance of stem in different anatomical locations. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying muscular dystrophy and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for muscle regeneration.

**Title:** Development of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PIN) Model for Simulating the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Variants: A Novel VOC-IN Approach

**Research Question:** Can a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PIN) model, specifically VOC-IN, accurately simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population, accounting for their distinct levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, and enable short-term predictions?

**Methods:** This study proposes a novel VOC-IN model that integrates epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. We combined the proposed model with reported data from the British Columbia (BC) province and its internal health agencies in Canada to develop a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PIN) called VOC-IN.

**Findings:** Our results show that VOC-IN can accurately fit reported data, simulate unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. Experimental results also reveal variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across regions. VOC-IN performs well in fitting and forecasting long-term multi-wave data.

**Implications:** The integration of PIN with disease models, particularly VOC-IN, represents a significant contribution. VOC-IN leverages available data and underlying principles governing disease to capture time-vary nature of parameters. Studies [23-30] have shown PIN can accurately fit compartment models and estimate timeary parameters. Inspired by these, we propose VOC-IN that fits and infers timeary parameters by encoding VOC data, epidemiological mechanisms, and ODE into networks.

**Conclusion:** This study introduces VOC-IN, a novel algorithm that combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemi models to estimate transmission of COVID-19 strains. VOC-IN emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data to optimize and achieve accurate fitting. Variants exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease, severity, immune evasion, and responsiveness to treatments. According to WHO's definition, VOCs necessitate substantial health measures. Simulating transmission within population and time-dependent SARS-2 characteristics is crucial. We aim to integrate VOC-IN with advanced methods to better predict infectious data.

**Title:** CytoNet: A Deep Sets-based Approach for Improved Single-Cell Profiling through Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning

**Research Question:** How can we develop a more accurate and efficient method for aggregating single-cell data in image-based profiling, which captures the heterogeneity within cell populations?

**Methods:** We introduce CytoNet, a Deep Sets-based model that leverages self-supervised contrastive learning to learn an optimal aggregation strategy for single-cell profiles. CytoNet receives single morphological feature data as input and produces an aggregated profile as output. We employ contrastive learning, a method that brings together data points from the same entity (e.g., same sample) and pushes others apart in feature space, to capture generalizable features for various tasks. Unlike previous approaches, we apply contrast learning to extracted features, not raw pixels, making it applicable to most image profiling datasets.

**Findings:** CytoNet outperforms average profiling by 30-68% in mean precision on a public dataset. Interpretability analysis reveals that CyNet achieves this by downweighting mitotic cells or debris and prioritizing crowded cells. Importantly, CyNet requires only perturbation labels, readily available in profiling datasets.

**Implications:** CytoNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single profiles, significantly boosting performance on image profiling datasets. This approach can be applied to various perturbations, expanding utility in functional genomics.

**Conclusions:** CytoNet provides an easier-to-apply and better-performing method for aggregating single image data compared to published strategies and average baseline. The model achieves this by quality filtering noisy cells. Future research can explore CyNet's applicability to perturbations, expanding utility in genomics.

**Title:** Quantifying Cognitive Effort in the Brain using Electroencephalography (EEG) Patterns: A Novel Framework for Assessing Brain Dynamics and Performance

**Research Question:** Can we develop a framework to quantify cognitive effort during task performance using electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns, and validate its effectiveness in capturing transitions in brain dynamics associated with cognitive performance?

**Methods:** We employed a dynamical systems approach to identify discrete EEG states (microstates) and optimal transport theory to associate cognitive effort with EEG patterns. We applied this framework to a spatial version of the Stro task, a cognitive test requiring participants to respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting aspect.

**Findings:** Our results revealed a significant correlation between cognitive effort and cost, confirming the framework's effectiveness in quantifying transitions. Utilizing a data-driven method, this research opens new avenues for physiologically describing cognitive effort in the brain.

**Implications:** This study highlights the importance of characterizing brain dynamics and costs in understanding cognitive processes, offering insights into the relationship between neural patterns, effort, and performance. Our framework provides a computational pipeline to quantify demand in EEG experiments, bridging a gap in existing literature.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the first application of a stochastic control framework to EEG data, providing a novel approach to quantify cognitive demand in experiments. By generalizing this method to EEG signals, we measure neural activity more directly than functional MRI. Our analysis of an EEG dataset during a spatial Stro task shows a correlation between cost and cognitive demand, supporting the framework's validity. This research contributes to understanding the neural basis of cognitive effort, offering a new perspective on brain function and performance.

**Title:** Expansion of Atypical Memory B Cells in Malaria-Exposed Individuals and Their Role in Protective Humoral Responses

**Research Question:** To investigate the generation and function of Plasmodium vivax (P. viv)-specific atypical memory B cells (aBC) in malaria-exposed individuals, and their capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections.

**Methods:** P. viv Binding Protein II (PvDBPI) probes were generated to detect the development and durability of P. viv-specific aBC, and demonstrate their capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies. PvDBI-specific aBC were elicited during malaria illness and persisted through the recovery phase of infections. Single aBC were cultured and secreted Ig tested for binding and inhibition activity.

**Findings:** PvI-specific aBC were elicited during malaria and persisted through recovery phase infections. Among aBC clones, A12 and B11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against PDBI variants. Notably, cell receptors (BCRs) of PvI-specific aBC expressed uniqueIGH genes with usage IGH1, comparable to classicalBC. Somatic hypermutation (SH) and CDR length of VH and VK in theseBC were not significantly different.

**Implications:** Our findings revealed P. viv infections elicited the development and persistence of P. viv-specific aBC. Accumulation of aBC during infections might play an important role in producing antibodies against malaria.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrated the generation of antigen-specific aBC in P. viv malaria acute infections. PvI-TH-specificBC were detected in individuals. Of these, expressed aBC and classicalBC phenotypes. Four clones aBC produced anti-PDBI antibodies low reactivity. Our findings highlight the role of aBC in humoral response to malaria by differentiating into ASC for broadly neutralizing against P invasion into erythrocytes. IdentifyingBC subsets play a major role in producing antibodies will facilitate development of effective and lasting malaria vaccines.

**Title:** Enhancing Polygenic Prediction of Complex Phenotypes with MR-MASHS: A Scalable and Efficient Method for Genome-Wide Association Studies

**Research Question:** Can we develop a flexible and computationally efficient method that models multiple phenotypes jointly and leverages sharing effects across phenotypes to improve accuracy, without requiring individual-level data, which are often not publicly available?

**Methods:** We introduce MRASHS, an extension of the MRASH model that requires only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel. Using summary data, we achieve the goal of increasing the applicability of the MRASH model to datasets not publicly available and making it scalable to biob-size.

**Findings:** Through simulations, we show that MRASH is competitive, and often outperforms current-state-of-art for single and multi-phenotypic polygenic in a variety of scenarios that differ in the pattern effect sharing across phenotypes, number of phenotypes, number of variants, and heritability. We also present a real analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in the UKob, showing that MRASH achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for majority, especially when data has smaller size.

**Implications:** MRASH requires individual data, e.g., genotypes and phenotypes for each and mainly privacy, these are rarely available [21]. Second, MRASH does not well to datasets with large size, such modern biob. These limitations the use MRASH PGS in genetics. We overcome these by introducing MRASH, which takes into account LD and test. We MRASH in task PGS for phenotypes jointly simulations several and show it competitive in accuracy available methods. We confirm results in analysis data 16 blood traits UKob [23,24].

**Conclusions:** MRASH need individual and lack scalability biob data. Through simulations and analysis UKob, show MRASH competitive state-of-art univariate multivariate PGS. Note MRASH outperformed methods 16 blood phenotypes, although magnitude varied phen, modest substantial. In this work, we introduced MRASH, summary version developed Bayes multivariate regression [20]. MRASH enjoys (1) learn patterns sharing phen; (2) model dozens jointly; (3) efficiency. MRASH addresses important limitations MRASH: need data lack scalability biob.

**Title:** Accurate Prediction of Epidemics through Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneity: A Novel Modeling Framework for Infectious Disease Control

**Research Question:** How can we improve the accuracy of epidemic predictions for infectious diseases by incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity into homogeneous models?

**Methods:** We propose a novel framework that integrates spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models by introducing a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (DE) model. Simultaneously, we preset a specific form for the recruitment and develop a mechanistic model. Data from the Omic variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the DE model using deep learning and calibrate the mechanistic using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods.

**Findings:** Our projections indicate an attack rate and peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared to the homogeneous model's 99.97 and 32.78%, providing an 18.6% improvement in accuracy based on actual data. Simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in suscept decreases herd immunity by 37.36% and prolongs outbreak from 30 to 70 days, aligning with real cases.

**Implications:** This study lays groundwork for a new class of models and insights for heterogeneity. Our approach shapes the spread of susceptibles during the Omic variant outbreak in Shanghai using distinct methodologies. Employing cutting-edge deep learning, we trained the Universal Equation (DE) model and used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MC) for calibrating mechanisms. Given limited information on transition, the DE framework is a good choice for learning recruitment from epidemic data. Utilizing the universal property of neural networks, we present (t) in absence of specific form, and train to shape (t) particular outbreaks.

**Conclusions:** By incorporating spatio-temp heterogeneity into classical models, our framework efficiently depicts the epidemic curve of the large outbreak, including size, size, immunity, and duration. Accuracy is significantly enhanced compared to homogeneous models. This study demonstrates the importance of considering heterogeneity in epidemic modeling and provides a foundation for future research in this area.

**Title:** Harnessing Synaptic Noise to Represent Uncertainty: A Novel Framework for Understanding Synaptic Function and Network Dynamics

**Research Question:** How do synapses utilize noise to represent uncertainty about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron, and what implications does this have for neuronal network behavior?

**Methods:** We developed a mathematical framework where the synapse interacts with the soma of the postsyn neuron as an agent in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests synapses use an internal model of somatic membrane dynamics, updated by a learning rule resembling LTP/LTD mechanisms, and utilize noisy release to encode uncertainty about somatic potential. We applied this framework to individual synapses, considering dynamics as interacting with cellular environment, deriving a learning rule minimizing surprise. This rule enables synapses to adapt efficacy to predict postsyn spikes, registered by backpropagating action potentials.

**Findings:** Our model predicts synapses should be stochastic to encode uncertainties about somatic potential, and makes precise predictions about synaptic plasticity in post-pre spike protocols and weight dependence. We show that synapses can learn to fire according to Gaussian distributions with varying spreads, reflecting uncertainty in firing times. This variability is reflected in spiking learning, with high trial-to-trial variability in membrane dynamics. In a network, synapses coordinate to represent and utilize uncertainties in behaviorally ambiguous situations, resolving problems like classification and closed-loop control in dynamic environments.

**Implications:** Synaptic noise is not a bug, but a feature of biological and artificial systems. Our approach makes precise predictions about interplay of synaptic and neural dynamics, enabling synapses to encode and utilize uncertainties. This contrasts with previous approaches, where variability is exploited to reflect uncertainty in firing. Our framework suggests synapses learn to adapt efficacy to predict postsyn spikes, registered by backpropag action potentials.

**Conclusions:** Synapses utilize noise to represent uncertainty about somatic activity, enabling neuronal networks to encode and utilize uncertainties. This framework provides a novel understanding of synaptic function and dynamics, predicting synaptic plasticity, and variability. Our results have implications for understanding brain function and artificial systems, where synapses interact with uncertain environments.

**Title:** Reconstructing Cell Lineage Trees from Single-Cell DNA Sequencing Data with Scup: A Distance-Based Phylogen Inference Method

**Research Question:** How can we develop a robust and efficient method for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data, accounting for the challenges of allelic dropouts and amplification errors?

**Methods:** We present Scup, a distance-based phylogen inference method for reconstructing cell trees from bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Scup is designed to address the challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, including allelic dropouts and amplification errors. We use the neighbor-joining algorithm to compute distances between cell pairs and reconstruct the lineage tree.

**Findings:** Scup outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed and accuracy on various synthetic and biological datasets, including a dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage topology.

**Implications:** Single-cell sequencing enables detailed analysis of development and differentiation, but comes with challenges such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Our method, Scup, addresses these challenges and provides a robust solution for reconstructing lineage trees from single-cell DNA data.

**Conclusion:** Reconstructing lineage from single-cell data is a fundamental problem with potential for studies of development and differentiation. Our method, Scup, leverages the advantages of single DNA sequencing and addresses its challenges, obtaining better accuracy and speed than state-of-the-art methods.

**Title:** Efficient Allocation of Limited Resources in Low-Income Settings: A Novel Approach to Improving Population Health Outcomes through Health Benefit Packages

**Research Question:** How can we optimize the allocation of limited resources in low-income settings to improve population health outcomes given the available healthcare system capacity?

**Background:** Efforts to achieve this goal are often framed through the lens of "health benefits" packages (HB), which seek to establish services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. Analytic approaches used to weigh evidence support different interventions and inform the broader HB deliberation process have limitations.

**Methods:** We propose the individual-based Thanzi On (LO) model as a tailored tool to assist evaluation of Malawi-specific HBs addressing these limitations. Mechanistically modelling and calibrating extensive country-specific data on disease incidence, health behaviour, and healthcare capacity to meet demand under realistic resource constraints, we simulated health gains under plausible HB strategies.

**Findings:** Linear optimization (LA) achieved largest health gain (~8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023-204 compared to benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, incurred excess DALs in first years of implementation. Other prioritization approaches assessed, including service based on patient characteristics rather than type, achieved consistent gains relative to benchmark year-by-year and 5% reduction DALs over period.

**Implications:** Our approach provides a tool to test HBs designed for Malawi, evaluating health gains through prioritization of services under realistic constraints. Failure to capture effects would result in overestimation of health delivered by healthcare. We believe our approach an initial step toward realistic representation of constraints Malian healthcare system, postponing analysis to future work.

**Conclusion:** The LO simulation, first, placed realistic constraint on Malawi healthcare deliverable based data-driven human resources and time for different appointments. Modelling enforced under rigid healthcare approach (section 2) simulated impact under alternative credible HB formulations ensuring (a) services by system constrained realistic workforce, (b) take realistic time, (c) other aspects analogous status quo, including practice and consumables, beds. We introduce Malawi setting, novel evaluation of HBs based individual epidemiological model.

**Title:** Unveiling Novel Mechanisms of Meiotic Chromosome Dynamics in the Holocentric Moth Plodia interpunctella: Implications for Reproductive Success

**Research Question:** What are the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosomal events, such as homolog pairing and segregation, in the holocentric moth Plodia interpella, and how do they compare to those in the silkworm moth Bomby mor, which diverged from Plodia over 100 million years ago?

**Methods:** We employed Oligaint FISH to investigate meiotic chromosome dynamics in Plodia and compared our findings to previous studies in Bomby. We visualized single chromosomes at subchromosomal resolution and labeled one chromosome at a time to quantify which region (arms or center) pairs first as cells progress through early meiotic prophase.

**Findings:** Meiotic hom pairing in Plodia is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, mirroring previous studies in Bomby. Both species form rod-shaped cruciform bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bom, Plodia can orient bival in multiple ways at metaph I. Kinetochores assemble consistently at non-telomeric loci toward chromosome centers, regardless of where they are located in bivalent. Four distinct kinetochores are observed at metaph I, with clear end-on microtub attachments and lateral microtub attachments orienting separated kincho.

**Implications:** These findings challenge the classical view that paired, pole-facing kinchores are required for accurate hom separation in meiosis I. Our studies highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, as novel organisms can lead to discovery of novel biology.

**Conclusions:** Meiotic hom pairing in Plodia is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, similar to Bom. Both species form rod-shaped bivalents at metaph I, but Pl can orient bival in multiple ways. Kinchores assemble at nonel loci toward chromosome centers, regardless of where they are in bivalent. Four distinct kincho are observed at I, with end-on microt and lateral micro attachments orienting separated kin. These findings suggest a novel "center-kin" segregation mechanism in holoc species, where kincho formation is restricted to chromosome center.

**Title:** The Role of NG2-Glia in the Median Eminence and Pituitary Development: A Novel Insights into the Etiology of Hypopuitarism

**Research Question:** What is the role of NG-Glia in the median eminence (ME) in pituitary development, and how does the absence of Sox3 affect NG-Glia proliferation and differentiation, leading to hypopuitarism?

**Methods:** We used conditional deletion of Sox3 in the central nervous system (CNS) to induce hypopuitar, and characterized the effects on NG-Glia proliferation, differentiation, and pituitary maturation. We also treated Sox mutants with low-dose aspirin, known to affect NG-Glia, and observed rescue of proliferative defects and hypopuitar.

**Findings:** Absence of Sox3 predominantly affects NG-G in the ME, leading to hypopuitar phenotypes in juvenile animals, despite embryonic onset of Sox expression in pituit. NG-G renewal and oligodrocy differentiation are affected. Lowosein treatment rescues proliferative defects and hypopuitar in Sox mutants.

**Implications:** Our study highlights a central role of NG-G for ME function during postnatal development, indicating sensitivity to extrinsic signals. We propose sufficient NG-G are required in ME to support pituit maturation as animal becomes independent.

**Conclusions:** NG-G in ME are mostly affected by Sox loss and proliferation, but differentiation is corrected by lowose treatment or changes in gut microbiota. Our study reveals novel role NG-G in postnatal ME formation and control of pituit maturation, and otherwise robust phenotype due to Sox loss can be modified by non-gen factors.

**Title:** Coordinated Activation and Inhibition of F-actin Supports Morphogenesis: Understanding the Proteins that Regulate F-act is Important since these Proteins are Misregulated in Diseases like Cancer

**Research Question:** The study aimed to identify the GEF (Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor) that activates CED-10/Rac during embryonic cell migrations, which is essential for morphogenesis.

**Methods:** The study used Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis to identify the Gase CED-10/Rac as an activator of F-act and investigate the role of CED/C-12, a two-component GEF that activates C-10 to promote cell movements resulting in engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, CED/C-12 supported embryonic migrations, but inhibited F-act in the epidermis. To address this paradox, the study investigated if C-12 harbors GAP (GTPase Activating Protein) functions. A candidate region in C- away from the CEF catalytic region was mutated, altering epider cell function but not corpsement. Interfering with GEF by interfering C's ability to bind Rac/C-10 resulted in loss of ventral enclosure and corpsement.

**Implications:** The study proposes that C/C-12 supports cycling multiple Gases by distinct domains, both promoting and inhibiting F-act nucleation.

**Conclusions:**

1.  The study identified C- as a GEF for C-10 during embryonic migrations, contrary to expectations.
2. C- harbors a GAP function that acts on Gases, distinct from its GEF function.
3. The study highlights the complexity of F- regulation in morphogenesis and its misregulation in diseases like cancer.
4. Further investigation of GEFs that regulate C- during embryonic development is warranted.

**Key Findings:**

* C/C- activates C-10 to promote corpse engulfment, as previously proposed.
* A different GEF must activate C- during epider cell migration.
* 18 Gs in C. elegans regulate embryonic development, mainly CDC-42 or RHO-1.
* C- and C- act as bipart GEF promoting C-10 during programmed cell death.
* C- also promotes tissue migration, ventral enclosure leading to epider to enclose C.

**Title:** Hierarchical Temporal Processing in the Rodent Visual System: Unveiling the Role of Intrinsic Mechanisms in Efficient Coding

**Research Question:** How does the rodent visual system process information across various timescales, and what are the underlying mechanisms that enable this hierarchical processing?

**Methods:** We employed information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis to investigate the temporal dynamics of spiking activity in the mouse visual system under visual stimulation and spontaneous conditions. We also developed a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input to reproduce our observations.

**Findings:** Our results show that information and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. In contrast, intrinsic times for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas predictability was stimulus-dependent. We found that a gradual increase in times had more predictive power for both correlation and timescales, suggesting a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in mouse cortex.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for efficient coding. This indicates that intrinsic mechanisms, such as increased recurrent coupling, play a crucial role in shaping the temporal hierarchy of processing.

**Conclusions:** Together, predict and timescales provide a comprehensive view of the neural code, quantifying both the amount and timescale of redundancy in spiking. Our results indicate that network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as increased recurrent coupling, are important for the temporal hierarchy of processing in the rodent visual system. This challenges the hypothesis that recurrence enables longer integration of information, previously thought to be a cause of long timescales in primates. Instead, our modeling suggests that a decrease in predict can be caused by an increase in recurrent, as stronger coupling leads to reduction of temporal correlations from stimuli. Moreover, decreasing predict may reflect efficient coding, where subsequent stages remove more temporal redundancy in spike trains. Our results indicate that encoding and feature representations play a role, but cannot be the sole cause long and timescales.

**Title:** Elucidating the Neural Circuits Engaged by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) through Corticospinal Recordings: A Computational Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** The neural mechanisms underlying the response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) remain poorly understood, despite its non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. This study aimed to develop a computational model of the motor cortical macrocolumn using epidural recordings from the cervical spine to investigate direct and indirect waves generated by TMS.

**Methods:** Corticospinal recordings from human subjects were analyzed to identify pathways and machine learning was used to identify common features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis revealed neuron types preferentially contributing to corticosp waves, with single wave latency predicted by average probability of connections between activated neuron and layer 5 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Conduction delay of shortest path to PT determined latency of cortic wave.

**Findings:** Multiple neuron activations preferentially modulated cortic waves, supporting the hypothesis that different pathways contribute to cortic waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of afferents to motor cortex and specific neuron types initiated I-waves, interpreted to propose cortical origins of afferents giving rise to Iaves.

**Implications:** This study provides a workflow for computationally tractable sensitivity analysis on complex models relating network structure to mechanisms underlying response to acute stimulation. Corticosp waves represent activity of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons sending axons to spinal cord, with shortest direct wave representing direct activation. Intrinsic mechanisms allow PT to behave as oscillators, generating Iaves from repeated spiking due to initial excitation by T. Computational models integrating anatomical and electrophys details investigate T-induced cortosp waves.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to understanding network effects in motor cortex via descending activity propagating to spinal in response to T, recorded epidurally as cortospinal waves. Cortosp represent activity of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons sending axons to spinal, with shortest direct wave representing direct activation. Intrinsic mechanisms allow PT to behave as oscillators, generating Iaves from repeated spiking due initial excitation by T. Computational models integrating anatom and electrophys details investigate T-induced cortosp waves.

**Key Findings:**

* Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types preferentially contributing to cortosp waves
* Single wave latency predicted by average probability of connections between activated neuron and layer 5 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons
* Conduction of shortest path to PT determined latency of cort wave
* Multiple neuron activations preferentially modulated cort waves
* Participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cort waves
* Activation of affer to motor cortex and specific neuron initiated Iaves
* Cortical origins of affer giving rise to Iaves proposed

**Methodology:** This study provides a workflow for computationally tractable sensitivity analysis on complex models relating network structure to mechanisms underlying response acute stimulation. Cortosp waves represent activity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons sending axons to spinal, with shortest wave representing direct activation. Intrinsic mechanisms allow PT to behave as oscillators, generating Iaves from repeated spiking due initial excitation by T.

**Findings:** cfDNA is shed into maternal circulation throughout pregnancy, detectable as early as the 4th week of gestation, comprising up to 40% of total plasma cell-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cfDNA has been used in clinical NIPT to screen for fetal aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuploies. However, the basic biology of cfDNA remains poorly understood, hindering research and clinical utility.

**Implications:** Investigating cfDNA will improve understanding of placental physiological processes generating cf, cf role in pregnancy, and leveraging cf for monitoring placental health and disease. Fetal and placental genomes are generally identical, but placental mosa can occur, highlighting distinction between cf"etal" and cfplac"DNA, especially in clinical applications. cfDNA represents full placental genome, enabling non-invasive genome characterization.

**Conclusions:** cfDNA is a powerful tool for longitudinal studies of placental development and disease, currently hindered by ethical and availability of early-midestation samples. This opens avenues for clinical applications beyond NIPT, currently limited to genetic screening fetus. Further research is needed to elucidate cf origins, characteristics, and clinical applications, to unlock full potential of cfDNA in maternal circulation.

**Title:** Unraveling the Common Aetiology of Hormone-Dependent Cancers: A Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Shared Risk Loci and Candidate Genes

**Research Question:** Do hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, and prostate cancers, share a common genetic basis, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) integrating data from large-scale meta-analyses and fine-mapping of breast, endrial, ovarian, and prostate cancer variants to identify shared risk loci and candidate genes.

**Findings:** We identified 44 multi-DC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping regions associated with at least two HDCs, with 13 regions containing risk variants for three HDCs and 28 for two HDC. Integrating GW data, epigenomic profiling, and promoter Hi-C maps from diverse cell models, we annotated 53 candidate genes at multi-DC risk regions. These targets were enriched with established cancer genes from the COSMIC Cancer Census, but had previously unreported pleiotropic roles. We also pinpointed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in regions that altered transcription motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms.

**Implications:** Our study provides a framework for identifying common genes driving complex traits and understanding HDC susceptibility. Known drug targets were overrepresented among candidate-DC genes, implying some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or repurposing existing treatments for HDC.

**Conclusions:** This study expands the repertoire of risk regions and candidate genes for HDC, providing insights into the genetic and biological underpinning HDC susceptibility. Our approach highlights the importance of integrating GW, epigenomic, and Hi-C data to uncover shared mechanisms and pleiotropic variants. The identified candidate genes and lncRNAs warrant further investigation to elucidate their roles in HDC.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel Genetic Risk Factor for Polymyomyositis in the Kiker Dog Breed: A Genome-Wide Association and Sequencing Study

**Research Question:** We investigated the genetic basis of polymyositis in the Kiker dog, a breed with a high incidence of familial occurrence, suggesting an inherited cause.

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls, identifying a significant association with a region on chromosome 19 (p = 4.7*10-10). Haplotype analysis revealed a 2.9 Mb region shared in homozygous or heterozygous states. Next-generation sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a 39 kb deletion 10 kb upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2.

**Findings:** The frequency of the deletion was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in a random Kiker breed sample. Leukocytes from affected dogs homozyg for the deletion overexpressed IL and IL upon mitogen stimulation. We suggest elements 10-49 upstream of IL/IL play a role in regulation, and deletion is a risk factor for polymositis in Kiker.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates involvement of the IL/IL locus in polymos in Kiker, but the responsible element and function in inflammatory processes are yet to be discovered. The assay to genotype the deletion in Kiker provides a tool for breeders to prevent birth of high-risk dogs and reduce incidence of polymos in the breed.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest distant variants upstream IL could be important in human autoimmune diseases associated with the IL/IL region. The study indicates that variants may be found at least 10 kb upstream of IL. We postulate that regulatory elements of expression could be involved in pathogenesis.

**Title:** Large-Scale Protein Stability Dataset Enables Fine-Tuning of a Language Model for Predicting Protein Folding and Stability

**Research Question:** Can a large-scale protein stability dataset be used to fine-tune a language model for predicting protein folding and stability, enabling rapid optimization of protein design with fewer iterations?

**Methods:** We trained a protein language model, ESMm, on a mega-scale dataset of 528 natural and de novo-derived sequences from 461 protein domains, accommodating deletions, insertions, and multiple mutations. We fine-tuned ESM to predict folding stability and evaluated its performance on small protein domains and generalizability to sequences distant from the training set.

**Findings:** Our results show that ESM performs reasonably well on small domains and generalizes to sequences distant from the training set. We also demonstrate that training on an ensemble of protein domains, rather than a single domain, improves the fine-tuned protein model's performance for stability prediction. However, ESM's performance lags behind state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset mirroring the distribution of sequence lengths observed in nature. Training on an ensemble of protein domains, rather than a single domain, improves the fine-tuned model's performance. Although ESM's performance on larger protein scaffolds is limited, a larger stability dataset may improve its generalizability.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that folding prediction is possible using a language model, enabled by large-scale stability measurements. Fine-tuning ESM on absolute energy of small domains generalizes to protein distal domains, showing potential for transfer learning to reduce experimental burden. Our results highlight the benefits of training on all sequences, rather than a single wildtype. Although ESM's performance on larger scaffolds lags state-of-art, a stability dataset may improve its generalizability.

**Title:** Inhibitory Killer Immunoglobulin-Like Receptors Modulate CD4+ T Cell Responses in Type 1 Diabetes through HLA Class II Associations

**Research Question:** Do inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (iIR) modulate CD4+ T cell responses in Type 1 diabetes (T1) through HLA class II associations?

**Methods:** We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1 dataset (N = 11,961) to investigate the impact of iIR genes on HLA associations in T1.

**Findings:** We found that iIR genes, in the presence of their ligands, have a significant and consistent effect on HLA class II genetic associations. Our results were validated in an independent dataset.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that iIR decrease HLA II protective associations, indicating that iIR regulate CD+ T responses in T1.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that iIR modulate CD+ T responses in T1 through HLA II associations, supporting the hypothesis that iIR play a role in autoimmunity.

**Background:** iIR are a family of inhibitory receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and late-differentiated T cells. Accumulating evidence suggests i regulate T-mediated immunity. Recently, we reported T-mediated control was enhanced by iIR in viral infections. We hypothesized that in autoimmunity, where enhanced T response is detrimental, iIR would have opposite effect. T1 is a paradigm of autoimm, with HLA genes explaining 50% of genetic risk, indicating T have major role in T1 etiopathogenesis. To investigate iIR effect on T response, we asked if H associations were modified by i genes.

**Supporting Text:** Our aim was to conduct immunogenetic study the role of i in autoimm. Specifically, we investigated if functional i genes impact H associations T1. This is significant in other contexts; previously reported functional i genes enhanced and detrimental H disease in chronic infections. We postulated similar effect relevant autoimm. i study a family of inhibitory called inhibitory-cell immunoglobulin-like (iIR). IR are predominantly on NK cells, at lower, late-differentiated T. Ligands IR are H class molecules which bind broad groups, e.g. IR3 binds H-B alleles a motif 77-83. Impact IR on H associations not studied. Postulated, given impact adaptive responses chronic, IR play analogous autoimm. Associations H II and T clear CD+ cells role T. Hypothesized if IR modulate CD+ responses this manifest IR modulation H II genetic.

**Future Directions:** IR with ligands also enhance and detrimental H associations and impact clinical outcome chronic infections. Distinguish modulation protective and detrimental by IR, suggest modulation responses IR from effect, likely NK-mediated.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy (FE): A Comprehensive Analysis of CTG18.1 Expansion-Driven Pathophysiology in Primary Corneal Endothelial Cells

**Research Question:** Fuchs endothelial corne dystrophy (FE) is a leading cause of age-related vision loss and the most common repeat-mediated disease in humans, with up to 80% of European cases attributed to a non-coding CTG repeat expansion (CT18.1) within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene T4. Despite the non-coding nature of the repeat and transcript complexity of T4, deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying disease has been challenging.

**Methods:** We employed long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcript biomarkers in primary-derived corneal endothelial cells (ECs) from a large cohort of CT18.1-expanded (+) and CT18.1-independent (-) FE cases.

**Findings:** Long-read sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short transcriptomic data revealed extensive altered splicing within FE and unique transcripts associated with CT18.1 expansions. Differential expression analysis highlighted the transcript consequences of FE within ECs. Exon usage, pathway, and spatialomics revealed T4 isoform skewing in FE with potential functional consequences. Exome data from 134 FE cases identified rare minor frequency (<0.005) and deleterious T4 variants in 7 FE cases, suggesting T4 variants independent of CT18.1 may increase FE risk.

**Implications:** Our study supports the hypothesis that at least two pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and T4 iso-specific dysregulation, underpin the pathophysiology of FE. These findings will inform the development of translational interventions for this triplet-mediated disease.

**Conclusions:** This comprehensive analysis of CT18.1-driven pathophysiology in primary-derived ECs provides novel mechanistic insight into RNA-driven and T4 dysregulation features of repeat-mediated disease. We identified generic biomarkers occurring irrespective of CT18.1 status and rare deleterious T4 variants in FE cases, suggesting T4 dysregulation itself may be a risk factor for FE. Robust transcript analysis in a biologically relevant and genomic context highlights molecular signatures driven CT18.

**Title:** Identification of the Genetic Basis of Low-Temperature Germination (LT) in Rice (Oryza sativa) and Development of a Valuable Resource for Direct Seeding in Cold Climates

**Research Question:** To investigate the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LT) in rice (Oza sativa) and develop a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold climates.

**Methods:** We employed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify the QTL qG11 from rice variety Arroz da, which exhibits rapid germination at lower temperatures. We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing the GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, expressed during seed germination. Arroz da GFh encodes functional GFh, whereas Japanese variety Hitb harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying Ar da allele decreased LT, whereas overexpressing functionalh in Hitb increased LT, indicating GFh is the causal gene behind q11.

**Findings:** Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed the functionalh allele was lost in popular varieties during modern breeding. We generated NIL in Hitb background carrying 172-k genomic fragment from Ar da includingh. The NIL showed superior LT to Hitb, with comparable agronomic traits. The functionalh from Ar da represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.

**Implications:** Overexpressing functionalh was previously shown to improve anaerobic germination and seedling establishment under anaobic conditions. However, whether NIL-Gh exhibits seedling vigor at low temperatures in fields remains to be determined. We suggest GFh controls LT by interacting with phytohorm signaling pathways. Haplotype analysis ofh revealed ten distinct based on polymorphic sites in theh region.

**Conclusions:** We identified GFh as responsible for LT-related QTL in Portuguese variety Ar da. Our study provides multiple evidence that GFh contributes to LT. Expression of functional during germination was previously unclear. We generated NIL in Hitb background carrying 172-k fragment from Ar includingh, which showed superior LT to Hitb with comparable agronomic traits. The functional from Ar represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold climates.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Terminal Redundancy (TR) in Hepatitis B Virus (HB) DNA Replication: A Study of 5' and 3' Flap Structures and Flap Endonucleases

**Research Question:** The hepatitis B virus (HB) relaxed circular (rc) DNA possesses an 8-9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy (TR) on the negative strand derived from the reverse transcription of pregenomic (pg) RNA. It remains unclear whether TR forms a 5' or 3' flap on HBrcDNA and which copy is removed during covalently circular (cc) DNA formation.

**Methods:** A mutant HB cell line HepDES182G was established with a C2G mutation in the pgRNA sequence altering the 3' TR while the 5 TR remained wild type (wt). Production of HBrc and ccDNA in HepDES2 cells was comparable to wt levels. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed the positive strand of rcDNA and both strands cc predominantly carried wt residue, indicating the 5 TR serves as template during rc replication forming duplex with the strand while 3 forms a flap structure removed during cc formation.

**Findings:** A survey of cellular endonucleases using loss-of-function study found 3' endonuclease Mus plays a role in cc formation alongside 5 endonuc F1. We mapped Mus and F cleavage sites within TR of nuclear-rc by RACE-NG analyses. Overlapping between Mus and F1 in cc formation indicates putative 5 and 3 formed TR are dynamically on rc precursor.

**Implications:** These findings shed light on HBrc structure and cc mechanisms contributing to understanding HB replication.

**Conclusions:** Our results indicate that 5 TR serves as template during rc replication forming duplex with strand while 3 forms a flap structure removed during cc formation. Mus and F1 play critical roles in cc formation in wild-type HB replicating cells. The putative 5 and 3 TR are dynamically interchangeable on rc precursor. These findings contribute to understanding HB replication cycle.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Metabolic Cross-Feeding in Microbial Communities in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) Treating Sulfide-Containing Wastewater: A Genome-Scale Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** How do microbial communities in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a cannedine factory respond to varying organic loading rates (OLRs) and what are the underlying metabolic dynamics driving their adaptation?

**Methods:** We developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale model (mmEM) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFC treating sulfide wastewater. The model encompassed three major guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). Simulations were conducted using mmEM to investigate how changes in metabolic capacities of key groups and substrate availability influence interactions and dynamics within MFC.

**Findings:** Our results revealed a shift from SO-domin to METomin community as OLR increased, accompanied by a decline in M performance. mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at low OLRs (LOLR) and adaptation to high OLR (HL). Simulations revealed constraints on SO growth under HL due to reduced-sulfide (S) cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, facilitating their dominance. Assessing crossfeeding under OLR enabled scenario-based simulations to explore impact of elevated levels SO growth and M performance.

**Implications:** This work highlights the role of metabolic crossfeeding in shaping community response to OLR. Insights gained will inform effective strategies for implementing M technology in real-world environments.

**Conclusions:**

1. Metabolic crossfeeding plays a crucial role in shaping microbial composition and M performance under varying OLR.
2. mmEM facilitated comprehensive study of dynamic interactions within communities M, enhancing understanding ecology and optimization for biotechn applications.
3. Associations among groups are driven by metabolic characteristics and wastewater profile.
4. mmEM precisely simulated abundances under LR and HR conditions, highlighting roles SR, MET, and SO in shaping composition M across OLR.
5. Adaptation is linked to crossfeeding among guilds, influencing M performance.

**Key Findings:**

* Shift from SO-domin to METomin community as OLR increased
* mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at LO and HR
* Simulations revealed constraints SO growth under HL due reduced-sulf (S) and acetate cross with SR
* More metabolites SR diverted to MET, facilitating dominance
* Assessing crossfeeding under O enabled scenario-based to explore impact SO growth and M

**Title:** Controlling False Discovery Rate in Machine Learning-Assisted Biological Discovery: A Framework for Reliable Enzyme Function Prediction

**Research Question:** How can we develop a machine learning (ML) framework to predict enzyme functions with controlled false discovery rate (FDR) in biological discovery, ensuring reliable and efficient use of experimental resources?

**Methods:** We propose CPEC, a novel ML framework that integrates deep learning with conformal prediction to provide accurate and FDR-controlled predictions for enzyme functions. Conformal prediction provides statistical guarantees that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. We evaluate CPEC using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery of less-characterized enzymes.

**Findings:** CPEC achieves reliable F control, better or comparable performance at lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for underrepresented in training data. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of C in addressing the challenge of overconfident ML predictions and false positives in biological discovery.

**Implications:** CPEC is a useful tool for biological applications where high validation rate is desired but budget is limited. By specifying desired F tolerance, users can make predictions with controlled F, ensuring efficient use of resources and reliability of ML-assisted discovery.

**Conclusions:** We address the challenge of overconfident ML predictions in biological discovery by introducing C, a framework that leverages conform prediction to achieve F-controlled functions. C enables users to specify desired F, tailored to experiment goals and makes predictions with controlled. Our results demonstrate C's effectiveness in enzyme function annotation, simulating discovery of less-character enzymes. We expect C to be a valuable tool for biological where high validation is desired but budget is limited.

**Title:** The Role of HSP-90 Chaperone in Modulating TDP-43 Proteinopathies in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

**Research Question:** Does the heat shock chaper HSP-90 contribute to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by modulating the aggregation and toxicity of hyperphosphorylated T-43 (TDP-43) protein?

**Methods:** We employed a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model expressing full-length human TDP-43 protein containing ALS-causing mutations to investigate the role of HSP-90 in T-43 proteinopathies. We used genetic and pharmacological approaches to disrupt H-90 function and examined the effects on T-43 aggregation, neurotoxicity, and neurodegeneration.

**Findings:** Loss of H-90 function protected against T-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult C. elegans, accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated T-43 protein. We found that H-90 mutation upregulates key stress responsive heat shock gene expression, including H-70 and H-16.1, and demonstrated that normal levels of H-16.1 are required for H-90 effects on T-43. Moreover, the neuroprotective effect of H-90 did not involve regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans.

**Implications:** Our data demonstrate for the first time that H-90 chaper activity contributes to adverse outcomes in T- proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS. These findings suggest that H-90 plays a critical role in modulating T- misfolding and toxicity, and that its dysfunction may be a potential therapeutic target for ALS treatment.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of H-90 in the pathogenesis of ALS and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying T- protein aggregation and neurotoxicity. These findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting H-90 to prevent or treat ALS. Further studies are needed to investigate the role of H-90 in human ALS and explore its potential as a therapeutic target.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Pathways Regulating Oogenesis and Cellular Identity in the Arthropoda Female Reproductive System: A Comparative Analysis of Artemia franciscana and Drosophila melanogaster

**Research Question:** Despite the diversity of morphologies, reproductive modes, and sex systems in Arthropoda, our understanding of the molecular pathways regulating oogenesis and cellular identity in the female reproductive system is limited, primarily due to the focus on model systems such as Drosophila and Daphnia. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by generating a comprehensive single-nucleus atlas of the Artemia francana female reproductive system and comparing it to the well-characterized Doph melanogaster ovary.

**Methods:** We employed single-nucle RNA sequencing (sn-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATACq) to produce a detailed atlas of the Artemia ovary, identifying somatic and germl cell types. We mapped our data to the Fly Atlas of D melanaster ovary, shedding light on conserved regulatory programs between distantly related Arthropoda species. Additionally, we explored gene expression and regulation of the chromosome during meiosis, highlighting unique dynamics and the presence of meiotic chromosome silencing in this group.

**Findings:** Our single-nucle sequencing resolved cellular complexity of the Artemia ovary, identifying clusters with distinct expression patterns sharing homology with Doph ovarian clusters, suggesting conserved expression programs for cellular identity and function. We annotated cell types by mapping clusters to Doph ovary using SAM and filtered for alignment above 0.2, supporting high conservation of molecular pathways defining identity in the ovary. Single-nucle RNA and AT-seq data revealed transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics in germ cells during oogenesis.

**Implications:** This study highlights the utility of single-nucle sequencing as an alternative to traditional approaches, such as epigen profiling and RNA-FISH, for studying meiotic chromosome regulation in species with difficulty isolating meiotic cells. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding oogenesis and cellular identity in female Arthropoda, shedding light on conserved programs between distantly related species.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of single-nucle sequencing in resolving cellular heterogeneity in the female reproductive system and exploring unique regulatory and chromatin accessibility in cell types. Our analysis of meiotic chromosome regulation in a heterogametic system contributes to the field, and highlights the potential of single-nucle sequencing for studying meiotic regulation in species with difficulty isolating meiotic cells. This work provides a comprehensive atlas of the Artemia female reproductive system, shedding light on conserved pathways regulating oogenesis and cellular identity in Arthropoda.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mechanisms of Allodynia: A Physiologically Motivated Modeling of Dorsal Horn Circuits in Chronic Pain

**Research Question:** What are the underlying mechanisms of allodynia, a debilitating symptom of chronic pain characterized by non-painful stimuli producing painful responses, and how do they vary across individuals?

**Methods:** We analyzed biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures common in laminae-II of the dorsal horn, hypothesized to mediate two types of allody: static and dynamic. Using neural rate models, we described activity of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. We implemented sensitivity analysis to identify mechanisms likely causing allody-producing dysregulation of subc's E signaling.

**Findings:** Disruption of E balance occurs due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling or upregulation excitatory responses, releasing excitatory neurons from inhibitory control or escaping inhibitory control, respectively. Mechanisms, subcirc involved, and proportion exhibiting vary depending on subc structure.

**Implications:** Our results suggest diverse mechanisms may be responsible for allody, explaining interindividual variability and offering targets for experimental studies on chronic pain mechanisms.

**Conclusions:** Dysregulation of E balance in dorsal circuitry is a compelling cause of chronic pain, supported by preclinical studies. However, understanding circuit complexity leaves questions on how dysreg occurs. Our subc motifs reflect recent evidence mediating static and dynamic allody (evoked by von Fre device). Including spiking in rate network analysis, we unraveled interactions maintaining or disrupting E balance in dorsal circuits. Afferent inputs mediate static and dynamic allody. Successful treatment of chronic pain requires understanding physiological causes. Dysreg of E balance in dorsal circuit is supported by preclinical evidence, but our understanding leaves many questions on how dysreg occurs.

**Title:** Distinct Roles of Hsp90 and Cochaperones in Regulating Elongation Factor 2 (EF2) Function: Implications for Protein Homeostasis

**Research Question:** How do Hsp and cochones regulate the function of elongation factor 2 (EF), a critical for ribosome translocation, and what are the implications for protein homeostasis?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Hsp and cochones in regulating EF function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We examined the effects of mutations in H and cochones on steady-state levels of EF, growth, and sensitivity to diphia toxin, a posttranslational modification of EF.

**Findings:** Our results show that H and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF function. Mutations in one group of H or one cochone reduced steady-state levels of EF, while mutations in another group altered sensitivity to diphia toxin. Further, we found that H mutants affected EF accumulation were negatively impacted by deletion of the gene encoding H1, and mutations in EF that mimic disease-associated mutations in human EF were impacted by loss of H1 and partially rescued by overexpression of H1.

**Implications:** Our findings provide evidence that H contributes to homeasis not only by assisting protein folding but also enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. Moreover, results suggest that yeast H mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochones, indicating distinct versions of the H folding pathway may chaper different types of clients.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the critical role of H in translation elongation, in addition to initiation, and identifies H as a protein bridging the interaction of EF with C and H90 or the TR cochone. Further studies are required to understand the interaction of H and EF with TRC and H90, whether they represent independent pathways or sequential interactions. Our results suggest that H and cochones have genetically distinct roles in mediating EF function, with folding dependent on H, C7, and C1 cochones and sensitive to H mutants in one group. We aim to identify differences in how interact with H and cochones to provide insight into mechanisms of selective inhibition of H function.

**Title:** Disrupted Utility-Based Risky Decision-Making in Social Contexts: The Role of Social Conformity as a Heuristic

**Research Question:** How do individuals make decisions in social contexts when their utility-based risk preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, such as in cases of cognitive impairment or novel options?

**Methods:** We examined participants with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), key regions implicated in risky decision-making, as they played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others' choices.

**Findings:** Both lesion groups showed disrupted use of utility-based computations for risky options in socially situated decisions, but increased conformity with others' choices, independent of utility-based computations. This suggests that in social contexts, others' choices may serve as a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that social conformity can serve as an alternative to utility-based processing in socially situated decision-making when individuals' risk processing is impaired. If individuals with impairments in utility-based decision-making rely on conformity to a greater extent, we expect a parametric relationship between degree of impairment and use of 'others' choices' heuristic. Indeed, across lesion and control groups, individuals most disrupted in utility-based decision showed greater use of this heuristic when making decisions under risk in social context.

**Conclusions:** Our results suggest a trade-off between utility-based processes and cognitively demanding heuristics facilitates decisions about risky options in social context. When utility-based decision-making is disrupted, individuals rely on others' choices as a heuristic. This relationship was replicated in an independent sample of participants, providing convergent evidence for the notion that there is a trade-off between utility-based processes and cognitively less heuristics.

**Title:** Exploring the Role of Developmental Bias in Morphological Evolution: Insights from Dawkins' Biomorphs

**Research Question:** Can Dawkins' biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution, be used to illustrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive outcomes, and if so, what are the implications for our understanding of evolutionary processes?

**Methods:** Using population simulations, we investigated the emergence of phenotypic variation in Dawkins' biom, a simplified model of morphological development, and found that it exhibits bias towards simpler phenotypes with low description complexity. This bias is formalized by an information-theoretic principle, analogous to evolution searching in algorithmic space. We also observed high mutational robustness and positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness, similar to molecular-genotype maps.

**Findings:** Our results show that Dawkins biom exhibits bias towards simplicity, a type of developmental bias, where certain phenotypes are orders of magnitude more likely to appear through mutations. This bias towards simplicity is formalized by an information-theoretic principle. We also found that moderately adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biomorphs that are less frequent. These patterns resemble findings in molecular-genotype maps.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that developmental bias towards simplicity and other patterns in Dawkins biom share with molecular-genotype maps may hold more widely for developmental systems. This prompts the question whether we expect to see bias in development generally or simplicity more specifically in systems. Our simulations show that phenotypic bias can influence adaptive evolution when phenotypes convey advantage, the more frequent (and usually simpler) is more likely to evolve.

**Conclusions:** Dawkins biom illustrates the power of natural selection in a more complex system than simple "ASE" program. Our results demonstrate the generation of phenotyp variation systematically in this system and test the hypothesis that this model morphological development exhibits bias and phenomena similar to molecular-genotype maps. We postulate that bias towards simplicity and other patterns in Dawkins biom hold more widely for developmental systems. Future research should investigate conditions under which sequence-constraint provide useful approximation and whether these hold in genotype maps.

**Title:** Human Sensitivity to Resonance in Nonlinear Systems: Exploring the Ability to Intuitively Excite and Stabilize Nonlinear Motions

**Research Question:** Can humans intuitively excite and stabilize nonlinear motions in complex systems, particularly those with nonlinear dynamics that cannot be analytically predicted?

**Methods:** A user study consisting of three experiments was conducted to investigate human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems. Participants interacted with a virtual double pendulum through a haptic joystick, tasked with hitting targets aligned with or offset from the nonlinear modes (N) of the system. A numerical tool was used to compute the NMs of the energy-conservative systems.

**Findings:** In all experiments, participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite and stabilize motions close to the N of the system, even when targets were located away from the N. For increased accuracy, participants adjusted arm stiffness to align resonant motions to the task, demonstrating the ability to shape dynamics through muscle changes.

**Implications:** This study extends existing research on human sensitivity to resonance to nonlinear systems, highlighting the ability to control and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions. Our findings suggest that humans can intuitively excite and stabilize nonlinear systems by adjusting stiffness to align resonant motions.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that humans are sensitive to resonance in nonlinear systems, even when dynamics cannot be analytically predicted. The ability to intuitively excite and stabilize nonlinear motions has implications for understanding human control and interaction with complex systems, particularly in robotics and biomechanics.

**Title:** Regulation of Pulcherrin Biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis: A Complex Interplay of Transition Regulators and Transcription Factors

**Research Question:** How do transition regulators (TSRs) and transcription factors influence pulerr biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis during the transition from exponential to stationary phase?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of two transition regulators, ScoC and Abr, and the Mar-family factor PR in regulating pulerr production in Bacillus subtilis. Genetic analysis revealed that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerr production during exponential phase and influence the rate and amount of pulerr produced. Expression of the pul biosynthesis gene yC was found to be under the control of Sco, Abr, and PR, and correlated with the amount of pulerr produced in each background. In vitro data indicated a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR.

**Findings:** Our biochemical analysis showed that regulators of the pul bios operon and transition regulators Sco and Abr bind the yC promoter with differing affinities. Results indicate pulerr regulation in Bacillus subtil is under tight repression during exponential growth by two distinct systems. Transition regulators Sco and Abr have been studied for roles in diverse Bacillus physiology, including sporulation, competence, protease production, and biofilm formation. Microarray analysis of effect of Sco on global expression was carried out in cells at different growth points in media.

**Implications:** Our results establish roles of PR and Abr in regulation of gene expression in vitro and provide evidence that Sco can bind to yC in vitro. Together, results establish a model where pul biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during transition to stationary phase and input from PR, linking stationary with extracellular sequestration. However, results suggest PR and Abr act as roadblocks to RNAP progression at y (Fig 7 and 7). Role of Sco involves direct and indirect regulation through another factor Sco modulates. Together, presence of three repressors is necessary to limit pul production, providing mechanistic insight into regulatory network of production in bacteria.

**Conclusions:** In Bacillus subtil, arrays of gene function together to precisely time expression products. An example is series made as cells transition growth to stationary upon nutrient limitation. Our study highlights complex regulation of pulerr biosynthesis in Bac subtilis, underscoring importance in physiology.

**Title:** Mathematical Modeling of Neural Control of Mictition after Spinal Cord Injury and the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying detrusor-sphinct dyssyria (DSD) and urinary incontinence after spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in alleviating these conditions.

**Methods:** A computational model of the neural circuit of mictition was developed based on the Hodgkin-Hux equations, replicating normal bladder function. Interneurons and network complexity were added to reproduce dysfunctional mictition after SCI, and the density and complexity of interactions of inhibitory and excitatory lumbar interneurons were modified to simulate the effects of TMS on the spinal cord.

**Findings:** The model replicated the re-emergence of a voiding reflex after SCI, and the improved coordination between detrus and urethral sphincter activity observed with low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) and enhanced urine storage with high-frequency T (30 Hz). Neuroplasticity and complexity among lumbar interneurons were necessary to replicate the effects of SCI on mition, and network modifications of interne were essential to understand the mechanisms of T on bladder dysfunction.

**Implications:** This study provides a framework for analyzing neural circuits controlling mition after SCI and the effects of T on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention for bladder dysfunction. The model captures normal/void functions and disorders of the bladder after SCI, such as D and overactivity, and simulates the effects of T on the spinal at the single-cell level based on experimental findings from patch-clamp and extracellular recordings.

**Conclusions:** The study highlights the importance of interactions among spinal interneurons, plasticity, and reorganization of circuitry in the emergence of a latent void reflex after SCI. Upper-level injuries (T or above) block communication between brainstem and spinal mition circuits. Modeling the dynamical behavior of neural controlling mition provides a mechanism to explore how SCI alters mition and how T may improve bladder function. Previous models focused on biomechan features of the bladder with limited neurophys controls or ignored biomechan constraints.

**Title:** Quantifying Fungal Growth: A Novel Mathematical Model for Estimating Morphology-Specific Growth Rates from Indirect Optical Density Data

**Research Question:** Can we develop a mathematical model to estimate morphology-specific growth rates of filamentous fungi from easy-to-collect, indirect optical density (OD600) data, without requiring calibration data generation, making it accessible to all microbiology laboratories?

**Methods:** We proposed a model that treats OD600 as an observed variable distributed around a linear transformation of true fungal concentration, explicitly including calibration in the structure. We evaluated the model's ability to fit and predict OD using time-course OD data for Aspergillus fumatus, a filamentous fungus, and estimated morphology-specific growth using directly measured data.

**Findings:** Our model outperformed reference models in fitting and predicting OD growth curves, overcoming discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD versus directly measured data in models without calibration. We demonstrated the model's ability to estimate morphology-specific growth rates from indirect OD data without calibration, making it accessible to all microbiology laboratories collecting OD data.

**Implications:** This study presents a novel mathematical model to infer biologically interpretable morphology-specific growth from indirect OD data, eliminating the need for calibration data collection. Unlike bacteria, calibration data cannot be reused for filamentous fungi due to OD sensitivity to size and shape. Directly fitting true growth to OD data resulted in model misfit and lower rates compared to estimated from direct measures.

**Conclusions:** Our model estimates morphology-specific growth rates from indirect OD data without calibration, making it accessible to all microbiology, not just specialist laboratories with automated methods or point-and-click. Instead of collecting time-course growth data, indirect measures can be used for growth estimation or mechanistic modeling by optical density (OD). This study aims to model filamentous growth and estimate morphology-specific rates from OD at 600nm without calibration, considering OD is an indirect measure.

**Title:** Unraveling the Evolution of Sex Chromosome Diversity in Beetles: A Phylogenetic and Genomic Insights

**Research Question:** How do sex chromosomes evolve and diversify in the most species-rich group of animals, beetles, and what are the driving forces behind this process?

**Methods:** We generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confus, a beetle with a neo-sex chromosome, and utilized eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. We identified ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, that share conserved genes across beetles, and found that the ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beet, while autosomes are independently added to the sex chromosomes.

**Findings:** Our phylogenetic sampling of beet suggests that they are a promising model to study patterns of kary evolution and evolutionary forces on chromosomes. We show that ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing kary evolution study at the molecular level. The ancestral X is conserved in Coleoptera, but multiple formations of neo-sex chromosomes occur among closely related species. Comparative analysis is needed to address the prevalence of these patterns and driving forces across species.

**Implications:** This study provides a novel model to better understand the forces driving sex chromosome evolution in beet, a species with diverse karyotypes and sex mechanisms. Our phylogen sampling and genomic approaches reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera, with a new chromosome-level assembly for Tribium confus and published assemblies from eleven species spanning the phylogeny.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of Coleoptera as a model system to study molecular and evolutionary mechanisms driving sex chromosome differentiation across taxa. While chromosomal sex determination is conserved, the identity of sex chromosomes is unclear, as seen in Diptera, which have XY chromosomes but genomic diversity in kary among species. The abundance of beet and development of genomic tools make Cole a valuable system to study the forces driving sex chromosome evolution.

**Title:** Modulation of Chromatin Structure and DNA Accessibility by Histone Variant H2 (H2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: A Role in Transcriptional Regulation under Stress Conditions

**Research Question:** How does the incorporation of histone variant H2 (H2) encoded by the non-essential HT1 gene in Saccharomy cerevisiae modulate chromatin structure and DNA accessibility, and what is its role in transcriptional regulation, particularly under stress conditions?

**Methods:** We generated mRNA profiles for wild-type, ht1, sw1, and ht1sw1 mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea (H), which induces DNA stress. We analyzed six biological replicates to examine the role of H2 in activation and repression during H exposure.

**Findings:** H2 played a more prominent role in activation than repression during H exposure, and its incorporation was important for upregulation of several H-induced genes. Apo-SWR-C contributed to expression defects in ht mutants, particularly genes involved in phosphate homeostasis. Mapping H2 incorporation before and after H treatment revealed decreases in H enrichment at transcription sites correlated with, but not required, upregulation of genes during H exposure.

**Implications:** This study characterizes the regulatory effects of H incorporation during transcriptional response to H. Our results suggest that H plays a larger role in activation than repression in Sacomyces, particularly during H exposure.

**Conclusions:** The relationship between H incorporation and activation in Sacomy may only be fully elucidated after a change in environment or introduction of cellular stress. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the additive effects of apo-SWR-C on transcript profiles to effectively examine the effects of H incorporation on expression.

**Title:** Leveraging Partial Label Learning for Automated Classification of Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiles

**Research Question:** How can we overcome the challenge of annotating single-cell transcriptomic profiles obtained from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data into various cell types and identifying their lineage relationships, given the rapid accumulation of datasets and high dimensionality of the data?

**Methods:** To address this challenge, we propose the use of partial learning, a framework where a set of candidate labels is provided for each data point, a simpler setting than fully supervised learning. We extend state-of-the-art multi-classification methods, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), prototype-based regression, and ensemble methods to the partial learning framework. We also investigate the effect of incorporating label structure into methods, focusing on hierarchical labels observed in developmental processes.

**Findings:** On simulated and real datasets, our extensions enable learning from partially labeled data and perform with high accuracy, particularly with a prototype-based method. Notably, performances of methods trained with partially annotated data reach those of fully supervised. Furthermore, we study the level of uncertainty in partially annotated data and derive prescriptive results on its effect on accuracy of label methods.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies can solve automated single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying on less stringent annotated datasets than fully learning. The flexibility and adaptability of partial learning make transcriptomic annotation easier and prediction more routine, interrogating mechanisms underlying cell differentiation.

**Conclusions:** This paper addresses the challenge of resolving partially annotated single-cell transcriptomics by solving partial learning. We compare implementations on simulated and experimental data, focusing on hierarchical labels found in differentiating systems. Limitations arise from transcript profiles lacking temporal and spatial information and manual annotation tedious, time-consuming expert knowledge. Rapid data accumulation makes accurate annotation single RNA datasets into cell types a major challenge. Training classifiers on profiles, even partially annotated, benefits from geometrical properties. Our highest performing classifier, prototype-based, shows cell identity and position in space not a linear function.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (P2) in Establishing Nuclear Architecture through Association with RNA-dependent Proteins

**Research Question:** How does Phosphidyositol 4,5-bisphosphate (P2) interact with RNA-dependent proteins to form nuclear compartments such as speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipidlets, influencing gene expression?

**Methods:** We employed mass spectrometry to unveil the RNA-dependent P2-associated (RD) proteome in human cells, identifying intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with polyP2-binding/R motifs prevalent in RD proteins. We found that these IDRs exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites.

**Findings:** We discovered that Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) associates with P2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and altered P2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BR4 protein. Our results suggest that P2 orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins, affecting their ability to form foci via phase separation.

**Implications:** This study reveals the pivotal role of P in establishing a functional nuclear architecture for gene expression. We propose that P acts as a molecular wedge via RNA to attract and retain different sets of RD proteins to distinct nuclear subpopulations (speckles, nucleoli, and NLs).

**Conclusions:** P localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA and RD proteins that associate with P in a higher RNA-dependent manner. Our optimized MS-based pipeline can be applied to other lipid-protein interactors. This work provides mechanistic insights into the biological implications of P localization in the nucleus.

**Title:** Unraveling the Genomic Mechanisms of Phenotypic Plasticity in Dung Beetles: A Comparative Genomic and Developmental Insights into the Evolution of Nutrition-Responsive Traits

**Research Question:** What are the genomic mechanisms underlying the development and evolution of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, particularly in relation to nutrition-responsive traits such as horn formation?

**Methods:** We generated chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the Onthagini tribe (Onophagus taurus, O. sagarius, and Digitophagusella) and compared them to seven other Coleoptera species to identify coding and non-coding changes associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. We also analyzed chromatin accessibility in developing horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females to identify cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition-responsive development.

**Findings:** Our results highlight the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrating that gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals. We identified sequence changes in coding and nonoding associated with adaptations to dung ecology, including lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, juvenile hormone production, and embryonic transcriptional regulation. In-depth analysis of horn development revealed remarkable non-synonymous substitutions in regulatory genes, potentially playing adaptive roles in species development.

**Implications:** This study provides new-quality genomes for three species, bolstering future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group. Our findings shed light on the genomic basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, highlighting the role of chromatin and nonoding in mediating nutrition-responsive traits.

**Conclusions:** Phenotypic plasticity is a key driver of diversification and adaptation, yet its genomic mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study reveals the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrating gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals.

**Title:** Elucidating the Pathogenesis of Lassa Fever: Unveiling the Dynamics of Lassa Virus Infection and Immune Response in a Cynomolgus Monkey Model

**Research Question:** The pathogenesis of Lassa fever remains poorly understood, particularly the mechanisms determining whether acute infection leads to controlled illness or catastrophic death. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of Lassa virus (LASV) infection and immune response associated with survival or death in a cynolgus monkey model reproducing different disease outcomes.

**Methods:** We performed histological and transcriptomic studies on cynolg monkeys infected with Josiah and AV strains of LASV, which uniformly resulted in fatal and non-fatal Lassa fever, respectively.

**Findings:** Lymphoid organs were an early reservoir for replicating virus, with LAS entering the cortical sinus of lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, viral tropism varied with severity, with limited dissemination to lymphoid organs and immune cells in non-fatal Lassa, whereas systemic dissemination to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and excessive response, was associated with fatal outcome.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insight into early viral dynamics and host response to LAS infection according to disease outcome. Our cynolg monkey model reproduces fatal and non-fatal Lassa, highlighting the importance of lymphoid organs as early reservoirs for LAS replication in infected animals, irrespective of disease severity. Tropism, dissemination, and immune infiltration strikingly differ between animals according to disease.

**Conclusion:** This study sheds light on the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and immune mechanisms associated with different outcomes. Animal models are crucial for understanding pathogenesis Lassa and enabling control of LAS leading to illness and death in humans.

**Title:** Uncovering the Upstream Role of Importin-β Nuclear Defects in Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Novel Insights from Mouse and Human Cellular Models

**Research Question:** What is the causal relationship between Importin-β nuclear defects and neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal dementia, and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)?

**Methods:** We employed two novel mouse models of neurodegeneration, NemR86 and NemR487, which recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, and investigated the role of Import-β nuclear import. We observed cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FT and AD/AD, including TDP, Importβ, Ran1, and Ran. Further, we identified transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurogenerative disease and showed that transient inhibition of Importβ in mouse and human neuronal non-neuronal cells induced proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations.

**Findings:**

1. **Import-specific nuclear block in mouse models of neurodegeneration:** NemR and NemR recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurogenerative diseases.
2. Cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in pathogenesis ALSFT and ADAD, including T, Importβ, Ran1, and Ran.
3.Pathological interaction between Importβ and mutant NemR protein in cytoplasm accumulations.
4.Transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurogener disease.
5.Transient inhibition of Importβ in mouse and human nonuronal cells induces proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations.

**Implications:** Our convergent results between mouse and human cellular biology provide mechanistic evidence that mislocalized and dysregulated events in neurogener diseases may arise from primary defect Importβ import. This has critical implications for investigating sporadic forms neurode arising from unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importβ function.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates causal role of Importβ nuclear import in neurogenerative diseases, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

**Title:** Temporally Modulating Phage Epigenetic Modifications to Enhance CRISPR-Cas-Med Mutagenesis of Lytic Bacteriophages

**Research Question:** How can we improve the efficiency of CRISPRas-mediated mutagenesis of lytic bacteriophages by reducing epigenetic modifications in their DNA?

**Methods:** We employed the eukary enzyme NgET to temporally reduce 5-methylcytosine (5mC) modifications in the T4 bacteriophage genome, enabling specific targeting with CRPR-Cas and introducing point mutations in a scarless manner.

**Findings:** Temporal reduction of 5mC in the T4 genome facilitated efficient targeting with CR-Cas, resulting in the introduction of point mutations in two AD-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. We observed that modifications protect the T4 genome from Cas12-mediated cleavage, enabling efficient lysis. Analyzing NgT-treated T4 in the same settings, we observed a 250 min delay in lysis compared to WT T4.

**Implications:** Our study presents a novel approach for precise, site-specific ph mutagenesis based on temporally reducing phage modifications, enhancing DNA accessibility for nucleases and boosting mutagen efficiency. The scarless nature of this approach allows studying the impact of introduced mutations on ph infection without side effects associated with gene deletion or insertion. Our findings propose an efficient strategy introducing mutations into genomes of lytic phages with cytosine-based DNA.

**Conclusions:** Temporal modulation of the ph epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research comprehending phage mechanisms through generation of mutants. By temporally reducing 5m, we elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 infections necessitating gene deletions. This approach enables investigation of phage functions and streamlining of phages with cytosine DNA. Our study circumvents previous limitations and presents a novel strategy for precise, site-specific ph mutagenesis.

**Title:** Histone H2A2 Plays a Crucial Role in Maintaining Genome Stability by Facilitating Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair after UV Irradiation

**Research Question:** How does histone H2 contribute to the maintenance of genome stability in response to UV-induced DNA damage?

**Methods:** We employed an unbiased genetic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify histone variant H2 as a key player in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCER) following UV irradiation.

**Findings:** In the absence of H2, repair by TCER is severely impaired, and RNA polymerase II clearance is reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. Histone H2 is required for proficient TCER and plays a major role in maintaining genome stability upon UV irradiation.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the significance of a repair-optimized chromatin environment in maintaining genomic stability. Histone variant H is essential for efficient TCER and RNA polymerase II clearance following UV irradiation. Importantly, UV-irradiation of H2-depleted cells leads to accumulation of double-strand breaks, a major threat to genome stability.

**Conclusions:** Histone H2 is a conserved from yeast to human and is essential for proper mammalian development, but not in budding yeast except under rapid transcriptional activation conditions. Previous studies have linked H2 to DNA damage response, double-strand break repair, chromosome segregation, double-strand break resolution, and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. Our results support a role for histone H in regulation of RNA polymerase II occupancy and TCER efficiency upon UV irradiation. Importantly, defective response to damage leads to sustained double-strand breaks and genome instability in H2-depleted cells.

**Title:** Investigating the Pervasiveness of Gene Expression Variation and its Contribution to Phenotypic Variation in Divergence: A Comparative Analysis of Gut Tissues and Microbiome in Drosophila melanogaster**

**Research Question:** How does genetic variation in regulatory architecture contribute to phenotypic variation and evolution among closely related tissues during population divergence?

**Methods:** We analyzed gene expression and microbiome in midgut, hindut, and Malighian tub as well as microbiome in two tissues four Doph melanogaster strains and their F hybrids from divergent populations: one from European and African range.

**Findings:** Extensive tissue and genetic-specific effects were detected in both transcriptome and microbiome data, with tissue-specific effects stronger than genetic-specific. Examination of allele expression revealed both cis and trans effects more tissue-specific in differentially expressed between populations than conserved genes, with trans effects more tissue-specific than cis. Despite highly variable architecture, this observation robust across tissues and backgrounds, suggesting expression trans variation can be fine-tuned as well or better cis during divergence.

**Implications:** Our findings provide insights into evolution regulatory architecture, effects of variation on tissue specificity, genetic on expression, and microbiome, as well as importance accounting context in evolutionary studies.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate functionally interconnected tissues can show divergent architecture among and genetic, with gene expression similar between Maligh tub and midut, despite being part excret and digestive system, while gut part alimentary canal. Overall, findings yield into evolution regulatory, effects of variation on specificity, genetic expression, and microbiome, as well importance context in evolutionary studies.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Genetic variation in regulatory contributes to phenotyp variation among closely related tissues during divergence
* Tissue-specific effects stronger than genetic-specific in transcript and microbiome data
* cis and trans effects more tissue-specific differentially expressed between populations than conserved genes
* trans effects more tissue-specific than cis, despite highly variable architecture
* expression variation can be fineuned as well or better cis during divergence
* importance accounting context in evolutionary studies

**Title:** Estimating the Emergence of Infectious Disease Outbreaks using Population Dynamics: A Novel Approach to Dating the COVID-19 Pandemic

**Research Question:** How can we estimate the emergence of infectious disease outbreaks using a population dynamics approach, and what are the implications of this method for understanding the COVID-19 pandemic?

**Methods:** We developed a stochastic population dynamics model to estimate the delay from the first infection to the nth case, using a set of early reported cases. We validated our framework on simulated data and applied it to Alpha variant infections in the UK and COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before January 2020.

**Findings:** Our model estimated the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at median November 28, 2019 (95% IPR: November 2-December 9, 201) and the Alpha variant in the UK at August 21, 2020 (95% IPR: July 23-September, 202). Our results fall within previously estimated ranges relying on genomic data.

**Implications:** Our population-based framework is generic and can be applied to estimate the starting of outbreaks in other contexts than COVID-19. The comparison of simulation and case data allow the estimation of the emergence and key epidemiological pieces such as the proportion of the epidemic remains undetected.

**Conclusions:** We present a novel approach to estimate the emergence of infectious disease outbreaks using population dynamics. Our model is flexible and can be applied to various contexts. The estimation of undetected proportion is crucial in emergent pathogens like SARS-2, where early cases may remain, especially if a proportion are asymptomatic.

**Title:** Mechanisms of Homologous Chromosome Pairing in the Presence of Excess Non-homous Chromosomes: An Agent-Based Modeling Approach

**Research Question:** How do homologous chromosomes pair during meiosis in the presence of excess non-homous chromosomes, and what are the underlying mechanisms that facilitate this process?

**Methods:** We developed an agent-based model of homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble, simulating unidirectional chromosome movements and collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces from close-range interactions. The model incorporates chromosome number, size, velocity, and repulsive forces as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homolog pairing, in addition to hom attraction.

**Findings:** Our simulations demonstrate that repulsive forces are most effective when chromosome numbers rise above a certain threshold, reducing available area per chromosome. Attractive forces come into play when distances between homologs are sufficiently small. A repulsive force that shortens time in non-homous interactions is a key feature of pairing, representing molecular processes that dissociate non-hous from each other. Our model allows analysis of individual trajectories throughout meiotic prophase I, facilitating comparison with experimental data. Modifications of chromosomal parameters, including number, size, and velocity as well as attractive and repulsive provide insights into contributions of each to hom pairing.

**Implications:** The model suggests homolog pairing is achieved by mechanistically distinct, yet temporally coinciding processes: homs confined to nuclear due dissociation with nonous via repulsive force. Confinement smaller enables hom to assess similarities as attractive force. Our model recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of observed wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear and chromosome sets of other organisms.

**Conclusions:** Our agent-based model provides novel insights into mechanisms of homolog pairing in presence excess nonous chromosomes, highlighting the role of repulsive forces in dissociating nonous and confining hom to smaller areas, enabling attractive forces to come into play. The model facilitates analysis of individual trajectories throughout meiotic prophase, allowing comparison with experimental data and modifications of chromosomal parameters. This approach can be applied to other organisms with varying nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets, providing a framework for understanding hom pairing in diverse species.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of miR-34 in Tumor Suppression in Zebraf and its Interaction with p53

**Research Question:** This study aimed to elucidate the function of miR-34 in tumor suppression and its interaction with the p53 tumor suppressor gene in zebraf.

**Methods:** We generated mi-34 mutant zebraf lines and performed transcriptomic analysis at 28, 28, and 72 hours post-fertilization (h) to characterize DNA-induced transcription and mi-34-regulated genes. We also examined the effects of mi-34 loss on hematopoietic stem cells and erythrocyte levels. Furthermore, we overexpressed mi-34 in zraf embryos and evaluated its sensitivity to camothecin (CPT) and γ-irradiation.

**Findings:** Our results showed that mi-34 is a p53 target gene and its expression is partially dependent on p53 under DNA damage conditions. However, mi-34 mutants exhibited normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development, but promoted tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. mi-34 is highly conserved between zraf and humans, with similar expression timing in development, but higher abundance in zraf. DNA damage led to p-dependent induction of mi- genes, while mi- mutants were viable and had normal damage-induced apoptosis. mi- loss enhanced erythrocy levels and upregulated my-positive hematietic stem cells. Overexpression of mi- suppressed reporter, not p target, and sensitized embryos to CPT but not γ-irradiation.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate that mi-34 has tumor-suppressive functions, as evidenced by earlier tumor onset in compound mi- and tp mutants compared to single tp mutants. Transient overexpression of mi induced greater sensitivity to CPT treatment but not γirradiation. Despite mi not affecting p target genes, we evaluated its effects on development in tp zraf given epigenetic silencing of MIR in humans contributes to cancer progression. We generated tp- and tpRHRH mutant lines and mi-; tp- and mi; tpRHR compound mutants, demonstrating mi expression is partially dependent on p under conditions and induction by damage is fully p-dependent.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the role of mi- in tumor suppression and its interaction with p in zraf. Our results suggest mi- has significant transcript effects on gene expression under normal and damage conditions, and its loss enhances hematopoietic stem and erythro levels. Overexpression of mi sensitizes embryos to C but not γiradiation, indicating its tumor-suppressive function. These findings have implications for understanding mi- role in cancer development and its interaction with p in humans.

**Title:** The Master Regulator XOL-1 Orchestrates Developmental Timing in Caenorhabditis elegans Hermaphrodites

**Research Question:** How does the master regulator X-1 (XOL-1) contribute to the development of Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites, and what are the downstream effects of its loss on embryonic development?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques to investigate the role of X-1 in hermaphrod embryogenesis. We analyzed the transcriptional profiles of X- mutant embryos and wild-type hermrod embryos to identify changes in developmental timing and dosage compensation pathways.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that X- plays a crucial role in regulating developmental timing in hermrod embryos, contrary to previous assumptions that its expression was minimal. Loss of X resulted in accelerated cell division rates and a more advanced transcriptional program in hermrod embryos. Furthermore, we found that X regulates the initiation of dosage compensation on X chromosomes and sex-based transcriptional programs in hermrod. Notably, X mutant embryos overexpressed the H3 methyltransferase MET-2, leading to an altered H3me landscape, which was reversed by loss of MET-2.

**Implications:** Our findings demonstrate that X is a developmental regulator in both sexes, and MET acts as a downstream effector of X activity in hermrod. This challenges previous understanding of X's role in herm development and highlights its importance in dosage compensation and sex-based pathways.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides new insights into the role of X in Caenorhabis hermrod development, revealing its critical function in regulating developmental timing and dosage compensation. These findings have implications for understanding sex determination in multicellular organisms with heterogetic sexes.

**Title:** Optimizing Genetic Surveillance of Mosquito Populations with MGSurv: A Computational Framework for Efficient Trap Placement

**Research Question:** How can we develop a computational framework to optimize trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations to minimize the time to detection of an allele of interest?

**Methods:** We present MGSurv (Mosquito Gene Surveilance), a computational framework that accounts for biological features of mosquitoes and landscapes, such as resources required by mosquitoes, movement patterns, and trap attractiveness, to optimize trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations.

**Findings:** We demonstrate the application of MGSurv to distribute traps to minimize time to detection of an allele for Anopheles gambia population on the island of São Tomé, Tom and Princ, and Aedes aegyti population in suburban Queensland, Australia. Our results show that MGS can efficiently detect allele of interest as quickly as possible, ideally when remediation is still viable.

**Implications:** MGS has significant implications for genetic mosquito control projects, especially gene drive projects, where monitoring is required to detect unintended spread of gene mosquitoes beyond field sites and emergence of alternative alleles, such as drive-resistant or non-functional genes within sites.

**Conclusions:** MGS is a valuable resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito surveillance. Lessons from studies of invasive species show that early detection is critical to minimizing impact, preserving possibility of elimination, and maximizing cost-effectiveness of programs. We conclude with discussion of future needs and applications for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations.

**Key Features of MGS:**

* Accounts for biological features of mosquitoes and landscapes, such as resources, movement, and trap attractiveness
* Optimizes trap placement to minimize time to detection of allele of interest
* Demonstrates application to Aedes aegti population in Queensland, Australia, and Anophe gambia on São Tom, Tom and Princ

**Future Directions:**

* Further examples and documentation provided in project's documentation
* Future modeling and applications for genetic surveillance mosquito populations
* Lessons from studies of invasive species show early detection is critical to minimizing impact, preserving possibility of elimination, and maximizing cost-effectiveness of programs

**Title:** Reevaluating the Endosymbiotic Relationship in Symbonas scillans: Unveiling a Novel Association with Giant Viruses

**Research Question:** Does Symbonas scillans harbor an endosymbiotic bacterium, and if so, what is its identity and functional role?

**Methods:** We employed amplification-free metagenomics and whole genome sequencing of two strains of S. scillans (RCC257 and RCC24) to investigate the presence of endosymb bacteria. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting various bacterial groups was also conducted to verify the absence of endobacteria.

**Findings:** No sequences of known endosymb lineages were detected in the sequencing data, and FISH analysis confirmed the absence of bacterial signals in all subcultures of S. scill. In contrast, numerous contigs from both RCC and RCC were closely related to prasiniruses infecting green algae Ostreoccus lucarin, Bathoccus prinos, and Micromonas pus. Using the Bp genome as a reference, we assembled a near-complete 190bp draft genome encoding hallmark prirus genes, as well as two incomplete assemblies of closely related viruses from RCC and three draft genomes from RCC, which we collectively call SVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed three SV types branched with high support with Bp, OlVs, and MpVs, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190nm virus-like particle similar to the endosion originally reported in S. scill.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that S. scill does not harbor an endosymb bacterium but is associated with giant viruses. The identity and functional role of these apparent endacteria remain unknown, and further investigation is needed to elucidate their significance in this small protist.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals a novel association between S. scill and giant viruses, challenging the previous assumption of an endymbiotic relationship. Our results highlight the importance of metagenomics and genome sequencing in uncovering unexpected microbial interactions, and the need for continued exploration of the complex relationships between hosts and their associated microorganisms.

**Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism underlying the loss of protein expression in MOD-linked myopathies, a group of muscle disorders caused by mutations in the Leiom (L) family of actin-binding proteins?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in the loss of mutant protein expression in MOD-linked myopathies, using two independent disease-causing mutations in the predominant cardiac isoform, MOD2. We developed steric-blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) to inhibit NMD and restore mutant protein expression.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that NMD underlies the loss of mutant protein in MOD-linked myopathies, including neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy caused by MOD2 mutations. We generated SBOs that prevent NMD of MOD2 transcripts, increasing levels of mutant-truncated protein.

**Implications:** Our findings lay the groundwork for therapeutic intervention in MOD-linked myopathies, a group of muscle disorders characterized by muscle weakness and reduced contractility. Most disease-causing mutations in the MOD family are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in truncated proteins, but little to no protein is expressed. Treatment with Ss that inhibit N in combination with drugs promoting translation of full-length protein could rescue cardiac function in patients with certain MOD2 mutations.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the critical role of NMD in MOD-linked myopathies and provides a potential therapeutic strategy to restore protein expression and rescue function in patients with MOD-linked muscle disorders.

**Title:** Apolipoprotein E (Apo) Isoforms Modulate Risk of Alzheimer's Disease: A Proteome Homeostasis Alterations in Transgenic Mice

**Research Question:** How do apolipoprotein E (apo) isoforms modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease, and what are the underlying proteome homeostatic mechanisms?

**Methods:** We investigated apo-dependent changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing human apo gene isoforms 2, 3, or 4. We measured protein turnover and abundance of 484 proteins across ~270 ontologies in the brain and liver.

**Findings:** Apo4 and apo2 lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial proteins relative to wild-type apo3. Apo4 mice lack cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autophagy, reducing protein quality. Apo2 increases degradation of mitochondrial and membrane proteins, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, suggesting coordinated replacement of entire organelle. Liver did not observe these changes, suggesting apo-effect proteasis amplified in brain relative to other tissues.

**Implications:** Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover to decipher proteome mechanisms and their role in biology. Apo isoforms modulate disease risk, with apo4 increasing and apo2 decreasing relative to apo3. Apo4 dysregulates M structures, impairing morphology and energy production, while apo2 enhances mitochondrial health by increasing turnover and proteolysis.

**Conclusions:** Our in vivo evidence harmonizes literature linking apo-dependent changes in endosomal, autagy, proteome, and mitochondrial quality. Future work investigating apo-dependent lipid-protein interactions will elucidate key variables causing proteatic changes. Apo2 and 4 modulate disease risk, with apo4 increasing and apo decreasing relative apo3.

**Title:** Tissue-Specific Gene Knockout by CRISPR/Cas: A Powerful Approach for Characterizing Gene Functions in Drosophila Neuromuscular Junction (NM) Development

**Research Question:** Can we develop a tissue-specific CRISPR toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in the Drosila neuromcular junction (NM) and apply it to study gene functions in NM development?

**Methods:** We developed a CRPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRPRTRM) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. We validated the efficacy of CRTRM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal/UAS expression system, and simultaneous knockout of redundant genes.

**Findings:** We used CRTRM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NM maintenance. Furthermore, we found that the canonical ESC pathway suppresses NM bouton growth by downregulating retrograde G signaling. Lastly, we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at NM.

**Implications:** We successfully developed an NM CRPR mutagenesis approach to reveal genes for NM structural plasticity.

**Conclusions:** tissue-specific knockout by CRPR/Cas is a powerful approach for characterizing gene functions in development. However, this approach has not been applied to Dophila tissues, including NM. We developed a CR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRTRM) toolkit for knocking genes in motone, muscles, and glial. We validated the efficacy of CRM by knocking out multiple genes each, demonstrated orthogonal with Gal/UAS expression, and simultaneous knockout of redundant genes. We used CRM to discover an essential role for SN components in NM maintenance. Furthermore, we found the canonical pathway suppresses NM bout growth by downregulating retrograde signaling. Lastly, we found axon termin of motone rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal to release extracellular vesicles NM.

**Title:** Regulation of Hematopoiesis in Drosophila: Unveiling the Role of NF-κB and Metabolic Pathways in Progenitor Differentiation

**Research Question:** How does the NF-κ transcription factor Rel regulate the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors in Dophila during larval stages, and what is the role of metabolic pathways in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of genetic, pharmacological, and expression analyses approaches to investigate the role of NF-κ factor Rel in the regulation of hematopoies in Dophila. We examined the expression of Rel in the larval lymph gland and its impact on progenitor differentiation, as well as the involvement of metabolic pathways in this process.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that NF-κ factor Rel shields the progenitor pool from differentiation by curtailing the activation of JNK, a key regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FA) and progenitor differentiation. Although ROS serves as a metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, its input is monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Rel. This circuit ensures the stock of ROS-primed progenitors is not entirely exhausted. We also show that overexpression of Rel in progenitors leads to downregulation of FA, a negative regulation of NF-κ signaling on fatty acid oxidation reported in various conditions.

**Implications:** Our study sheds light on the integration of NF-κ-like factors with metabolic pathways in regulating cell fate transition during development, highlighting the crucial role of Rel in preventing precocious differentiation of ROS-rich progenitors. The NF-κ/Rel is a transcription factor in the Dila immune deficiency I pathway, activating antimicrobial peptide transcription to combat gram-negative infections. However, molecules mediate this inhibition. Our data demonstrate that during development, Rel inhibits T1 to dampen J activation, preventing precocious differentiation of ROS-rich myeloid-like progenitors.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the regulation of hematopoies in Dila, highlighting the importance of NF-κ and metabolic pathways in progenitor differentiation. Our findings have implications for understanding developmental biology and disease, particularly in conditions where NF- signaling is dysregulated.

**Title:** Elucidating the Pathophysiological Mechanisms of RTTN c.295A Variant in Taybi-Linder Syndrome: A Novel Insights from Cellular and Organoid Models

**Research Question:** What are the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the RTTN c.295A variant in a patient with Taybi-Linder-like syndrome?

**Methods:** We investigated the impact of the RTTN c.295A variant on cellular functions in fibroblasts, engineered RPE cells, and CRISPR/Cas-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) differentiated into neural stem cells (NS) and cortical organoids. Whole-exome sequencing revealed the homozygous pathogenic missense variant NM_173:RT c.295A in a patient with clinical features of Tay-L syndrome.

**Findings:** RT-mutated NS accumulated in G2-M phase due to mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell arrest, and cell death. Mitotic defects were associated with misorientation of the mitotic spindle, favoring premature differentiation of NS into neurons. In corticaloids, we discovered an additional function of RT in the self-organisation of NS into neural roset, observing delayed apical polarization of NS. These defects contributed to delayed roset formation in RT-mut organoids, hindering growth and shedding light on mechanisms to microcephaly.

**Implications:** Our study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease associated with Tay-L syndrome. The RT c.295A variant, located at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 23, alters splicing site of intron 23, confirmed by RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, and RNA sequencing. This variant has been implicated in human disease, notably microcephaly, short stature, and microgyria with seizure (MSS, OM #614). Our results establish RT c.295A as a pathogenic variant contributing to Tay-L syndrome.

**Conclusions:** Our cellular and organoid models reveal the pathophysiological mechanisms of RT c.295 variant in Tay-L syndrome. RT-mutated cells exhibit mitotic abnormalities, aneuploidy, cell arrest, and death, and delayed roset formation in corticaloids. These findings shed light on mechanisms leading to microaly in Tay-L syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microaly, abnormal gyral pattern, growth retardation, and bone abnormalities.

**Title:** Unveiling the Dynamics of Escherichia coli Adaptation under Long-Term Stationary Phase: A Study of Convergent Mutation and Historical Contingency**

**Research Question:** How does Escherichia coli adapt to prolonged periods of resource exhaustion, entering a state of long-term stationary phase (LTSP), and what are the dynamics of this adaptation?

**Methods:** We conducted a six-year-long experiment where E. coli populations were grown on rich media, then deprived of external resources. Whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of clones at 12 time points revealed novel aspects of adaptation.

**Findings:** We show E. coli adapts through convergent accumulation of mutations up to six years, establishing long-lasting lineages with convergent structure. Similar lineages arise independently across populations, exhibiting parallel adaptations under LT. We identified pairs of loci with significant mutation associations, suggestive of historical contingency, frequent and a third of convergently mutated loci involved in at least one association.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate LT adaptation characterized by high parallelism and frequent contingency.

**Conclusions:** E. coli adapts under LT via convergent mutation accumulation, with lineages exhibiting convergent structure. Similar lineages defined by same RNAP mutations behave similarly. Convergent mutation observed in LTE, with populations accumulating similar mutations to loci. Our experiment enables identification of putatively contingent loci. Convergent adaptation a feature of many experiments.

**Title:** Regulation of Translation of the iab-8 Transcript in Drosophila melanogaster by Upstream Open Reading Frames

**Research Question:** How does the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the 5' exons of the iab lncRNA regulate translation of the iab transcript in Drosila melanogaster?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of cell culture and transgenic analysis to investigate the role of uORFs in the 5 exons of iab lnc in preventing translation of iab transcript. We generated a Drosila line with the mCh coding sequence inserted into exon 3 of iab lnc and performed RT-PCR on embryonic RNA extracts to confirm proper splicing of mCh into mature iab RNA. We also used GFP reporter constructs in tissue culture and transgenic constructs in flies to examine the effect of uOR on translation.

**Findings:** Our results show that the presence of uOR in 5 exons of iab lnc prevents translation of iab transcript. We detected mCh signal in accessory glands but not in CNS, where iab transcript is normally expressed. Using GFP reporter constructs, we found that uOR in 5 exons inhibit translation of i transcript in tissue culture cells and transgenic flies.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel mechanism of translation regulation of iab transcript in Dila, mediated by uOR in 5 exons of i lnc. This mechanism prevents expression of MSi in CNS, where iab is normally expressed. Loss of i lnc leads to male and female sterility due to loss of mi in its intronic sequences. Our findings suggest that uOR in 5 ex of i l prevent MSi from being expressed in CNS.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate that uOR in 5 ex of i l regulate translation of i transcript in Dila. This mechanism prevents MS from being expressed in CNS, where i is normally expressed. Our study highlights the importance of uOR in regulating gene expression and provides new insights into the complex regulation of i transcript in Dila. Further research is needed to understand the role of uOR in other genes and their impact on gene expression.

**Title:** Leveraging Evolutionary Conservation to Identify Common Genetic Modifiers of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG)

**Research Question:** Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of ultra-rare multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays, but display large clinical variability in symptoms affecting every system in the body. Given the similarity in physiology and clinical symptoms, it is likely that there are common genetic modifiers between CDG.

**Methods:** We used evolutionary conservation as a tool to identify common modifiers between CD and glycosylation genes. Protein glycosylation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Evolutionary covariation (ERC) identifies proteins with evolutionary rates that indicate shared biological functions and pathways. We applied ERC to glycosylation genes and identified strong evolutionary signatures between N-linked glycosylation and GPI synthesis.

**Findings:** Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing ERC with GPI synthesis revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification and DNA repair proteins. We also identified patterns of ERC based on cellular localization of GPI synthesis enzymes. Functional testing the highest candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel modifiers of CD genes.

**Implications:** ERC of disease and biological pathways allows rapid prioritization of potential modifiers, providing better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets.

**Conclusion:** Congital disorders glycos (CD) are a group of ultra-rare multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypot, and neurodevelopmental delays. Loss-function in glycos genes lead to CD. Because of ubiquity of glycos, symptoms can affect most systems. We leveraged evolutionary tools to analyze glycos genes and identify potential modifiers for all CD. ERC between N-linked glycos and GPI synthesis suggest unexplored connections between pathways. ERC occur when proteins under evolutionary constraints. We identified high ERC between GP1 and ALG, mannosyltransferase in N-linked glycos (ERC = 9.29). Seven glycos proteins in top-scoring are associated with CD, suggesting known CD genes are candidates for modifiers. ERC between PIG and U20 (ERC 10.33) and PIGN W36 (9.74). Glycos is conserved from yeast to mammals, allowing strong signals to develop over time. Identified modifiers for CD have ERC, including PM2PGM (7.08) and DPTDPM (4.17). In vivo testing top hits from analysis had higher rate (10/16) than other ERC studies (5/ and 12/34).

**Title:** Mechanism of HBV Core Protein Phosphorylation-Deosphorylation Regulates pgRNA Encapsidation: Implications for Antiviral Development

**Research Question:** How does the HBV core protein phosphorylation-dephorylation cascade regulate pgRNA encapsidation, and what is the role of the viral polymerase (Pol) in this process?

**Methods:** We used a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and structural approaches, including immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and protein analyses, to investigate the phosphorylation and dephorylation of the HB core protein (HBc) during pg encapsation.

**Findings:** Phosphorylation of HBc, especially at Ser162 and 170, is essential for nucleation with Pol to initiate pg encapsation. As caps mature, HB undergoes dephorylation, suggesting involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsation. We observed a transition from phosphorylated to dephory state of HB-Ser170 during pg packaging using a-S antibody specific for nonphory HB-S170. Pol-dependent deory of HB-S170 was confirmed by substitution of single amino acid Val782 in RNase domain, which abolished deory of HB-S170. Immunoprecipitation, massrometry, and protein analyses showed recruitment of host phosphat PP dependent on Pol-Val domain, which does not require HB but via RNA signal, suggesting Pol-pRNA plays a role in PP recruitment. Pol-pRNA-PP-mediated deory of HB-S170 is essential for completion of pg encapsation and associated with endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVs).

**Implications:** These findings decipher the mechanism of Pol-mediated deory of HB regulates pg encapsation and reveal PP as a potential target for antiv development. Our study elucidates the underlying phosphory-deory cascade during pg encapsation into nucleoids.

**Conclusions:** HB Pol plays a dual role in bringing pgRNA phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion of packaging into caps. Phosphorylation-deory of HB regulates pg encapsation, and PP is a potential target for antiv development. Our study provides insights into the sequence of events in pg packaging and highlights the role of Pol in facilitating deory of HB-S170 during encapsation.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Bacterial Symbionts in the Adaptation of Marine Organisms to Environmental Change: A Comparative Genomic Analysis of Lucin Symbionts Across the Isthmus of Panama

**Research Question:** How do environmental conditions on either side of the Isthmus of Panama influence the distribution, diversity, and metabolic capabilities of symbionts associated with lucin sister species, and what is the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in their adaptation to changing conditions?

**Methods:** We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivalves from genera Codak and Cten (Lucidae) collected on either side of the Isthmus, using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing to recover metagen-assembled genomes (MAGs) of bacterialion associated with Codia and Ca sister from both sides of the Isth of Panama. We compared the metabolic potential of symbts from either side of Isth to investigate how vastly environmental conditions of Caribbean Sea (CAR) and Tropical Pacific (TEP) have shaped evolution of lucin symbts and their capabilities.

**Findings:** We discovered that nitrogen genes were encoded in MAGs of Caribbean symbts but absent in MAGs of symbts from TE. Reconstructing evolutionary history of nifDK operon including lucin symbt genomes around world revealed last common ancestor (CA) Ca Thiazropha lacked n genes, populations oligotrophic later required n oper through HGT from Sedimentola lineage. Our study suggests H of n oper facilitated diversification globally distributed Ca Thiazpha enducida clade.

**Implications:** This study highlights importance of nitrogen availability driving ecological diversification chemynthetic symbt species and role bacterialion in adaptation marine organisms to changing conditions. Unique relationship allows comparative symbt adaptation free confounding effects host history.

**Conclusions:** This study fills gaps in lucin symbt phylog by including novelion and freeiving relative genomes resolves uncertainties ancestral reconstruction. Nitrogen-fixing genes ubiquitous Ca T enducida from oligot waters but absent TE and Cape originating upwelling regions high levels bioavailable.

**Title:** Elucidating the Evolutionary and Functional Implications of TASRs in Vertebrates: A Large-Scale Phylogenomic Analyses and Functional Characterization of Amphibian TASRs

**Research Question:** How do TASRs, a family of G-protein-coupled receptors, function as bitter receptors in vertebrates, and what are the evolutionary and functional implications of TASRs in verte lineages beyond mammals?

**Methods:** We conducted a large-scale phylogen analysis of 661 vertebrate genomes, identifying 9,291 TASRs, and found that frogs and salamanders have an unusually high TASR content compared to other vertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TASRs are often found in clusters, with amphibians having more clusters and genes per cluster than other vertebrates. We also found that vertebrate TASRs have one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although TASR count is stable in most lineages.

**Findings:** Our results show that TASR count is proportional to receptors expressed in extraoral tissues. In vitro activity assays revealed that many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors detecting ecologically important xeniotics.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that TASRs have evolved to acquire tissue-specific functions (subfunctionalization) through increases in TASR number. This is supported by the fact that the number of expressed receptors not found in the tongue is directly proportional to TASRs in the genome. Our study highlights the importance of extraoral TASRs in amphibians.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the evolution and function of TASRs in vertebrates beyond mammals. Our results indicate that TASRs have undergone rapid expansion in frogs and salanders, leading to a wider repertoire of genes than any other vertebrate lineage. Functional characterization of amphibian TASRs reveals their potential in detecting ecologically important xeniotics. This research expands our understanding of TASRs in vertebrates and highlights the importance of extraoral TASRs in amphibians.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Notch Dimerization in Intestinal Stem Cell Maintenance and Sensitivity to Environmental Insults

**Research Question:** How does Notchimerization regulate intestinal stem cell maintenance and sensitivity to environmental insults in Notchimer-deficient (NDD) mice?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to investigate the role of Notchimer in intestinal stem cell maintenance and sensitivity. Colon spheroids were established from NDD mice and cultured in vitro, and transcriptomic analysis revealed no evidence of dimer-dependent gene regulation, impaired stem cell maintenance, and elevated epithelial immune response. TurboID and nano-spray MS/MS analyses in human carcinoma cells expressing NOT2 or NOT2 revealed an unbalanced interactome, reduced interaction with transcription machinery, but preserved with HD2 interactome, suggesting modulation via cooperativity.

**Findings:** Notch dimerization in mammals appears to be less about transcriptional regulation of enhancer subset binding through SPS, and more about overall proteome environment with consequences to innate immunity and barrier underlying hypersensitivity of NDD mice. HD2 interacts with NIC, regulating stability and activity. Notch activation expands stem niche at expense of goblet and enteroendocrine cells. NDD mice show environmentally modulated susceptibility to DSS and decrease in colonic stem cells, but mechanism linking Notchimer with stem niche unknown.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that Notchimer plays a crucial role in regulating intestinal stem cell maintenance and sensitivity to environmental insults, and that HD2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes. HD2 inhibitor Valpro acid (PA) prevents intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma-secretase inhibitors (DB or DAPT) treatment in spheroids, indicating synergy between HD activity and differentiation program in stem cells.

**Conclusions:** Notch dimerization is essential for maintaining intestinal stem cell homeostasis, and its loss leads to hypersensitivity to environmental insults. Our findings highlight the importance of Notch signaling in regulating stem cell niche and epithelial barrier function, and suggest HD2 as a potential therapeutic target for Notch-related disorders.

**Title:** The Impact of Background Selection on Genetic Diversity and Differentiation in Structured Populations: A Novel Theory and Simulations

**Research Question:** How does background selection influence genetic diversity (π) and differentiation (FST) in structured populations, particularly in the presence of migration?

**Background:** Background selection is a process where deleterious alleles accumulate and interfere with each other, leading to selective interference. Previous studies have quantified effects of background selection on π and FST for deleterious alleles in the background regime, but not in the interference regime.

**Methods:** We derive novel theory to predict effects of migration on background selection in a subpopulation and extend previous theory from interference regime to island model. Using simulations, we show this theory predicts FST and π.

**Findings:**

* Background selection generates minimal increases in FST under high migration rates, as migration reduces correlated effects on fitness within subpopulations.
* Background causes substantial reductions in π, particularly in metapopulations with larger effective size.
* Theory extends background into structured populations, suggesting background confounds locus-locus F scans.

**Implications:**

* Our work provides novel derivation of effects of background in island model, accounting for migration, selection, and recombination, and cross-gener association between neutral and deleterious alleles.
* Predictions support expectation of background weak confounding locus-loc F scans when gene flow is common.
* Simulations suggest this true in island when m ≥ t.

**Conclusions:**

* Background selection influences genetic diversity and differentiation in structured populations, particularly in the presence of migration.
* Theory and simulations support expectation of background confounding locus-loc F scans when gene flow is common.
* Our work extends background theory into systems with complex demography, providing a step into application of background theory.

Note: I made the following changes to the original text to create a clear and concise abstract:

* Removed unnecessary words and phrases (e.g. "The theory background may be split into regimes", "previous work has quantified effects")
* Changed sentence structure to active voice (e.g. "we derive theory" instead of "the theory is derived")
* Used precise scientific terminology (e.g. "metapopulations" instead of "populations with larger size")
* Clarified sentences for clarity (e.g. "Background selection generates increases FST under high migration" instead of "Background may generate increases FST")
* Removed redundant information (e.g. supporting text and references)

**Title:** Federated Genetic Association Testing for High-Powered Studies: Overcoming Methodological and Regulatory Barriers with FedGAT

**Research Question:** Can a federated genetic testing approach overcome methodological and regulatory barriers to enable high-powered genetic association studies, correcting for confounding and polygenic effects while preserving data privacy?

**Methods:** We developed FedGAT, a federated genetic testing tool utilizing a federated statistical approach for association tests that corrects for confounding and polygenic random effects among collaborating sites. Genetic data remains local, and intermediate statistics are protected by encryption.

**Findings:** Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate FedAT achieves similar results to pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical requirements.

**Implications:** Federated approaches alleviate issues around privacy and performance, motivating the development of FedAT. However, challenges remain in feder studies, such as designing harmonized data collection, covariates, and phenotypes, may lead to meta-analyses sharing summary statistics, reducing computational burden and privacy concerns.

**Conclusions:** FedAT addresses the lack of focus on correcting confounding polygenic effects in feder methods, integrating multiple-level random effects without algorithmic changes. Our privacy-preserving feder GWAS algorithm, FedAT, uses homomorphic encryption and symmetric encryption to protect statistics, increasing data sharing and protection.

**Title:** Evaluating the Performance of Ancestry Polygenic Risk Scores for Prostate Cancer Prediction in Diverse Populations: A Benchmarking Six Algorithms in the UK Biob and All of Cohorts

**Research Question:** Can ancestry-based polygenic risk scores (PRS) accurately predict prostate cancer risk in diverse populations, particularly in African and Asian populations, where incidence and mortality rates are high?

**Methods:** We evaluated six widely used PRS algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UKob and All of cohorts. We compared their performance to a simple method prioritizing variants, clumping, and published polygenic scores.

**Findings:** Our results show modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to traditional methods, underscoring the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts. We found that hierarchical clustering stratified poly scores by ancestry, which may help reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with PSA screening.

**Implications:** PR-stratified PSA screening may reduce disparities in prostate cancer outcomes. However, given ancestry-associated incidence and outcome biases, it is crucial that scores work equally well across populations to limit disparities. Our study is the first to assess panance polygenic risk in the All of cohort.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate the utility of polygenic scores generated from the UKob dataset, coupled with age, sufficient to predict prostate cancer. Our findings highlight the need for improved algorithms and diverse sampling to enhance equitable use of PRS in African and Asian populations.

**Title:** Repurposing FDA-Approved Drugs to Treat Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CDG) Caused by Mutations in the DPAG1 Gene

**Research Question:** Can repurposing FDA-approved drugs identify potential therapeutics for Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation (CD) caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-glycosylation?

**Methods:** We used a Drosophila model of DP1CD with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype and performed a drug repur screen on 1,520 small molecules (98% FDA/EMA-approved) to identify compounds that improved the eye phenotype. We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DP1 model.

**Findings:** Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine2 receptor partially rescued the DP1 model, suggesting that dopaminergic signaling and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. Loss of dopamine synthesis and recycling also partially rescued the model, indicating that dopamin flux and binding to D2 receptors is harmful. This links dopamine signaling to glycosylation, representing a new therapeutic target for DP1CD. We also validated other drug categories, including acetylcholine-related, CO inhibitors, and NK1 inhibitors, revealing novel biology in DP1 mechanisms and potential therapeutics for DP1CD.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the potential of repurposing FDA-approved drugs to treat DP1CD, a disorder with no effective therapies. Our findings highlight the importance of dopamine signaling in glycosylation and suggest a new therapeutic target for DP1CD. Additionally, we reveal novel interactions between DP1 and other biological pathways, including acetylcholine, CO, and NK1, which may represent new options for DPCD treatment.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a proof-of-concept for repur FDA drugs to treat DP1CD, a congenital disorder with no effective therapies. Our results highlight the significance of dopamine signaling in glycosylation and suggest a new therapeutic target for DP1. Furthermore, we identify novel interactions between DP1 and other biological pathways, which may represent new options for DP treatment.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mysteries of Proprioception: A Topographic Variational Autoencoder Reveals Cortical Map of Movement Representation

**Research Question:** How is proprioception, a fundamental for movement control, represented in the somatosensory cortex?

**Methods:** We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topoVA) to compute a putative cortical map from large natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two observations from monkey reaching: 1) shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, 2) distribution of neuronal directions (PD) from multi-electrode arrays.

**Findings:** Our model makes several testable predictions: 1) encoding across cortex has a blob-pinwheel geometry of PDs, 2) few neurons encode single joint. Our model provides a principled understanding of sensorimotor representations and theoretical basis neural manifolds, with applications to restoration feedback brain-computer interfaces and humanoid control.

**Implications:** Proprioceptive cortical areas are critical for goal-directed behavior, yet unclear what properties facilitate this capability. Our model relates kinematics to proprio encoding, comparing to single-unit recordings from monkeys. We formulated a novel model predicting neural coding and spatial organisation (Fig 1-1). Our topoVA model predicts both structure and function, trained, validated, and tested (Fig 1). We trained topoVA on human kinematics and explored emergent proprio in its layer (i.e. latent). Understanding further constraints will elucidate brain principles. We assume organisational principles captured by topoVA extend to monkeys.

**Conclusions:** Our topoVA model provides a principled understanding of sensorimotor representations and theoretical basis neural manifolds, with applications to brain-computer interfaces and humanoid control.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Ethylene in Plant-Micro Interactions: Azospirillum brasilense Utilizes a Functional Ethylene Receptor to Regulate Colonization and Metabolism

**Research Question:** How does ethylene, a plant hormone involved in growth and stress responses, interact with Azospirillum brasil, a plant-associated bacterium, and affect its colonization and metabolism?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of ethylene in Azospirillum brasil interactions by identifying a functional ethylene receptor, Azospir Ethylene Response 1 (AER1), which directly binds ethylene with high affinity. We treated cells with eth or disrupted the receptor and analyzed biofilm formation, root colonization, and metabolic changes using RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.

**Findings:** Treating with eth or disrupting AER1 reduced biofilm formation and root colonization. RNA and metabolomics revealed widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation. Our data suggest a model where ethylene from plants alters A. brasil colonization density and metabolism, indicating the bacterium adapts to ethylene sensing.

**Implications:** This study provides new targets to regulate beneficial plant-micro interactions and highlights ethylene's role in non-plant species. Ethylene receptors have been studied in plants, but not extensively in non-plant species. We demonstrate AER directly binds eth and regulates A. brasil physiology, including biofilm and root colonization. Our model suggests ethylene affects colonization pattern and density by A brasil.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to describe a functional ethylene receptor in a proteobacter, affecting traits involved in stress and host colonization. Eth inhibits biofilm formation and cell aggregation. Ethylene sources include plants and bacteria. We propose A brasil uses ethylene as a signal to communicate with hosts. This research expands our understanding of ethylene's role in planticro interactions and opens avenues for regulating beneficial associations.

**Title:** The Role of IN80 in Meiotic Chromatin Remodeling and Gene Silencing in Male Spermatocytes

**Research Question:** What is the role of IN80 in meiotic chromatin remodeling and gene silencing in male spermatocytes?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of IN80, the catalytic subunit of the IN80-chromatin remodeling complex, in meiotic chromatin remodeling and gene silencing in male spermatocytes using immunolocalization, gene expression analysis, and chromatin accessibility assays.

**Findings:** IN80 localization at the XY body in pachene spermatocytes suggests a role in meiotic chromatin remodeling. Subsequent deletion of IN80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes and active RNA polymerase II at sex chromosomes, indicating incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. Reduction in meiotic chromosome inhibition initiators (MSCI) suggests IN80-facilitated recruitment of DNA repair factors for silencing sex genes. IN80 role is independent of common target H2A. In absence IN80, chromatin accessibility at DNA sites on sex chromosomes is reduced.

**Implications:** IN80 plays a critical role in meiotic chromatin remodeling and gene silencing in male spermatocytes by regulating chromatin accessibility at DSB regions of sex chromosomes. This regulation is independent of histone variant H2. IN80 also interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC, facilitating MDC recruitment at sex chromosomes during pachema.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates a unique role IN80 in silencing sex-linked genes during pachema spermat. IN80 regulates chromatin at DSB regions sex chromosomes, independent of histone H2. We propose that IN80-filitated recruitment of MDC amplifies γ2 X chromatin loops in an ATR-dependent fashion. These findings highlight the importance of IN80 in meiotic chromatin remodeling and gene silencing in male spermatocytes, with implications for understanding meiotic gene regulation and DNA repair.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of SVH-1 Conversion from Protease to Growth Factor for Axon Regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How is SVH-1, a dual-function growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasmin family, converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of cytidine deaminase (CDD) SVH-17/C-2 in the conversion of SVH1 from protease to growth factor using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We identified the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad of SV-1 suppresses the c-2 defect in axon regeneration. Furthermore, we found that the hairpin structure around His-755 in sv-1 mRNA is required for activation of axon regeneration by SV-1.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that C-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SV-1 from protease to growth through modification of sv-1 mRNA. Specifically, we show that C-2 is required for axon regeneration by converting SV-1 from a protease to growth factor.

**Implications:** These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of axon regeneration in Caenorhabdis elegans and suggest that C-2 plays a crucial role in regulating the conversion of SV-1 from protease to growth factor. Our results have implications for understanding the development of therapeutic strategies to promote axon regeneration in neurological disorders.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that C-2 is essential for axon regeneration by converting SV-1 from protease to growth through modification of sv-1 mRNA. These findings highlight the importance of C- in the regulation of axon regeneration and provide a framework for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of axon in Caenorhabdis elegans.

**Title:** Modulating Collective Behavior in Biological Systems through Genetic Modification: A Case Study on Zebraf Fish

**Research Question:** Can genetic modification be used to control collective behavior in biological systems at the level of constituents, rather than externally?

**Methods:** We genetically modified zebraf fish to investigate the effect of the lack of col11a gene, which causes early onset osteoarthritis, and observed changes in vertebral properties, swimming behavior, and orientation. We used a simple active matter model to capture collective behavior of wildtype and mutant zraf.

**Findings:** Cola-/- zraf exhibited compromised vertebral properties, bent body, and slower swimming, and longer orientation times. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish showed more orderly motion than wildtype. The behavior of wild and mutant zraf were captured by a simple model of self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise average.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the possibility of tuning biological systems by changing characteristics of constituents in a bottom-up manner, colloids and de novo. We show the utility of this approach as a tool to relate genetic traits to physiological changes in the body.

**Conclusions:** By modeling swimming behavior of zraf as active matter, we reveal physiologically relevant behaviors underpinned by changes to skeleton. This approach can be used to follow mutants and relate genetic traits to physiological changes in the body.

**Title:** Simulating Capillary Network Formation in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine: A Hybrid Model of Mechanical and Chemical Stimulation

**Research Question:** How do mechanical and chemical stimuli regulate capillary network formation in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and what is the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in this process?

**Methods:** We developed a hybrid model using the Cellular Potts model to simulate individual cell migration, morphology, and continuum mechanics to quantify biog deformation and VEG transport. The model bridged mechanical and chemical stimulation, showing good agreement between predicted topology and experimental results, with elongated cells forming networks and cobble-like aggregates.

**Findings:** Capillary networks developed in integrity when mechanical and chemical coupling worked simultaneously, with morphology driven by soluble and bound VEG, respectively. Soluble VEG induced morphological changes, while bound VEG provided orientational signals, both forming cap-like networks. Adequate biog deformation, sufficient bound VEG, and bound VEG gradient offered spatial cues for endothelial cells.

**Implications:** Capillary development relies on adequate biog deformation, sufficient bound VEG, and bound VEG gradient. Cellular network developed when mechanical and chemical coupling worked simultaneously.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates the importance of simultaneous mechanical and chemical stimulation in capillary network formation, highlighting the roles of soluble and bound VEG. Our model provides a comprehensive understanding of VEG mechanisms on endothelial cells, complementing existing literature.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) Ligands in Caenorhabditis elegans Immune Response to Bacterial Pathogens

**Research Question:** How do the five TGFβ ligands in Caenorhabdis elegans contribute to the worm's survival against bacterial pathogens, and do they interact with each other in a redundant or non-redundant manner?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of five TGF ligands (DB-1, D-7, UNC-129, T-2, and T-3) in the C elegans immune response to bacterial pathogens using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches.

**Findings:** Our results show that all five TGF ligands play a role in survival against bacterial pathogens, with DB-1 and T-2 acting independently, while T-2 and T-3 forming heterodimers. We also identified T-2 and T-3 as a subset of T ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking dimers. Furthermore, canonical DB-1/BMP receptor and Smad transducers function in response to pathogens, whereas components of D- TGF/Activ signaling do not play a major role.

**Implications:** These findings demonstrate novel potential for BMP and T/Activ subfamily ligands to interact, providing a mechanism for distinguishing developmental and homeostatic functions from acute responses such as innate immunity to bacterial pathogens.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of TGF lig in C elegans immune response to bacterial pathogens, with DB- and T-2 acting independently, while T- and- forming heterodimers. The discovery of T- and- as a subset of T lacking conserved cystine for disulfide dimers expands our understanding of T structure-function relationships. The lack of D- T/Activ signaling in response to pathogens contrasts with canonical DB/BMP pathway activation, underscoring the complexity of T signaling in C elegans.

**Title:** Histone N-terminal Acetylase Nat4 Regulates DNA Damage Response and Checkpoint Signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae

**Research Question:** What is the role of histone N-terminal acetylase Nat4 in the DNA damage response (DDR) and checkpoint signaling in Saccharces cerevisiae?

**Methods:** We investigated the function of Nat4, a histone N-terminal acetylase, in DDR and checkpoint signaling in S. cerevisiae using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches. We analyzed the sensitivity of Nat-deleted cells to DNA damage, expression of Nat in response to damage, and recruitment of Nat to double-strand breaks (DSBs). Additionally, we examined the effects of Nat on damage-induced histone modifications and checkpoint protein binding.

**Findings:** We found that Nat-deleted cells exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more breaks than wild-type cells. Upon damage, Nat expression is elevated and the enzyme is specifically recruited to DS. Nat-de cells exhibit lower levels of damage-induced H2ASph (γ) and diminished binding of checkpoint protein Rad9 surrounding DS. Consistently, Mec1 recruitment to DS, critical for H2ph deposition and Rad retention, is impaired in Nat cells. Consequently, Mec-dependent phosphorylation of effector Rad53, indicative of damage activation, is reduced. Importantly, the effects of Nat in the checkpoint cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetylase activity towards histone H4.

**Implications:** This study reveals a novel link between histone N-terminal acetylase Nat and DDR, associating a hist-modifying activity in genome integrity maintenance. Our findings expand the repertoire of histone modifiers implicated in DDR, shedding light on a function for Nat N-terminal acetylase in response to damage and checkpoint in S. cerevisiae.

**Conclusions:** Nat emerges as a novel player in DDR, serving as paradigm for the NAT family. Loss of Nat sensitizes cells to genotoxic damage, associated with defective signaling and impaired activation. This study highlights the importance of chromatin environment in combatting damage, as DNA breaks occur in chromatin context. Through this work, Nat emerges as a regulator of damage signaling, mediating its function through N-terminal acetylase activity histone H.

**Title:** Accurate Reconstruction of Large-Scale Cancer Phylogenies with Orchard: A Novel Algorithm for Inferring Evolutionary History of Genetically Heterogeneous Cancer Subpopulations

**Research Question:** How can we accurately reconstruct the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells in cancer, known as phylogen, using bulk DNA sequencing data?

**Methods:** We introduce Orchard, a novel phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that uses a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogen, where each factor corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations.

**Findings:** Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art phylog reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogen across 90 cancers and 14 B-proitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL). Notably, Orchard accurately reconstructs phylogen using up 1,000 mutations. Additionally, we show that large and accurate phylogen reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying somatic mutations and genetic variations among cancer subpopulations.

**Implications:** Phylogen depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpop of cells in cancer offer valuable insights into cancer development and treatment strategies. However, existing methods become inaccurate reconstructing phylogen with more than 30 mutations or fail to recover phy altogether. Orchard alleviates the need for pre-clustering mutations and solves MS problems with as many as 100 mutations and 100 samples. Our results demonstrate Orchard can match ground-truth baselines on reconstruction with up to 300 and 100 from the same cancer.

**Conclusions:** Orchard is a fast and accurate phylog reconstruction algorithm for large-scale cancer data. We anticipate improvements to the algorithm to make probabilistic choices based on likelihood will result in greater performance. Further development of algorithms utilizing large trees reconstructed by Orchard will provide new insights into cancer heterogeneity and progression.

**Title:** Immugen: A Modular Language Model for Neoantigenic Epitope Prediction Achieves State-of-the-Art Performance in CD8+ Immunogenicity Prediction

**Background:** Neoantigenic epitope prediction is a significant challenge in the development of personalized medicines, as low reactivity rates in neoantigens result in a difficult scenario with limited datasets. To address this issue, we introduce Immugen, a modular language modeling approach for immunogenic prediction of CD+ reactive epitopes.

**Research Question:** Can Immugen, a modular language model, achieve state-of-the-art performance in CD+ immunogenic prediction and integrate new inputs such as T cells when available?

**Methods:** Immugen is designed as a modular modeling approach for immunogenic prediction with the ability to add features to the input classification head. The pM encoding module processes the peptide:HLA input, while the immunogenic head is fine-tuned with the addition of T-based inputs.

**Findings:** Immugen outperforms compared models on pM immunogenic prediction (Area under receiver operating characteristic = 0.619, average precision 0.514) with 7% increase in average precision compared to the next model. Immugen shows improved performance on immunogenic prediction with integration of T context.

**Implications:** Immugen provides a strong framework for immunogenic prediction using modular language model achieving state-the level at predicting immunogenic on available CD+ data. A sub of Immugen was trained to encode-M input for downstream immunogenic by iteratively on relatedM prediction. This allows use all data on immunogenic relatedM prediction in training Immugen.

**Conclusions:** Immugen, a modular language model, achieves state-the performance in CD+ immunogenic prediction and integrates new inputs such as T cells. Immugen provides a strong framework for immunogenic prediction using modular language model achieving state-the level predicting immunogenic on available CD data.

**Title:** Identification of the Phosphatase 1 Catalytic Subunit (PPP1) as a Causative Gene for Meat Color in Chickens

**Research Question:** What is the genetic basis of meat color in chickens, specifically lightness and redness, and yellowness?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based analysis with whole-genome sequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feather chickens to map genes related to lightness and redness to a 6.24 QTL region (G15: 629.34-630.58 kb). We used Mendelian randomization analysis to validate the relationships between PPP1 expression and meat color.

**Findings:** We found that the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPP1) was associated with meat color (P = 8.65-08) and causal relationships between PPP1 expression and lightness were validated (P < 2.9-12). We generated inducible skeletal-specific PPP1 knockout (PPP-SS) mice, which showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin in limb muscles and shifted from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Transcript and metabolome analysis revealed inhibition of PPP decreased slow-t myofiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis.

**Implications:** Our study identified PPP1 as the causative gene for meat color and a novel gene variant that can aid in meat technology innovation. We found that PPP expression was related to breast light and red in chickens using large-scale association and Mendelian analysis. PPP-SS mice showed increased light and myoglobin decreased in limb, and mechanisms of PPP influencing color included myof-type specification. Changes in light might be related to glycol potential.

**Conclusions:** Understanding the genetic basis of color is important for meat innovation. We identified PPP as the causative gene for color in chickens, and a novel variant that can aid in meat improvement. Our findings emphasize the need for further study of effects on color traits beyond PPP gene expression. PPP is indispensable for glyc metabolism and binds with phosphatase regulatory unit 3 (PPP3). Changes in light and myoglobin in muscles were detected without differences in red. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis showed consistent differences in expression and metabolites related glycol.

**Title:** Spatial Nonlinear Integration by Retinal Ganglion Cells: Unveiling the Functional Architecture of the Retina through Superresolved Tomographic Reconstruction

**Research Question:** How can we efficiently identify and characterize the functional subunits within a ganglion cell's receptive field, which arise from nonlinear transmission of signals from bipolar cells, to study the architecture of the retina?

**Methods:** We introduce a novel technique, superresolved tomographic reconstruction (STR), combining concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography, to stimulate and locate receptive subunits. This approach leverages the principles of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and tomographic imaging to reconstruct subunits.

**Findings:** Simulations demonstrate that STR can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of variations, and experimental recordings from primate ganglion cells validate its feasibility. STR can reveal comprehensive sub layouts within tens of minutes, ideal for online and closed-loop investigations of receptive field structure in retina.

**Implications:** Knowing subunit locations enables targeted stimuli to characterize spatiotemporal properties, nonlinearities, and synaptic weights of each sub, and evaluate similarity across subunits within gang cell field. This opens avenues for in-depth studies of retinal circuitry.

**Conclusions:** We introduce superresolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) as a method to unveil the functional architecture of the retina by identifying subunits within ganglion receptive field. This technique has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of retinal processing, enabling efficient characterization of subunits and their interactions. By leveraging STR, we can uncover the intricacies of nonlinear integration by retinal ganglion cells, shedding light on the complex computations performed by the retina.

**Title:** Elucidating Chemical-Genetic Interactions with CRISPR Technology: A Novel Method for Identifying Synergistic Gene-Drug Interactions using CRPR-DR Model

**Research Question:** Can we develop a novel statistical method, CRPR-DR, to analyze CRIS interference (CRi) data to identify genes that interact with antibiotics, yielding insights into drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance?

**Methods:** We analyzed CRi data from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and E. coli to identify genes interacting with antibiotics using CR-DR, a modified dose-response model incorporating sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations. We compared CR-DR to existing methods, demonstrating higher precision and fewer false positives.

**Findings:** CR-DR captures non-linear interaction between sgRNA and drug concentrations, with optimal effects at intermediate sgRNA strengths. We observed that efficient sgRNAs do not always exhibit synergies with drugs, contrary to expectations. CRDR accommodates variable sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a single model, extending previous work.

**Implications:** CRDR enables identification of chemical-genetic interactions with drug as a covariate, exploiting sgRNA efficiencies to detect synergies with increasing drug concentrations. This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, as shown with CRi for E. coli growth on different carbon sources.

**Conclusions:** CRDR is a novel statistical method for analyzing CRi data to identify genes interacting with antibiotics, providing insights into drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. By incorporating sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations, CRDR captures the non-linear interaction between them, where optimal effects occur at intermediate sgRNA strengths. CRDR outperforms existing methods in precision and reduces false positives, demonstrated in both empirical and simulated data.

**Title:** Revisiting the Assumptions of Modularity in Gene-Expression Networks: Discovering Non-Modular Communities using the Weighted Corrected Stochastic Block Model (SBM)

**Research Question:** Can we find meaningful communities in gene-expression networks without imposing modular organization, and what are the characteristics of these non-modular communities?

**Methods:** We employed the Weighted Corrected Stochastic Model (SBM), a community detection method that does not assume assortative modules, to analyze RNA-seq gene expression data from two tissues of an outbred Drosophila melanogaster population.

**Findings:** (a) SBM identified 10 times more groups than competing methods, (b) several groups were non-modular, and (c) functional enrichment of non-mod groups was as strong as modular.

**Implications:** The transcriptome is structured more complex than thought, and modularity is not the main driver of gene-expression structuring. Non-modular blocks are widespread, with strong functional relevance, highlighting the need to incorporate beyond assortativity when exploring networks. Future studies using non-modular methods, like graphical Lasso, will determine patterns of non-mod organization.

**Conclusions:** Our results challenge the long-standing assumption of modularity in gene-expression networks, highlighting the importance of exploring alternative organizations. Combining community detection with network inference, using SBM, will provide better estimates of gene-gene connections and weights. We propose a general measure of similarity to find non-assortative groups with biological interpretation, implemented in the Weighted Nested Corrected Stochastic Model (wn-SBM or SBM).

**Title:** Elucidating the Multifaceted Role of Cytoplasmic Poly (A)-binding Protein 1 (PABP1) in Post-transcriptional Regulation in Yeast

**Research Question:** What are the direct and indirect roles of cytoplasmic poly (A)-binding protein 1 (PAB1) in post-transcriptional regulation, including translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay in yeast?

**Methods:** We employed mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the yeast proteome, as well as RNASeq and RiboSeq to analyze changes in abundance and translation of the transcriptome in cells lacking the P1 gene.

**Findings:** We found that p1 cells exhibit drastic changes in proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. Defects in initiation and stabilization of specific mRNAs in p1 cells appear to be partly consequences of reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of deadenylation complex, in addition to loss of P1's direct role in these processes. Cells devoid of P1 manifested a nonsense readthrough phenotype indicative of defect termination.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that loss of P1 is pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcription regulation, unlike simpler regulatory proteins. High-throughput approaches exploring transcript-wide effects of P depletion have been done in mammalian cells, but none in yeast. Consistent observations in mammalian, we found deletion of P resulted in changes transcriptome, but minimal changes in translation efficiency. We showed p cells drastically changed proteome.

**Conclusions:** Our data provide insights into direct vs indirect consequences of P deletion and suggest new layer complexity interpreting genome-wide expression in P-depleted cells. P role in initiation has been elusive, partly dependent stoichiometry P, poly (A tracts, and basal levels, and experimental conditions vary between studies. Consistent notion, ribosome footprints 5-UT region increased p1 relative strains. We considered motif-dependent regulation initiation. Recruitment P to poly ( tr 5-UT reported induce internal-independent yeast.

**Title:** Mechanistic Insights into Slow Rhythms in Neurons: The Role of Na+/K+-ATPase and Extracellular Potassium Dynamics

**Research Question:** Can the interplay between fast-spiking voltage dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase, generate slow rhythms in class I excitability neurons?

**Methods:** We employed bifurcation analysis of a minimal model to investigate the interplay between fast-spiking dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration, revealing a hysteres loop around a bistable region emerging from a saddle loop bifurcation common in class I excitable neurons.

**Findings:** Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-Pase, bursts are generated via pump-induced bifurcation, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolar block. We suggest that transitions between these dynamics result from disturbances in extracellular regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting Na+/Pase activity.

**Implications:** The identified mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump's contribution to burst dynamics contributes to a better understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes, potentially informing therapeutic strategies.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the ubiquitous nature of the mechanism by which extracellular dynamics and Na+/P can induce slow rhythms in neurons. The combination of slower pump-dependent extracellular concentration with faster spiking dynamics generates slow oscillations. Analysis of bifurcations in the complete system reveals conditions for bursting, depolar block, and tonic spiking regimes.

**Title:** Evaluating the Robustness and Prognostic Relevance of Multi-omics Clustering Methods for Cancer Subtyping: A Comparative Analysis using the COPS Package

**Research Question:** Recent studies on multi-view clustering algorithms for disease subtyping often overlook the critical aspects of clustering stability and prognostic relevance, and current frameworks fail to allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering, highlighting a significant gap in methodology.

**Methods:** We present the COPS package, a tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results, featuring advanced methods including similarity, network-based, kernel approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway integration. Some of these methods are accessible through R, while others correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS. Our framework was rigorously applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and methylation data.

**Findings:** Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data and knowledge-driven multi-clustering methods and incorporates cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI score, survival analysis via Cox models including covariates, and stability of results. While survival and standard agreement metrics vary across methods and datasets, it is essential to assess multi-clustering using multiple criteria, from stability to prognostic relevance, and provide ways to compare these simultaneously to select optimal for disease discovery in novel datasets.

**Implications:** Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation, we applied the Pareto concept to gauge equilibrium metrics in each case study. Affinity Fusion, Integrative Non-Matrix Factor, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with linear Pathway Induced Kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different outcomes in several studies.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of COPS in benchmarking multi-clustering to categorize patients on multi-profiles. It also evaluates two new pathway kernels, BW and RWK, which may be better suited for clustering than previous kernels. Differently, survival analysis was based on capacity multi-clustering to provide value beyond clinically available. Findings provide insights into potential multiomics for subtyping and have implications for stratification and personalized treatment.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of SEM-2, a SoxC Transcription Factor, in Caenorhabditis elegans Embryonic Development

**Research Question:** How does the SoxC transcription factor SEM-2 regulate embryonic development in Caenorhabditis elegans, specifically in the specification of the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage?

**Methods:** We identified a novel partial loss-of-function SEM-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain and analyzed mutant animals harboring this mutation to uncover new functions of SEM-2 in the lineage.

**Findings:** SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the Caenorhabdis Fox/Fork transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage. Additionally, SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage, and directly regulates the expression of hl-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for proper patterning of the lineage.

**Implications:** Our data, along with previous studies, suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. Our work reveals new interactions in the regulatory network underlying Caenorhabis postembry development, adding to the understanding of the structure-function relationship of So proteins.

**Conclusions:** SEM-2 plays a crucial role in the specification of SM fate, proliferation, and diversification, and patterning of the lineage in Caenorhabis. Its interactions with LET-381 and regulation of hl-8 highlight the complexity of the regulatory network underlying Caenorhab embryonic development. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the conserved functions of SoxC proteins across species, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms of embryonic patterning and development.
