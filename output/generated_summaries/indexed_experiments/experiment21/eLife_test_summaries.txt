**Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of Electrical Synapses: Multiple Gap Junctions and Adherens Junctions Contribute to Neuronal Communication

**Research Question:** How do electrical synapses, a form of neuronal communication mediated by gap junctions, function in the absence of additional cellular structures?

**Methods:** We investigated single synaptic contacts on zebraf Mner cells, where gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release, using expansion microscopy to map the incidence and distribution of synaptic structures.

**Findings:** Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by molecular components, with most of the synaptic surface occupied by interleaving gap junction and adherens junction components, suggesting a close association between the two structures. Glutamate receptors were confined to small portions of the contact, indicating most of the area functions as an electrical synapse.

**Implications:** Our results reveal the organization of an electrical syn that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions in association with structural and signaling molecules of adherens junction. The relationship between intercellular structures aid in establishing boundaries of electrical syn found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into structural and functional diversity of synapses.

**Conclusions:** Electrical synapses, a modality of neuronal communication by gap junctions (GJs), have been less studied than chemical synapses with distinct pre- and post-synaptic components. Our findings suggest that electrical syn operate with multiple gap junctions in association with adherens junction components, expanding our understanding of syn organization and diversity.

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Pre-Bötzinger Complex Neurons in Inspiratory Rhythm Coordination: A Novel Insights from Optogenetic Transgenic Approaches

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the identity and function of Preötz complex (Preöt) neurons projecting to the facial nucleus (7) motoneurons, which coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity, and their role in inspiratory rhythm generation.

**Methods:** A combination of optogenetic and viral transgenic approaches was employed to selectively photoinhibit Preöt neurons projecting to nucleus 7, demonstrating minimal effects on breathing. Anesthetized and conscious states, as well as type of anesthetic employed, influenced the results. The population of Preöt neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons sending collaterals to brainstem nuclei regulating autonomic activity.

**Findings:** Modulation of subgroups of Preöt neurons, based on axonal projections, is a useful strategy to understand mechanisms integrating breathing with motor and physiological behaviors. Abnormal respiratory autonomic modulation and orof behaviors are associated with disease development and progression.

**Implications:** Our results raise the question whether Preöt7 neurons are part of Pre respiratory network or distinct group. Our hypothesis is that facial projecting Preöt neurons transmit rhythm, not generate it. Photoinhibiting these neurons on inspiratory activity is due collaterals. Selective photoin of Preöt projecting to nucleus 7 modulates oracial with minimal impact on respiratory activity.

**Conclusions:** Utilizing combinatorial viralgenic approach with Cre-recombin expression and retroaxonal Cre delivery, selective transduction and photoin of Pre facial premotor neurons affected activity minimally breathing. Selective Pre7 photoin had clear difference compared non-selective Preoin, particularly under ketamine/medomidine and recovery. With selective approach, smaller population transduced with restricted anatomical location. Photoin Preöt produces apnea, reduces sympathetic activity, respiratory modulation BP, increases parasympathetic activity HR, and respiratory-sinus arrhythm. Neurons Preöt modulate oracial behaviors.

**Title:** The Role of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) Neurons in the Parabrachial Nucleus (PBN) in Modulating Active Defensive Behaviors in Response to Threat

**Research Question:** Do calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (P) serve as a general alarm system that modulates both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat?

**Methods:** We employed a predator-like programmed robot to chase mice to investigate the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behaviors. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP during robot chasing elevated responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent. In contrast, animals with inactivated CG neurons exhibited reduced responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that CGRP neurons in the PBN dynamically regulate active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. Optogenetic activation of CGRP during robot chasing increased flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, suggesting that CGRP amplifies the perceived threat, promoting active behaviors. In contrast, inactivated CG neurons exhibited reduced responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning.

**Implications:** These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical system capable of regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. Our results suggest that CGRP activation amplifies perceived threat, promoting active behaviors. Optogenetic inhibition of CG in animals while being chased by the robot during conditioning showed less freezing and fleeing compared to the control group.

**Conclusions:** CGRP neurons, known for relaying information to the forebrain and inducing freezing (Han et al., 2015), were examined to explore their role in active responses. Using a naturalistic paradigm with robot and aversive stimuli of varying levels, we recorded activity and found that CGRP encode threat intensities through variations in duration and amplitude. These results confirmed stimulating CGRP without aversive generates rapid, unconditioned freezing in mice. We tested manipulating activity of CG during fear with robot promotes fleeing or amplifies behavior. Optogen activation of CG in absence external stimuli induced robust freezing, and during conventional conditioning further conditioned, demonstrating primary in driving passive responses. However, under heightened conditions, such as enhanced CG activation or robot speeds, neurons strengthened active behaviors amplifying threat.

**Title:** Investigating the Relationship between Obesity and Human Brain Structure: A Diffusion-weighted MRI Study of 30,000 UK Biob Participants

**Research Question:** This study aimed to explore the relationship between obesity and brain structure by examining the association between waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and regional microstructural metrics, including isotropic volume fraction (ISO) and intra-cellular fraction (IC) in a large cohort of 30,000 UKob participants.

**Methods:** Diffusion-weighted MRI was used to investigate the relationship between WHR and microstructural metrics in two distinct brain systems: prefrontal/temporal/striatal (ISO) and medial/occipital/statal (IC). Gene expression, cellular composition, and neurotransmitter density were analyzed to refine characterization of obesity-associated systems.

**Findings:** Significant associations were observed between WHR and ISO in the prefrontal/temporal/statal system and IC in the medial/occital/statal system. The ISO-WHR system co-located with expression of genes for innate functions, glial density, and mu-opioid receptors, while the IC-WHR system co-located with genes for G-protein receptors and decreased density of mu and other receptors. Genetic correlations between WHR and ISO (r=0.026, P=0.36) and IC (r=0.112, P9×10-4) were estimated, as well as correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP for ISO and IC (P<0.05).

**Implications:** These findings suggest a two-way mechanistic model where genetically determined neurite density in the medial system may contribute to obesity, while water content in the prefrontal system reflects a consequence of obesity mediated by innate system activation.

**Conclusions:** Obesity is associated with coupled but anatomically distinct changes in brain measures of water and neurite density. Anatomically and functionally distinct brain systems were identified using gene expression, composition, and neurotransmitter density to refine characterization of obesity-associated systems. This study provides insights into the complex relationship between obesity and brain structure, highlighting the need for further investigation into underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

**Title:** Identification of Epithelial-Mesymal Transition (EMT) Cancer Stem Cells in Human Tumors and Their Predictive Value for Metastasis

**Background:** Cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergo epithelial-mesymal transition (EMT) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental models, however, tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the surrounding tumour tissue in human specimens, leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain.

**Research Question:** Can the combination of EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin markers identify disseminating EMT cells in human tumours and predict metastasis?

**Methods:** We examined 12,000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours using immunofluorescence staining for EpCAM, CD24, and Viment, and trained an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict metastasis.

**Findings:** We observed a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD, and Viment co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. The ANN predicted metastasis with high accuracy (cross-validated accuracy 87-89%). Single disseminating EMT cells were identified in human cancer specimens and were highly predictive of metastatic disease.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the presence of disseminating EMT cells in human cancer and their predictive value for metastasis. The combination of EpCAM, CD, and Viment markers identifies EMT cells that have disseminated into the stromal region surrounding primary tumours. The presence of these cells is strongly correlated with metastasis.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for the relevance of EMT in human cancer and its predictive value for metastasis. The ability to identify disseminating EMT cells at the single cell level across thousands of fields from human tumours enabled us to train an ANN to predict metastasis. The combination of EpCAM, CD, and Viment markers is a useful for identifying EMT cells that have disseminated into the stromal region.

**Title:** Evolutionarily Conserved Apoptosis and Efferocytosis Pathways Drive Tissue Repair: Unraveling the Mechanisms of Apoptotic Cell Recognition and Clearance in Wound Healing

**Research Question:** How do apoptotic cell recognition and clearance mechanisms regulate tissue repair during wound healing, and what are the key players involved in this process?

**Methods:** We employed single-cell RNA sequencing to map the cellular dynamics of early inflammation in mouse wounds and human diabetic foot ulcers. We analyzed the expression of apoptotic and efferytosis pathways in fibroblasts, immune cells, including Ly6+ macrophages, and dendritic cells.

**Findings:** Apoptotic pathways and efferyt receptors were upregulated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including Ly6+ macrophages during inflammation. Human diabetic wounds upregulated mRNAs for efferyt pathway and altered eyt signaling via receptor Axl and its ligand Gas. Early in mouse wounds, we detected upregulation of Axl in dendritic and fibrobl via TLR-independent mechanisms. Inhibition in vivo studies revealed Axl is required for wound repair but dispensable for eytosis. In contrast, inhibition of another eyt receptor, Tim4, decreased eyt and abrogated wound repair.

**Implications:** These findings highlight distinct mechanisms of apoptotic cell detection and clearance in tissue repair, providing potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides an atlas of dynamic changes in early wound repair at the single-cell level. We found apopt and eyt pathways upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse and human diabetic wounds. Functional studies show e receptors Axl and Tim4 have differential effects on eyt and wound repair. mRNAs encoding eyt receptors and pathways were upregulated in skin beds and diabetic wounds, confirming protein upregulation of Axl and Tim4 in mouse wounds. Efficient eocyt clears apopt cells during inflammation, given upregulation mRN associated with apoptosis and low apopt cells in wound beds.

**Title:** Targeted Genetically Encoded Multiplexing (Ta-EM): A Novel Genetic Barcoding Approach for Single-Cell Transcriptomics and Behavioral Studies in Drosophila

**Research Question:** How can we link anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identify cell types corresponding to gene clusters in single-cell sequencing sets?

**Methods:** We developed a straightforward genetic barcoding approach, Target Genetically Encoded Multiping (Ta-EM), utilizing Drosophila's powerful genetic tools for in vivo tagging defined cell populations. Ta-EM involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-inducible UASFP construct, enabling barcode reading during single-cell sequencing of a population of interest.

**Findings:** Ta-EM enables identification of cell types in cell atlases, multiplet droplets, and barcoding experimental conditions/replicates. We demonstrate Ta- barcodes can be read using next-generation sequencing for population-scale measurements.

**Implications:** Ta- has potential for large-scale behavioral screens and multiplexing single-cell transcriptomic experiments.

**Conclusions:** TaEM provides a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms, enabling novel capabilities in various experimental contexts. However, Ta- barcodes are not observed in all single-cell expression data, likely due to Gal driver strength. Nevertheless, variable recovery of Ta- barcodes driven by panid Gal driver demonstrates TaEM's robustness.

**Title:** Unveiling the Origins of Chemical Defense in Poison Frogs: A Novel Insights into the Evolution of Alkaloid Acquisition and Accumulation

**Research Question:** How do poison frogs of the family Dendidae acquire and accumulate alkaloids for defense, and what is the role of diet in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the alkaloid content in undefended and defended species of the Dendidae, and their diet composition, to test the assumption that diet is the primary determinant of alkaloid acquisition.

**Findings:** Contrary to previous studies, we found measurable amounts of alkaloids in undefended species, and confirmed that they consume toxic arthropods, sources of alkaloids. Our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. We propose the existence of a phenotypic intermediate, passive accumulation, which differs from sequestration in lacking transport and storage mechanisms, yet resulting in low toxin levels.

**Implications:** Our study supports the concept of passive accumulation as an ancestral state in Dendidae and possibly related taxa, and selection on toxin resistance leading to accumulation and defense. We incorporate pharmacokinetic ideas into an evolutionary model explaining acquired defenses in poison frogs and other animals.

**Conclusions:** Passive accumulation is a pervasive in ecological studies and may be more common in toxin-sequest lineages than known. Our study presents a novel alkaloid dataset for Dend and relatives, but is limited. Assuming ants and mites contain alkaloids, most Dend and ancestors have been exposed to toxins through diet. Quantifying toxin-exposure-resistance in frogs is scarce, given alkal diversity in frogs and sources. Most studies since 1990s emphasize diet as primary defense determinant, although Daly et al (1998) proposed alkaloid system in D ancestor overexpressed in apmatic species.

**Title:** Targeting Ribosome Biogenesis as a Promising Strategy to Overcome Epithelial-to-Mesymal Transition (EMT)-Mediated Chemoresistance in Advanced Breast Cancer

**Background:** Epithelial-to-mesymal transition (EMT) is a complex process that significantly contributes to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EM signaling pathways and its reversal process, mesymal-to-epithelial (MET), has hindered the development of effective treatments.

**Research Question:** What is the role of ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) in EMT and MET processes, and can targeting RIBi pathway overcome EMT-mediated chemoresistance in breast cancer?

**Methods:** We employed a Tri-PMT EMT lineage-tracing model and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively analyze EMT status of tumor cells.

**Findings:** Our study revealed elevated RIBi during transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. RIB and subsequent nascent protein synthesis by ER and mTOR signaling are essential for E/M completion. Importantly, inhibiting RIB genetically or pharmacologically impaired E/M capability of tumor cells. Combining RIB inhibition with chemotherapy synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesymal cells under chemotherapies.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that targeting RIB pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.

**Conclusion:** Targeting EMT for therapy has been challenging due to the complexity of E process and controversies promoting MET, which favors progression. Using E-lineageacing model, we found upregulation of R pathway at transitioning of E and MET. Activation of R during E process has been previously reported. Together, results suggest upregulated R pathway needed for mesym cells to undergo MET during outgrowth in lungs. Ribosome biogenesis recognized crucial in cancer pathogenesis. To investigate signaling responsible R upregulation in E/M process, we sorted cells and probed activations. Importantly, involvement unwed R activities both E and processes makes R new target overcoming E-related chemoresistance and metastasis. Targeting R by RNase inhibitor impaired E transitioning of cells and synergized with chemotherapies.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Elevated ribosome biogenesis (Ri) is transiently upregulated during EMT and MET processes
* R and subsequent nascent protein synthesis by ER and mTOR signaling are essential for E/M completion
* Inhibiting R genetically or pharmacologically impairs E/M capability of tumor cells
Combining R inhibition with chemotherapy synergistically reduces metastatic outgrowth of epith and mesym cells under chemotherapies

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of Seedling Root Traits in Plant Establishment under Challenging Environments: Insights from Pearl Millet, a Drought-Tolerant Cereal Crop

**Research Question:** How does the seedling root system of pearl millet, a drought-tolerant cereal crop, adapt to challenging environments in the Sahel region, and what are the underlying genetic mechanisms controlling this adaptation?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of crop modeling, phenotyping, and genomics approaches to investigate the impact of drought on pearl millet establishment in Sahelian environments. We phenotyped a diversity panel of pearl millet inbred lines representative of the crop's genetic diversity to test the hypothesis that fast primary root growth after germination is an adaptation to drought stress. We also conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) and bulk segregant analysis (BSA) on a biparental population to identify genomic regions controlling primary root growth.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that drought is a major constraint in Sahelian agystems, affecting crops during the vegetative stage, with 57% of years experiencing stress. We show that fast primary root growth is correlated with increased water tolerance in field conditions, with a strong and significant relationship between root growth and stay-green at the vegetative stage (R = 0.95, p < 0.01). Field experiments support the hypothesis that rapid primary root growth is beneficial for millet to cope with early stress after germination. Differences in root growth are mainly regulated by cell elongation.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the conserved function of glutaredin (GR) genes in regulating root elongation and enhancing resilience in pearl millet to Sahelian environments. We identified a glutaredin-encoding gene, PgXC9, as a candidate regulator of root growth, and its closest Arabidopsis homolog, AtXY19, revealed a novel role in cell elongation. These findings suggest that GR genes play a crucial role in plant adaptation to challenging environments.

**Conclusions:** This study provides insights into the seedling root traits of pearl millet, a drought-toler cereal, and its adaptation to Sahelian environments. Our results demonstrate the importance of fast primary root growth in coping with early stress and highlight the conserved function of GR genes in root elongation and resilience. These findings have implications for breeding drought-tolerant crops and understanding plant adaptation to challenging environments.

**Title:** Dynamic Contextual Modulation of Conceptual Representations in the Brain: A Multimodal Processing of Concrete and Abstract Concepts

**Research Question:** How do concrete and abstract concepts encode information in the brain during real-world processing, and to what extent do brain responses change depending on visual context?

**Methods:** In this study, we investigated the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses change dynamically depending on visual context. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain activity while participants watched movies with concrete and abstract concepts in different contexts.

**Findings:** Our results show that across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts encode experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, response of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when processed in scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when visual context is unrelated to given word, activation resembles that of abstract processing.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that while concepts encode habitual experiences, neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on contextual information. Our results highlight the role of visual in modulating neural representation of abstract and concrete words, similar effects may be observed in contexts that engage other sensory modalities.

**Conclusion:** The brain adept at integrating information across modalities to form conceptual, process that is critical for navigating multimodal nature of real experiences (Barsal et al., 2018; Smith, 2007). Our findings suggest that conceptual representations change dynamically depending on present in context. When concepts are situated in related contexts (e.g. word 'love' while watching people kissing), engage regions involved in processing concrete and visual information. Conversely, when concepts displaced from context (e.g. word'apple' while house interior), engage abstract regions related processing internal/interceptive/affective information.

**Title:** Identification of a Novel SMG1 Inhibitor, KVS1, that Elevates Expression of Truncated Proteins and Enhances Immune Antigen Presentation in Cancer Cells**

**Research Question:** Despite the recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, the limited availability of targetable antigens on tumor cells hinders its broad application. We investigated the role of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in concealing neoantigens through the destruction of RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations.

**Methods:** We conducted a high-throughput screen based on ratiometric analysis of transcripts to identify mediators of N in human cells, implicating disruption of SM1 phosphorylation of UP1 as a potential disruptor of N. This led to the design of a novel SM1 inhibitor, KVS1, that elevates expression of transcripts and proteins from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells.

**Findings:** KVS1 concomitantly increased the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I peptides from N-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. Inhibition of SM1 at concentrations as low as 600nM led to equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts, suggesting total blockade of the N pathway. Western blotting showed K1 decreases the amount of phosphorylated UP1, the target of SM1 activity in different cell lines.

**Implications:** K1 provides opportunities for studying N and diseases where N plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases. Previous studies with non-specific or toxic N inhibitors have shown increase in antigens from tumor mutations when N is inhibited. We investigated whether K1 could alter surface presentation of proteins from genes harboring truncations in CI358 and LS cells. Treatment of CI and LS cell lines with a reported SM1 small molecule, SM11, resulted in increases in transcripts and proteins from truncations, as did LY341. Although SM displayed SM specificity and inhibition, it was insoluble. Our screen offered an unbiased assessment of targets for N disruption, concluding SM an ideal to inhibit.

**Conclusions:** We developed a cell-based assay to query effects of a library on N function, identifying a compound capable of inhibiting N and its target as SM1, a critical of N. This led to the design of K1, a soluble and easily administered SM1 inhibitor. K1 elevates expression of truncated proteins and enhances immune antigen presentation in cancer cells, providing new opportunities for studying N and diseases where N plays a role.

**Title:** Accelerated Aging and Cancer Risk: A Novel Insights from Phenotypic Age (Pheno) and Phenotypic Acceleration (PhenoAcc) in the UK Biob Cohort

**Research Question:** Is accelerated aging, as measured by Phenotypic Age (Pheno) and Phenotyp Acceleration (PhenoAcc), a significant risk factor for cancer incidence, and does it vary across individuals?

**Methods:** We analyzed data from 374,463 participants in the UKob cohort, using Cox regression models to examine the association between Pheno and PhenoAcc with cancer incidence. We generated Pheno using chronological age and biomarkers, and PhenoAcc by subtracting the effect of chronological age from residual and incidence-weighted cancer polygenic risk score (CPRS) based on 20 site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS).

**Findings:** Compared to biologically younger participants, older individuals had significantly higher overall cancer risk, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAcc was observed on overall risk, with HRs of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) with high genetic risk and oldereno compared to low risk youngereno. PhenoAcc was negatively associated with healthy lifestyle factors (β=-0.01 in men, p<0.001; β=-0.98 in women, p<0.001).

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that accelerated aging, measured by Pheno, is associated with increased risk of site-specific and overall cancer after adjusting for chronological age. Within genetic groups, oldereno was related to increased risk, and adherence to a healthy lifestyle could retard the aging process. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China and Excellent Foundation of Jiangsu Province.

**Conclusions:** This study shows that accelerated aging, measured by Pheno, is consistently related to increased risk of site-specific and overall cancer after adjusting for chronological age, and across genetic groups. Stratification by risk with youngereno as reference, oldereno was associated with higher risk across groups. Participants at high risk had 5-year cancer rates of 5.78% and 4.58 for biologically men and women versus 6.9 and 5.17 for older. Our results provide a cost-effective indicator for biological age and novel biomarker for cancer prediction.

**Title:** Enhancing Biodiversity Conservation through Community-Sourced Data: Evaluating the Quality and Impact of Biome on Species Distribution Models in Japan

**Research Question:** Can community-sourced data from the Biome app improve the accuracy of species distribution models (SDMs) in Japan, and what are the implications for biodiversity conservation?

**Methods:** We investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on SD performance for 132 terrestrial plants and animals in Japan. We assessed the accuracy of species identification (95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but <90 for plants, mollusks, and fishes) and evaluated the effect of incorporating Bi data into traditional survey data on SDMs.

**Findings:** Incorporating Bi data into traditional survey data improved SD accuracy, reducing the number of records required for accurate models (Boyce ≥ 0.9) from >200 to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Bi data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple sources better estimates species distributions, aiding protected area designation and ecosystem assessment.

**Implications:** Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced data contributes to conserving and monitoring ecosystems. SDMs may be substantially improved by utilising rapidly accumulating Bi's occurrence records if sampling efforts are adequately controlled (Steen et al., 2020). Our study shows the quality of community data gathered through Biome and its impact on SD accuracy.

**Conclusions:** Community-sourced data through the Bi app improves SD accuracy, especially when combined with traditional surveys. The most accurate predictions were obtained with 50-70% Bi data, highlighting the necessity of incorporating both for comprehensive understanding species distributions (Miller et al., 2019; Pacifici et al.,201; Robinson et al.,202). Our results have implications for biodiversity conservation, protected area designation, and ecosystem assessment.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Mesenchymal BMP Signaling in Lung Development and Congenital Pulmonary Cysts

**Research Question:** What is the role of mesenchymal bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1 (BMPRA)-mediated signaling in lung development, and how does it contribute to the formation of congenital pulmonary cysts?

**Methods:** We used genetic mouse models to dissect the function of mesymal BMPRA in prenatal lung development and discovered that ablation of mesym BMPRA disrupted lung branching morphogenesis, leading to prenatal cystic lesions.

**Findings:** Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial fibers were found in cystic airways of mesym BMPRA knockout lungs. Ectopic mesym expression of BMP ligands and air epithelial perturbation of Sox-Sox prox-dist axis were detected in mesym BMPRA lungs. Deletion of Smad/5, two BMP downstream effectors, from lungyme did not phenoc the cyst abnormalities in mesym BMPRA lungs, suggesting a Sm-independent mechanism.

**Implications:** Our study reveals the first time the role of mesym BMP in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital cysts.

**Conclusions:** Mesym BMP signaling is indispensable for lung development, particularly airway morphogenesis. Mesym deletion of BMPRA at early stage causes abnormal morph and cyst at gestation in mice. Congenital cysts are reported in human CP patients as result abnormal lung development. Aberrant epithelial growth may contribute air cyst formation, as multiple models suggest loss Sox or expansion Sox in air epithelia associated altered differentiation and cyst pathology.

**Title:** Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) Regulates Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGF) Activity in Living Cells

**Research Question:** The role of phosphatidyositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P) in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) activity in living cells is not fully understood due to the difficulty in visualizing lipid domains around EG in the plasma membrane.

**Methods:** We used super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to visualize both EG and PI(4,5)P nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells and examined the dynamics and functional roles of PI(4,5)P as a boundary and neighboring lipid of EG in the activation of EG by EGF.

**Findings:** EG and PI(4,5)P nanodomains aggregated before EGF stimulation through transient visits of EG to PI(4,5)P nanodomains. The degree of co-aggregation decreased after EGF stimulation depended on phospholipaseγ, EG effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)P. Artificial reduction in PI(4,5)P content of plasma membrane reduced dimerization and autophosphorylation of EG after EGF. Inhibition PI(4,5)P hydrolysis after E stimulation decreased phosphorylation EG-Th654. Thus, EG kinase activity and density PI(4,5) around EG molecules were mutually regulated.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that autogenous remodeling of lipid environments regulates EG activity. Preferential coagregation of EG nanodom with PI(4,5)P rather than PS is due to curvature of membrane. PI(4,5)P nanodom of inactive HRAS were enriched whereas those of active KR4B were with PS due specific R-lipid interactions by membrane.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI(4,5)P in regulation of EG activity in living cells. Our findings suggest that PI(4,5)P plays a crucial role in stabilizing EG dimers and increasing autophosphorylation upon EGF stimulation. Hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P by PLC plays a role in deactivation EG. These results highlight the importance of lipid remodeling environments in regulating EG activity.

**Title:** Identification of a Mitochondrial Glycolytic Carrier in Blastocystis: A Novel Target for Stramenile Pathogens

**Research Question:** How does Blastocyst, a stramenile pathogen, transport glycol intermediates between the cytos and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis, and what are the implications for carbon and energy metabolism?

**Methods:** We identified a mitochondrial carrier in Blastyst that transports glycol intermediates, such as dihydroacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the inner membrane, linking cytos and mitochondrial branches of glycol. Comparative analyses with phylogenetically related human oxoglutar carrier SLC25A11 and dicarboxyl carrier S25 show the glycol carrier lost ability to transport canonical substrates malate and oxutar.

**Findings:** Blastocyst lacks key components of oxidative phosphorylation for ATP generation, such as complex III, IV, ATPase, and AD/ATP carriers. The presence of glycol phase in mitochondrial generates ATP, powering energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, and NAD used by complex I to generate proton force for protein and molecule import.

**Implications:** Given its unique specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, the carrier for glycol intermediates identified here represents a drug target against stramenile pathogens of great economic importance.

**Conclusion:** We report the discovery and characterization of a mitochondrial protein unique to strameniles, transporting glycol intermediates dihydroacet phosphate, glyceral-3-phosphate, and P, providing a previously missing link between cytos and mitochondrial glycol. Mitochondrial glycol is found exclusively in striles, so we searched for a transporter ubiquitous in these species but not in eukotes. Unlike striles, Blastyst lost cytos phase glycol, consistent with absence of gene encoding pyruate carrier.

**Title:** A Novel Framework for Genetic Association Studies: Haplotype Function Score (HFS) Enhances Causal Discovery and Polygenic Prediction of Complex Traits

**Research Question:** Can a new framework, haplotype-based approach, Haplotype Score (HFS), improve the identification of causal genetic associations and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to traditional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based methods?

**Methods:** We developed the HFS framework, which calculates a genomic activity score for each haplotype, replacing genotype in association studies. We applied HFS to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank dataset, identifying 361 independent FS-trait associations (p < 5 × 10−8). Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, a median increase of 63 compared to SNP-based analysis. H-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with strong biological interpretability.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate HFS offers improvement in biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods, highlighting its value in genetic studies. HFS detected 11-334 more causal signals (median 63) per trait compared to functionally aware fine-mapping methods, Poly (Weissbro et al., 2020) and SbayRC (Zheng et al., 202). We integrated HFS with SNP-based polygenic scores using least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO) regression, showing 16.1-39% improvement in cross-ance polygenic prediction.

**Implications:** HFS represents a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits, offering robust biological and polygenic insights. Compared to SNP, H has several advantages, including improved causal loci identification, biological interpretation, and polygenic prediction. However, further algorithmic and computational advancements are needed.

**Conclusions:** Our study introduces HFS as a novel framework for genetic analysis, demonstrating its superiority over classic SNP-based methods in causal and polygenic prediction. We suggest HFS as a valuable tool for future genetic studies, with potential to enhance our understanding of complex traits.

**Title:** Modulating the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis through Mindfulness-Based Training: A Longitudinal Effects on Hippocampal Structure and Function in Healthy Adults

**Research Question:** Can different types of mindfulness training modules targeting attention-based, socio-affective, or socio-cognitive skills impact hippocampal organization and reduce stress in healthy adults?

**Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal study with 332 healthy adults, evaluating the effects of three 3-month training modules on hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic connectivity using structural and resting-state fMRI analysis. We related these changes to diurnal and chronic cortisol levels.

**Findings:** We observed significant increases in bilateral cornu ammonis (CA-3) volume following the 3-month compassion-based module targeting socio-affective skills, compared to socio-cognitive skills or waitlist control. Structural changes paralleled relative increases in functional connectivity of CA-3 when socioffective compared socio-cognitive. Training-induced changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Notably, a multivariate approach revealed other subfields contributing to changes in cortisol levels.

**Implications:** Our study provides a link between socio-emotional intervention, hippocal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults. Specifically, we found that 3-month compassion training cultivating care, rather than attention-based or socio-cognitive training, related an increase in hippocal CA-3 subfield volume with alterations in connectivity and reduction in diurnal cortisol output.

**Conclusions:** Our findings highlight the importance of socioffective training in modulating the HPA axis, impacting brain structure, function, and behavior. Future studies may test the specificity of the relationship between stress and the hippocampus using targeted measurements. The increases in CA-3 volumes following socioffective training were small, but consistent when assessing left and right hippocampal subfields.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Large Effect Alleles and Inversions in Local Adaptation in Sunflowers: A Genome-Wide Association Study

**Research Question:** To what extent do large effect alleles and inversions contribute to local adaptation in sunflowers, and whether loci within inversions can drive adaptation in the absence of recombination suppression?

**Methods:** We conducted a genome-wide association study on three sunflower species (Helianthus annu, Helthus argyll, and Helthus petolar) with large species-specific inversions to explore patterns of local adaptation.

**Findings:** We found significant genome-wide repeatability signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, particularly within regions harboring inversions in one species. This suggests inversions facilitate local adaptation, but some loci can still contribute substantially without recombination suppression in species lacking inversions.

**Implications:** Our results indicate that adaptation in sunflowers involves repeatability at few genes, often associated inversions, coupled with redundancy across many loci. We estimated the number of regions contributing to adaptation for each variable phenotype, related to genic redundancy.

**Conclusions:** Local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve strong repeatability at few genes, associated inversions, coupled with redundancy across many loci. Our findings support the local adaptation model for long-term persistence of segregating inversions in sunflowers, rather than dominance or meiotic mechanisms.

**Title:** Investigating the Effects of Aging on Mammary Epithelial Lineages: A Key to Understanding Breast Cancer Susceptibility

**Research Question:** How do age-dependent changes in mammary epithelial lineages contribute to the increased susceptibility to breast cancer, particularly luminal breast subtypes?

**Methods:** We analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger (<30 years old) and older (>55 years) women to investigate age-dependent changes in gene expression and transcriptional variance.

**Findings:** We observed age-dependent directional changes in gene expression and increased transcriptional variance that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were exclusively detected in luminal epithelia, involving regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SAT1. Epithelial expression of gap junction protein G6 increased with age, and modulation of G6 expression in heterochron co-cultures revealed it provided a conduit for myepith cells to drive change luminal cells. Age luminal transcriptomes comprised a signal detectable in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that luminal epithelia are the site of integration of variant responses to aging in surrounding tissue, and their emergent phenotype endows cells with ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin, representing a biosensor of cancer susceptibility.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates how directional and variant responses contribute to aging biology in breast tissue of older women, showing increased variances in transcript profiles of mammary lineages across individuals a significant outcome of aging and central to understanding increased susceptibility to breast cancers with age. We propose that age-dependent and transcriptional responses in epithelia explain changes leading to increased cancer initiation.

**Title:** Leveraging Non-Target Reads from Whole-Genome Sequencing for Phenotyping Plant-Pest Interactions: Insights into the Genomic Basis of Variation in Plant Resistance

**Research Question:** Can non-target reads from whole-genome sequencing serve as phenotyping proxies for understanding the genomic basis of variation in plant resistance to pests, reducing the need for labor-intensive phenotyping experiments?

**Methods:** We analyzed whole-genome and epigen sequencing data from 207 natural lines of field pennycress (Thlas arse) grown in a common environment colonized by aphids, mildew, and microbes. We corrected for sequencing depth biases by deduplicating reads and used residuals as unbiased estimates of aphid, mildew, and microbe loads.

**Findings:** Numbers of non-target reads assigned to pest species differed between populations, showed significant SNP-based heritability, and association with climate origin and glucosinolate contents. Lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid load, i.e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide analyses identified genetic variants in defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were associated with pathogen loads, particularly transposons and hypomethylation in a gene involved in stomatal closure.

**Implications:** Our study provides first insights into defense mechanisms of Thpi, a crop model species, and demonstrates non-target whole-gen sequencing can estimate intensities of plant interactions. With increasing sequencing datasets, this approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research.

**Conclusions:** This study contributes to mechanistic understanding of pest resistance in Thpi, reflecting heritable variation in plant resistance. Non-target reads from whole-gen sequencing can serve as phenotyping for plant-pest interactions, reducing need for labor-intensive experiments.

**Title:** Overcoming Malaria Drug Resistance through Collateral Sensitivity: A Novel Strategy to Suppress Emergence of Resistance in Plasmodium falciparum

**Research Question:** Can the combination of two drugs based on collateral sensitivity profiles prevent the emergence of resistance in Plasium falciparum, a major obstacle to malaria control and eradication efforts?

**Methods:** We profiled cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several Plasiumodihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHH inhibitors, focusing on compound TDC-125, which was active against all tested lines, including DH C276, a mutant that arose with clinical candidate DSM265. Selected with TDC-125, the most common mechanism of resistance was copy variation of the dhod locus, while one mutation, DHH263, conferred resistance to TDC-125 but not DSM. Selection of DH276 with TDC-125 yielded additional genetic changes in dhod. Double mutants exhibited decreased sensitivity to TDC-125 and were highly resistant DSM.

**Findings:** Combining two DHH inhibitors, DSM and TDC-125, based on collateral profiles failed to prevent emergence of resistant parasites in vitro. Although previously identified mutations exhibited sensitivity to TDC-125, mutation DH263 in selection with TDC-125 was resistant to TDC-125 but DSM. Sequentially selected parasites with additional dhod mutations were resistant DSM but not TDC-125, suggesting still sensitive to therapeutic dose. Treating collaterally sensitive line with TDC-125 selected parasites with genetic changes dhod, including DH227, alone conferring resistance TDC-125.

**Implications:** The emergence of cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of DH enzyme. Our findings suggest that combining DH inhibitors based on collateral profiles may not be effective strategy to suppress emergence of resistance in Plas falciparum.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that combining two DH inhibitors, DSM and TDC-125, based on collateral profiles fails to prevent emergence of resistance in Plas falcipar in vitro. While previously identified mutations exhibited sensitivity to TDC-125, mutation DH263 in selection with TDC-125 was resistant TDC- but DSM. Sequentially selected parasites with additional dh mutations were resistant DSM but T-125, suggesting still sensitive to therapeutic dose. Treating collater sensitive line with T- selected parasites with changes dh, including DH227, alone conferring T- resistance.

**Title:** Biogeographic Variation in Antimal Drug Resistance: A Novel Insights from a Compartmental Model

**Research Question:** What is the relationship between malaria transmission intensity and drug resistance, and how does strain diversity influence the evolution of antimal drug resistance across different bioge regions?

**Methods:** We developed a novel compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant strains, as well as the dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity to investigate the relationship between transmission and resistance.

**Findings:** Our results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while steadily decreases in high-divers, high-trans regions.

**Implications:** Our study underscores the critical role of strain diversity in bioge patterns of resistance, suggesting that control protocols should vary from region to region, and there is no one-size-fits cure for malaria worldwide. The inclusion of strain in the model provides a mechanistic explanation for Southeast Asia's persisting resistance to antimal drugs, including chlorquine, despite lower transmission than Africa.

**Conclusions:** Strain diversity and strain-specific immunity, tracked through macroparas structure, predict the complex relationship between transmission and drug frequencies. Our model implies that control strategies should be tailored to region-specific, accounting for local strain diversity and transmission dynamics.

**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Δ-THC Exposure on Early Embryonic Development: A Stepwise In Vitro Study**

**Research Question:** How does Δ-TH, the most abundant phytocannabinoid in cannabis, affect early embryonic development, particularly during the formation of primordial germ cells (PGCs)?

**Methods:** We employed a stepwise in vitro system to model early embryonic development, exposing mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and primed embryonic cells (EpiCs) to varying concentrations of Δ-TH (0.1 nM-100µM) to mimic physiologically-relevant concentrations in cannabis users.

**Findings:** Δ-TH increased proliferation of naive ESCs, but not primed ESCs, in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner, associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Notably, Δ-TH rewired ESC metabolism by increasing glycolytic and anabolic capabilities, a memory retained throughout differentiation to PGCs in the absence of direct exposure, associated with altered transcriptional profile.

**Implications:** This study provides the first in-depth molecular characterization of Δ-TH's impact on early germline development, highlighting the importance of metabolic remodelling and its potential as a driver of exposure through differentiation stages.

**Conclusions:** Our results reveal a moderate but significant impact of Δ-TH on early embryonic processes, underscoring the need for further investigation into its effects on embryonic development, particularly during the first trimester in humans. The metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming of PGCs during development is sensitive to environmental insults, with potential consequences for the offspring. This study sheds light on the impact of Δ-TH on early stages of embryonic development, a critical for understanding the effects of cannabis use during pregnancy.

**Key findings:**

* Δ-TH increases proliferation of naive ESC, but not primed ESC, in a CB1-dependent manner
* Moderate transcriptomic changes associated with Δ-TH-induced proliferation
* Δ- rewires ESC metabolism, increasing glycolytic and anabolic capabilities
* Memory of metabolic rewiring retained throughout differentiation to PGC
* Altered transcription profile in PGC in absence of direct Δ-TH exposure

**Significance:** This study is the first to investigate ΔTH's impact on early embryonic development, a critical for understanding the effects of cannabis use during pregnancy. The results highlight the importance of metabolic remodelling and its potential as a driver of exposure through differentiation, underscoring the need for further research into ΔTH's effects on embryonic development.

**Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of the NLR Gene Family in Zebraf (Danio rerio): Insights into the Evolution and Diversity of Immune Genes in a Model Species

**Research Question:** How does the NLR gene family, a key component of the innate immune system, evolve and exhibit diversity in the zebraf (Danio), a species with hundreds of NLR genes, compared to other animals?

**Methods:** We sequenced 93 zebraf from multiple wild and laboratory populations, identifying 151 NLRs, exceeding the previously known 400, with approximately half present in all wild populations and 4% found in 80% of individuals. Wild zraf have up to twice as many NLRs per individual and up to four times more NLR per population than laboratory strains.

**Findings:** Contrary to the massive gene copy number, nucleotide diversity in zraf NLR genes is low, with half monomorphic and few polymorphisms, suggesting purifying selection. In contrast, mice NLR (Np1) copy numbers vary in laboratory strains from 2-5. Many fish studies report 10-50 NLR genes (e.g., Rajan et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016). Hundreds of NLR are present in zraf (Stein et al., 2007; Laing et.,200; Tres et al.

**Implications:** The hundreds of NLR copies in zraf, with purifying selection, suggest evolution is not neutral. Expression of NLR is induced by pathogen exposure (reviewed Chhal et al.,202), but most zraf NLR function unclear. We previously demonstrated reduced single-nucleotide variation in laboratory strains (Suurli et al.,202). Here, we show NLR copy and variation also reduced, likely due to recent population bottleneck.

**Conclusions:** This study lays groundwork for investigating molecular and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to large vertebrate gene diversity. We identified 151 NLR, with 59% present in at least one wild population, shared between two, and restricted to single. Variability in gene distribution among populations observed.

**Title:** Discovery of a Novel Famenian Ovule with Integument Wings: Implications for the Evolution of Seed Dispersal Mechanisms

**Research Question:** What is the significance of the discovery of a new Famen ovule with integument wings and its implications for the evolution of seed dispersal mechanisms?

**Methods:** A new Famen ovule taxon, Alamenia gen. et sp. nov., was discovered in the Xinhang, Anhui, China, China. The ovule possesses three integument wings extending outwards and inwards along the abaxial side, enclosing the nucellus, and is borne terminally on dichotomous branches without a cup. Mathematical analysis was used to compare the dispersal efficiency of seeds with one, two, three, and four wings under the same conditions.

**Findings:** Alamen is the second cupulate ovule in the Famen, indicating that integuments of earliest ovules without cup evolved for photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. It suggests that winged seeds originated earlier than other dispersal mechanisms such as plume and papp, and three-wing seeds followed by seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-wing seeds are more adapted to dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions.

**Implications:** The discovery of Alamen provides evidence that integuments of earliest ovules without cup evolved for photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispers, indicating that winged seeds originated earlier than other dispersal mechanisms. It also suggests that three-wing seeds are more adapted to dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions. This study contributes to our understanding of the evolution of seed dispersal mechanisms and the diversity of Famen winged ovules.

**Conclusions:** The discovery of Alamen, a novel Famen ovule with integ wings, provides new insights into the evolution of seed dispersal mechanisms. It suggests that integuments of earliest ovules without cup evolved for photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispers, and that wing seeds originated earlier than other dispersal mechanisms. Mathematical analysis shows that three-wing seeds are more adapted to dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four under the same conditions. This study contributes to our understanding of the evolution of seed dispersal and diversity of Famen winged ovules.

**Title:** RSYN-mediated BCR-ABL Neddylation: A Novel Therapeutic Target for Philadelphia-Positive Leukemia

**Research Question:** What is the role of RSY in the pathogenesis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, and can targeting RSY-mediated BCR-ABL nedlation be a potential therapeutic strategy for Ph+ leukemia treatment?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of RSY and B-ABL in patients with Ph leukemia, and examined the effects of RSY inhibition on B-ABL stability and leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

**Findings:** RSY is highly expressed in Ph leukemia patients and promotes disease progression by stabilizing B- via nedlation. The nedlation of B by RSY competes its ubiquitination-dependent degradation, increasing B stability. RSY inhibition significantly suppresses Ph leukemia cell survival, linked to its NED8 ligase activity, which mediates B- nedlation to enhance stability.

**Implications:** RSY plays a pivotal role in Ph leukemogenesis, and targeting RSY-mediated B- nedlation may offer an alternative to tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Ph treatment.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals RSY's novel role in hematology and delineates it as a potential therapeutic target for Ph leukemia. RSY's NED8 ligase activity nylates and stabilizes B, promoting leukogenesis. RSY inhibition profoundly prolongs survival in tumor-bearing mice, underscoring its significance in Ph treatment.

**Title:** Antimicrobial Peptide-Primed Mining of Peptoglycan Hydrolases from Bacterial Proteomes: A Novel Strategy for Discovery of Promising Antimicrobial Agents

**Research Question:** Can antimicrobial peptides derived from bacteriophage lysins be used as templates to mine peptoglycan hyrolases with bactericidal activity from bacterial proteomes?

**Methods:** We developed an antimicrobial peptide-priming strategy to identify peptogcan hyrolases from bacterial proteomes using bacteriophage-derived antimicrobial peptides as templates. As a proof-of-concept, we used the antimicrobial peptide P307 from PlyF lysin as a template to search for peoglycan hyrolases in the Acinetobacter baumann proteome (PHAb).

**Findings:** We identified five peogcan hyrolases (PH8, PH10, and PH11) with potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens, even after heat treatment at 100°C for 1 hr. Crystal structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 revealed that hyperthermostable PH10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by dimeromer transition, while thermosensitive PH8 formed a monomer. Mouse models of bacterial infection demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PH10.

**Implications:** Our antimicrobial-prim strategy provides a new clue for discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs. Considering that lysins from Gram-negative bacteria contain antimicrobial-like regions, we hypothesized that antimicrobial peptides could be used as templates to mine peogcan hyrolases. Using PlyF-derived antimicrobial peptide P307 as a template, we successfully discovered two peogcan hyrolases PH10 and PH11 from A. baumann proteome.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the feasibility of antimicrobial-prim mining for bacteridal peogcan hyrolases with desirable physico properties from bacterial proteomes. Our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides can be used as templates to discover new peog hyrolases with bactericidal activity, providing a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics. Further studies are needed to explore the full potential of this strategy for antimicrobial discovery.

**Title:** Uncovering Hidden Patterns of Pancreatic Cancer Symptoms: A Retrospective Study of Danish Patient Registry and Electronic Health Records**

**Background:** Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with limited treatment options, and early detection of symptoms and disease correlations is crucial for improving prognosis. This study aimed to investigate symptom trajectories of pancreatic cancer using Danish Patient Registry (NPR) and electronic health records (EHR) data.

**Methods:** We analyzed 6.9 million patients from 1994 to 2018, of whom 23,592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish Registry included 18,523 of these patients. To complement registry codes, we used text mining to extract symptoms from free clinical notes in HR (307 cancer and 30,780 controls). We generated and compared symptom trajectories to uncover patterns prior to pancreatic diagnosis.

**Findings:** Text mining of clinical notes captured more symptoms before diagnosis than registry-based analysis, including 'Blood pressure without diagnosis', 'Abnormal heartbeat', and 'intestinal obstruction'. Trajectories identified two groups with lower survival (<90 days): 'CoughJaiceIntestinal' and 'PainJaiceAbnormal function'. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of pancreatic symptom trajectories, leveraging full potential of data for early detection.

**Implications:** This study uncovered significant disease and symptom trajectories prior pancreatic, assessable as risk factors for screening. Complementing cancer symptoms from diagnosis with text mining, we observed more symptoms in EHRs than NPR. Future applications could use AI and text techniques to build longitudinal trajectories for early prediction in clinics, serving as a guide for screening and improving lives.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates phenotypic information in registry and EHR can detect patterns prior pancreatic diagnosis. Our study reveals increased prevalence of early symptoms in EHR, suggesting harnessing complete data by multi-modality trajectories from EHR and registry codes. This work contributes to the field of cancer research, building on previous studies (Delesierre et al., 2017; Jensen et al., 2017; Walter et al.,2016).

**Title:** Developmental Trajectory of Sleep Spindle-Oscillation Coupling in Children and Adolescents: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Research Question:** How does the synchronization of fast spindle activity (12.5-16 Hz) during slow oscillation (0.5-1 Hz) peak, a hallmark of adult non-rapid eye sleep, develop across childhood and adolescence?

**Methods:** We conducted a cross-sectional study on children (5-6, 8-11, 14, and 18 years) and adults (20-26 years) to investigate age-specific patterns of slow and fast spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling. We analyzed individualized detection of single events using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from frontal (F3, F) and centro-parietal (3, C, C, Cz, P) electrodes.

**Findings:** Our results show that the predominant fast spindle frequency was development-specific, below the canonical range for most children, while slow oscill-spindle coupling was evident in adult-like fast sples in all age groups, but less precise in children. We found that fast maturity was associated with enhanced oscill-spindle strength and precision across age groups.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the ability to generate adult-like fast sples actuates precise oscill-spindle patterns from childhood to young adulthood.

**Conclusion:** This study provides the first detailed characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fastles, oscillations, and their coupling in children and adolescents. Our results indicate that the maturation of development-specific fastles towards adult-like sples explains age-related differences in strength and precision of oscill-sp patterns.

**Title:** Investigating the Abandonment of Understudied Genes in Omics Research: A Systematic Analysis and Tool Development

**Research Question:** Why are understudied genes systematically abandoned in favor of better-stud genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results, and how can we promote the investigation of understud genes?

**Methods:** We conducted a systematic analysis of 45 biological and experimental factors proposed to affect the choice of genes being studied in -omics experiments and found that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. We also evaluated the possibility that understud genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but not investigated by authors.

**Findings:** Our results show that understud genes are abandoned between the completion of - experiments and reporting results, rather than being abandoned by research. The abandonment of understud genes may be driven by the concern that less-investigated genes yield lower impact. We also found that understud genes may accrue greater number of citations. We developed a tool, Find Understud Genes (FM), to engage bias during selection of hits.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the need to promote understud genes in research. FM allows scientists to identify understud genes in vertebrate aging. FM is available for download at fm.amal.northwestern.edu as MacOS/Windows app.

**Conclusions:** Our study suggests that underst genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-stud between the completion - experiments and reporting results. We propose FM to promote investigation understud genes. Our results reinforce that underst genes are not abandoned by research, but between experiments and results. The abandonment of underst genes may be driven by valid concern that less-invest genes yield lower impact.

**Title:** Investigating the Detrimental Effects of Non-caloric Monoschar on Vascular Function: A Zebraf Model Study

**Research Question:** Do artificially sweetened beverages containing non-caloric monoscharides, suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages, have detrimental effects on blood vessel function?

**Methods:** We established a zebraf model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Utilizing this model, we examined the effects of glucose and nonoric monoschar on blood vessel formation, especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs). Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of endothelial cells (ECs) exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and upregulated proangiogenic genes.

**Findings:** Our results showed that glucose and nonoric monchar induced excessive formation of ISVs, excessively branched vessels formed by ectopic activation of quies ECs into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of ECs exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary EC, proliferating EC, and upregulated proangi genes. Further experiments validated that fox1 mediated excessive angiogenesis by nonoric via upregulation of marck1.

**Implications:** This study provides new evidence of the negative effects of nonoric monchar on vascular system and underlying mechanisms. Our findings suggest that both caloric and nonoric monchar treatment lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting differentiation of quies EC into cells through fox1-marck pathway.

**Conclusions:** This study provides novel insights into the roles of nonoric monchar in health and mechanisms. Our results have significant implications for understanding the detrimental effects of artificially sweetened beverages on vascular function.

**Title:** Leveraging Shared Structures for Efficient Storage of Multiple Sequences in Working Memory: Behavioral and Neural Evidence

**Research Question:** How do individuals process and store multiple sequences in working memory (WM) when faced with limited capacity constraints, and what neural mechanisms facilitate this process?

**Methods:** In this study, participants memorized sequences of items with different colors and locations, then reproduced the color and location sequences in order. We manipulated the consistency between location and color trajectories to examine the impact on memory performance and neural activity.

**Findings:** We found that sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrated improved memory performance and a correlation between color and location sequences. Notably, sequences with consistent trajectories showed reactivation of common trajectories and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Additionally, neural reactivation correlated with WM behavior.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that a shared structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and replay, facilitating efficient organization in WM. This is supported by neural evidence from EEG recordings, showing reactivation of shared trajectories during encoding and retention, and spontaneous replay of sequences during recall. Moreover, reactivation is related to WM and behavior.

**Conclusions:** Our findings provide converging behavioral and neural evidence for leveraging common structures to facilitate WM. Specifically, sequences with color-location aligned trajectories showed enhanced memory and significant correlation between color and sequence trajectories. This suggests replay-based mechanisms in WM mediate combinations based on shared structures. When subjects prepare to reproduce location during recall, the task-relevant color demonstrates spontaneous replay, highlighting the bond between color and sequences with common trajectory. Together, the color-location correlation in behavior and findings indicate that replay mechanisms in WM mediate sequence based on common structures.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Shared structures facilitate storage of multiple sequences in WM through encoding and replay
* Consistent trajectories improve memory and correlation between color and sequences
* Neural reactivation correlates with WM and behavior
* Replay mechanisms mediate sequence combinations based on shared structures

**Future Directions:**

* Investigate the neural basis of shared structures in WM
* Examine the role of replay in sequence storage and retrieval
* Develop strategies to leverage shared structures for improved WM performance

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of PURA Mutations in Neurodevelopmental PUR Syndrome: A Structural and Functional Analysis of the PUR Protein

**Research Question:** How do mutations in the PUR gene cause neurodevelopmental PUR syndrome, and what is the impact of these mutations on the structural and functional integrity of the PUR protein?

**Methods:** We employed a multi-disciplinary approach combining X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate the effects of mutations in the PUR gene on the structure and function of the PUR protein. We solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains of human PUR and analyzed their dynamics using molecular simulations and magnetic resonance measurements.

**Findings:** Our results reveal that mutations in PUR impair its localization to processing bodies, either by destroying its folding, RNA binding, or dimerization. The high structural promiscuity and dynamics of PUR make it susceptible to mutations, explaining why even conservative mutations result in full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PUR syndrome.

**Implications:** This study provides the first experimental assessment of the effects of PUR syndrome-causing mutations on folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding, as well as subcell localization to stress granules and bodies. Unlike other genetic disorders, such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, pathogenic variations in PUR are found along the entire sequence, not just hotspot regions.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that the structural flexibility and promiscuity of PUR domains contribute to its susceptibility to mutations, offering an explanation for the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PUR syndrome. This study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopment disorders, such as PUR syndrome, to develop effective treatments and therapies. Further research is needed to understand the underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with PUR syndrome.

**Title:** Interaction between TRPV4 and ANO1 plays a crucial role in temperature-dependent perspiration in eccrine glands of mouse pads

**Research Question:** This study investigates the interaction between transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TR4) and anoctamin 1 (ANO) in eccrine glands of mouse pads and their potential role in temperature-dependent perspiration.

**Methods:** We examined the expression of TR4, ANO, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in eccrine glands of mouse pads using immunofluorescence and western blotting. We also measured cytosolic Ca2+ increases in response to menthol and acetylcholine stimulation in wild-type and TR4-deficient mice. Additionally, we tested the effect of menthol on sweating in wild-type and TRPMKO mice.

**Findings:** TR4 colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO, and AQP5 in eccrine glands of mouse pads. TR4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases were inhibited by menthol. Acetyloline-stimulated sweating in foot was temperature-dependent in wild-type but not TR4-deficient mice and inhibited by menthol in wild and TRPMKO mice. Basal sweating without acetyl stimulation was inhibited by ANO inhibitor. TR4 expression was higher in normidrotic skin from patients with acquired generalized anhidrosis (AG) compared to anidrotic skin from AG.

**Implications:** TR4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interaction with ANO. TR4 or the TR4/ANO complex could be targeted to regulate perspiration.

**Conclusions:** TR4-expressing secretory cells in eccrine glands are involved in secretion of macromolecular components as well as water and ions. The interaction between TR4 and ANO promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse pads. TR4 expression is higher in normidic skin from patients with AG compared to anidic skin from AG. This suggests TR4 plays a role in maintaining friction in foot pads, as wild mice climbed a slippery slope more easily than TR4-deficient mice.

**Title:** Universal Cortical Morphology: A Multiscale Description of Primate and Mammalian Cortices

**Research Question:** Can we develop a universal description of cortical morphology that captures the diversity of shapes and sizes across primate and mammalian species?

**Methods:** We employed a multiscale analysis of cortical morphology, combining fractal geometry and morphometrics to describe the cerebral cortices of 11 primate species and 70 mammalian species.

**Findings:** Our results show that all cortices can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes, following a common scale-free morphometric trajectory. Importantly, we found that all cortices approximate the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension df = 2.5. This understanding enables precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale.

**Implications:** Our findings indicate a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and common mechanisms governing cortical folding. We demonstrate a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology, with a more than fourfold increase in size from two to eight standard deviations at a spatial scale of 2 mm. This new understanding may generate biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future.

**Conclusions:** Expressing cortical morphology as a function of scale is more than a list of morphometric measures or listing sulci and gyri. Our novel syntax enables rigorous characterization of brain and morphological changes. Biological processes may act on specific scales, leaving others untouched (e.g., ageing). Our multiscale metrics differentiate morphological changes better than single-scale metrics, with comparable effect sizes for classification. Primate and mammalian cortices share key properties beyond fractal dimension, including a universal self-similar scaling equation. The fractal dimension is 2.5 for all cortices, with substructures smaller than a length. Fractal scaling aspects of morphology has been postulated, with recent MRI studies estimating 2.5 for whole cortex. Our results demonstrate a universal self-similar equation for primate and mammalian cortices, with two aspects of universality: K remains same for all scales and fract dimension 2.5.

**Key contributions:**

* A universal description of cortical morphology across primate and mammalian species
* precise quantification of brain morphology as function of scale
* scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology
* biomarkers for range of conditions in future
* multiscale metrics differentiate morphological changes better than single-scale metrics
* universal selfimilar equation for primate and mammalian cortices
* fractal dimension 2.5 for all cortices with substructures

**Title:** Elucidating the Role of NF-κB Transcription Factor REL in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) through Live-Cell Imaging and Transcriptomics Analysis

**Research Question:** How does the NF-κ transcription factor REL regulate immune and stress responses in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

**Methods:** We employed live-cell imaging and transcriptomics to investigate the dynamics of REL in PDAC cells in response to TNα stimulation. Single-cell analysis revealed rapid, sustained, non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of REL. Bayesian analysis predicted REL heterogeneity in PD cells dependent on actin dynamics. RNA-seq identified REL-regulated gene clusters, including TNα-induced upregulation of actin regulators NU2 and ARHG31. siRNA depletion of ARHG31 and NU2 altered TNα-stimulated REL dynamics, establishing a negative feedback loop regulating REL activation.

**Findings:**

1. TNα induces rapid, sustained, non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of REL in PD cells.
2. REL heterogeneity in PD cells is dependent on actin dynamics.
3. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct REL-regulated gene clusters, including TNα upregulation of actin regulators NU2 and AR31.
4. siRNA-mediated depletion of AR31 and NU2 altered TNα-stimulated REL dynamics, establishing a negative feedback loop regulating REL activation.
5. We characterized NF-κ pathway in PD cells, identifying NF-κ/Iκ proteins interacting with REL in presence or absence TNα.
6. RNA-seq identified genes with distinct expression patterns based on TNα and REL activation.
7. Live imaging with knockdown targets revealed novel mechanisms regulating REL dynamics, including negative loops between REL and actin modulators NU2 and AR31, and REL and non-canonical NFκ protein REL.

**Implications:** Our study provides computational and experimental evidence for interdependence between actin network and NFκ pathway with REL translocation in PD. We identified actin modulators AR31/2 as REL targets and regulators of nuclear REL with TNα, providing a mechanism mediating relationship between act and REL. In contrast, NF1 and NF2 showed increased interaction with REL TNα, forming NFκ heteromers with REL, NF1 and NF2 in PD cells. siRNA knockdown of TN-regulated genes affected TN-stimulated REL, suggesting Iκ plays a role in suppressing TN induction of REL in PD cells. REL is highly modulated by NFκ/I proteins in absence of stress or inflammatory cues.

**Conclusions:** Our study characterizes NFκ pathway in PD cells and identifies novel mechanisms regulating REL dynamics, including negative loops between REL and actin modulators and REL and non-canonical NFκ protein. These findings provide insights into the complex interplay between actin and NFκ pathways in PD, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for PD treatment.

**Title:** Disrupted Excitation-Inhibition Balance in C. elegans Model of PTEN Mutations Reveals GABAergic Defects and Therapeutic Potential of Ketogenic Diets

**Research Question:** How do PTEN mutations affect excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the C. elegans neuromuscular system, and can ketogenic diets mitigate GABAergic defects in PTEN mutants?

**Methods:** We used the C. elegans neuromuscular system, where excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic inputs regulate muscle activity, to investigate the impact of d-18/PT mutations on GABAergic and cholinergic development and function. We found that d-18/PT mutations selectively impaired GABAergic but not cholinergic development, leading to a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. Reduced DAF-16/FOX activity during development was responsible for GABA defects in d-18/PT mutants.

**Findings:** Our study demonstrates that d-18, the C. elegans ortholog of PTEN, leads to defects in inhibitory GABAergic neurodevelopment without affecting cholin excitatory signals. We found that a ketogenic diet enriched with β-hydrobutyrate early in development induces D-FOX activity, improving GABA neurodevelopment in d-PT mutants.

**Implications:** Our results provide insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and shed light on the mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of ketogenic diets. The C. elegans neuromus system offers a valuable model for investigating the PIK/Akt pathway's role in neurodevelopment, conserved throughout the animal kingdom.

**Conclusions:** PTEN mutations in C. elegans result in GABAergic impairments due to decreased D- activity during development. Cholinergic excitatory neurons remain unaffected. Our findings suggest β-hydrobutrate acts early to mitigate GABA defects in d-PT mutants. Together, our results demonstrate d- mutations lead to inhibitory GABA defects without affecting cholinergic signals, highlighting the importance of D-FOX in GABA development. The PI/Akt pathway's role in neurodevelopment is conserved, making C. elegans a suitable model for investigating this pathway's function.

**Title:** Unveiling the Antiviral Function of Interleukin-1β (IL-1) in Containing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection

**Research Question:** What is the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the innate immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and how does it contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19?

**Methods:** Utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we investigated the effects of soluble factors secreted by human monocytes on SARSV-2-induced cell fusion in infected cells. Cytokine screening identified interleukin-1 (IL-1) as a key mediator of inflammation that inhibits syncytia formation by various SARSV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1 activates Rho/RO signaling through a non-canonical IL- receptor pathway, enriching actin bundles at cell junctions and preventing syncytia formation.

**Findings:** In vivo experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1 significantly restricted SARSV-2 spread in lung epithelium. Fluorescence staining showed SARS-2-infected epithelial cells fused with neighboring cells promoting viral transmission, while IL-1 induced actin bundles restricting syncia and viral transmission. Mechanistically, IL-1 activates Rho to cell junction between S-2-infected cells and neighboring cells via IL- mediated to initiate actin bundle, preventing cell fusion and viral spreading.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the function and mechanism of IL-1 in inhibiting SARS-2-induced syncytia formation, and the role of innate factors including cytokines against coronavir transmission, providing potential therapeutic targets for viral control.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the antiv function of IL-1 against SARS-2-induced cell fusion, revealing a critical role for proinflammatory cytokines in controlling viral infection. Our findings suggest IL-1 as a potential therapeutic target for controlling SARS-2 transmission and COVID-19.

**Title:** Nutritional Modulation of Insulin-Producing Cells and Sugar-Sensing Neurons Orchestrates Metabolic Homeostasis in Drosophila

**Research Question:** How do insulin-producing cells (IPC) and sugar-sensing neurons regulate metabolic homeostasis in response to nutritional changes in Drosila?

**Methods:** We employed in vivo electrophysiological recordings to investigate the effects of nutritional state on IPC activity in Dophila. We found that IPC activity decreased during starvation and increased after feeding with glucose or fructose, but not non-nutritive sugars. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous application.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that IPC and sugarensing neurons, specifically Diure hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intererealis (DH44s), work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Activating IPC had a satiety-like effect on food-search behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DHNs increased hyperactivity. Functional experiments showed that DH44s do not affect IPC activity, while other DHNs inhibit them.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the complexity of insulin regulation, emphasizing that secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors. IPC and DHNs are integral to a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive response to shifts in metabolic state.

**Conclusions:** This study advances our understanding of the neuronal underpinnings of metabolic homeasis, demonstrating that IPC and DHNs are autonomously and systemically sensing the nutritional state to modulate insulin release and behavior. Our findings suggest that IPC and DHNs work in parallel to maintain homeostasis, with IPC releasing insulin in response to glucose ingestion and DHNs responding to changes in hemol sugar levels. These results have implications for understanding metabolic regulation in Dila and potentially other organisms.

**Title:** Large-Scale Endogenous Tagging of Proteins in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) using the SplitNeGreen System

**Research Question:** Can the splitNeGreen system be used to generate a large-scale endogenous library of tagged proteins in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), enabling the study of protein function in healthy and differentiated cell types?

**Methods:** We engineered a human iPSC line to constitutively express the m21 fragment of the splitNeGreen protein (NG-10) and demonstrated efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment mNG. We used neural network-based image restoration to enable live imaging of dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSC.

**Findings:** Our results show that the splitNe system enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins in iPSC, opening the door to studying protein function in healthy and differentiated cells. We generated a proof-of-concept by targeting multiple genes for endogenous tagging with mNG and clonally isolating tagged iP lines. This work provides the foundation for a genome-wide endogenous library in human iPSC.

**Implications:** This study represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous library in human cells, enabling the study of protein function in stem and across cell types in vitro. The splitNe system allows for easy and efficient endogenous with m in cells where NG-10 is constitutively expressed, making it a valuable tool for generating a large-scale library of tagged proteins in human cells.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate the potential of the splitNe system for large-scale endogenous tagging in human iPSC, enabling the study of protein function in healthy and differentiated cells. This work provides the basis for a high-quality endogenous library in iP, which will be used to study protein in stem and across cell types in vitro. The splitNe system is a valuable tool for generating a genome-wide library of tagged proteins in human cells, enabling the study of protein function in healthy and differentiated cells.

**Title:** Development of a Novel Electrolytic Lesion Technique for Chronic Intracortical Multielectrode Probes: A Platform for Investigating Causal Connections between Brain and Behavior

**Research Question:** Can a novel electrolytic lesion technique be developed for chronically implanted intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology, enabling causal investigations of the neuronal population's role in circuit function while providing insight into local reorganization after neuron loss?

**Methods:** A custom-built current source was designed to provide stable current for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake animals. The performance of this lesion technique was validated using histology, ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesion.

**Findings:** The electrolytic lesion method avoids disruptive procedures, offers millimeter precision over extent and submill precision location, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining population after lesion. This technique can be used in areas of cortex, several species, and theoretically with multielectrode. The low-cost lesion device can be easily adopted into existing electrophiology setup.

**Implications:** This technique is expected to enable causal investigations of the neuronal population's role in circuit while providing insight into local reorganization after neuron loss.

**Conclusions:** A novel electrolytic lesion through microelectrode is compatible with electrophys recording of activity pre- and post-lesion. A custom current source was built to ensure stable delivery throughout lesion, for repeated, as well as different types and animals. This design can be used creating intrac electrodes for electrophiology and electrolytic lesion. The technique works with multielect probe testing in vivo rabbit cortex, with no limitations preventing from working with passive multielectrode.

**Title:** Investigating the Detection of Pesticides by the Mouthparts of the Buff-tailed Bumblebee (Bombus terrestr)

**Research Question:** Can the mouthparts of the buffailed bumblebee (Bombus terre) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution mimicking the nectar of oilseed (Brassica nap)?

**Methods:** We used a combination of behavioral assays and electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buffailed bumblebee detect the presence of pesticides in a solution mimicking the nectar of oilseed. Bees were presented with solutions containing concentrations of imaclopr, thiamox, clothin, and sulfox, spanning six orders of magnitude, and their feeding behavior and electrophysiological responses were recorded.

**Findings:** Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing these concentrations of pesticides, even when these contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of pesticides altered gustatory neurons through slight reduction in firing rate or change in rate of adaptation.

**Implications:** These data provide strong evidence that buffbees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact nectar with other body parts, we predict they are at risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

**Conclusions:** Our results contradict previous studies suggesting that bees can detect and avoid neotinoids in nectar (Ar et al, 2018; K et al 2015; et 2020). We conclude that buffes cannot taste neotoids in nectar on their own or in water. This conclusion, however, has been challenged by a study in free-flying B terre foragers (Ar et 2018). Our findings have implications for the use of pesticides in agriculture, as bees are important pollinators of crops but are at risk when pesticides are used. If bees could detect and avoid pesticides, these could be used to defend against pests without risk to bees.

**Title:** Spatial Dynamics of Plasmodium knowlesi Infection in Non-Human Primates in Southeast Asia: A Regional Prevalence and Geographic Determinants

**Research Question:** This study investigates the prevalence and geographic determinants of Plasium knowlesi infection in non-human primates (NHPs) in Southeast Asia, a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and a barrier to malaria elimination in the region.

**Methods:** We conducted a meta-analysis of 632 NHP from 148 sites across Southeast Asia, using remote sensing data and statistical models to identify relationships between Pl know in NHP and forest fragmentation.

**Findings:** Prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia, with low overall and high estimates for Malaysian Borne. Regions with higher prevalence in NHP overlap human infection hotspots, and transmission linked to land conversion and fragmentation. Novel relationships between Pl know in NHP and forest fragmentation suggest higher prevalence contingent on habitat complexity, explaining geographic variation in parasite burden.

**Implications:** This study addresses critical gaps in regional Pl know epidemiology, indicating prevalence in simian reservoirs may drive human spillo risk. Associations between landscape and variation in sim Plasium spp. in primates have not been explored, and this study aims to (1) assemble georeferenced P know in NHP, (2) evaluate N P know prevalence by region, and (3) assess environmental and spatial factors for P in NHP across Asia.

**Conclusions:** This study is the first to systematically assess P know in NHP at regional scale and wide habitats. Prediction intervals indicate heterogeneity within regions, consistent with variability across individual sites. Detailed plots for prevalence can be found in Appendix 2. Covariate and P data used to fit models explore relationships between local landscape and N malaria. Notwithstanding limitations, this highlights spatial heterogeneity and landscape driving know infection in NHP. Given intersection between epidemiology and ecology, infection within reservoirs must be considered in public interventions.

**Title:** The Rise of Angiosperms to Ecological Dominance and the Breakup of Gondwana: Major Transitions in the Evolutionary History of Insect-Plant Interactions

**Research Question:** How did the breakup of Gondana and the rise of angiosperms influence contemporary trophic interactions, and how did host shifts and paleogeographical events shape the evolution of ancient phytophagous weevils of the family Belidae?

**Methods:** We integrated molecular data from the fossil record to construct a time-calibrated tree for ancient phytophous weils of the beetle family Belidae. Our analyses indicate that crown Belidae originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondana, associated with Pinops (conifer) host plants, with larvae developing in dead/decaying branches.

**Findings:** Our results show that Belidae tracked their host plants as major movements occurred during Gondana's breakup, surviving on distant disjunct landmasses. Some Bel shifted to angiosperms and Cycadops when conifers declined, evolving new troph interactions including bro-poll mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorous paras angperms. Ext radiations of Bel in the genera Rhin (Australian region) and Prohin (Hawaiian) have relatively recent origins.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the breakup of Gond and rise of angios led to major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions, with Belidae adapting to new hosts and developing new troph interactions. The two subfamilies Belinae and Oxycninae originated in the Australian and Neotropical regions, respectively, indicating a Gwan origin for the family. The likely ancestral plants of Belidae were Pinops (0.53) or angiosperms (0.43), with Pinops being the most likely host.

**Conclusions:** Belidae originated during the Jurassic in association with gymperms and colonized angperms as the latter diversified and rose to ecological dominance during the Latecret and Paleogene. The subfamilies Bel and Oxycn diverged during the separation of East and Westondana, with both lineages still developing on their ancestral plant. Our study highlights the importance of integrating molecular and fossil data to understand the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions and the impact of paleogeographical events on the evolution of ancient species.

**Title:** Unveiling the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Tumour Evolution: A High-Resolution Analysis of Hepatocellular Carcinomas

**Research Question:** How do tumour cells grow and evolve within the tumour volume, and how do mutations disperse throughout the tumour, contributing to overall tumour growth?

**Methods:** We leveraged high-resolution data from hepatocellular carcinomas, with hundreds of samples taken in two and three dimensions, to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Using spatial metrics, we found that tumour cells predominantly grow uniformly within the tumour volume, rather than at the surface. We determined how mutations disperse throughout the tum and how cell death contributes to tumour growth.

**Findings:** Our results shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution in the emerging field of spatial biology. We used genetic data from hepatocellular tumours at high resolution (Ling et al., 2015; Li et al.,202) to analyse the evolution of tum in vivo. We linked spatial sampling with evolution on a larger scale, phylogenetic comparison of primary and metastatic tumours elucidated the dynamics of metastasis (Jones et al.,200; Zhao et al.,201; Alves et.,201; Hu.,202).

**Implications:** Our findings have implications for understanding tumour growth and evolution, and can inform the development of targeted therapies. The spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution can be used to predict tumour progression and response to treatment. Our methods can be applied to other solid tumours, including breast, lung, and colon cancer.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the spatio-temp dynamics of tumour evolution, and demonstrates the importance of spatial sampling for understanding tum growth and evolution. Our results highlight the need for high-resolution data in the field of spatial biology. The spatio-temp dynamics tumour evolution can be used to predict tumour progression and response to treatment, and inform the development of targeted therapies. Our methods can be applied to other tumours, including breast, lung, and colon cancer.

**Title:** Unveiling the Neuroendocrine Mechanism of Seasonal Polyphenism in Copsa chinensis: A Novel Function of Bicon and its Receptor

**Research Question:** What is the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism of seasonal polyphenism in Cops chinensis, specifically the transition from summer-form to winter, and what is the role of Bicon and its receptor in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of Bicon subunits Cursα and Cursβ in response to low temperature (10°C) and CTR, and their heterodimer formation, which mediates the transition from summer to winter by influencing cuticle content and thickness. We also identified the Bicon receptor Curs-R and its role in upstream signaling the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer to winter. Furthermore, we discovered that miR-2 targets Curs, contributing to regulation of Bicon signaling in seasonal polyism.

**Findings:** We found that Cursα and Cβ were upregulated in the head and cuticle of winter-form compared to summer, suggesting a potential role of Bicon in seasonal polyism. The transition from summer to winter was regulated by low temperature (10°C) and CTR, and 10°C treatment CTRi reduced expression of Curs and Cβ. We identified Curs as the Bicon receptor, with temporal and spatial patterns similar to Curs and Cβ, and higher expression in winter-form than summer. Curs and Cβ formed a heterodimer neurope that acts on Curs to mediate transition from summer to winter by affecting cuticle content, chitin, and thickness. mi-2 targets Curs to modulate Bicon signaling in seasonalism.

**Implications:** These findings reveal a novel neuroendocrine mechanism underlying seasonal polyism and provide insights into Bicon and its receptor. Bicon genes and receptor play a pivotal role in regulating cuticle development, and may be necessary for tanning in all insects. However, further studies are needed to understand how Bicon mediates polyism.

**Conclusion:** This study provides the first evidence for the function of Bicon and its receptor in the transition from summer to winter in C chinensis, shedding light on the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism of seasonal polyism. Our findings highlight the importance of Bicon and its receptor in regulating cuticle development and tanning, with potential implications for understanding polyism in other insects.

**Title:** Targeting Epigenetic and Transcriptional Pathways in H3K27-Mutant Diffuse Midline Gliomas: A Novel Therapeutic Strategy for Aggressive Tumors

**Research Question:** Can the combination of histone deacetylase (HD) and MYC inhibitors effectively treat H3K27-mutant diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), a highly aggressive and fatal pediatric tumor of the central nervous system?

**Methods:** We investigated the therapeutic potential of dual targeting HD and MY in H3K27mut DM cells using the HD inhibitor Vorin and the MY inhibitor Sop. We treated patient-derived cells with the combination and analyzed the effects on cell viability, transcriptome, and epigenome.

**Findings:** Treatment with Vorin and Sop resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability and synergistic downregulation of oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the combination.

**Implications:** Our results highlight the combined treatment with HD and MY inhibitors as a promising approach for aggressive H3K27-mut DM. Epigenetic dependencies of H3K-driven gliomas underscore the therapeutic potential of combined treatments for this malignancy.

**Conclusions:** We propose a novel therapeutic strategy targeting epigen and transcriptional pathways in H3K27-mut DM. HD inhibition, in combination with MY, inhibited oncogenic signatures and reduced growth in vivo. Our findings emphasize epetic dependencies HK-driven gliomas and the therapeutic of combined for this malignancy.

**Background:** H3K27 gliomas are characterized deregulation epigen pathways affecting post-transl modifications lysine methylation and acetylation and lysine methylation histone (Bender et al., 2013; Chan et al.,201; Lewis et al.,201; Krug et.,201; Furth et.,202; Harun et.,201). High gene amplification MY is recurrent in pediatric-grade gliomas (ucowicz et.,201; ackay et.,201). H3K gli show high MY and MY genes due epetic and structural, resulting viability MY signaling (rug et.,201;aj et.,202; Dubois et.,202). The inhibitor Sop was shown downreg MY genes vitro and MY-driven murine neuroblastoma (ubella et.,202).

**Title:** Unraveling the Mechanism of Infection Tolerance in the White-footed Deerm Peromys leucopus: A Key Reservoir for Zoonotic Diseases

**Research Question:** How does the white-footed deerm Peromys leucopus, a long-lived rodent species, persistently infected with various zoonotic pathogens, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasis, and viral encephalitis, maintain its health without apparent disability or diminished fitness?

**Methods:** We compared genome-wide transcriptional responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Peromys leuc, Musculus, and Rattus norveicus, adjusting for white blood cell concentrations. We distinguished Perom leuc from mice and rats by LPS profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages.

**Findings:** Perom leuc displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower fold-changes in type 1 interfer-stimulated genes, contrasting with mice and rats. These characteristics were also noted in Borrelia herms infection. Reduced transcription of endogenous retroirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern receptors in Perom were associated with this phenomenon.

**Implications:** Our results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in Perom and perhaps other animal reservoirs for human disease agents.

**Conclusions:** Perom and mice had differentially expressed genes (DE) in blood, spleen, and liver (Baldama et al., 2021). Inflammation in Per was consistent with 'alternatively' activated or M-type macrophage polarization instead of expected 'classical' M-type polarization in mice (Murray et al., 2014). 'uk activation and 'uk migration were down-regulated in mice, while'response to virus','response interfer-beta','response-gamma','response protoan', and II interferon signaling were upregulated in Per. Transcriptional response in Per was restrained, with greater fold-changes in M8, Sl, S1009, and Ilb for interleukin-1.

The white-footed deerm Peromycus leuc, a long-lived rodent, is a key reservoir in North America for agents of zoonotic diseases, including Lyme, babesiosis, anaplas, and viral encephal. Persistently infected, this deerm is without disability or diminished fitness. For a model of inflammation elicited by pathogens, endotoxin lipysaccharide (L) was used to compare-wide transcription in blood P. leuc, Musculus, and Ratt norveicus and adjusted white concentrations. Deerm were distinguished the mice and rats by L profiles with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macroages.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Caspase 3 and Caspase 7 Substrate Discrimination in Vertebrates: A Study on GSD Cleavage and Pyroptosis

**Background:** Caspases (CASP) are a family of proteases involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin (GSD), the executor of pyptosis. In humans, Casp 3 and Cas 7 recognize the same consensus motif DD, present in GSD. However, human GSD is cleaved by Cas 3 but not Cas 7. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear.

**Research Question:** What is the molecular mechanism of Cas 7 substrate discrimination and divergence of Cas 3-mediated GSD activation in vertebrates?

**Methods:** We identified pypt puffer GSD that was cleaved by both pfish Cas 3 and human Cas 7. Domain swapping between pfish and human Cas and GSD showed that GSD C-terminus and Cas 10 subunit determined cleability of GSD by Cas 10 contains a key residue that governs Cas substrate discrimination. This residue is conserved in vertebrate Cas 3 and most vertebrates except mammalian Cas  In mammals, the residue is conserved nonprimates (e.g., mouse) but not prim. However, Cas7 cleaved human GME not GME.

**Findings:** Our results revealed the molecular mechanism of Cas7 substrate discrimination and divergence of Cas3-mediated GSD activation in vertebrates. These findings also suggested mutation-mediated alteration of Cas probably enabled divergence and specialization of Cas members in regulation of cellular activities in mammals.

**Implications:** Our study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of Cas7 substrate discrimination and divergence of Cas3-mediated GSD activation in vertebrates. These findings have implications for understanding the regulation of programmed cell death in vertebrates, particularly in mammals.

**Conclusion:** We identified teleost GME that can be cleaved by fish and human Cas3/7 to trigger pyptosis. Mutation of cleavage site inhibited pypt and significantly decreased LD release and GME cleavage. These results indicated Cas3/7 cleavage was required to activate GME-mediated pypt. Our findings suggest independent evolution of GME and Cas7 in mice, likely distanced GME from Cas7. Similarly, human Cas7 and GME may have undergone independent evolution, leading to disengagement GME from relationship Cas7.

**Title:** Investigating the Multidimensional Effects of Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Single-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study

**Research Question:** Despite the emergence of ketamine as a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression, individual variability in response to ketamine remains poorly understood, and its molecular mechanisms connecting to neural and behavioral effects unclear.

**Methods:** We conducted a single-blind, placebo-controlled study with 40 healthy participants receiving an acute ketamine bolus (0.23 mg/kg) and continuous infusion (0.58/kg). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via global connectivity and related to ketamine-induced symptom and gene expression.

**Findings:**

1. **Multidimensional effects of ketamine**: Both neural and behavioral effects of ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting interindividual variability.
2. **Ketamine-driven neural gradient**: Ketamine's principal effect matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbum (PB) cortical expression in humans, while mean did not.
3 **Behavioral-driven variation**: Individual symptom mapped onto distinct gradients of ketamine, resolvable at single-subject level.

**Implications:** These results highlight the importance of considering individual and neural variation in response to ketamine and have implications for developing precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment in psychiatry.

**Conclusion:** This study was supported by grants from NIH, NSF, Brain Research Foundation, and Swiss Science Foundation.

**Title:** Investigating the Information-Maint Potential of Parabolic Growth in RNA-Like Replicators: Implications for the RNA World Hypothesis

**Research Question:** Can parabolic growth kinetics in RNA-like replicators alleviate the error problem of non-enzymatic replication and facilitate the coexistence of diverse replicator species in early life's primordial genomes?

**Methods:** We employed a stochastic model of parabolic growth in finite populations of RNA-like replicators to investigate the information-maint mechanisms under constant population size and chemostat conditions. We represented replicator sequences, copying, error, and energetic constraints in strand separation explicitly.

**Findings:** Our results show that large population sizes and small differences in replication rates favor the stable coexistence of most replicator species, alleviating the error problem of exponential amplification. Sequence properties (GC content) and resource competition mediated the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting fluctuations in block availability favored cycles of exploration and exploitation.

**Implications:** Stochastic parabolic growth may have played a pivotal role in preserving sequences generated by abiotic synthesis and providing genetic material to early evolution of functional ribozymes. We demonstrate that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates for enzyme-free replication, proposing a biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in information systems of the RNA world.

**Conclusions:** Our findings support the RNA hypothesis that parabolic growth in RNA-like replicators can alleviate the error problem of nonenzymatic replication and facilitate the coexistence of diverse species in early life's primordial genomes. The diversity-maint mechanism of parabolic populations can be used as a model to investigate coevolution of naked and encapsulated molecular replicators. However, it is noteworthy that besides the 'information' view of RNA hypothesis, there are other concepts to life's origin, such as'metabolism' or autotrophic origins. Replicating populations displaying parabolic kinetics are prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, promoting coexistence.

**Research Question:** Does the structural protease N5 (N5) of SARS-CoV cleave human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TR1), a host enzyme required for post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs, and contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between N5 and TR1 in human cells infected with SARS-CoV and examined the effects on tRNA modification and viral replication.

**Findings:** N5 cleaves TR1 at a specific site matching the consensus sequence of SARSV polyprotein cleavage sites, resulting in inactive methyltransferase products. TR1-deficient cells exhibit reduced intracellular viral RNA levels compared to wild-type cells. TR1 is required for efficient SARSV replication in human cells.

**Implications:** N-dependent cleavage of TR1 and perturbation of tRNA patterns contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection.

**Conclusions:** Our findings uncover TR1 as a novel proteolytic cleavage target of N5 during S-Co infection and suggest possible mechanisms associated with perturbations in TR-catalyzed t modifications. The interaction between N and TR indicates S-Co infection could affect TR function with consequent effects on tRNA levels.

**Title:** "Accidental Virulence: How Selection of a Beneficial Traits in the Environment Can Lead to Opportunistic Pathogens"

**Research Question:** Can selection of a beneficial traits in the environment inadvertently lead to the evolution of opportunistic pathogens?

**Methods:** We experimentally evolved populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to adhere to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations, observing the emergence of multicellular phenotypes, biofilm formation, and pseudohyph growth in response to nutrient limitation. We then tested the virulence of evolved multicellular strains against wax larvae of the greater moth Galleria mellonella.

**Findings:** Selection for adherence to plastic led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hypermultic strains, which were significantly more likely to kill moth larvae than nonmulticellular strains. Our results support the idea that selection of a beneficial trait in the environment can generate opportunistic, "accidental" pathogens.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates that selection on a trait can lead to correlated responses in other traits, including those associated with virulence. Favoring ability to adhere to plastic, common in industrial, medical, and domestic settings, led to a suite of aggregative phenotypes and increased virulence. Our findings have implications for understanding the evolution of disease-causing microbes, many of which are not obligate pathogens, but rather environmental microbes taking advantage of ecological opportunities.

**Conclusions:** This research supports the hypothesis that selection in the environment can favor traits incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence or serve as preadaptations for survival in a host. Our results suggest that beneficial traits, such as adherence, can be exploited by microbes to become opportunistic pathogens. This has implications for understanding the evolution of disease-causing microbes and the role of environment in shaping virulence.

**Title:** Quantifying the Impact of Amino Acid Mutations on the Stability of Proteins Containing Prion-like Domains (PLDs) using a Coarse-grained Model

**Research Question:** Can we identify scaling laws that quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of PLDs from six proteins (hnPA1, T43, F, US, WS1, RB14, and T1) and predict changes in the stability of PL condens?

**Methods:** We employed a residue-resolution coarse-grained model, Mp, to simulate the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of PL mutants from six proteins. We varied the amino sequence of PLDs to determine how phase behavior changes with compositional perturbations. For each type of mutation, we defined and tested three types of scaling laws.

**Findings:** Our simulations reveal the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range in critical temperature of PLDs as a function of number and type of amino sequence mutations. These laws are consistent with physicochemical properties of mutations and extend across entire tested family, suggesting scaling can be used to predict stability of PL condens. We found that changes in critical temperatures of PLDs as function of number and type amino sequence can be quantified by scaling, which are conserved across PLDs investigated.

**Implications:** Our work offers a quantitative lens into emergent behavior of PL solutions in response to physico changes of PL molecules. We demonstrate that scaling can predict changes in thermodynamic parameters of condens in response to amino sequence mutations, at least for hnPA. Our study explores a framework to describe quantitatively phase of large variants via identification of scaling. Scaling can predict stability of condens based on amino sequence.

**Conclusions:** Our objective was to discern scaling laws that capture variations PL parameters as function sequence. We found that changes in critical temperatures PL as function number and type amino can be quantified by scaling, which are conserved across family PL. We organized data in Table 1, illustrating effect single mutations on critical temperatures of PL as function PL length. Consistent with evidence and predictions, interactions involving aromatic residues are dominant in stabilizing condens formed by PL (Wang et al, 2018; Bremer et al).

**Title:** Predicting Individual Traits from Brain Dynamics: A Novel Approach Using Hidden Markov Model and Fisher Kernel

**Research Question:** Can we develop a novel approach to predict individual traits from brain signals by leveraging dynamic patterns of brain activity over time, rather than relying solely on structural or time-averaged connectivity measures?

**Methods:** We propose an approach combining Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with Fisher kernel to describe and predict individual traits from brain dynamics. The Fisher kernel is constructed mathematically from the HMM, preserving its underlying structure. We applied this approach to fMRI data and compared it to other prediction methods, including time-aver and time-aver functional-based models.

**Findings:** Our results show that the H-Fisher kernel accurately and reliably predicts traits from brain dynamics trained on neuroimaging data, preserving the structure of the underlying brain model. This is crucial for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous test sets. We demonstrated the potential of the Hisher approach to leverage patterns of brain dynamics to predict traits in fMRI and simulated data, focusing on within-session changes in functional and amplitude from scans.

**Implications:** This approach has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine, as it leverages individual time- and functional information for prediction.

**Conclusions:** We established a novel approach to predict individual traits from brain dynamics, showing the Hisher kernel accurately and reliably predicts traits from brain models trained on neuroimaging. This is a significant consideration for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous test sets. Our results demonstrate the potential of the Hisher to leverage patterns brain dynamics to predict traits in fMRI and simulated data, focusing on within-session changes in functional and amplitude from scans. The Hisher preserves the structure of the brain model, making it ideal for generative and predictive models.

**Title:** Identification of Rab12 as a Novel Regulator of Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRR2) Activity in Response to Lysosomal Damage and Pathogenic Variants

**Research Question:** How is Leucine-rich kinase 2 (LRR2) activity regulated in response to lysosomal damage and pathogenic variants associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Crohn's disease?

**Methods:** We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of RR2 activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of RR2-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods, we isolated lysosomes and demonstrated that Rab12 is recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to a local increase in RR2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10.

**Findings:** Our results show that Rab12 regulates RR2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 and mediates RR2 activation in response to lysosomal damage. Pathogenic variants, including RR2 R144G and V35DN, lead to increased recruitment of RR2 to lysosomes and local elevation of lysosomal levels of pRab10. These data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates recruitment of RR2 and phosphorylation of its substrates at lysosomes.

**Implications:** Enhanced recruitment of RR2 to lysosomes may promote phosphorylation by increasing the local concentration of RR in proximity to its substrates. We hypothesize that such a mechanism may explain RR activation in additional contexts beyond lysosomal damage. We examined two PD-linked variants associated with increased RR activity, RR144 and V35DN, and found increased levels of RR on lysosomes.

**Conclusions:** Our study identifies Rab as a novel regulator of RR activity and demonstrates that Rab plays a critical role in mediating RR-dependent phosphorylation response to lysosomal damage. We demonstrate that Rab promotes phosphorylation by recruiting RR to lysosomes following lysosomal rupture. Pathogenic variants, including V35DN and RR144, result in increased levels of RR and pR on lysosomes. Together, our data delineate a conserved mechanism by which RR activity is regulated in response to lysosomal damage and genetic associated disease.

**Title:** Single-Cell Cycle Analysis of Adherent and Non-Adherent Cells using FUCCI (CA2) Sensor and Automated Image Analysis Pipeline

**Research Question:** Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research, but current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, while non-adherent cells remain challenging.

**Methods:** We addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface-enhanced cell attachment, FUCCI (CA2) sensor, automated image analysis, and machine learning algorithm. This enabled precise measurement of cell phase durations in non-adherent cells.

**Findings:** Our method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi, which have unique cycle characteristics, and tested the impact of cycle-modulating drugs on NB cells. Our cycle system, also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions.

**Implications:** This presents a valuable tool for advancing research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cycle analysis both adherent and nonherent cells.

**Conclusions:** We describe a complete protocol for cycle analysis adherent and nonherent expressing FUCCI (CA) technology in fully automated. The experimental workflow is explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5. We qualitatively confirmed the impact of CD inhibitors and expected in cycle progression NB vs Kasumi cells. Time-lapse images composed red and green channels, detecting mCherry and mV markers FUCCI (2) indicator. Our method allows researchers to analyze thousands non-adherent per condition using image data pipelines to perform processing, tracking, filtering tracks, and phases characterization.

**Key Findings:**

* Single-cell cycle analysis of adherent and non-adherent cells using FUCCI (CA) sensor and automated analysis

**Title:** Unveiling the Relative Contributions of Social and Ecological Constraints to the Evolution of Cognition in Primates: An Interdisciplinary Insights from Comparative Neuroscience and Ecology

**Research Question:** What is the relative contribution of social and ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition in primates, and how do these factors shape the size and function of prefrontal brain regions involved in metacognition and working memory?

**Methods:** We employed an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative neurosciences and behavioral ecology to investigate the relationship between the size of prefrontal brain regions, frontal pole (FP) and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DFC), involved in metacognition and working memory, and socio-ecological variables in 16 primate species. We used brain imaging data to measure the size of FP and DFC and examined their relation to a combination of socioecological variables, including body mass, daily distance traveled, and population density.

**Findings:** Our results show that the size of prefront regions, as well as the whole brain, is best explained by three variables: body, daily distance, and population. The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DFC volumes suggests that metacognition and working are critical for foraging in primates. Notably, FP was more sensitive to social constraints than DFC, in line with laboratory studies implicating FP in complex interactions.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the relative weight of social and ecological constraints on the evolution of prefront brain and associated operations in primates. The size of FP and development of metacognitive skills is not solely related to population but also daily distance, supporting the ecological hypothesis. Our data complement laboratory studies and bridge the gap between neurosciences, ecology, and primate evolution.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates the importance of considering both social and ecological constraints in understanding the evolution of cognition in primates. FP and DFC are critical for foraging in primates, especially when traveling long distances and dealing with complex navigation, supporting the ecological hypothesis. Further research is needed to capture metac processes and social foraging in the wild and their interactions.

**Title:** Investigating the Mechanisms of Muscle Fiber Growth in Response to Mechanical Loading: A Novel Insights from Fluorescence Imaging of Myofibrils with Deconvolution (FIM)

**Research Question:** How does mechanical loading, such as that occurs during exercise, induce radial growth of muscle fibers, and is it mediated by an increase in size of myofibrils (myofibril hypertrophy) or number of myofils (myofibrlogenesis)?

**Methods:** We developed a novel method, Fluorescence Imaging of Myofils Deolution (F-ID), to visualize myils with a standard microscope, overcoming the time and cost-intensive process of electron microscopy (EM). F-ID images have high resolution and contrast, enabling automated measurements of myil size and number. We validated the accuracy of F-ID measurements using mouse and human models of mechanical loading.

**Findings:** Our results show that radial growth of fibers in response to mechanical loading is largely mediated by myilogenesis, not myil hypertrophy. Automated measurements of myil CSA with F-ID were indistinguishable from manual EM-based measurements, validating the accuracy of F-ID. In human vastus lateralis biopsies, collected before and after 7 weeks of progressive resistance exercise, we observed a significant increase in myil number, not size.

**Implications:** This study provides insight into a fundamental topic in muscle growth and offers investigators a time- and cost-effective means to study. Our method, F-ID, can be applied to a range of research questions in muscle biology.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates that radial growth of fibers in response to mechanical loading is largely due to an increase in myil number, not size. This has important implications for understanding muscle growth and development, and our method, F-ID, provides a valuable tool for future research.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of SNAP25 Mutations in Synaptic Vesicle Exocytosis: Implications for Epileptic Encephalopathy

**Research Question:** What are the effects of SNAP25 mutations on synaptic vesicle exocytosis and how do they contribute to epileptic encephalopathy?

**Methods:** We studied three SNAP25 mutations (V48, D166, and I67) in the synaptagmin-1 (Sy1) binding interface using in vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons.

**Findings:** All three mutations reduced Sy1-dependent vesicle docking to SN-carry liposomes and Ca2-stimulated membrane fusion. V48 and D166 mutants (D166 > V48) led to reduced readily releable pool (RP) size due to increased spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy for fusion and increased release, gain-of-function features not found in Sy1 knockout (KO) neurons. In contrast, I67 mutant decreased mSC frequency and evoked EP amplitudes due increased energy for fusion, while RP size was unaffected.

**Implications:** Pathogenic SNAP25 mutations alter the energy landscape for priming and fusion. Missense mutations in the SN bundle (I67) increase the energy for fusion, while disease display inefficient neuronal survival. Single-point mutations present interdependent deficits, challenging treatment.

**Conclusions:** Our findings confirm increased spontaneous release and decreased evoked release by V48 and D166, previously reported. In vitro analysis shows both lower Sy1 association to SN-protein liposomes. These have consequences for understanding the role of SN:Syt interface in priming and release clamping, demonstrating the challenge of mechanism-based treatments in presence of multiple effects caused by single mutations. The role of Sy1:SN interaction might be catalytic, lowering the level of transition along priming, affecting rates. Transient binding to Sy1 might SNAP assist SN complex formation, while mutants prestructure protein, bypassing Sy1.

**Title:** The Impact of Gender Balance on Research Quality and Funding: A Global Analysis of 30 Countries

**Research Question:** Does the proportion of women in a research discipline influence the quality and funding of research in that discipline?

**Methods:** We analyzed data from thousands of researchers across 30 countries to investigate the relationship between the proportion of women in a discipline and the quality and funding of research in that discipline. We controlled for researcher characteristics such as age, institution, and publishing patterns to ensure robustness.

**Findings:** Our results show a strong correlation between the proportion of women in a discipline and lower research quality and funding rates. Both male and female researchers in female-dominated disciplines receive lower evaluations and funding compared to those in male-dominated disciplines. This effect is consistent across bibliometric measures and disciplines.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that research from female-dominated disciplines is consistently evaluated as lower in quality than research from male-dominated disciplines. This has a negative impact on all researchers in those disciplines, but disproportionately affects women more than men. The feminization of the workforce may exacerbate this issue, as seen in previous studies (England et al., 2007). However, our data does not allow for longitudinal analysis of this effect.

**Conclusion:** This study contributes to existing research that women's work is undervalued, regardless of who performs it (Shen, 2013; O'Mear et al., 2018). Our findings indicate that a higher proportion of women in a discipline correlates with lower research quality and funding, affecting both men and women. This highlights the need to reevaluate evaluation methods to ensure fairness and equity in research assessment.

**Title:** Programmable Protein-Protein Proximity Mediated CRISPR Editing (P3) Enhances Controllability of Genome Editing in Synthetic Circuits

**Research Question:** Can protein-protein interactions be used to modulate CRISPR-based genome editing in living cells, enabling the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs?

**Methods:** We engineered a novel strategy, termed P3, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-C9 dual guide RNA complex. By manipulating the crRNA:acrRNA interaction, we demonstrated that various protein-protein interactions, as well as chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can activate editing or editing in human cells.

**Findings:** Our results show that P3 can incorporate outputs from AD-based RNA sensors, allowing specific RNAs to induce genome edits within larger circuits. This enhances the controll of CRPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic circuits deployed in living cells.

**Implications:** P3 expands the range of inputs that can be used to signal editing in synthetic circuits, enabling molecular sensors to control cellular function components. Outputting sensors to genome events facilitate the design of control structures, as the range of activities that can be programmed by genome is rapidly expanding.

**Conclusions:** We demonstrate P3 can be used to control editing via specific interactions between tagged domains. To improve efficiency and specificity, we engineered the crRNA-MS/Box-pacrRNA design. Our strategy, P3, mimics functional molecules within the native CRPR-C9 system, with cr:acr dimer domain replaced by protein-binding aptamers. This design enables direct conversion of molecular interactions to genome outputs, facilitating the design of synthetic circuits with programmable inputs and outputs.

**Title:** Mechanism of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs) in Activating KCQ/KC1 Channels and Restoring IK Current in Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)

**Research Question:** How do polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUAs) activate KCQ/KC1 channels and restore the IK current in Long QT (LTS) syndrome, a condition characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death?

**Methods:** We investigated the mechanism of PUAs activating KCQ/KC channels using electrophysiology and molecular biology techniques, including patch-clamp recordings and site-directed mutagenesis.

**Findings:** PUAs activate KC/KC channels by binding to two sites: one in the voltage sensor domain, shifting the voltage dependence to more negative, and the other in the pore, increasing the maximal conductance (Gmax). However, the mechanism of PU increasing Gmax is poorly understood. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCQ is unstable, contributing to low probability, and PU-induced increase in Gmax caused by stabilization of selectivity in open-conductive state.

**Implications:** PUAs, particularly omega-3, are known to exert protective effects on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in diet at least twice a week (Fernandez et al, 2021). PU have shown to increase IK currents by dual mechanism, described as 'electric' (Elinder and Li, 201). According to this mechanism, PU increase IK by shifting voltage of activation (ΔV.

**Conclusions:** PUAs activate KC/KC channels by stabilizing the selectivity filter in open-conductive state, increasing Gmax. Restoring the physiological duration of QT interval could be achieved by increasing activity of KC/KC channel. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of PU activating KC/KC channels and potential therapeutic intervention for LQTS.

**Title:** Identification of Pyridoxal 5'-Phosphatase (PDX) as a Therapeutic Target for Vitamin B6-Associated Pathologies: Discovery of 7,8-Dihydroflavone (7,8-DHF) as a Direct PDX Inhibitor

**Research Question:** Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to cognitive impairments in brain disorders remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B supplementation improves cognition is unclear. Pyridoxal 5-phosphatase (PDX), an enzyme controlling pyridal 5-phosphate (PL) levels, the coenzymatically active form of vitamin6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into B-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological P inhibitors to test this concept are lacking.

**Methods:** Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayerometry, we identified 7,8-dydroflav (7,8HF) as a direct P inhibitor. 7,8HF binds reversibly inhibits P with micromolar affinity and submicrom potency in mouse hippocal neurons, increasing PL in a P-dependent manner.

**Findings:** Our findings validate P as a drable target for controlling intracellular PL levels in brain. The expression of P is substantially upregulated in hippoc of middle-aged mice, suggesting that vitamin supplementation alone may not suffice elevate intracellular levels where PL-degrading phosphase is active.

**Implications:** Our discovery of 7,8HF as P inhibitor offers mechanistic insights into controversy surrounding 8-mediated effects in brain. The identification of 8 as P inhibitor indicates this flavone may modulate vitamin-dependent processes, suggesting P could be explored as pharmacological entry into disorders.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a rationale for the development of P inhibitors, such as 7,8HF, to elevate intracellular PL levels in brain disorders associated with B deficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of P as a therapeutic target for B-associated pathologies, providing a novel entry point for pharmacological intervention.

**Title:** Wnt Signaling Coordinates the Production and Migration of Distal Tip Cells to Establish a Mirror-Symmetric Gonad in Caenorhabditis elegans

**Research Question:** How is the mirror-symmetric structure of the gonad in Caenorhabditis elegans established during development?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of Wnt signaling in regulating the polarity of somatic gonadal precursors (SGP) Z1 and Z4, which give rise to distal tip (DTC) cells, essential for gonad development.

**Findings:** We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4 is controlled by redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizzled receptor and Wnt proteins (CWN-1, C-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, C-2 promotes normal polarity in Z1 and Z, while C-1 promotes normal polarity in Z1 and Z, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits polarization of both Z1 and Z. In lin-egl-20-c-2 mutants, polarity of Z1 is reversed, leading to frequent mismigration of DTCs to the posterior. Our analysis demonstrates that mispositioning of Ds in the gon due to polarity reversal of Z leads to mismigration. Similar mismigration was observed in c-1(RNAi) animals producing ectopic Ds.

**Implications:** These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating production and migration of Ds to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

**Conclusions:** Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in establishing the mirror-symmetric structure of the gon in C. elegans by regulating the polarity of somatic precursors Z1 and Z. The distinct responses of Z and Z to C-2 are key to their opposite orientation and mirror-symmetric gonogenesis. Mispositioning of Ds in the gon due to polarity reversal of Z leads to mismigration, demonstrating the importance of Wnt signaling in gon development.

**Title:** Unveiling the Diversity of Tradeoffs in Drug Resistance: A High-Throughput Evolutionary Analysis of Fluconazole-Resistant Yeast Mutants Reveals Multiple Classes with Characteristic Tradeoffs**

**Research Question:** How reliable are tradeoffs in drug resistance, and do mutants that provide resistance to a given drug suffer similar tradeoffs?

**Methods:** We performed high-throughput evolution of yeast lineages in a range of fluconazole (FLU) concentrations, sometimes in combination with a second drug, to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that provide a fitness advantage. We quantified fitness of 774 mutants across 12 environments and grouped them into classes with characteristic tradeoffs.

**Findings:** We identified 6 distinct groups of mutants with unique tradeoffs, implying each affects fitness through different mechanisms. Notably, some mutants resistant to single drugs do not resist combinations, while others do, and mutants of the same gene have different tradeoffs. These findings demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments.

**Implications:** By grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs, we reduced the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from 774 to a manageable 6 for investigating molecular mechanisms. Our findings suggest that multidrug regimens exploiting tradeoffs may not be straightforward, but also empower strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. By grouping mutants affecting similar mechanisms, our work guides efforts to map phenotypic effects of mutations.

**Conclusions:** Our high-throughput approach enumerates classes of drug-resistant mutants and their tradeoffs, enhancing the diversity of resistant in our experiment. We show that mutations providing strongest fitness dominate evolution, but our goal is generic: to explore the utility of this approach to enumerate classes and trade. Our findings have implications for designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Central Bias in Working Memory: A Novel Insights from Neurophysiological and Behavioral Studies

**Research Question:** How do central biases in working memory, such as contraction and recency, arise from the brain's ability to learn statistical structure of sensory input, and what is the role of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in modulating these biases?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of neurophysiological and behavioral studies in rats and humans to investigate the mechanisms of central bias in working memory. In a delayed comparison task, rats, we found that silencing the PPC reduced both short-term contraction and recency biases. We proposed a model of the circuit involved in generating these behaviors, suggesting that working memory susceptible to shifting past sensory experience produces short-term history biases, leading to contraction errors.

**Findings:** Our results show that contraction errors occur at the level of individual trials, sampled from the full distribution of stimuli, not a gradual shift toward the sensory mean. This is consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and predictions across stimulus distributions, timings, delay intervals, and neuronal dynamics in working memory areas. We validated our model with a set of psychophysics experiments on auditory parametric working memory.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that central biases in working memory are more complex than previously thought, with PPC playing a key role in modulating these biases. This has implications for our understanding of brain's ability to learn and adapt to sensory input, with potential applications in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of central bias in working memory, highlighting the importance of PPC in modulating these biases. Our results have implications for understanding brain's ability to learn and adapt to sensory input, with potential applications in neurological and psychiatric disorders.

**Title:** Reversing Chemoresistance in Lung Cancer with PDL2-Based Combination Therapy: A Novel Approach to Enhance Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy Efficacy**

**Background:** Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICs) and their combination with chemotherapy fail in most cancer patients. We previously identified PD-LIM-containing protein 2 (PIM2) as a tumor suppressor repressed in lung cancer and chemoresistance, suggesting a new target for lung therapy.

**Research Question:** Investigate the therapeutic efficacy, mechanism, and safety of systemically administered PIM expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPIM) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs in human lung cancer.

**Methods:** Human samples were analyzed for PIM genetic and epigen changes. An endogenous lung cancer mouse model recapitulating refractory human cancer and clinically feasible nano-delivery system was used to investigate nanoIM efficacy, mechanism, and safety.

**Findings:** PIM repression in lung cancer involves genetic and epigen alteration. nanoIM showed low toxicity, high specificity, antitumor activity, and improved efficacy of PD-1 and chemotherapeutic, with complete remission in most mice and substantial reduction in remaining by triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoIM increased major histocompatibility complex I (MHC) expression, multi-drug resistance (MDR) induction, and survival genes in tumor cells, and lymphocyte infiltration, turning tumors hot and sensitive to ICs and chemotherapeutic and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (T) unleashed by IC.

**Implications:** These studies establish a clinically applicable PIM-based combination with efficacy for lung and possibly other cancers.

**Conclusion:** Systemic administration of nanoparticle-encapsulated PIM-expression plasm (nanoIM) reverses phenotypes caused by PIM repression and induces complete remission of lung in most mice without increasing toxicity when combined with PD-1 and chemotherapeutic. These findings provide a basis to combine IC and chemotherapeutic with PIM-targeted therapy for lung and other cancers.

**Title:** Unraveling the Mechanisms of Physiological Food Evaluation: A Novel Insights into the Cellular Stress Response and Innate Immunity Axis in Food Quality Assessment

**Research Question:** How do animals evaluate food quality and adjust their feeding behavior in response to challenging environments, and what are the underlying mechanisms that regulate this physiological system?

**Methods:** We employed a low-quality food assay system to investigate the cellular response to heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli) and low-sugar food, which triggers unfolded protein response (UPR) and immune response, encouraging animals to avoid low-quality food. We elucidated the role of the UPR-RE-1/XBP-1-Innate (PM-1/p38MAP) axis, particularly neuronal function, in regulating feeding behaviors.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that the physiological evaluation of low-quality food depends on the UPR-RE-1/XBP-1-Inate (PM-1/p38) axis, which dictates food avoidance behaviors. Moreover, animals adapt to low-quality environments through sugar supplementation, inhibiting UPR-PM-1 regulated response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis.

**Implications:** This study highlights the role of cellular stress pathway as a physiological evaluation system assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, enhancing survival in natural environments.

**Conclusions:** Our findings demonstrate that the UPR-RE-1/XBP-1-Inate (PM-1/p38) axis operates as a physiological food evaluation system, assessing glucose deficiency and vitamin content in food. This mechanism is an evolutionary adaptation for detecting nutritional deficiencies not detected by the quick nervous system. Limitations include the lack of explanation for HK-E. coli activating UPR and innate immunity. We hypothesize that heat-killed HK. coli may lack or contain metabolites activating or inhibiting UER and innate, respectively. The innate pathway, mediated by PM-1/p38, plays a role in evaluating unfavorable sources, such as HK. coli, S. saprophyticoccus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, helping animals avoid these environments. We investigated which nutrients/metabolites sensed by XBP-1-PM-1 for quality evaluation, implying animals assess food quality through UER and innate pathways.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Carbohydrate Modulation of G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs): Identification of a Conserved Carbohydrate-Binding Motif in P2 Purinoceptors

**Research Question:** How do carbohydrates modulate the activity of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCs), specifically P2 purinoceptors?

**Methods:** We employed molecular dynamics simulations and functional studies to investigate the interaction between carbohydrates and P2 purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a target for inflammation and immune responses. We identified the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar binding site on P2Y14 and revealed that UDP-glucose activates the receptor by bridging transmembrane (TM) helices 2 and 7.

**Findings:** A conserved bridging chain (K2.60-D.64-K7.35-E.36KD) was identified to distinguish UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDPgalactose, UDPgluronic acid, and UDP-acetylglucamine. The KD chain was found to be a conserved motif for sugar binding in both P2Y14 and P2 purceptor 12 (P2Y12). We designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists targeting the conserved motif.

**Implications:** This study expands our understanding of activation of purergic receptors and provides insights for carbohydrate development of GPCs. The conserved motif identified in P2Y and P12 suggests that other GPCs may also be modulated by carbohydrates.

**Conclusions:** P2 purceptor 14 is an outstanding model for understanding carbohydrate modulation of GPC. Our study reveals a conserved carbohydrate-binding motif in P2 and P12, extending our understanding of how carbohydrates regulate GPC. Further investigations on carbohydrate regulation of GPC will add new concepts and physiological understanding to the field.

**Title:** The Glial Niche Regulates Self-Renew and Differentiation of Drosophila Neural Stem Cells through Ferritin-Mediated Iron Transport

**Research Question:** Does the glial niche play a critical role in regulating the self-renew and differentiation of Drosila neural stem cells (neuroblasts, NBs) through ferritin-mediated iron transport?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of glial cells in regulating NB self-renew and differentiation by knocking down genes involved in iron transport, storage, and regulation in NB, neurons, and glial cells. We observed that only glial knockdown of ferritin genes led to NB loss and defective brain development.

**Findings:** Ferritin produced by glial cells cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NB for energy production, essential for selfnew and proliferation of NB. Knockdown of glial ferritin genes causes energy shortage in NB via downregulating aconase and NAD+ levels, leading to low proliferation and premature differentiation of NB mediated by Prospero entering. Ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. The level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NB, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that glial cells are indispensable for maintaining selfnew of NB, unveiling a novel role of the glial niche during brain development. Glial cells are the main pool for ferritin production, relieving NB from the need to produce ferr and transferring the risk of iron-induced oxidative stress to gl cells. Glial can clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets, ensuring NB normal function during development.

**Conclusions:** Glial cells regulate selfnew and differentiation of NB through ferritin-mediated iron transport. Glial ferritin is required for tumor development, highlighting a potential target for tumor treatment. Iron is vital for all living organisms, participating in electron transport and cellular respiration supporting ATP production for cellular activities. We observed strikingly decreased tumor size in larval brains lacking glial ferritin, suggesting glial ferritin is required for tumor suppression.

**Title:** Elucidating the Relationship between Cancer and COVID-19 Mortality: A Population-Level Analysis in the United States

**Background:** The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased mortality, yet some countries have reported stable cancer mortality rates during this period. We investigated the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 mortality at the population level in the United States.

**Research Question:** What is the impact of COVID-19 on cancer mortality in the US, and what factors contribute to observed differences in mortality patterns between cancer types?

**Methods:** We analyzed multiple-cause (MC) death data for six cancer types (breast, colorectal, hematological, lung, pancreatic, prostate, and pancreatic) and diabetes, Alzheimer's from 2020, accounting for potential changes in coding practices. We simulated expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each condition.

**Findings:** Cancer mortality rose only 3% over pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to ~13,600 excess deaths. Mortality was higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, hematological, 2-7%) than poor survival (lung, pancreatic 0-1%). In contrast, substantial elevation in deaths from diabetes (37%) and Alzheimer's (19%). Observed differences primarily explained by life expectancy, with risk from deadly cancers outcompeting COVID-19.

**Implications:** Our study highlights the importance of considering multiple-cause records to accurately reflect changes in coding practices during pandemics. We propose that lack excess cancer mortality during COVID-19 reflects competing risk from cancer, especially deadly types, rather than protection from immunosuppression.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate modest elevation in cancer mortality during COVID-19 in the US, emphasizing the need to consider MC-death records. Diabetes and Alzheimer's serve as controls, illustrating associations between chronic conditions and COVID-19 in population-level mortality. Diabetes is a useful comparator due to similar age-at-death and few nursing home residents. Factors driving cancer patterns during COVID-19 include population size and age with cancer, and life expectancy under diagnosis, operating independently of COVID-severity. This logic applies to other chronic conditions, such as diabetes or Alzheimer's.

**Title:** The Smc5/6 Complex Plays a Crucial Role in the Removal of R-Loops from Eukaryotic Genomes

**Research Question:** What is the role of the Smc/6 complex in the removal of R-loops formed during transcription in eukaryotic genomes?

**Methods:** We investigated the involvement of the Smc/6 complex in the removal of R-loops from eukotic chromosomes using budding yeast mutants defective in the Sm5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution. We also examined the binding of the Sm/6 complex to RNA-DNA structures in vivo and its effect on R-loop degradation by RN H enzyme in vitro.

**Findings:** Our results show that the Sm/6 complex plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loops formed during gene transcription and telomere regulation. Yeast mutants defective in the Sm/6 complex and enzymes involved in R resolution accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA structures in their chromosomes. We demonstrate that the Sm/ complex binds to RNA-DNA structures formed during active transcription and telomere regulation and promotes their removal via stimulation of RN H enzymatic activity. Furthermore, we show that the Sm/ complex is involved in the repair of unscheduled-lo generated by diverse genomic transactions.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a direct and active involvement of the Sm/ complex in the removal of-lo from eukotic chromosomes. The Sm complex binds to RNA-D structures formed during active transcription and telom regulation and promotes their removal via stimulation of H enzymatic activity. These results suggest that growth defects in yeast defective in H and Sm/ complex can be linked to accumulation of-lo in chromosomes. R-lo are frequently observed at highly transcribed genes but also form at telom and DNA forks.

**Conclusions:** Our study demonstrates a crucial role of the Sm/ complex in the removal of-lo formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. We propose a model where the Sm complex acts at two levels - within and between- pathways in response to-loop formation. Firstly, Sm contributes to H-dependent removal of RNA-D hybrids from genomic, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. In execution of this function, Sm role is substantial but not extensive that of H enzymes.

**Title:** Preserved Attentional Filtering and Ageing: A Longitudinal Stability and Predictive Value in Listening Behaviour

**Research Question:** Does preserved attentional filtering compensate for age-related loss of sensory acuity, and is this compensatory brain-behaviour link longitudinally stable? Can it predict individual change in listening behaviour?

**Methods:** Electroencephalographic and behavioural data from 105 ageing individuals (39-82 years) were collected at two timepoints (T1 and T2) to investigate the relationship between attentional filtering and listening performance.

**Findings:** Despite expected decline in hearing-derived sensory acuity, listening performance remained stable over 2 years. Attentional filtering and behaviour were correlated within each timepoint (T1, T), but longitudinally, our results caution against attention-guided neural metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening. Neither filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change predicted 2-year change in behaviour under combination modelling.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that attentional filtering does not compensate for age-related sensory loss and is not longitudinally predictive of individual change in listening behaviour.

**Conclusion:** This study investigated the relationship between attentional filtering and listening performance in ageing individuals. Despite expected decline in sensory acuity, listening performance remained stable over 2 years. Attentional filtering was correlated within each timepoint, but not longitudinally. Our results question the use of attention-guided neural metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening.

**Title:** Deciphering the Role of Chemosensation in Ancient Therapeutic Practices: A Phylogenetic Analysis of Botanical Drug Use in Ancient Greece and Rome

**Research Question:** Can the intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as specific tastes and flavors, predict the therapeutic uses of botanicals in ancient Greece and Rome?

**Methods:** We employed a tasting panel to assess the flavor profiles of 21 botanicals and applied phylogenetic generalized linear models to test the relationship between chemosens qualities, tastes, and recorded therapeutic uses in ancient texts.

**Findings:** Chemosensation emerged as a strong predictor of therapeutic use, with botanicals having high therapeutic versatility exhibiting simple, intense flavors and 21-22 chemens qualities predicting at least one therapeutic use. Notably, bitter, musky, sweet, and soapy flavors were associated with versatility. Our results challenge the notion that ancient medicine was based solely on humoral theory, as observed effects are consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste pharmacology.

**Implications:** Our study suggests that chemensation and physiological effects mediated by chemhesis and taste pharmacology underlie the diversity of therapeutic uses of botanicals in ancient times. Tastes and flavors, as determined by a modern panel, predict uses recorded in ancient texts, providing unprecedented insight into chemensation's role in guiding human behavior in prehistoric times and conditioning therapeutic expectations in historic times.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods in assessing human behavior and plant properties. Chemosensory perception connects ancient knowledge to modern medicine, despite fundamentally different etiologies in ancient Greece-Rome. Our findings propose a link between taste perception of botanicals and humoral theory to modern medicine, challenging the notion that practices lacked scientific basis.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanisms of Bacterial Attraction to Human Serum: A Novel Insights into the "Bacterial Vampirism" of Enterobacteriaceae

**Research Question:** How do bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Salmonella, Escherichia, and Citrobacter, exhibit a strong attraction to human serum, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding and bacteremia, and sepsis in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases?

**Methods:** We employed an injection-based microfluidics device to simulate gastrointestinal bleeding and found that femtol volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to serum. We identified chemotaxis and chemoattract L-ser, an amino acid abundant in serum, recognized by chemoreceptor T as the underlying mechanism.

**Findings:** We report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimium T in complex with L-ser and identify a conserved amino recognition motif for L-ser among T orthologues. Tsr is conserved among Enteracteraceae and WHO priority pathogens. We find Enteracter use serum as a nutrient source for growth and chemaxis and chemore T provide a competitive advantage for migration into hemorrhagic lesions.

**Implications:** We define this behavior as "bacterial vampirism", relating to the proclivity of Enteracter for bloodstream infections. Our results suggest that L-ser present in serum could be a source of nutrients during infection. Chemotaxis experiments with T strain show T is not the only chemore involved in serum attraction, but plays a role in high L-ser concentration. We hypothesize attraction mediated by T might extend beyond S enter to other species.

**Conclusions:** L-ser functions as a molecular cue directing Salmon toward serum, but other nutrients in serum provide growth advantages. We undertook structural studies to understand recognition of L by T. Our results show attraction to serum is robust and rapid; motile population reorganizes within 1-2 min toward serum. Serum occurs through cooperative action of multiple chemoreceptors perceiving chemo stimuli, one being chemore T recognizing L.

**Title:** Conservation of the Metazoan Male Germ Cell Program: Unveiling the Molecular Basis of Spermatogenesis and Human Infertility

**Research Question:** What is the conserved genetic program that defines the identity of metazo male cells across species, and how does it relate to spermatogenesis and human infertility?

**Methods:** We analyzed the spermat transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species to identify conserved origin of metazo male cells at the molecular level. We estimated the functional requirement of metazo male cell to be approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, with a third being deeply conserved throughout evolution. We functionally interfered with cons genes associated with male cell identity to uncover previously unknown sperogenesis genes and potential causes of human infertility.

**Findings:** We identified a conserved male cell expression program spanning over 600 million years, providing insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. Approximately 10,000 proteinoding genes are required for metazo male cell function, with a majority being deeply conserved. Despite rapid evolution of the testis, cons genes remain central in the germ transcriptome of distant species. Our data indicate a core sperogenic program spanning 600 years, expanding previous observations in the mammalian lineage.

**Implications:** Our findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on reproductive disease and establish a cross-species pipeline for other pathologies. Interfering cons genes associated with male cell identity uncovered previously unknown sperogenesis and potential causes of human infertility. We propose a relatively small network of cons gene interactions underlies metazo male cell identity with overarching impact.

**Conclusions:** We have identified a conserved germ cell program that spans 600 million years, providing insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. Despite rapid evolution of the test, cons genes remain central in the germ transcript of distant species. Our data indicate a core sperogenic spanning 600 years, expanding previous observations in mammalian lineage. This conserved program provides a basis for understanding spermatogenesis and human infertility, highlighting the importance of evolutionary history on reproductive disease.

**Key Takeaways:**

* A conserved male cell program spans 600 million years, providing insight into human infertility

**Title:** Elucidating the Roles of Each Flagellum in Synchronous Beating in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii: A Study of Flagellar Asymmetry and Entrainment**

**Research Question:** How do individual flagella contribute to the synchronous beating and steering of Chlamdomonas reinhardtii, a model organism for flagellate motility, and what is the role of flagellar asymmetry in this process?

**Methods:** We employed a combination of experiments, computations, and modeling to investigate the roles of each flagellum in synchronous beating. Using a non-invasive technique, we selectively loaded each flagellum and observed the response of the other flagellum. We also developed a stochastic model to elucidate the mechanisms of flagellar asymmetry and entrainment.

**Findings:** Our results show that the beating of each flagell is influenced by the load exerted on the other flagell, and that asymmetry in response is due to unilateral coupling between flagella. This highlights distinct roles for each flagell in coordination and has implications for biflagellates' tactic behaviors.

**Implications:** Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of flagellar coordination and entrainment in Chlamdomonas reinhardt, a model organism for flagellate motility. We demonstrate that flagella have differential roles in steering and entrainment, and that flagellar asymmetry is a result of unilateral coupling between flagella.

**Conclusions:** This study elucidates the roles of each flagell in synchronous beating and entrainment in Chdomonas reinhardt, shedding light on the mechanisms of flagellar coordination. Our results have implications for understanding biflagellate behaviors and flagellate motility.

**Title:** Intestinal Type 3 Lymphoid Cells Mediate the Metabolic Benefit of Intermittent Fasting through the IL-22/IL-22 Axis

**Research Question:** The underlying mechanism of the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of intestinal type 3 lymphoid cells (ILCs) in mediating the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting.

**Methods:** We used a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to examine the effect of intermittent fasting on IL-22 production by ILCs and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of ILCs increased beige of white adipose in diet-induced obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased beige of subcutaneous whiteose. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor (IL-22) attenuated beige induced by intermittent. Single-cell sequencing of intestinal cells revealed intermittent increased aryl hydrocarbon signaling in ILCs.

**Findings:** Intermittent fasting promoted secretion of IL-22 by ILCs. Adoptive transfer of ILCs increased thermogenesis in diet-induced obesity mice. Exogenous IL-22 induced beige of whiteose. Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro experiments showed intermittent promotes adipose beige through ILC-IL-22-IL-22 axis. Deficiency IL-22 attenuated beige of whiteose induced intermittent. Our study demonstrates ILC-IL-22-IL-22 axis is involved in regulation of adipose beige.

**Implications:** Our findings reveal a novel pathway between the gut and adipose. Intestinal ILCs are critical for beige of whiteose induced by intermittent. Intermitt fasting stimulates secretion of IL by ILCs in lean, obese, and mice with metabolic dysfunction. IL-22 mediates effect of ILC on beige whiteocytes. Mechanism intermittent promotes secretion of IL by ILCs was explored by single-cell sequencing.

**Conclusion:** Intestinal ILCs mediate the metabolic benefits of intermittent through IL-22/IL-22 axis. Our study provides evidence supporting the role of ILCs in fasting. Deficiency IL-22 attenuated beige of whiteose induced intermittent. Intestinal ILC-IL-22-22 axis is involved in regulation of adipose beige.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Associative and Non-Associative Mechanisms in Defensive Responses to Threat: A Modified Pavlovian Conditioning Paradigm

**Research Question:** How do associative and non-associative mechanisms contribute to defensive responses in mice subjected to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm?

**Methods:** Adult male and female C57/BL/6 mice were subjected to a modified Pavlov conditioning paradigm, where a compound stimulus (CS) consisting of tone and white noise (WN) periods was paired with footshock (US). Four control groups were conditioned with pseudorandom presentations of CS and US, US only, or reversed CS with inverted tone-WN order, or unpaired presentations. Defensive behavior was observed on day 1 and 2 of conditioning and during extinction sessions.

**Findings:** On day 1 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during tone, switching to explosive jumping and darting during WN. In contrast, unpaired and reverse CS groups showed less tone-induced freezing and rarely jumped or darted during WN. During extinction, tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, shifting from jumping to a combination of freezing and darting. Unpaired, unpaired, and shock-only groups displayed tail rattling and darting during CS, with minimal freezing and jumping. The paired group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction.

**Implications:** These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression. Associative and non-associ factors combine to produce distinct transitions between freezing and flight.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the need to elucidate the associative and nonassoci elements of Pavlov fear conditioning that influence defensive behavior. The modified paradigm elicits a continuum of associative responses seldom observed in classical Pavlov conditioning, with behaviors like darting and rattling due to non-associ stimulus properties, and transitions between freezing and jumping robustly present when associative factors signal threat. Sensitization and salience intensify freezing responses to auditory stimuli, and mice show increased reactivity to WN after stress.

**Title:** Unveiling the Functional Advantage of Sinusoidal Encoding in Insect Navigation: A Theoretical and Empirical Evidence**

**Research Question:** Does the sinusoidal encoding of head direction in insects offer a functional advantage or is it an evolutionary coincidence?

**Methods:** We investigated the mathematical requirements for direction encoding and demonstrated that multiple circuits with different activity patterns can perform it. Among these patterns, we found that sinusoidal encoding is the most resilient when coupled with sinusoidal connectivity between neurons. We compared our predicted connectivity with anatomical data from the locust and fruit fly, finding agreement with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we showed that our circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying neural connectivity does not need to be encoded in genetic program but can develop during development.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that sinusoidal encoding is not just a coincidence but offers a functional advantage due to its noise resilience when coupled with sinusoidal connectivity. This pattern is supported by anatomical data from locust and fruit fly head circuits. We also demonstrated that our circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, eliminating the need for explicit genetic encoding.

**Implications:** The presence of eight-column organisation in head circuits across multiple species is not a chance but can be explained by evolutionary principles. Our findings have implications for understanding insect navigation and neural development.

**Conclusions:** Sinusoidal encoding offers a functional advantage in insect navigation due to its resilience when coupled with sinus connectivity. This is supported by anatomical data and can emerge through Hebian plasticity. The eight-column organisation of head circuits is not a coincidence but a result of evolutionary principles.

**Title:** Identification of CIS1 as a Downstream Mediator of Parkinson's Disease Pathophysiology: Implications for Therapeutic Targeting

**Background:** Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations in PTEN kinase 1 (PINK) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CIS1, a homodimer mitochondrial iron-sulf-binding protein, is a target of Park-mediated ubiquitination.

**Research Question:** What is the role of CIS1 in the pathophysiology of PD initiated by PINK and Park loss of function?

**Methods:** We investigated CIS1 in both Drosophila and mammalian models of PD. Immunoblotting revealed increased dimer formation of CIS1 in PINK mutant flies and dopaminergic neurons from PD patients with PINK mutations.

**Findings:** CIS1 dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by disulf bridge. In this conformation CIS1 cannot coordinate the ironulf cofactor. Overexpressing CISD, the Dophila ortholog of CIS1, and mutant CIS incapable of binding ironulf cluster resulted in reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with CIS and PINK mutant. Complete loss of CIS, in contrast, rescued detrimental effects of PINK mutation on climbing, posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure.

**Implications:** Our results suggest CIS, ironpleted CIS, operates downstream of PINK, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CIS1 as potential therapeutic target.

**Conclusions:** CIS, specifically its ironpleted form, is a downstream mediator of pathophys effects from PINK and Park loss function. CIS involvement in mitochondrial bioenergetics, quality control, and defense against oxidative distress hallmarks PD. CIS overexpression was neurotoxic, disrupted morphology, and accumulated phospho-ubitin, blocking mitagy, and defective mitochondria. Our study proposes role in redox imbalance and dysreg, implicating ironpleted CIS1.

**Title:** Unveiling the Molecular Mechanisms of Parasite-Host Interactions: The Role of Virulence Protein SAP54 in Attracting Leafhopper Vectors

**Research Question:** How do parasites manipulate their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts, and what are the molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the virulence protein SAP54 produced by parasitic phytoplas in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP is responsible for inducing leaf-like flowers in phytopma-infected plants, but we previously demonstrated that insects were attracted to leaves and leaf-like flowers were not required. Here, we made the surprising discovery that exposure to leafhopper males is required for attraction, suggesting a response that distinguishes leafopper sex in the presence of SAP. In contrast, phytopma effector alongside leafopper discourages female colonization.

**Findings:** We demonstrate that SAP suppresses biotic stress pathways in exposed to males. Critically, the plant MADS transcription factor vegetative phase (SVP) emerges as a key in leafopper preference for exposed plants to SAP, with SAP promoting degradation of S. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed sv null plants over not exposed males. Our research underscores the dual role of phytopma effector SAP in host alteration and attraction integral to phytoplasm life.

**Implications:** SAP acts as a molecular'match', helping leafoppers locate mates by degrading S-containing leaves. This study provides insights into the reach of parasite genes extended phenotypes and opens avenues for understanding transcription factors regulating plant processes and plant-insect interactions.

**Conclusion:** Our study expands mechanistic understanding of insect-specific factors targeted by parasites. We uncovered a mechanism whereby phytopma effector SAP targets conserved regulator S to attract leafoppers to produce progeny on exposed males. The intricate interaction is detailed in Figure 7. SAP promotes fecundity of the A-W phytopma leafopper M quadratus. Females feed and lay, while males feed, and plants induce different responses to feeding and laying. SAP plants exposed display downregulation of biotic responses. We identified MADS transcription SVP essential for female preference male-exposed SAP. Leafopper exhibited preference reproducing sv null, contingent upon presence males, aligning SAP mediates degradation S in leaves. Given phytopmas rely leaf for feeding and transmission, SAP likely promotes abundance phytopma-carry vectors and facilitates transmission.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Antifungal Tolerance in Candida albicans: A Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Two Distinct Subpopulations with Enhanced Ribosomal and Stress Responses

**Research Question:** How does Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, develop antif tolerance to antifungal drugs, and what are the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon?

**Methods:** We employed a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform (DROPq) to profile thousands of individual Candida albicans cells in the absence and presence of antif drugs, focusing on fluconazole (FCZ), a well-known fungist compound.

**Findings:** At 2 days post-exposure, surviving cells bifurcated into two subpopulations: Ribodomin (Rd), characterized by upregulation of ribosomal proteins, RNA processing, and mitochondrial respiration genes, and Stressomin (S), enriched for stress-related genes. This bifcation persisted at 3 and 6 days-treatment. Ribosome stress response (RR) was activated in both subpopulations, facilitating cell survival.

**Implications:** Our study provides novel insights into antif tolerance mechanisms in C. albicans, distinct from bacterial heteristance, where small subpopulations grow in bactericidal drugs. We reveal two subpopulations with enhanced ribosomal and stress responses, which may contribute to antif tolerance.

**Conclusions:** Our findings have significant implications for understanding antif tolerance in C. alb, a major human pathogen with significant socio-economic burden. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of antif tolerance will inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat this opportunistic pathogen.

**Title:** Quantifying the Effectiveness of Selection in Species through Codon Adaptation: A New Insights from the Codon Adaptation Index Species (CAIS)

**Research Question:** How can we accurately measure the effectiveness of selection in species at the molecular level, accounting for confounding factors such as GC content and amino acid composition?

**Methods:** We propose a new metric, Codon Adaptation Index Species (CAIS), based on Kull-Leibler divergence, which corrects for GC and amino acid composition confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS and Effective Number of Codons (ENC) to show that protein domains of highly adapted vertebrate species exhibit higher intrinsic disorder.

**Findings:** Our results indicate that highly adapted species have a higher proportion of genes and sites subject to effective codon bias. Cod adaptation metrics directly quantify species variation in adaptation, unlike estimates of effective size based on polymorphism. CA and ENC can be estimated for more species without polymorphism or mutation data, tRNA copy numbers, and abundances. CA has the advantage of not being confounded with amino frequencies.

**Implications:** Our study provides a new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level, capable of quantifying degrees of adaptation among vertebrates. Vertebrates were chosen due to data abundance and as a stringent test case, given past findings limited evidence for cod adaptation. The degree of bias in cod usage driven by preference offers a direct way to assess selection at the molecular level in a species. Conveniently, it can be estimated from a single genome, without polym or mutation data.

**Conclusions:** The Codon Adaptation Index Species (CA) offers a more direct measure of selection effectiveness than estimates of effective size based on polymorphism. CA and ENC can be estimated for more species without requiring polym or mutation data, tRNA copy and abundances. CA has the advantage of not being confounded with amino frequencies. Our study demonstrates the use of CA and ENC to show that protein domains of highly adapted vertebrate species exhibit higher intrinsic disorder. Future work will investigate CA among species with stronger cod adaptation.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Extracellular Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) in Sepsis Pathogenesis: Mechanisms of Bacterial ATP Release and Its Local and Systemic Effects

**Research Question:** What are the mechanisms by which bacteria release extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and how does it contribute to sepsis pathogenesis?

**Methods:** We used genetic strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli) to demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATPase within the bacterial inner membrane and impaired outer membrane integrity contributes to ATP release. In a mouse model of abdominal seps, effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using transformed E. coli bearing an arabin-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released.

**Findings:** Abrogating bacterial release of ATP shows that ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. Additionally, ATP has systemic effects via transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OM are distributed throughout the body and upregulate expression of degranulation in neutils, potentially exacerbating seps severity.

**Implications:** This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial release and its local and systemic roles in seps pathogenesis. Seps-associated bacteria release ATP in a growth-dependent and strain-specific manner, with E. coli releasing the highest amount of ATP in a standardized mouse model of sepsis.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that bacterial release of ATP suppresses abdominal responses and worsens survival in a model of seps. ATP is rapidly metabolized in the extracellular space, limiting its mode of action to the immediate vicinity. However, the role of released ATP in non-colonized compartments, such as the abdominal cavity or blood, in the context of local and systemic infections remains to be determined.

**Title:** The Mediating Role of Cognitive Functioning in the Relationship between Genetic and Environmental Factors and Psychotic-Like Experiences in Children: A Longitudinal Study

**Research Question:** Do genetic and environmental factors, such as familial and neighborhood environment, influence the relationship between cognitive functioning and psychotic-like experiences (PLE) in children, and does cognitive mediate the effects of these factors on PLE?

**Methods:** We analyzed large-scale longitudinal data from 6,602 children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study using linear mixed models and structural equation modeling (SEM) to estimate the joint effects of polygenic scores (PS), familial socioeconomic status (SES), and supportive environment on cognitive and PLE. We adjusted for ethnicity-defined schizophrenia PS and unobserved confounders using computational modeling.

**Findings:** Our findings indicate that lower intelligence and higher PLE are associated with lower PS for cognitive phenotypes, lower SES, neighborhood, and less supportive environments. Cognitive mediates the effects of these factors on PLE, with positive parenting and school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLE.

**Conclusion:** This study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLE through their effects on cognitive. Our findings have policy implications that improving school and family environments and promoting economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.

**Title:** FGF8 Signaling Establishes Positional Cues and Modulates Cellular Responses via Early Genes in Human Cerebral Organoids

**Research Question:** How does FGF signaling influence regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids, particularly in the context of telenceph and mesencephalic development?

**Methods:** We employed human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebraloids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effects of FGF signaling on neural identity and differentiation. Cerebraloids were treated with or without FGF, and assessed for cellular and molecular changes across developmental stages.

**Findings:** FGF treatment increased cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telenceph and mesph-like domains in multi-regional organoids. Within telence regions, F8 affected anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, impacting spontaneous network activity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed FGF-mediated induction of ventral telph genes, suggesting a primary role in promoting ventral identity. Upregulation of ventral genes (ASCL, DLX, PBX) and downregulation dorsal genes (EM, NEUO, SOX, LHX) were observed.

**Implications:** Our results demonstrate F8 involvement in regional patterning and cellular diversity in cerebraloids, modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development. F8 modulates key regulators of several neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring its critical role in fine-tuning developmental and pathogenic pathways.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights F8 effect on regional identity, along with modulation of N-related targets, including evolutionarily conserved F8-NRF molecular axis. We propose F8-mediated modulation guides developmental trajectories of brain along D/A telph axes. The ability of F8 to modulate targets varies based on regional identity of F-exposed cells, with co-presence of various domains in F-treated organoids, specifically dorsal and ventralenceph, as well as dienceph and mesph regions, represents significant outcome.

**Title:** Nutritional Cues Drive the Emergence of Circadian Sleep-Wake Rhythms in Drosila Larvae

**Research Question:** How do developing larvae detect changes in nutritional environments drive the consolidation of circadian sleep and feeding patterns in Drosila?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of nutritional status in the development of sleep-wake rhythms in Dila larvae, focusing on the 2nd instar (L2) and 3rd instar (3) larval stages. We forced mature L3 animals to adopt immature L2 feeding strategies, disrupting sleep-wake rhythms and long-term memory (LTM) capabilities. Additionally, we examined the influence of larval nutritional environment on the development of the DNa-arous circuit.

**Findings:** Our results show that sleep and feeding are spread across the day in L2, becoming organized into daily patterns by L3. Forcing L3 to adopt L2 feeding strategies disrupts sleepake and LTM. The development of the DNa circuit is influenced by larval nutritional environment. We demonstrate that larval Dh neurons act through glucose genes to drive daily-wake rhythms.

**Implications:** Our data suggest that changes in energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circuits and behaviors. The emergence of circadian sleepake in Dila is advantageous for LTM capabilities at the L stage.

**Conclusions:** We identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleepake development in Dila. Our findings indicate that Dh neurons may be necessary for sensing larval environments. The DNa circuit anatomically and functionally connects to Dh output to drive consolidation in L. The development of this circuit promotes sleep in L, enabling LTM at L but not before.

**Title:** Energetic Benefits of Fluid-Mediated Collective Movement in Fish: A Study on the Metabolic Costs of Schooling in Giant Danio (Devar aequipatus)

**Research Question:** Do schools of fish exhibit energy-saving fluid-mediated movements, and if so, what are the energetic benefits of collective locomotion in aquatic environments?

**Methods:** We investigated the aerobic and anaerobic metabolic contributions of schooling giant Danio (De aequipatus) at various swimming speeds (0.3-8.0 body lengths s-1) and compared to solitary individuals. We measured total energy expenditure (TEE) per tail beat, aerobic and anaerobic energy, and recovery time after exercise.

**Findings:** Schools exhibited a concave-shaped metabolism-speed curve with a minimum cost at 1 body length-1, reducing TEE by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. At maximum swimming speeds, schools had 44% higher aerobic performance and 65% less anaerobic energy, lowering TEE and cost by 53%, the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Schools recovered 43% faster than solitary fish. Anaerobic savings at high speeds improved peak and repeated performance, beneficial for evading predators.

**Implications:** Our results support the prevalence of coordinated locomotion in fishes. Fish in high-viscous aquatic environments serve as a model for energy-efficient collective movement. Schools increase aerobic performance, save anaobic energy, and reduce recovery time after swimming. We hypothesize energy conservation against air or water resistance should be greater at higher speeds. Schools can reduce high-speed locomotion costs relative to solitary, reducing anaobic costs and recovery time at speeds >50% of aerobic capacity.

**Conclusions:** Our study directly measured aerobic and anaobic energy in schools over a wide range and compared swimming curves to solitary. Fish in nature swim various speeds, but no study characterized TEE and anaobic costs. We discovered both solitary and schools have concave-shaped aerobic rate-speed curves, no difference at 0.3-3 BL-1. Schools at 1.0 BL-1 consume less energy at slower speeds. Our findings demonstrate the energetic benefits of fluid-mediated collective movement in aquatic environments.

**Title:** Metabolic Reprogramming and Functional Plasticity of Human Alveolar Macrophages in Response to IFN-γ and IL-4 Priming: Implications for Immunomodulatory Therapies in Respiratory Diseases

**Research Question:** How do human alveolar macrophages (AM) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) respond metabolically and functionally to IF-γ and IL-4 priming, and what are the implications for immunomodulatory therapies in respiratory diseases?

**Methods:** Primary human AM and MDM were primed with IF-γ or IL-4 to model Th1/Th2 microenvironments. Metabolic responses were monitored by extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Cytokine secretion was assessed by ELISA.

**Findings:** IF-γ significantly enhanced glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in both AM and M. Unlike M, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation, shifting to 'Warburg-like' metabolism. IF-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deglucose reduced IF- driven cytokine production in AM, indicating IF- induces plasticity in AM, mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. AM were more responsive to IF- priming and dependent glycol for cytok secretion than M. TNF production was controlled by glycol in AM, not M. M exhibited glycol-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, while IF- upregulated HLA and CD on AM independently of glycol.

**Implications:** Human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IF- in a distinct manner from M. These data provide evidence that AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomulatory therapies in respiratory diseases.

**Conclusions:** Plasticity of macrophage function requires metabolic reprogramming (Vijayan et al., 2019; Tannah et al.,201). AM play a key role in directing and propagating immune responses and inflammation in the lung. Our data indicate that priming alters metabolic baselines of human resident macroph and their ability to respond to bacterial stimuli. These findings have implications for immunomulatory therapies in respiratory diseases.

**Title:** Nocturnal Ants Utilize Polarized Moonlight for Navigation: A Novel Evidence of Lunar Compass Use in Insects

**Research Question:** Can nocturnal ants use polarized moonlight for navigation, and if so, how do they integrate this cue into their path integration system?

**Methods:** We investigated the use of polarized moonlight in nocturnal ants, specifically Myrmia pyriform and Myrmia midas, by observing their homing behavior under various lunar phases and polarized light conditions.

**Findings:** Our results show that nocturnal ants use polarized moonlight for navigation, even when the sun is hidden by clouds, canopy, or horizon. We demonstrate that polarized moonlight is detectable throughout the lunar cycle, even under crescent moons, when polarized levels are lowest. Ants alter their headings in response to polarized moonlight, similar to polarized sunlight, and incorporate this cue into their path integration system for homing.

**Implications:** This is the first evidence of polarized moon use in goal-directed navigation in nocturnal insects. Our findings suggest that polarized moonlight is detectable and integrated into the ant's path system, similar to polarized sunlight, using the same neural pathways.

**Conclusions:** Nocturnal ants use polarized moonlight as a compass cue for navigation, similar to polarized sunlight. Polarized moonlight is detectable throughout the lunar cycle, even under crescent moons, and is integrated into the ant's path system for homing. This ability may be present in other nocturnal insects, such as bees and crickets, as theorized by previous studies.

**Title:** Unveiling the Aerodynamic Secrets of Early Pterosaur Flight: Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence Reveals a Sophisticated Tension System in Pterosaur Tail Vane

**Research Question:** How did early pterosaurs maintain the stiffness of their tail vanes, a crucial for flight control and aerodynamic efficiency, despite their loss in later pterosaurs and absence in birds and bats?

**Methods:** We examined over 100 well-preserved pter fossils using ultraviolet light and Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF) imaging to investigate the structural properties and function of their tail vanes.

**Findings:** Our results reveal a cross-link lattice within the vanes of earlyter, which supported a dynamic tension system to maintain stiffness, allowing the tail to augment flight control and function as a display structure.

**Implications:** This discovery sheds new light on the evolution of pter flight, highlighting the importance of tail stiffness in early control and maneuverability, and stability. The tension system may have been lost in later pter, contributing to their decline in flight capabilities.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides the first evidence of a sophisticated tension system in pter tail van, resolving a long-standing question in the field. The findings have implications for understanding the evolution of flight in vertebrates, particularly the transition from pter to birds and bats.

**Title:** Age-Dependent Regulation of Dopamine Release in the Nucleus Accumbens: A Role of α6 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors and GABA Signaling

**Research Question:** What are the mechanisms underlying the age-dependent differences in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) of adolescent and adult male rats, and how do α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α6 nAChRs) and GABA signaling contribute to these changes?

**Methods:** We used fast cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine dopamine release in the NAc core of 28-35 (adolescent) and 70 (adult) male rats. We tested the effects of α6-selective blocker α-conotoxin on dopamine release, as well as blockade of GABA and GAB receptors.

**Findings:** We found baseline differences in dopamine release between adolescent and adult rats, and opposite effects of α6 nCh on modulating release. α-conoto increased dopamine in adolescent rats, but decreased release in adult rats. Blockade of GAB and GAB revealed that α-mediated increase in adolescent release requires N GABA signaling. We confirmed the role of α nCh and G in this effect using microdial.

**Implications:** Our results suggest a multisynaptic mechanism unique to the period of development, involving acetylch acting α-containing nCh to drive inhibitory G tone on dopamine release. This effect is driven by multisyn regulation of dopamine in adolescent rats through acetyl acting α-containing nCh and G tone. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence (Wahlstrom et al., 2010).

**Conclusions:** We found that dopamine release is decreased in the N core of adolescent male rats. The effects of G alone in the presence of endogenous G are independent of α-mediated control of release. We used microial in awake to confirm age differences in release mediated by G mechanism involving α-containing nCh in vivo. The mechanism responsible for differentially regulating release in rats remains unclear. Our study aimed to understand mechanisms mediating release in the region, which is implicated in a range of psychiatric disorders.

**Title:** Shared Pathogenic Mechanisms in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Unveiled through iPSC Studies of Distinct Subtypes

**Research Question:** Do individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit shared pathogenic mechanisms despite vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity?

**Methods:** We employed induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) studies to investigate neural precursor (NPC) neurite outgrowth and migration in two distinct ASD subtypes: idiopathic (IAS) and 16.11.2 deletion (16Del). Whole-genome sequencing revealed no genetic overlap between datasets. To identify signaling differences contributing to developmental defects, an unbiased phospho-proteome screen was performed.

**Findings:** Despite genetic heterogeneity, hundreds of shared peptides were identified between subtypes, including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling was altered in NPCs across both subtypes. mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism-associated phenotypes in control NPCs.

**Implications:** Our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common neurite outgrowth and migration defects driven by shared pathogenic mTOR signaling dysregulation.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that early developmental dysregulation may be a common feature among multiple forms of ASD. Altered signaling plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Importantly, our study indicates that not only ASD NPCs have enrichment of dysregulated mTOR, but mTOR dysregulation drives autism-associated phenotypes.

**Title:** Synaptic Heterogeneity of Inner Hair Cells Contributes to the Diversity of Spontaneous and Sound-Evoked Firing of Spiral Ganglion Neurons**

**Research Question:** How does synaptic heterogeneity of inner hair cells (IHCs) contribute to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of spiral ganglion (SGN) neurons in the cochlea?

**Methods:** We performed paired recordings of murine IHC and postsynaptic SG boutons in acutely explanted organs of Cort from hearing mice with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic in vivo SG characterization. This approach tightly controlled I Ca2+ influx and recorded postsyn SG response to glutamate release at single afferent synapse.

**Findings:** Synapses with high spontaneous release rate (SR) were predominantly found on the pillar side of IHC. These SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact EPSCs, lower thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2 channels and vesicular sites, shorter latencies, and higher release rates. This indicates synaptic heterogeneity of IHC directly contributes to diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked SG firing.

**Implications:** This study supports the presyn hypothesis of functional SG diversity and highlights challenges in bridging the gap between presynaptic cell and neural encoding. Synaptic heterogeneity exists among synapses formed by individual IHC with 5-30 SG, and is a candidate for cochlea decomposing acoustic information.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates that synaptic heterogeneity of IHC contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SG, supporting the presyn hypothesis of functional SG diversity. However, challenges remain in bridging the gap between presynaptic cell and neural encoding, and further work is needed to elucidate mechanisms of SG diversity in the cochlea.

**Title:** Unveiling the Regulatory Role of PfOR in Chromatin Structure and Gene Regulation in Plasmodium falciparum: Implications for Antimalarial Strategies

**Research Question:** What is the role of PfOR in chromatin structure and gene regulation throughout the lifecycle of Plasium falcum, and is it a potential target for antimal strategies?

**Methods:** We employed CRISPR/C9 genome editing, molecular genomics, and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (Ch-seq) to investigate PfOR's function, distribution, and indispensability in the parasite lifecycle.

**Findings:** PfOR modulates chromatin structure and heterochatin formation throughout the erythrocytic cycle and is essential for parasite survival. Ch-se experiments revealed PfOR binds to subtelomeric regions and antigenic genes, suggesting a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown and chrom conformation capture studies showed downregulation of PfOR impairs histone marks and collapses heterochatin structure, leading to parasite death.

**Implications:** PfOR plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating it as a strong candidate for antimal strategies. Genome-wide distribution and function of PfOR throughout the lifecycle remained elusive until this study.

**Conclusions:** Our findings confirm PfOR's multifunctional role in chromatin and gene regulation, highlighting its potential as a novel target for antimal therapies. PfOR is not only critical for parasite progression and survival but also regulates heterochatin and gene silencing, including immune evasion through antigenic variation.

**Title:** Tumor-Infiltrating Nerves Contribute to Cancer-Associated Behavioral Alterations in Brain Function: A Novel Insights from a Mouse Model of Head and Neck Cancer

**Research Question:** Do tumor-infiltrating nerves contribute to changes in mental health experienced by cancer patients by impacting brain function?

**Methods:** We employed a mouse model of head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing to investigate the interaction between tumor-infiltr nerves and brain.

**Findings:** Our results show that tumor-infiltr nerves connect to distinct brain areas, activating neuronal circuitry associated with altered behaviors (decreased nesting, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced running). Tumor-infiltr nocicept neurons exhibited heightened activity and brain regions receiving these projections showed elevated Fos and calcium compared to non-tumor counterparts. Genetic elimination of nocicept neurons decreased F expression and mitigated behavioral alterations induced by tumor presence.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that, in addition to pain, tumor-infiltr nerves communicate signals to brain leading to cancer changes in behavior. This connection occurs independently of pain, and cancer-brain drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice. Elimination of TR1-expressing nocpt neurons reduces tumor growth and survival, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients.

**Conclusions:** The interaction between tumor-infiltr nerves and brain is pivotal to developing interventions alleviating mental burdens associated with cancer. Our study demonstrates tumor-in nerves are integrated into a pre-established circuit extending from tumor to T ganglion, connects to Spc, and projects brain influencing behavior in pain-dependent and independent ways. Cancer patients, notably survivors, experience poor mental health. The connection between tumor and brain, with our finding TR1-express nocpt neurons within circuit functionally altered, might contribute these changes.

**Title:** Genetic Diversity as a Hallmark of RNA Viruses: Exploring the Impact of Mutations on the Biophysical Properties of the Multifunctional Nucleocapsid Protein of SARS-CoV-2

**Research Question:** How does genetic diversity influence the biophysical properties of the multifunctional nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, and what are the implications for viral evolution and fitness?

**Methods:** We analyzed the large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2 to examine the impact of mutations on the biophysical properties of the nucleocapsid protein, focusing on its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). We performed biophysical experiments on several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants and computationally evaluated the range of biophysical traits resulting from diversity in SARSV-2 N-protein domains and IDRs.

**Findings:** Variation in physicochemical parameters of IDRs allowed plasticity, but also functional constraints occurred in related coronaviruses. Mutations in IDRs had nonlocal impact on thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid separation. Distant mutations in IDRs had compensatory effects, shifting the balance of interactions controlling protein properties and creating a new protein-protein interface.

**Implications:** Genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in bi characteristics of N-pro species, particularly in IDRs. Properties like charge, phosphorylation, polarity, and hydrophobicity of IDR subregions are functional constraints across coronaviruses, despite little sequence conservation. Our results suggest a biophysical space for viable N-pro, with potential for mutations to modulate overall bi properties.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the importance of genetic diversity in RNA viruses, particularly in the multifunctional nucleaps protein of SARS-2, and its impact on biophysical properties. The large genomic database of SARS-2 presents an opportunity to probe sequence impacts on biophysical and examine constraints for viral viability. Our findings provide insights into salient mechanisms of N-pro functions and aspects of the bi fitness landscape underlying evolution.

**Title:** Metabolic Adaptations of Skeletal Myosin in Hibernating Mammals: A Comparative Study of Small and Large Species

**Research Question:** How do skeletal myosin and its metabolic states change during hibernation to optimize energy utilization in small and large mammalian species?

**Methods:** We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators (Ictomys trcematus and Eliom quinus) and large hibernators (Urs arctos and Ursus americanus) and conducted Mant-AT chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure myos dynamics and ATP demand. Additionally, we performed proteomics analyses.

**Findings:** Our results showed preservation of myos structure in U. arct and U. american during hibernation, while I. trcematus and E. quinus exhibited changes in myos metabolic states during torpor, leading to higher energy expenditure in type II, fast-twitch muscle at ambient temperatures (20°C). Loaded-ATP chase experiments at 8°C (near body temperature of torpid animals) revealed myos ATP consumption in type II fibers reduced by 77-107% during tor compared to active periods. We observed My2-hyperphosphorylation during tor in I. trcematus, stabilizing the myos molecule.

**Implications:** Our study demonstrates that restingos is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes in ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe its altered response to cold exposure, highlighting myos as a contributor to skeletal non-shivering thermogenesis.

**Conclusions:** This study provides new insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of hibernation, shedding light on the role of myos in energy utilization. Our findings suggest that my remodeling of myos DRX and SR conformations in skeletal muscles suppresses ATP demand during hibernation, supporting previous studies on I. trcematus cardiac muscle. These results have implications for understanding the evolution of hibernation strategies in mammals, particularly in response to cold exposure.

**Title:** Modulation of Chondrocy Division Plane Rotation Determines Formation of Clusters or Columns: A Multifunctional Regulation of Morphogenesis in Pre- and Postnatal Bone Growth

**Research Question:** How do chondrocy columns, a hallmark of growth plate architecture, contribute to bone elongation, and what is the underlying mechanism of their formation?

**Methods:** We employed 3D imaging and morphometric analysis of confetti-labeled clones in embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice to investigate the formation of chondcy columns and their role in bone elongation.

**Findings:** Contrary to expectations, our analysis revealed that chondcy in embryonic growth plates rarely form columns, instead exhibiting non-stereotypic cell stacking due to incomplete division plane rotation, resulting in elongated clusters perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. In postnatal growth plates, both ordered and disordered columns, as well as small disorganized clusters were observed at the edges. Correlation between cluster dynamics and bone elongation expansion suggests clusters promote expansion, while columns support elongation.

**Implications:** Our findings support the idea that modulation of division plane rotation in proliferating chondcy determines formation of clusters or columns, a multifunctional regulation of morphogenesis throughout pre and postnatal growth. This work provides new understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying growth activity and elongation during bone development.

**Conclusions:** Our study highlights the importance of 3D analysis in studying complex cellular arrangements, revealing the dynamics of division plane rotations and their effect on formation of clusters and columns in pre and post growth. The presence of clusters and columns correlated with growth rates, suggesting different strategies during embryonic and postnatal development, emphasizing the role of 3D in understanding morphogenesis.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanism of Proton-coupled Oligopeptide Transport in Mammalian POTs: A Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Experimental Validation

**Research Question:** How do mammalian pro-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) utilize the electrochemical gradient to facilitate peptide uptake, and what are the underlying thermodynamic forces driving this process?

**Methods:** We employed unbiased enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to map the conformational cycle of SLC2, a mammalian POT, in different protonation states with and substrate presence/absence. Conformation free energy landscapes were computed to identify the sequence of protonation steps driving inward alternating access. Key differences between mammalian and bacterial POTs were validated in cell-based transport assays. Constant-PH and absolute free energy (ABE) calculations linked proton binding to peptide recognition.

**Findings:** Our simulations revealed a likely sequence of protonation steps driving inward alternating access, distinct from bacterial POTs. Conformation changes and proton movement were coupled to substrate presence, with ligand binding affecting protein conformation and protonation of E56 and E622 residues. AB calculations established a mechanistic link between proton and peptide recognition.

**Implications:** This study advances understanding of proton-coupled peptide transport in mammals, paving the way for integrating solute carrier biology with drug design to enhance tissue bioavailability.

**Conclusions:** This study constructs a model of alternating mechanism using bacterial and mammalian POT structures, explaining proton movement driving conformation changes and conformation-proton coupling. We establish distinct effects of substrate presence on conformation and protonation, linking to E and E residues. Our work provides a detailed model of substrate-proton alternating in mammalian POTs for the first time.

**Title:** Unveiling the Mechanism of Speech-Induced Auditory Suppression in the Human Brain: A Neurophysiological Evidence for Enhanced Sensitivity to Feedback

**Research Question:** Does speech-induced auditory suppression in the human brain increase sensitivity to feedback, enabling the detection of vocalization errors?

**Methods:** We employed intracran electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production to investigate the topography of auditory suppression in the superior temporal gyrus (ST) and its relationship with sensitivity to auditory feedback. A delayed feedback (DF) task was used to determine whether suppressed sites were sensitive to auditory alterations.

**Findings:** We found that overlapping sites in the ST exhibited both speech-induced suppression and sensitivity to feedback, with a strong correlation between the two measures, supporting the hypothesis that suppression increases sensitivity to errors. Delaying feedback during speech enhanced responses in the ST, and the degree of sensitivity varied across recording sites. A significant correlation between suppression and feedback sensitivity was observed, indicating a shared mechanism between suppression and speech monitoring.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that speech-induced suppression enables detection and correction of errors by increasing sensitivity to auditory feedback. When participants produced speech with simultaneous feedback, posterior ST was selectively activated during the DF paradigm, indicating that attentional load modulates feedback sensitivity.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring, supporting the hypothesis that suppression is a key mechanism underlying speech monitoring. Our findings have implications for understanding the neural basis of speech production and error correction, with potential applications in speech therapy and rehabilitation.

**Title:** Unveiling the Complexity of McrBC Systems: A Comprehensive Census and Phylogenetic Analysis of Prokaryotic Type IV Restriction Systems Reveals Enormous Diversity and Plethora of Genomic Associations

**Research Question:** What are the characteristics and functions of Coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoNuTs), a previously uncharacterized branch of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, and how do they interact with translation components and DNA?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive census of McBC systems among the most common proary Type IV restriction systems, followed by phylogenetic analysis to reveal their enormous diversity and plethora of genomic associations. We focused on CoNu, characterized by the presence of coiled-coil structures and nucleases, and identified three types and subtypes with distinct domain compositions and genomic associations.

**Findings:** CoNu contain domains predicted to interact with translation components, such as OB-fold resembling Smp protein binding bacterial messenger RNA (tmRNA), Y-like domains recognizing methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp chaper homologs, along with RNases, such as HN, suggesting they target RNA. Some CoNu might target DNA via McC nuclease homologs. Restriction systems, like Type RM, BRE, and Dant Type, are frequently encoded in same superons. Many of these superons CoNu are regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly RNA fragments with termini binding CAR (CRIS-Associated Rosann Fold) domains.

**Implications:** We hypothesize that CoNu, with ancillary factors, employ an echoned defense strategy analogous to Type CRIS-C systems, eliminating virus and/or RNA first, then aborting infection leading to P/dormancy via RNA cleavage. Our findings suggest that CoNu target RNA, and possibly DNA, via Mc nuclease homologs, and are regulated by cyclicotides and RNA fragments.

**Conclusions:** This study reveals CoNu, a previously uncharacterized branch of proary Type restriction systems, with extraordinary complexity and diversity. Their interactions with translation components and DNA suggest a two-prong strategy, reminiscent of Type CRIS-C systems. We propose that RNA targeting is an ancestral feature of CoNu systems, supported by their similarity to Type-A encoding Cnu H70 proteins and higher-order associations with DNA systems. The conserved association of CDC-like ATPases with Type-A CoNu, encoding tm-binding SP domain, supports tmRNA interaction. Structural analysis of bacterin protein indicates an inactivated PD(E)K-type endonuc fold, potentially nucleic-binding.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Calcineurin in Caenorhabditis elegans Innate Immunity and Lifespan Extension**

**Research Question:** How does calcineur, a conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent ser/threonine phosphatase, regulate innate immunity and lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of calcine in regulating the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in C. elegans and its impact on innate immunity and lifespan. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown tax-6, the catalytic subunit of calcine, and observed the effects on C. elegans susceptibility to bacterial infection and lifespan.

**Findings:** Calcine inhibition led to defects in DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to infection. Notably, intestinal bloating caused by calcine inhibition mimicked the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. We identified the transcription factor HL-30 as required for lifespan extension mediated by calcine inhibition and the nuclear receptor NHR-8 as upregulated by calcine inhibition and necessary for increased lifespan.

**Implications:** Our studies uncover a role for calcine in C. elegans DMP and provide a mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated longevity. Calcine, a conserved from yeast to humans, regulates diverse cellular processes, including thermaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan in C. elegans. Calc activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, activated by calmodulin binding. The rhythmic D cycle in C. elegans is regulated by calcium waves, suggesting a complex relationship between lifespan and immunity.

**Conclusions:** Calcine plays a crucial role in regulating C. elegans innate immunity and lifespan. Inhibition of calcine enhances lifespan through multiple pathways, including autophagy and CRE-regulated transcriptional coactivators. Our findings shed light on the complex interplay between lifespan and immunity and provide a new mechanism for calcine-mediated longevity.

**Title:** Cognitive Control of Conflicts between Task-Relevant and Irrelevant Information Enables Goal-Directed Behavior: A Study on the Geometry of Cognitive Space Representation

**Research Question:** How do cognitive processes resolve conflicts between task-relevant and irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior, and what is the geometry of the cognitive space that represents these conflicts?

**Methods:** We designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized, and measured human performance and fMRI activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to test the hypothesis that different types of conflicts are organized based on similarity in the cognitive space.

**Findings:** Our results support the hypothesis that different types of conflicts are represented as points in a cognitive space, with the distance between points reflecting the geometry of the space, which scales with the difference in sources of the conflicts being represented by points. The dimensions in the cognitive space correspond to domain-specific cognitive processes, and the location of a type of conflict in the space can be parameterized by a limited number of coordinates reflecting control needed for each domain-specific control. We also found that the space can represent types of conflicts with low dimensionality, and different domains can be conjunctively represented in a single space to achieve domain-general control.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that the cognitive space is a principle for representing conflicts, and the frontopetal network may be the location of this space due to its roles in conflict resolution. We propose two solutions to resolving different types of conflicts: domain-general control and domain-specific control. Domain-general control posits the frontopetal encodes information and flexibly implements strategies, supported by generalizable adjustment. In contrast, domain-specific control posits the same mechanisms are applied across domains.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides evidence for the geometry of cognitive space representation of conflicts, supporting the hypothesis that different types are represented as points in a space. The distance between points scales with difference in sources, and dimensions correspond to domain-specific processes. Our findings have implications for understanding how cognitive control diverse conflicts, enabling goal-directed behavior, and the role of frontopetal network in conflict resolution. Future research should investigate the neural encoding of cognitive space and its dimensionality.

**Title:** Elucidating the Vaginal Immune Response in Preterm Birth: A Longitudinal Investigation of the Immunopome in High-Risk Pregnant Women

**Research Question:** Can the vaginal immune response, referred to as the immunop, predict spontaneous preterm birth (PT) in high-risk pregnant women?

**Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal study of 739 pregnant women, collecting vaginal swabs at different gestational points, and quantifying cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides via sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models were constructed from mediator concentrations.

**Findings:** Throughout uncomplicated gestation, the immunop harbors a homeostatic profile. However, in women who experience preterm labor (PTL) or preterm prelabor of membranes (PPROM), the immun is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state, characterized by increased monocyte chemoatants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides. The immun has predictive value over maternal characteristics for identifying women at risk for early (<34 weeks) PT.

**Implications:** The immunop undergoes homeost changes throughout gestation, and deviations from this shift are associated with PT. The immun can be leveraged as a biomarker for early PT, a subset associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.

**Conclusions:** This study represents the largest and most comprehensive profiling of the immune response in vaginal fluid throughout well-character pregnancies. Our data show that the immun has predictive value over maternal alone for a subset early PT, highlighting immune changes in PT attributable to factors other than maternal. Alterations in the immun are observed in women destined to undergo PT, and the immun can be used to identify those at risk.

**Title:** Hernandez-Hern Model: A Novel Computational Framework for Understanding Sex-Specific Electrical and Ca2 Signaling in Arterial Myocytes

**Research Question:** What are the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2 signaling in the development of myogenic tone in arterial vessels, and how do they differ between male and female myocytes?

**Methods:** We developed an in silico model, the Hernandez-Hern model, based on experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female myocytes from murine arteries. The model simulates membrane currents and their impact on membrane potential as well as local and global Ca2+ signaling in male and female myocytes.

**Findings:** The Hernandez-Hern model suggests that KV.5 channels have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, but simulations indicate KV.5 is the dominant current regulating potential in male myocytes. In contrast, female myocytes have larger KV2.1 expression and longer activation time constants, suggesting KV.1 plays a primary role in controlling membrane potential. Over physiological membrane potentials, a small number of voltage-gated K+ and L-type Ca2 channels drive sex differences in intracellular Ca+ and excitability. The model also predicts female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to Ca2 channel blockers compared to male.

**Implications:** The Hernandez-Hern model provides a new framework to investigate sex-specific antihypertensive drug impact. Predictions from the idealized vessel suggest Ca2 blockers are more potent in females, resulting in substantial Ca reduction in arterial smooth muscle compared to male. The model demonstrates the importance of sex differences in Ca2 and KV.

**Conclusions:** We present the Hernandez-Hern model, the first integration of sex-specific voltage-gated KV. The model comprehensively describes essential electrical and Ca dynamics in arterial myocytes, uncovering key components necessary to understand behavior and response to variations in pressure. The Hernandez-Hern predicts KV. channels play a critical role in controlling membrane in female compared to male myocytes, and antihypensive Ca blockers cause larger reductions in Ca currents in female than male myocytes.

**Title:** Decomposer Size and Climate Interactions Shape Litter Decomposition Across a Precipitation Gradient

**Research Question:** How do decomposers of different sizes interact with climate to influence litter decomposition rates across a precipitation gradient?

**Methods:** We investigated the relationship between decomposer size and climate by placing litter baskets of varying mesh sizes at seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, from arid to mesic, and characterizing macrocomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping.

**Findings:** Decomposers responded differently to precipitation based on size, with microbial decomposition increasing with precipitation in winter and macrocomposition peaking in arid during summer. This led to similar decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyperarid sites. Macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the importance of macrocomposition in arid lands, resolving the dry decomposition conundrum, and emphasizing the need to consider decomposer size when investigating geochemical processes. Macrocomposition contributed minimally to whole-community decomposition in winter but dominated in arid sites during summer. Pit trapping revealed macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass followed a h-shaped response to precipitation, peaking in ar environments.

**Conclusions:** Climate interacts with biota of different categories to influence litter decomposition. Decomposers respond differently to precipitation based on size, leading to similar rates across gradient except hyperid sites. Opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and microorganisms mesofa result in similar rates across gradient except hyperid sites where decompos activity is minimal regardless of size. Our results support long-suggested but largely overlooked hypothesis that macrocomposition governs litter in deserts.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of CY-B in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC): A Novel Insights into Metastasis and Signaling Pathways

**Research Question:** What is the role of CY-B in the development and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a cancer with dismal prognosis and high rates of metastasis?

**Methods:** We employed a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer to investigate the expression and function of CY-B, a protein highly expressed in human PDAC. We deleted the Cy gene encoding CY-B in the pancreas and analyzed the effects on tumorigenesis and metastasis.

**Findings:** Deletion of Cy accelerated tumorigenesis, leading to enhanced ER and JNK-induced proliferation in precancer lesions, indicating CY-B as a buffer of RAC hyperactivation in early stages. However, as disease progressed, loss of CY inhibited metastasis. CY-B depleted tumour cells showed reduced chemotactic responses to lysosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macinotic uptake of lysosphatidic receptor 1.

**Implications:** Our study implicates CY-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis. CY-B expression correlated with poorer survival in human PDAC, suggesting its potential as a prognostic biomarker.

**Conclusions:** CY-B plays a dual role in pancreatic cancer, buffering RAC activation in early stages and inhibiting metastasis as disease progresses. Loss of CY accelerates tumorigenesis and metastasis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for PDAC treatment.

**Title:** Characterization of HERV-K (HML-2) Proviruses in Rhes Macaques: Implications for Viral Evolution and Pathogenesis

**Research Question:** To investigate the presence, structure, and evolutionary history of HERV (H-ML-2) proviruses in rhes macques, and their potential for recent or ongoing activity.

**Methods:** We analyzed two recenthes genome assemblies for H-2 proviral sequences and performed in-depth characterization of their structure, coding capacity, and evolutionary history, with a focus on SER-K-like proviruses.

**Findings:** Identified 145 H-2-like proviruses inhes macques, including a clade ofhes-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact reading frames, and insert polymorphism of these insertions suggest recent or ongoing activity inhes macques. 106 provuses form a clade characterized by ~750 bp sequence between env and 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), derived from recombination with HER-K (H-8)-related virus. This clade found in Old World (OW) but not great apes, suggesting originated after ape/OW split. Similar provuses found in white-cheek gibbons, insert cluster within OW recombinant cl, indicating interspecies transmission OW to gibbons. LTR of youngest provuses deletions U3, disrupt Response Element (RE), required for nuclear export unspliced RNA. Showed H-8 region functions as Response-independent constitutive transport (TE), indicating ancestral-RE export system replaced by C mechanism.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest thathes macques may harbor or have recently active H-2-like retroviruses. Characterized clade ER inhes macques may serve as model for investigating evolution over time and HERH-2 virology and pathogenesis.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence for recent or ongoing activity of H-2 retroviruses inhes macques, with implications for understanding viral evolution and pathogenesis. Characterization of SER-like provuses inhes mac may serve as valuable model for future research.

**Title:** Elucidating the Immunomodulatory Role of Enterococcus faecalis in Wound Infections: A Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis Reveals Distinct Transcriptional and Metabolic Alterations

**Research Question:** How does Enteroccus faalis infection contribute to chronic wound healing and what are the underlying molecular mechanisms?

**Methods:** We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected and uninfected wounds in a mouse model, examining over 23,000 cells to create a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of wounds.

**Findings:** Our analysis revealed transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating distinct changes associated with bacterial infection compared to normal healing. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faalis prompted premature epithelial-mesymal transition in kerocytes. Additionally, E. fa modulated M2 macrophage polarization inhibiting pro-inflammatory in vitro, in vivo, and our RNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage cstalk with neutrophils, regulating chemine signaling, while promoting anti-inflammatory with endothelial cells.

**Implications:** Our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faalis in wound infections, suggesting uninf wounds undergo reparative angiogenesis while E fa infection evokes pathologicalization. Our analysis underlines M-like macroage-EC interactions as altered cell signaling during bacteria-infected healing.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides a comprehensive comparison of transcriptomic and cellular profiles between uninf and E fa-infected full-thickness skin wounds 4 post-infection. However, our study lacks a dataset uninf unwounded skin transcript, which would allow investigating changes temporally induced by wounding alone. E fa reaffirmed known functions fibro during uninf healing, consistent with lig-receptor interactions. Imm cells crucial in healing by eliminating pathogens, promoting kerocyte fibro activity, and resolving inflammation and repair.

**Title:** Temporal Dynamics of Volatile-Induced Defense Priming in Maize Plants: A Novel Insights into the Role of Stress-Induced Volatiles in Plant Defense Activation

**Research Question:** How do herbivore-att-induced volatiles influence defense responses in neighboring plants, and what are the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon?

**Methods:** We employed a custom-built high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToFMS) system to investigate the temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herboreattacked and undamaged maize plants.

**Findings:** Continuous exposure to natural blends of herbore-induced volatiles resulted in a clocked response in neighboring plants, characterized by a terpene burst at the onset of the second day, which was not explained by terene accumulation during the night but coincided with jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. This delayed burst occurred independently of day-night transitions and could not be fully explained by sender dynamics, but was the result of stress-induced volatile exposure during the first day and secondary bioactive volat on the second.

**Implications:** Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volat results in a response that integrates priming and induction into a distinct and predictable pattern, providing an answer to the long-standing question whether volat predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring, revealing they can both in sequence.

**Conclusions:** Our experiments highlight the importance of tracking defense responses in real-time as plants perceive dynamic volatile of herboreatt neighbors. The ecological relevance of clocked kinetics of activation in neighboring plants is discussed, proposing several hypotheses. Responding strongly to cues on the second may avoid unnecessary expenditure (Waterman et al., 2019; Mithfer et al., 2005). This is the result of volatile priming on the first that yields clock response to volat perceived the next. Mechanisms and biological implications of this phenomenon are discussed.

**Title:** Recursive Vocal Combinatorics in Wild Orangutans: Implications for the Evolution of Human Language and Music

**Research Question:** Do non-human primates exhibit recursive vocal patterns that may have predated the evolution of language and music in humans?

**Methods:** We analyzed the vocalizations of wild male orangutans to identify rhythmic sequences nested within rhythmic sequences, consistent with hierarchical structures.

**Findings:** Our results show that orangutan calls exhibit temporally and acoustically distinct rhythms in lower strata not related to the overarching rhythm of the higher stratum, indicating recursive structures not resulting from non-hierarchical processes or anatomical constraints.

**Implications:** These findings represent a case of recursive combinatorial homin vocalics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music, suggesting that recursive structures may have predated the evolution of language in humans. This opens the possibility that recursive combinatorics were first a feature of proto-mus expression in human ancestors, later "re-engineered" for linguistic combinatorics.

**Conclusion:** Our study provides evidence for recursive self-embedded patterning in a non-human great ape, the flanged orangutan, in the wild, and offers a new perspective on the evolution of recursion in the hominid family. Future studies on primate combinatorics, particularly in the wild, can assess precursors and proto-states of recursion, adding recursion as a new layer of analysis.

**Title:** Co-evolutionary Arms Race between Vertebrates and 5'pp-RNA Viruses: Unveiling the Role of MDA Receptor in Innate Immunity

**Research Question:** How do vertebrates compensate for the loss of the RIG receptor, a key component of the innate immune system, and how do 5pp-R viruses counteract this response?

**Methods:** We investigated the interaction between the MDA receptor and 5pp-R virus in the lower vertebrate Miichthys mii, a species lacking RIG, and its homologous Gallus gallus, and the 5-R viruses SCRV and VSV.

**Findings:** Our study reveals that MDA, a structurally similar to RIG, can substitute for R in recognizing 5pp-R in vertebrates without RIG, leading to redundancy of R from the genome. Furthermore, 5-R virus utilizes the m6 methylation mechanism to degrade M and weaken its antiviral ability, promoting its replication and immune evasion.

**Implications:** Our findings provide a snapshot into the coevolution between vertebrate and virus, highlighting ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system. The loss of RIG in vertebrates is a widespread event, and our research offers a new perspective on verte groups that have lost R.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate that vertebrates have evolved MDA with alternative functions to recognize and resist 5-R virus in the absence of R, and that 5 virus can counteract this by degrading M. These findings unveil the complex arms race between virus and innate immunity in vertebrates and shed light on the diversity of antiviral activity.

**Title:** The Impact of Follic-stimulating Hormone (FSH) on Body Composition and Bone Metabolism in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy (AD)

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the correlation between serum Follic-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone turnover markers in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (AD).

**Methods:** Twenty-nine non-metatic prostate cancer patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019 and underwent administration of luteizing hormone-releasing antagonist deglix. Body fat mass (FBM), lean mass (LBM), and bone density (BMD) were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptometry at baseline and after 12 months of AD. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.

**Findings:** At baseline, a weak, non-significant direct relationship was found between FSH levels and FBM in arms (r = 0.36) and legs (r = 0.33). Conversely, a stronger correlation was observed between F and total FBM (r = 0.52, p = 0.006), fat at arms (r =0.54, p =0.004), and fat trunk (r =0.45, p=0.018) after 12 months. An inverse relationship between serum F and appendicular mass/FBM ratio was observed (r =-0.64, p=0.001).

**Implications:** This study suggests that FSH levels after AD could have an impact on body composition, particularly on FBM. Therefore, F could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and guide clinicians in the evaluation of body in PC patients undergoing AD.

**Conclusion:** This study provides new insights into the relationship between FSH and body composition in prostate cancer patients undergoing AD. The results are hypothesis-generating and cannot be generalized due to the limitations of an ancillary study. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.

**Title:** Inhibition of Ryanodine Receptor 2 (Ry2) Channels Mitigates Ventricular Tachycardia/Fibrillation (VT) and Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) in a Guinea Pig Model of Heart Failure

**Research Question:** Can inhibition of Ryanod receptor 2 (Ry2) channels reduce ventricular tachardia/fibrillation (VT) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in a guinea pig model of heart failure?

**Methods:** We used a guinea pig model of heart failure that replicates clinical aspects of human ischemic heart failure, including prolonged QT interval, high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SC, and Ca2+ leak via hyperactive Ry2. Animals were randomized to receive dantene (DS) or placebo in early chronic heart failure. We assessed incidence of VT/SCD (primary outcome), ECG heart rate and QT, echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcasmic Ry2 oxidation.

**Findings:** DS prevented VT/SC by decreasing dispersion repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias compared to placebo. DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic during β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart variability and function. Inhibition Ry2 hyperactivity with dene mitigates vicious cycle sarcasm Ca+ leak increases diolic Ca+ and ROS-mediated Ry2, reducing repolar lability and protecting VT/SC. Moreover, consequent increase sarcasm Ca+ load improves contractile function.

**Implications:** Inhibition of Ry2 hyperactivity with dene mitigates vicious cycle sarcasm Ca+ leak increases diolic Ca and ROS-mediated Ry2, reducing repolar lability and protecting VT/SC. Moreover, consequent increase sarcasm Ca+ load improves contractile function. These life-saving effects of Ry2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies repurposing dene as potential therapy for heart failure and SC.

**Conclusion:** This study demonstrates that inhibition of Ry2 channels reduces ventricular tachia/fibrillation and sudden cardiac death in a guinea pig model of heart failure by reducing sarcasm Ca+ leak, repolar lability, and improving contract function. These findings suggest that Ry2 inhibition may be a new target for therapy for heart failure and SC.

**Title:** Unraveling the Complex Regulatory Interplay of Smad and Schnur Transcription Factors in C. elegans Body Size Regulation

**Research Question:** How do Smad and Schnur transcription factors mediate the transcriptional responses to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF) family, including the conserved bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family in C. elegans?

**Methods:** We employed genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP-seq through a novel analysis pipeline to untangle the roles of Smad and Schnur transcription factors in developing C. elegans larvae. We chose the second larval (L2) stage, where Smad activity is elevated, as determined by RADMAD activity. Our analysis revealed SMA-3/Sm and SMA-9/Schnur target genes that are co-regulated by both factors, as well as separate genes they independently regulate.

**Findings:**

* SMA-3/Sm acts as a transcriptional activator at a genome-wide scale, whereas SMA-9/Sur targets both activated and repressed genes.
* Mutations in sm-9 partially suppress the body size phenotype of sm-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between factors, challenging the prevailing model for Schnur function.
* Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-car metabolism and endoplasmic retic (ER) secretory pathway, including disulf reductase-11.
* Our findings indicate Smads and SMA-9/Sur have previously unreciated complex and genomic interactions regulating secretion extracellular components like collagen into cuticle to mediate body regulation.

**Implications:**

* Smad and Schnur transcription factors have complex and previously unrec interactions regulating secretion extracellular components like collagen into cuticle to mediate body size regulation.
* Sm-independent roles for SMA- in functions, including immunity, are consistent with vertebrate Schnur homologs in immunity.

**Conclusions:**

* Smad and Schn transcription factors have complex and previously unrec interactions regulating secretion extracellular components like collagen into cuticle to mediate body regulation.
* Sm-independent roles SMA in functions, including immunity, are consistent with vertebrate Schnur homologs in immunity.
* Our findings provide novel insights into Smad and Schnur functions in C. elegans body size regulation, challenging prevailing models for Schnur function.

**Title:** Embryonic Transcription Factor DUX Contributes to Immunotherapy Failure in Metastatic Cancers: A Novel Biomarker and Therapeutic Target for Checkpoint Resistance

**Research Question:** Does the embryonic transcription factor DUX contribute to immunotherapy failure in metastatic cancers, and can it serve as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint resistance?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression of DUX in a cohort of metastatic tumors, including bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers, and examined its association with immune exclusion and response to PD-1 blockade in urothelial carcinoma patients.

**Findings:** We found that DUX expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with ~10-50% of advanced uroth, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX. DUX expression is significantly associated with immune exclusion and decreased response to PD-1 blockade in a large cohort of uroth carcinoma patients. Furthermore, DUX expression is a significant predictor of survival even accounting for tumor mutational and molecular features in this cohort, with DUX expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year.

**Implications:** Our data motivate the development of DUX as a biomarker and therapeutic for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance. We verified DUX expression in advanced uroth carcinoma was associated with an immune phenotype: higher proportion of D+ tumors exhibit immune-excluded or immune-des phenotype compared to malignancies where DUX is silent. We also examined correlation of DUX status with PD-1 levels in tumor and immune compartments via IHC.

**Conclusions:** DUX expression is a feature of metastasis and may be important driver of immune evasion. While mechanism governing DUX depression in cancer remains to be elucidated, we show DUX expression in metastatic is associated reduced anti-tumor, mirroring observations in primary and cancer cell models. These suggest DUX expression in metast induces immunosup gene program, concord with established inhibiting JAKSTAT in primary. We hypothesize DUX expression these will generate transcript signals CD+ cell exclusion tumor. Uro cancers exhibited highest frequencies D expression 54 patients metastatic cohorts analyzed, suggesting DUX particularly important that type. Data demonstrate rates DUX observed metastatic reflect expression rather technical introduced formalin tissues consistent polyadenated D transcript primary metastatic. We assessed consequences D expression metast cancers focused uro for reasons.

**Key Takeaways:**

* DUX is a common feature of metastatic tumors, particularly in uro, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers.
* DUX expression is associated with immune exclusion and decreased response to PD-1 blockade in uro carcinoma.
* DUX is a significant predictor of survival, even accounting for tumor mutational and molecular features.
* DUX may be a biomarker and therapeutic for checkpoint resistance.

**Future Directions:** Develop DUX as biomarker and therapeutic for checkpoint resistance.

**Title:** Investigating the Aetiology of Livestock Abortion in Tanzania: A Surveillance Platform for Improving Livelihoods, Food Security, and Public Health

**Research Question:** What are the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in Tanzania, and how can a surveillance system be established to inform evidence-based interventions for improving livelihoods, food security, and public health?

**Methods:** A surveillance platform was established in pastoral, agro-pastoral, and smallholder systems in Tanzania to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Livestock officers reported events, and the research team investigated within 72 hours, collecting samples and questionnaire data on determinants of attribution, patterns, species, breed, previous history, and seasonality, determinants of reporting, and investigation, and zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017-2019, 215 events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44), and (n=100) goats were investigated.

**Findings:** Attribution was achieved in 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopath proved less useful than PCR due to sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive pathogen detection. Livestock surveillance generated valuable information on causes, reproductive losses, and pathogens not captured through other forms.

**Implications:** Establishing a surveillance system through community-based officers, sample collection, and molecular platforms is feasible. The study demonstrated utility, acceptability, and feasibility of abortion as a target for syndrom and event surveillance, operational across settings, including rural areas.

**Conclusions:** This study supports establishing a livestock framework for evidence-based interventions to improve livelihoods, human health in Africa. Aetiological attribution rarely exceeds 35%, even in well-resourced systems, and is sparse in African systems. Our study suggests a role for stressful events, including drought, wild attacks, reported in unattributed cases.

**Title:** Nicotine-Induced Regulation of Intestinal Stem Cell Proliferation and Tumorigenesis: A Novel Therapeutic Implications

**Background:** Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for the development and progression of various diseases, with Nicotine (NIC) being a major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, the underlying mechanisms of NIC-regulated stem cell functions remain poorly understood.

**Research Question:** This study aimed to investigate the effects of NIC on murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo, and elucidate the underlying signaling pathways involved.

**Methods:** Mice were treated with NIC, and ISC abundance and proliferative activity were assessed in vivo and ex vivo. Protein expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Transcriptional coactivator with PD-binding (TAZ) and Notch signaling was examined via α-nicot acetylcholine receptor (nA) and protein kinase (C activation. Pan cells were used as controls.

**Findings:** NIC increased ISC abundance and proliferative activity in vivo and ex, and induced YAP/TA and Notch signaling in ISC via αA and PK activation. This effect was not observed in Pan cells. Inhibition of Not signaling by dibenzine (DB) nullified NIC effects on ISC. NIC enhanced tumor formation from ISC loss of tumor suppressor APC, while DB inhibited NIC-induced growth.

**Implications:** This study identifies NIC-regulated pathway regulating stemness and tumorigenesis ISC, suggesting DB as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.

**Conclusion:** Our findings highlight the pivotal role of NIC as a stimulant of cancer cell proliferation in intestinal tumors, explaining colon development in smokers. Development of drugs blocking αA, Y/TA, and Not signaling may provide a new therapeutic strategy for colon cancers. Our data indicate NIC increased ISC abundance and proliferation, partly explaining increased intestinal tumors in smokers. We demonstrated NIC enhances ISC via αA and Y/TA and Not signaling. This is consistent with DB-induced suppression of YTA and Not signaling ISC from NIC-treated mice. NIC expands ISC through upregulated αA and formation Y/TA-Not loop, suggesting these factors as therapeutic targets for NIC-induced colon cancer.

**Title:** Elucidating the Collaborative Impact of Hsp110 and Different JDP Classes on Hsp-Dependent Aggregate Processing

**Research Question:** How do H110 nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) and J-domain proteins (JDPs) regulate Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing, and what is the role of H110 in the initial stages of disaggregation?

**Methods:** We investigated the collaborative impact of H110 and different JDP classes on H70-dependent aggregate processing using biochemical assays and structural analysis.

**Findings:** Our results show that H110 plays a crucial role in the initial stages of disaggregation, determining its efficacy. H110 catalyzes the recruitment of H70 onto aggregates, modifying them into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. H70 stimulation by H110 is stronger with class B than A JDPs, requiring auxiliary interaction between BDP and H70's EE motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate that H110 disrupts J-H70 interaction, destabilizing chaper complexes at the aggregate surface, potentially improving disaggregation but also inhibiting substoichiometric H110.

**Implications:** The interplay between co-chaper and H70 is critical to unlock disaggregating potential. Our findings suggest that substrate-binding activity to H110 is not necessary to increase S1-S1 binding to aggregates, and NEF concentration is negatively correlated with affinity for H70. We also show that larger H70-J assemblies at the surface, dependent on S1 and interaction with EE, modify misfolded proteins more amenable to disaggregation.

**Conclusions:** H110-dependent disaggregation is limited to initial stages, chaper recruitment and disassembly, not protein folding. H110 loading onto aggregates correlates with remodelling into smaller species, improving recognition by H104 disagase. H110 may release H from aggregate, as well as J, unless tethered via interaction, e.g., other J subunit complex with aggregate-bound H70. The fate of displaced proteins is yet to be established, presumably at low H110 levels, may rebind another site or aggregate-bound chaper. The effect of H110 on recovery is more pronounced when H70 comprises class JDP.

**Title:** Wearable Digital Insoles for Objective Gait Analysis in Knee Osteoarthritis: A Promising Alternative to Clinical Gait Methods

**Research Question:** Can wearable digital insoles accurately measure osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures comparable to traditional gait analysis in clinical settings?

**Methods:** We developed a machine learning model trained on force plate data from participants with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and controls to predict force data from a separate validation set and independent insole dataset containing OA and control subjects. The model's performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves.

**Findings:** Our results show that digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional g measurements, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.86 and PR of 0.90 for the validation set and 0.83 and 0.86 for the independent insole dataset. We also demonstrated that a single stride of raw time-series data can be assigned to each subject, indicating that individuals can be identified by their gait characteristics.

**Implications:** This work provides a framework for an alternative to traditional gait analysis methods, adds to the body of knowledge on wearable analytical pipelines, and supports development of at-home assessments, potentially improving ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring.

**Conclusions:** Wearable digital insoles offer a promising solution to the challenges of clinical gait analysis due to their relatively low cost, portability, and ease of use. Our study demonstrates that digital insoles can measure osteoarthritis-specific g signatures similar to traditional gait analysis, highlighting their potential for clinical application in monitoring disease progression and intervention.

**Title:** Non-Opioid Therapy for Post-Surgical Pain: Exploring the Potential of Human Amniotic Membrane-Derived Biologics

**Research Question:** Can human-derived biologics from the amniotic membrane (AM) provide an effective non-opoid treatment for post-surgical pain without the severe side effects associated with opioid analgesics?

**Methods:** We investigated the analgesic effects of Clarix Flo (FLO), a human amni membrane product, on post-surgical hypersensitivity in mice and elucidated the underlying mechanisms of its pain inhibition.

**Findings:** Local application of LO attenuated post-surgical hypersensitivity without known opioid side effects, achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DR) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We purified the major component, heavy-hyaluronic acid/paxin 3 (HA/PT3) from human AM with greater purity and solubility than LO. HA/PT3 replicated LO-induced neuronal pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HA/3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements inhibited sodium and high-voltage activated current onice DR neurons.

**Implications:** Our findings highlight the potential of naturally-derived biologs from human tissues as non-opoid treatment for post-surgical pain, unraveling the neuronal mechanisms of inhibition by LO and HA/3.

**Conclusions:** Human tissue products may be deployed as biologic to treat post-s pain. We identified HA/3 as primary bioactive responsible for inhibition, inducing acute cytoskeleton rearrangement and IN and HVA currents in CD-dependent, making a promising non-opoid for posturgical pain.

**Title:** Investigating the Correlation between Pigmentation and Functionality of Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cells Derived from Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

**Research Question:** Does the color intensity of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-RPE) correlate with their gene expression profiles and functionality?

**Methods:** We employed the Automated Live Imaging and Picking System (ALPS) to photograph and RNA-sequencing analyze individual iSCPE cells, categorizing them into four clusters based on gene expression profiles. We calculated the weighted sum of RGB channels (brightness) as a proxy for pigmentation level and used gene enrichment analysis (GSEA) to investigate correlations between pigmentation and gene expression.

**Findings:** Contrary to our hypothesis, we found no correlation between color intensity and specific gene expression profiles, suggesting that pigmentation may not directly indicate functional characteristics of RPE. The transcriptome analysis revealed dynamic regulation of pigmentation, with a time-lag between mRNA production of enzymes and melanin synthesis (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Moreover, pigmentation did not correlate with expression of R markers (Figure 2—figure 1).

**Implications:** Our results indicate that color of iPE cells may not be a reliable indicator of their functionality. This is supported by evidence from other studies: bone-derived R cells, poorly pigmented in vitro, become heavily pigmented post-transplanted (Supta et al., 2009) and iPE cells, unpigmented in vitro, become heavily pigmented post-engrafted (Mandai et al., 2017; Sug et al.). This suggests that pigmentation of stem-derived R cells may not necessarily reflect their maturation levels.

**Conclusions:** Our findings suggest that pigmentation of iPE cells is not a reliable indicator of their functionality. The lack of correlation between color and gene expression implies that other factors, such as retin recycling, may underlie the degree of pigmentation. Specifically, genes related to retin recycling (RD11, 1, 10, 3, 5) showed weak correlation with color intensity (0.25, 0.20, 0.16, 0.12, 0.11 respectively, Figure 4—figure 3). Our study highlights the need to reevaluate the use of pigmentation as an indicator of R cell functionality and suggests that other factors, such as retin recycling, may play a more significant role in determining the degree of pigmentation.

**Title:** Bridging the Gap between Ethology and Neuroscience: A Novel Automated Apparatus for Studying Cooperative Behaviors in Common Marmets (Callithrix jacus)

**Research Question:** Can a novel, high-throughput behavioral apparatus, the Marmet Apparatus Automated Pulling (MoAAP), capture the nuances of cooperative behaviors in commonarmets (Callith jacus) and provide a platform for investigating neural mechanisms underlying social behaviors?

**Methods:** We designed and developed MoAAP, a modular, adaptable apparatus for studying cooperative behaviors in commonarmets, addressing limitations of traditional research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed behavioral data integration with video and audio recordings. Mo accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual capabilities, allowing investigations of neural activity in naturalistic social behaviors.

**Findings:** MoAAP provides a robust tool for advancing understanding primate behavior and cognitive processes, bridging the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations. With Mo, we amassed a substantial number of trials, demonstrating the possibility examining neural dynamics in commonets. Our apparatus and paradigm represent an advancement, addressing traditional behavior studies and precise, controlled neural activity.

**Implications:** The combination of Mo's modular design, high-resolution data, and integration with neural recordings positions it as a versatile tool unraveling complexities primate behavior. By incorporating behavioral, video, and audio with Mo's timing and reward delivery, one gains a comprehensive understanding interplay behavior, communication, and interactions in this species using an automated task. Additionally, Mo and associated paradigms create an avenue simultaneous recordings while marmets are engaged tasks by Mo, significantly increasing trials for analysis and statistical power investigating relationship activity behaviors.

**Conclusions:** Mo and associated cooperative paradigm make a significant contribution to studying marm behaviors in the field. Mo's flexibility, adaptability, and high-resolution data make it suitable investigating underlying mechanisms in primates. This work paves the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience usingarm as a model organism.

**Title:** Moderate Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Affects Genome Regulation in the Offspring: A Physiologically Relevant Murine Model and Human Cohort Studies

**Research Question:** Does moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PA) affect genome regulation in the offspring, and if so, what are the underlying mechanisms and implications?

**Methods:** We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate PA, resembling common patterns of alcohol consumption in pregnancy in humans. Early PA was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborns without altering behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. Methylation differences were enriched in non-coding regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects on genome regulation.

**Findings:** Moderate PA was sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes, highlighting a role for preventative dietary interventions. Regions identified as sensitive to gestational exposure were replicated in human cohorts. Maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some damaging effects of early PA on DNA methylation.

**Implications:** Our studies demonstrate that early exposure is sufficient to affect genome regulation, even in the absence of phenotypic changes, and highlight a role for preventative dietary interventions. Supporting regions identified as sensitive to gestational exposure were replicated in human cohorts. Maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against damaging effects of early PA on DNA methylation.

**Conclusions:** Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure can affect genome regulation in offspring, even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes, highlighting a role for preventative dietary interventions. Regions identified as sensitive to gestational exposure were replicated in human cohorts. Maternal diet high folate and choline protected against damaging effects early PA on DNA methylation.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Selective Gene Silencing by Double-Stranded RNA (dsRNA) in Caenorhabditis elegans: An Intersecting Network of Regulators and Gene-Specific Requirements

**Research Question:** How do differences in gene-specific regulators contribute to the efficacy and resistance of RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabdis elegans?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of intersecting regulators, Mael domain protein R-10 (R-10), intrinsically disordered protein-16 (MUT-16), and Argonaute protein-3 (NR-3) in RNAi silencing in Caenorhabdis elegans using quantitative models and exploratory simulations.

**Findings:** Our results show that R-10, MUT-16, and NR-3 work together to silence somatic genes, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene. Notably, the requirement for NR-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. We found that (1) cis-regulatory elements of the target gene reduce dependence on NR-3, (2) animals recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and (3) cleavage and tailing mRNAs with U dinucleotides, which are templates for amplifying RNAs, are enriched in 'UG' zones matching dsRNA.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that intersecting regulators and gene-specific requirements contribute to selective silencing by endogenous RNAs. This is supported by extensive characterization of RNAi in Caenorhabdis elegans, making it a suitable system to examine how target and regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance. A pathway required for silencing response to dsRNA has been worked out in C elegans (Figure 1). The requirement for NR- but not MUT or R- can be bypassed by enhancing processing dsRNA, suggesting that loss NR has least impact on efficiency.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a dynamic model of RNA silencing by dsRNA with criteria for efficient silencing. The fact that three structurally and functionally different proteins are required for unc-22 silencing suggests each could contribute to silencing any RNA target. Similar mechanisms could generate other 22 RNAs independent R-10 (Yang et al, 2012; Zhang et al, 201). Future studies test each aspect of model. RNA is widely applied for silencing in plants, insects, humans, like C elegans, plants (San-Mra et al,202) and insects (Pinon et al).

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM) Mortality: A Whole-Genome Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Key Pathways and Predictors of Death

**Background:** Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a devastating complication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, yet the underlying mechanisms of mortality remain poorly understood. This study aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality, and identify predictors of death in Vietnamese adults with TBM, pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and healthy controls.

**Methods:** Whole-blood RNA sequencing was performed on 281 TBM, 295 PT, and 30 healthy controls. Weighted gene co-expression analysis identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Multivariate Cox regression selected predictors of death, followed by logistic regression and bootstrap validation.

**Findings:** Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T cell activation were associated with TBM mortality. HIV-positive individuals exhibited increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative showed elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular organization. Four genes (MMP1, N2, Z, C, and CD) were strong TBM predictors.

**Conclusion:** TBM induces a systemic response similar to PT, highlighting genes and pathways related to death, offering potential therapeutic targets and a novel biomarker for outcomes.

**Key Findings:**

* Common pathways involved in TBM mortality in HIV-positive and negative individuals
* Differences in death associated with expression of angiogenesis in HIV-positive and TN signaling in HIV-negative
* Four-gene signature as potential biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status
* Candidate predictors for HIV-negative TBM: combination of common genes, HIV-specific genes, age, T severity, and CSF lymphocyte count
* Three clinical factors associated with outcome: age, M grade, and CSF lymphocyte

**Implications:** This study characterizes global dysregulation in immune responses, including inflammation, and specific pathways involved in TBM and mechanisms leading to death. Understanding TBM pathogenesis by identifying pretreatment transcriptional modules associated with disease severity and mortality. Transcription profiles with T mortality stratified by HIV status.

**Title:** Assessing the Performance and Coverage of Commercial Antibodies in Biomedical Research: A Large-Scale Characterization of 614 Antibodies for 65 Neuroscience-Related Proteins

**Research Question:** How effective are commercial antibodies in detecting and characterizing proteins in biomedical research, and what is the scope of the problem of non-specific antibodies?

**Methods:** We developed a standardized approach using parental cell lines to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 neuroscience-related proteins in three common biomedical applications: Western blot (WB), immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunofluorescence (IF). We compared antibodies from multiple commercial partners side-by-side to evaluate specificity and performance.

**Findings:** (i) More than 50% of antibodies failed in one or more applications; (ii) ~50-75% of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing antibody, suggesting significant coverage; (iii) recombinant antibodies outperformed monoclonal and polyclonal. Hundreds of underperforming antibodies were used in published articles, raising concerns. Encouragingly, many manufacturers reassessed and altered or removed underperforming antibodies.

**Implications:** This study demonstrates the scale of the specificity problem and suggests an efficient strategy for achieving proteome coverage using the commercial repertoire and data for new antibody generation.

**Conclusions:** Our study provides an unbiased, scalable framework for representation and comparison of antibody performance, estimating coverage of proteins with renewable antibodies, assessing the value of characterization methods, and informing a strategy for identifying renewable antibodies for all proteins. We tested 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 proteins, finding two-thirds covered by at least one high-performing and half by at least high-per renewable, indicating significant coverage by high-per antibodies. This analysis assesses the problem and contributes to a comprehensive validation ecosystem.

**Title:** Enhancing Gene Expression Control in Drosophila: Combining GAL4/UAS with Binary Systems for Inter-Organ Communication Studies

**Research Question:** Can we develop a resource of reagents that facilitate the combined use of GAL4/UAS and binary systems in Drosophila, enabling researchers to control gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously?

**Methods:** We generated a set of over 40 LexA-GAL and Q2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in, verified their tissue specificity in larvae, and built constructs encoding Q2 and Lex-G transcription factors in a single vector. We integrated this construct into the fly genome and used FLP/F recombination to isolate lines expressing only Q2 or Lex-G. Using compatible shRNA vectors, we evaluated both Lex and Q systems for in vivo knockdown and generated a library of RNAi lines as a resource.

**Findings:** We successfully integrated the vector into the genome, generating a driver expressing both Q2 and Lex-G. Desired regions can be excised with Flp, resulting in flies expressing only Q or Lex-G. We evaluated both Q and Lex systems for in vivo knockdown and generated a library of transgenic shRNA lines in our QU and Lexop vectors as a resource.

**Implications:** These Lex and Q system vectors and fly lines provide new tools for researchers to activate or repress two genes orthogonally in the same animal, expanding the ability to study inter-organ communication in Dophila.

**Conclusions:** We have generated a set of stocks, vectors, and protocols that combined with GAL lines will greatly expand the ability of Doph researchers to modulate expression in multiple tissues. This resource will facilitate the study of complex biological processes, such as organ development, behavior, and disease, and improve our understanding of the intricate relationships between organs.

**Title:** Elucidating the Molecular Mechanisms of B11-Mediated Synaptic Dysfunction in Neurodevelopmental and Neuropsychiatric Disorders

**Research Question:** The transcription factor B11 (B11) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsych disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear.

**Methods:** We investigated the role of the synaptic organizer molecule Cql2, a direct target of B11, in regulating synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA synapses in vivo and vitro. We also examined the interaction between Cql and a specific variant of neurexin-3, Nrx3 (25+).

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that Cql exerts its functions through direct interaction with Nrx3 (25+). Interruption of Cql-Nrx (25) interaction by expression of a non-binding Cql mutant or deletion of Nrx in dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major B11 as well as Cql mutant phenotypes. This identifies a novel Cql-Nrx (25)-dependent pathway through which B11 controls moss fiber-CA synapse function.

**Implications:** This study contributes to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopment disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction. Our findings suggest that the B11/Cql/Nrx (25) pathway is essential for the structural and functional integrity of moss fiber synapses, connections between dentate gyrus granule and CA3 pyramidal neurons.

**Conclusions:** This study identifies a novel B11/Cql/Nrx (25)-dependent regulatory mechanism controlling moss fiber synapse function. Genetic studies suggest single components to be associated with neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction. Our data demonstrate these molecules interconnected in a regulatory pathway, providing insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders.

**Title:** Zinc Finger Protein S1 (S1) Regulates Transcription and mRNA Stability through Dual Mechanisms: A Paradigm for Cross-Talk between Synthesis and Decay

**Research Question:** How does the zinc finger protein S1 (S1) regulate transcription and mRNA stability, and what are the underlying mechanisms of its dual functions?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of S1 in transcriptional regulation and mRNA stability using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP), RNA sequencing (seq), and biochemical assays.

**Findings:** We found that S1 regulates transcription by binding to promoters and transcribed gene bodies, affecting RNA polymerase II (Pol) configuration and elongation. S1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally, stabilizing them. The interaction between S1 and mRNAs is controlled by their promoters and coincides with S1 dissociation from chromatin. Intriguingly, S1 dissociation from chromatin correlates with the extent of backtracked Pol. We propose that following promoter recruitment, S accompanies Pol and regulates backtracking.

**Implications:** S1's co-transcription binding imprints mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for cross-talk between synthesis and decay of mRNAs, and a paradigm for dual-role of zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between S1's modes of regulation remains to be examined.

**Conclusions:** S1 impacts mRNA life cycle from transcription to degradation. The S effect on elongation is linked to its function on mRNA stabilization, suggesting all functions are connected. S possesses two classical zinc fingers. The correlation between S binding to bodies and Pol occupancy in genes supports this notion. The capacity of S to alter Pol in context R4 and affect backtracking underlies its effect on transcription. Alteration in Pol configuration is reflected in increased backtracking, indicated by values. Binding S to bodies correlates Pol activity, particularly in CR+ genes. S function in subset genes extends beyond initiation and encompasses elongation, as proposed earlier. Interaction with chrom has effect on Pol elong and mRNAs, suggesting mechanistic linkage. The R4 subunit enhances Pol activity and promotes instability due co-transcriptional imprinting. Taking observations, back associated with co-binding S to nas RNA. Reassuring, genes exhibit S-dependent back also imprint S, whereas do not do not. Unexpected, in addition chrom feature, S binds subpopulation mRN whose transcription stimulated S-CRN.

**Key findings:**

* S1 regulates transcription by binding to promoters and transcribed gene bodies, affecting Pol configuration and elongation
* S binds subset mRN co-transcriptionally, stabilizing them
* Interaction between S and mRN controlled by promoters and coincides with S dissociation chrom
* S dissociation chrom correlates with extent backtracked Pol
* S accompanies Pol and regulates backtracking
* co-binding imprints mRNA fate, paradigm cross-talk synthesis and decay mRN, dual-role zincinger
* interplay S modes remains to be examined

**Title:** Developmentally Controlled Programmed Cell Death and Fungal Accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana Roots: Unveiling the Role of ANAC032/SMB and BFN1 in Restricting Microbial Invasion

**Research Question:** How do developmentally controlled programmed cell death (PCD) processes in Arabidopsis thalian roots influence fungal colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendita indica, and what are the roles of the root-specific transcription factors ANAC/SMB and senescence-associated nuclease BFN in this process?

**Methods:** We investigated the connection between PC and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis roots, focusing on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC/SMB and senescence nuclease BFN. Mutations in both PC regulators increased colonization by S. indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. Reporter and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN expression is downregulated during S colonization in mature epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism facilitating accommodation of beneficial microbes in roots.

**Findings:** Our results demonstrate that root PC and post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Smb-3 mutants exhibit hypercolonization around the merematic zone and delay S-induced root growth promotion. Additionally, BFN expression is downregulated in older epidermal cells during S colonization, suggesting a transcriptional control facilitating accommodation of beneficial microbes.

**Implications:** We propose that tight regulation of PC and rapid clearance of root cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the apical meristem. Furthermore, we show S downregulates B1 in older epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. Our results emphasize that beneficial microbes can modify plant PC processes to enhance colonization.

**Conclusions:** This study highlights the functional link between PC and microbial accommodation in roots. Impaired PC in Arabidopsis mutants increased colonization by the endophyte S. We show that PC protects the meristem from microbial colonization, but propose that adapted microbes manipulate host PC processes by affecting transcriptional expression of B1 to facilitate accommodation. Further investigation is needed to determine whether fungal effectors, signaling molecules, or systemic Arabopsis responses underlie B1 downregulation by S.

**Title:** Mechanical Forces Regulate Exosome Extrusion from Stressed Neurons: Implications for Neurodegenerative Disease

**Research Question:** How do mechanical forces regulate exosome extrusion from stressed neurons, and what are the implications for neurodegenerative disease?

**Methods:** We investigated the role of mechanical forces in regulating exosome extrusion from stressed neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and biophysical approaches. We analyzed the relationship between uterine occupation and exosome production in C. elegans, focusing on the ALMR neuron, which produces exosomes in response to stress.

**Findings:** We found that mechanical forces potentiate exosome extrusion from stressed C. elegans neurons. Exosome production from the ALMR neuron peaks at day 2-3, coinciding with C. eleg reproductive peak. Disruption of C. germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early production strongly suppresses exosome extrusion from ALMR during peak. Conversely, restoring egg production at late reproductive phase through mating or inducing retention can increase AL exosome production. Interventions promoting AL exosome production are associated with expanded uter lengths, while suppressing ex production is associated with shorter uter lengths. Fertilized eggs, oocytes, dead eggs, or fluid can enhance exosome production, but presence of fertilized eggs is not required.

**Implications:** Our findings suggest that mechanical uter occupation potentiates exosome extrusion from proximal stressed neurons, highlighting the importance of mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease. The requirement of sperm and oocytes for exosome production raises questions about the role of fertilized eggs in exogenesis. We propose that mechanical forces, rather than fertilized eggs, constitute the ex-inducing stimulus.

**Conclusions:** Our results draw attention to the significance of mechanical signaling in exosome production and spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of mechanical forces in neurodegenerative disease, particularly in the context of exosome spreading and aggregate formation.

**Title:** Investigating the Role of Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) in Alzheimer's Disease: A Novel Insights into Synaptic Defects and Memory Impairment

**Research Question:** Does Dickkop-3 (DKK), a secreted Wnt antagonist, contribute to synaptic defects and memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD)?

**Methods:** We investigated the expression and function of DKK in healthy and AD brains, using immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and behavioral studies in hAPP-J20 and hAPP-NL-FL-F mouse models.

**Findings:** DKK expression is upregulated in AD brains, and extracellular DKK levels increase early in the disease. DKK accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around amyloid plaques. Functionally, DKK triggers loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via W/JNK pathway. In contrast, DKK knockdown restores synapse and memory in hAPP-J20 mice.

**Implications:** Our findings identify DKK as a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD. DKK regulates stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus through different signaling pathways. DKK loss-of-function ameliorates synaptic defects in J20 mice, supporting hypothesis that DKK is a key contributor to synaptic changes in this AD model.

**Conclusions:** DKK plays a critical role in the integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains. Synapse loss is the strongest correlate cognitive impairment in AD, but mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms contributing to synapse vulnerability in AD. DKK knockdown does not affect number or size amyloid plaques in J hippocampus. Gain-of-function studies demonstrate DKK directly affects integrity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses.

**Title:** Harnessing the Power of Siderophores: Iron-Chelating Pyoverines from Pseudomonas spp. as a Novel Class of Sustainable Antibacterials against Opportunistic Pathogens

**Research Question:** Can siderophores, specifically iron-chelating pyoverines produced by non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp., exhibit antibacterial properties against human opportunistic pathogens by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest?

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive screen of 320 Pseudomonas isolates against 12 human opportunistic pathogens to identify pyoverines with high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverine was evaluated for its efficacy against Acinetobacter baumannii, Klei pneumoniae, and Staphlococcus aureus in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, we assessed pyoverine survival in infected Galleria mellella larvae and mammalian cell lines and erythrocytes.

**Findings:** Our results show that pyines from environmental Pseudas spp. exhibit strong antibacterial properties by sequestering iron from pathogens. Five pyines with broad-spectrum activity were identified, with the most potent pyine reducing growth of A. baumannii, K. pneumonia, and S. aureus in a concentration-dependent manner. Pyine increased survival of infected G. mellella larvae and showed low toxicity to mammalian cell lines and erythrocytes. Whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution to pyines compared to antibiotics.

**Implications:** Pyines from non-pathogenic Pseudas have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against human opportunistic pathogens. Our findings support the concept of siderore-mediated competition in natural communities applied to human pathogens. We propose pyines as potent agents to reduce growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the antibacterial properties of pyines produced by Pseudas spp. against human opportunistic pathogens through iron sequestration. Pyines from non-pathogenic Pseudas could become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against human pathogens. Our results highlight the potential of pyines as a novel approach to combat antibiotic resistance.

**Title:** Elucidating the Mechanisms of Prefrontal Network Failure in Schizophrenia: A Recurrent Spiking Network Model Explains NMD Synaptic and 0ag Synchrony Deficits

**Research Question:** Schizophrenia is characterized by a failure of prefrontal networks, yet the underlying disruptions at synaptic level remain poorly understood, hindering our comprehension of genetic and environmental risk factors influencing prefront network failure.

**Methods:** We developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal circuits to investigate the link between NMD synaptic and 0ag synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefront failure schizophrenia. We analyzed the balance between AMPA and NMD components of recurrent excitation and G inhibition on oscillatory spike synchrony, informing biological data.

**Findings:** Reducing NMD synaptic currents prevented the network from shifting to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, paralleling dynamic modulation of 0ag synchrony observed in monkey prefront cortex and suppression by NMD antagonists. Our model provides a plausible mechanism linking NMD synaptic and 0ag synchron deficits in pharmacological monkey prefront schizophrenia.

**Implications:** This study establishes a theoretical basis for how NMD synaptic reduction in schizophrenia leads to desynchronization in prefront recurrent circuits, providing evidence that spiking networks near the boundary between asynchronous and synchronous states explain biological observations. Reducing NMD currents prevents oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, preventing 0ag synchrony emergence.

**Conclusions:** Our spiking network model elucidates mechanisms mediating the link between NMD synaptic malfunction and reduced 0ag spiking, observed in biological data. The emergence of 0ag spiking between prefront neurons when inputs push the network across state, and failure of spiking between prefront when NMD currents are reduced, as observed in primate prefront recordings. This study addresses the gap in understanding how genetic and environmental factors alter prefront function in schizophrenia, providing a framework for future research.

**Title:** Unveiling the Dynamics of Tip-Stalk Cell Patterning in Angiogenesis: An Order-Disorder Transition and Turing-Like Mechanisms

**Research Question:** How does the spatial patterning of Tip-St cell fate in angiogenesis undergo an order-dis transition in response to high levels of pro-angiogenic VEGF, and what are the underlying mechanisms driving this process?

**Methods:** We combined an experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses to investigate the dynamics of Tip-St cell patterning in response to varying levels of VEGF.

**Findings:** We found that at high levels of VEG, the Tip-St patter undergoes an order-dis transition, resulting in robust but temporally unstable differentiation of cells, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprouting extensions. Moreover, sprouts form in a manner maximizing their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model dependent on fibronectin enrichment.

**Implications:** Our results suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates robust cell differentiation but not instructive steps in angiogenesis, requiring additional cues and self-organization mechanisms. This analysis contributes to understanding cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and complex morphogenic processes.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals a dynamic view of angiogenic induction, where VEG input induces NOT signaling and Tip cells can behave as sprouts. Inputs specifying cell fate can be contradictory, e.g., proangiogenic VEG promoting Tip fate and NOT signaling by neighboring cells promoting St fate and suppressing Tip identity. This underscores the need for refined models integrating biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-St fate.

**Title:** Unveiling the Role of Locus Coeruleus-Hippocampus Communication in Learning and Memory Formation: A Novel Insights into the Timing and Neurotransmitters Involved

**Research Question:** What is the precise timing of locus coeruleus (LC)-hippocampus communication during learning and which neurotransmitters are crucial for memory formation in the hippocampus?

**Methods:** We investigated the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace conditioning in mice using optogenetic stimulation and pharmacological approaches.

**Findings:** Our results show that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli, amplifying responses with optogenetic stimulation enhancing long-term memory formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LC activity increases norepinephrine and dopamine in the hippocampus, and the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during fear conditioning is similar to LC activity. Notably, hippocal dopamine is important for fear memory, while norephrine is not.

**Implications:** These findings suggest that LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning events, enhancing long-term memory formation. Our data indicate that dopamine, not norephrine, is released into the hippocampus during these responses, although direct manipulation of this projection is required to confirm. We provide evidence that LC activity increases both dopamine and noreph content in the hippocampus, and dopamine is required for fear memory, while noreph is not.

**Conclusions:** Our study reveals the critical role of LC-hipocampus communication in learning and memory, highlighting the importance of dopamine in trace memory formation. These findings have implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of learning and memory, particularly in the context of fear conditioning, and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for memory-related disorders.
