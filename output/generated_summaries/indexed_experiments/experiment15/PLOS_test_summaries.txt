Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of cases of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), also known as sleeping sickness, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over the past two decades. Despite this progress, pockets of infection remain, and it is essential to assess whether different regions are on track for elimination and where intervention efforts should be focused. A previously developed stochastic mathematical model for gHAT in the DRC was used to analyze data from 16 health areas in the Mosango health zone in Kwilu province. The model was fitted to the data using a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology, allowing for the quantification of uncertainty in the results. The analysis revealed that the health area of Kinzamba II, which accounts for approximately one-third of the health zone's cases, is expected to have the latest expected year for elimination of transmission (EoT) under current intervention strategies. The study suggests that expanding health area fitting to cover more of the DRC should be done using deterministic fits for efficiency, but stochastic projections should be used to capture both parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations. This approach provides a new framework for highly detailed calibration and projections of future gHAT infections for various intervention scenarios.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze tumor microenvironments (TMEs) to better understand cancer and predict patient outcomes. TMEs contain a vast amount of information about a patient's cancer, including the cellular composition and spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations. By exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups, researchers can identify specific interactions that are useful in making predictions about patient survival and treatment success with emerging immunotherapies. To achieve this, the researchers used spatial K functions to summarize the spatial relationships in the TME, and then applied functional data analysis and random forest models to predict outcomes and identify important spatial relationships. This approach was tested on simulated data and found to be effective in identifying important spatial interactions while controlling the false discovery rate. The researchers then applied this approach to real data from triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients, using multiplexed ion beam imaging. The results showed that the approach was able to identify significant differences in the distribution of cell phenotypes and protein antigens between patient groups, and predict which group a new patient belonged to based on their TME and meta-data. This approach has the potential to guide therapeutic interventions and improve patient outcomes. The methods used in this study are publicly available in a companion R package called funkycells.
Researchers investigated how abnormal neural synchronization affects brain function in various disorders. They used computational models to study how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-evolve, particularly during synchronization and desynchronization processes. The study focused on the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic structural plasticity (hSP), on network behavior.

The researchers created a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with varying synaptic weight and structural plasticity mechanisms. They found that structural reorganization can significantly enhance network synchrony, particularly when weaker connections are eliminated through weight-dependent pruning. This process allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections, resulting in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity.

The study also compared the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in networks with STDP-only and those with a combination of STDP and hSP or structural plasticity. The latter required significantly higher intensity stimuli to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future studies on inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms in disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

The researchers employed a simple stochastic structural plasticity model to accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and structural plasticity. They compared their method with a prevailing method, Butz and van Ooyen SP (BvOSP), and found similar network dynamics. The study highlights the importance of considering the complex interactions between neuronal dynamics and synaptic plasticity during transitions to and in steady synchronized states in plastic neuronal networks.
Researchers have identified a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians, a type of flatworm. In planarians, neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors. The study found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing a specific gene, delta-2, at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. These delta-2-expressing neurons then instruct phagocytic progenitors to differentiate into glia. The researchers discovered that inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1, a gene involved in cell-fate specification, severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types. The study suggests that the interaction between delta-2-expressing neurons and notch-1-expressing phagocytic progenitors is crucial for the coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia. This mechanism allows for the restoration of the pattern, numbers, and wiring of diverse neuron classes in planarians. The researchers propose a model in which patterned expression of delta-2 in neurons interacts with notch-1-expressing phagocytic progenitors to accomplish coordinated regeneration of planarian neurons and glia. This mechanism may also facilitate the evolution of new configurations of glia in the nervous system by allowing neurons to acquire or lose expression of delta-2 and access dispersed phagocytic progenitors.
Researchers investigated the role of gamma-delta (γδ) T cells in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV. They analyzed blood samples from individuals who were previously identified as either "broad" or "non-broad" neutralizers. The study found significant differences in the expression of certain surface markers on γδ T cells between the two groups. Specifically, participants who developed bNAbs had higher levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells during acute HIV infection (AHI). These markers were associated with the development of bNAbs years later. Additionally, the study found that the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells were linked to the early production of IgM antibodies against the HIV envelope protein (Env). The researchers also observed that Vδ2 T cells were reduced during early AHI in participants who developed bNAbs, and this reduction was associated with higher viral loads. The study suggests that γδ T cells may play a role in promoting the development of bNAbs, which could have implications for HIV vaccine strategies. The findings indicate that targeting γδ T cells may help improve vaccine-induced humoral immune responses, particularly the induction of broad and potent neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 Env. Overall, the study provides new insights into the relationship between γδ T cells and the development of bNAbs, which could inform the development of more effective HIV vaccines.
Researchers have developed a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, that targets two key cell surface receptors, IL-6Rα and IL-8RB, implicated in a synergistic pathway that drives tumor metastasis. The BS1 antibody combines the variable domains of two distinct antibodies: tocilizumab, which targets IL-6R, and 10H2, which targets IL-8R. In preclinical mouse models of cancer, blockade of IL-6 and IL-8 receptors with BS1 significantly reduced metastatic burden.

A quantitative, computational model of the BS1 bispecific antibody was developed to understand the mechanisms underlying its binding and inhibition. The model simulates the binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors, providing insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects. The results demonstrate how the balance of binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes drives receptor inhibition.

Simulations of BS1 binding over a range of initial antibody concentrations and for cells with differing levels of combined IL-6R and IL-8R expression revealed that the relative amount of the two target receptors is critical for bispecific antibody binding. When IL-6R and IL-8R are present in a 1:1 ratio, bispecific antibody binding is nearly identical to the binding of the combination of anti-IL-6R and anti-IL-8R monospecific antibodies. These findings provide important predictions for effective therapeutic design and suggest that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and their receptors is a promising approach to inhibiting tumor metastasis and cancer lethality.
Researchers investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase, in the assembly and stability of acentrosomal spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. Acentrosomal spindles lack centrosomes, which are essential for spindle organization in most cell types. The study found that ZYG-8 depletion resulted in overelongated spindles with defects in pole and midspindle formation. Experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle, suggesting a potential role for ZYG-8 in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5. Additionally, the study found that ZYG-8 is required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle and that its kinase activity is necessary for its function during both meiosis and mitosis. The researchers propose that ZYG-8 plays two key roles in oocytes: regulating microtubule dynamics and influencing the activity of motors that walk along microtubules to tune the forces that build and stabilize the spindle. ZYG-8 contains a microtubule-binding doublecortin domain and a kinase domain, and previous studies have shown that it is required for proper spindle positioning in mitotically dividing embryos. The study's findings provide new insights into the functions of a doublecortin-family protein in cell division and shed light on how forces are balanced within acentrosomal spindles.
Researchers investigated the relationship between type 2 diabetes (T2D), metabolite levels, and genetic regulation using data from the UK Biobank and the Estonian Biobank. They analyzed 249 metabolites, primarily lipids and lipoproteins, and found 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D. In contrast, twice as many metabolites were found to be causally affected by T2D liability, spanning various metabolite classes, including branched-chain amino acids. The study also identified four metabolites with genetic loci that showed attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls, suggesting that T2D affects the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Furthermore, the researchers found 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few distinguishing between complication classes. Notably, 40 of these metabolites were not causally linked to T2D in either direction, indicating biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. The study provides a comprehensive map of the consequences of T2D on targeted metabolite levels and their genetic regulation, shedding light on the T2D trajectory leading to complications. The findings suggest that T2D affects the genetic regulation of metabolite levels, rather than the other way around, and highlight the importance of considering the complex interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2D risk.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to tolerance to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in mice. They crossed two strains of mice, CC061, which is highly susceptible to MRSA, and CC024, which is tolerant, to generate F1 and F2 populations. The F1 and F2 mice were infected with MRSA USA300, and their survival rates and weight changes were monitored. The results showed that the F1 and F2 mice exhibited a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype, with 65% and 55% survival rates, respectively. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents, suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors.

A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) peak was identified on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection. The WSB/EiJ allele, present in CC024 mice, contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, were found to have high-impact variants in this region. These genes are receptors for the complement factor C5a, an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response. The researchers hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice, reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival.
Researchers investigated how genetic networks influence adaptation in a population by modeling a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network, the negative autoregulation motif. They used forward-time genetic simulations to measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. The study found that both models had fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected, and the network model exhibited a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations, with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. The results suggest that interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects. The study also found that both network and additive models exhibited similarities in key aspects of their adaptive walks, such as the number of adaptive steps and the distribution of fitness effects among both fixations and beneficial mutations. However, the network model approached the optimum more slowly than additive models on average. The study highlights the importance of considering genetic networks in understanding adaptation, particularly in the study of the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations during adaptive walks.
Researchers have proposed a new understanding of how the brain integrates information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. They suggest that neurons and synapses are naturally equipped to optimally perform this integration according to Bayesian probability theory. In this framework, apical dendrites represent prior expectations and basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials, which are parametrized by local quantities such as effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances. The somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior, and a gradient-based plasticity rule allows neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. This theory explains various experimental findings on multi-sensory integration and makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity. The researchers demonstrated that conductance-based neuron models naturally compute posterior distributions from Gaussian likelihood functions and prior represented in dendritic compartments. They derived somatic membrane dynamics from stochastic gradient ascent on this posterior distribution and synaptic plasticity from matching the posterior to a target distribution. The theory predicts neuronal response properties that differ from those of classical neuron models, and simulations demonstrate successful learning of a prototypical multisensory integration task. This framework suggests that synaptic plasticity tries to match bottom-up input to top-down expectations, and a probabilistic view of single neuron computation yields the same somatic membrane potential dynamics. The assumption of Gaussian likelihoods and priors reflects the fact that the summation of many independent synaptic inputs generally yields a normal distribution, in agreement with experimental data.
Researchers have used the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) to classify domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database. The study aimed to explore the detection and cataloging of domains from these proteomes, which include a wide selection of model organisms such as zebrafish, fruit flies, and E. coli. On average, the researchers were able to provide positive classification for 90% of residues in all proteomes, classifying 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins comprised of over 226,424,000 amino acid residues.

The study found that eukaryotes have a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains compared to bacteria. Additionally, eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small repeats. The researchers identified highly populated domains that are shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria, such as the Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains.

The study also compared the sampling of homologous groups from the whole proteome set against the stable ECOD reference and discussed groups that have been enriched by structure predictions. The results suggest that highly accurate structure predictions are facilitating convergence between sequence and structural classifications, particularly among larger well-understood protein families. However, among less populated homologous groups, structural domain classification is still finding domains previously unannotated by sequence domain classifications. The study's findings have implications for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets.
Researchers investigated the life cycle of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), a major cause of kidney transplant failure for which there are no antiviral treatments. They used single-cell analysis to study the expression of the viral TAg (large T antigen) throughout the cell cycle. Contrary to the current model, which suggests that TAg expression promotes cells to enter the S phase for viral replication, the study found that robust TAg expression requires the replication of the host DNA first. The researchers used inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication to show that both TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase. BKPyV is known to promote cellular re-replication, where the cell re-enters the S phase from the G2 phase without passing through mitosis or G1 phase, resulting in cells with greater than 4N DNA content. The study found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA rely on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators despite BKPyV infection. The findings suggest a new model for polyomavirus replication, where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication. This understanding of the molecular events required for BKPyV production may help identify effective therapeutic targets against the virus.
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, existing TWAS approaches primarily focus on marginal analyses, examining one gene at a time, which may lead to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, a novel TWAS fine-mapping method called FABIO (Fine-mApping of causal genes for BInary Outcomes) has been developed. FABIO is specifically designed for binary traits and can model all genes jointly on an entire chromosome, accounting for genetically regulated expression (GReX) correlations among genes.

FABIO employs a probit model to directly link GReX of genes to binary outcomes, effectively controlling false discoveries and offering substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches. The method was evaluated through extensive simulations and applied to in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank. Results showed that FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27.9%-36.9% over existing approaches across traits. FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension. Overall, FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits, offering improved power and accuracy compared to existing methods.
This study investigated the roles of Btn2 and Hsp42, two protein sequestrases, in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress conditions. Oxidative stress, induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure, leads to protein misfolding and aggregation. The study found that Btn2 and Hsp42 play a crucial role in sequestering misfolded proteins into defined proteostasis quality control (PQC) sites, preventing their accumulation and potential toxicity. In the absence of Btn2 and Hsp42, cells become sensitive to oxidative stress and accumulate protein aggregates. The study identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as a substrate of Btn2 and Hsp42, and showed that these sequestrases suppress the formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, an amyloid form of Sup35, under oxidative stress conditions. The absence of Btn2 and Hsp42 leads to the formation of both amorphous and amyloid Sup35 aggregates, suggesting that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress. The study concludes that protein sequestration is a key antioxidant defense mechanism that mitigates the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation. The findings highlight the importance of Btn2 and Hsp42 in maintaining proteostasis and preventing protein misfolding diseases.
Researchers conducted a large-scale CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screen to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in glioblastoma (GBM) invasion. While previous studies have focused on coding genes, this study aimed to evaluate the role of lncRNAs in GBM invasion. The researchers used CRISPRi to knockdown 2,307 candidate lncRNAs and assess their association with invasion capacity in Matrigel. The top candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown in three tumor lines.

Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with a decrease in invasion upon knockdown, with the top candidate, LINC03045, demonstrating an 82.7% decrease in tumor cell invasion. LINC03045 expression was also significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that WASF3, a gene previously implicated in tumor invasion, was highly correlated with LINC03045 expression. Knockdown of WASF3 was associated with a significant decrease in invasion, and overexpression of WASF3 rescued the invasive function lost with LINC03045 knockdown.

The study identified LINC03045 as a critical lncRNA involved in GBM invasion, and its expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival. The results suggest that LINC03045 may regulate invasion via WASF3. This study provides new insights into the role of lncRNAs in GBM invasion and identifies LINC03045 as a potential therapeutic target.
Researchers investigated how the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of auditory stimuli. They used electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain. A new clustering procedure was developed to identify patterns in the EEG data, which indicated that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus to build a model. This suggests that the brain relies on the repetition of strong beats in a stochastic sequence of auditory stimuli to select a model of the sequence. The study aimed to identify the classes of models used by the brain to organize the statistical regularities of sequences of stimuli, which remains an open question in the field. Previous studies have assumed specific classes of models, but this research provides evidence for a more general approach. The clustering procedure allowed the researchers to extract regularities from the EEG data that matched the algorithm used to generate the random sequence of stimuli. This study contributes to our understanding of how the brain processes and models complex auditory sequences.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at the single-cell level. However, it has limitations when applied to highly heterogeneous solid tissues and organs, which require cell dissociation for analysis. This can lead to discrepancies between bulk RNA-seq results and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq results using composite scRNA-seq data. To address this issue, researchers have developed a computational method to calculate cell type-specific weighting factors (cWFs), which account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size and cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression.

The cWFs were computed for 76 cell types across 10 solid organs and validated using five methods, including reconstitution, deconvolution, comparison with experimentally measured transcript contents, independence from differential cell-type ratios, and prediction using unmatched organ RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. The results show that cWFs accurately reconstitute and deconvolve whole-organ RNA-seq data using composite scRNA-seq data weighted by the corresponding cWFs. Additionally, cWFs effectively predict aging progression, suggesting their potential diagnostic applications and association with aging mechanisms. This study provides an important method to overcome the limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues and organs, and highlights the diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) extends this approach to estimate the direct effects of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, both MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants, which violate one of the core assumptions of instrumental variables. To address this issue, researchers have proposed a radial formulation of MVMR, which allows for the visualisation of the effects obtained in MVMR and the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are outlying based on their association with all exposures.

The radial MVMR approach includes an adapted Galbraith radial plot, which enables the visualisation of the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis. Additionally, radial MVMR includes an option for the removal of outlying SNPs that may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR. A corresponding R package, RMVMR, has been developed to implement the radial MVMR methods. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses, highlighting its ability to visualise causal effect estimates and provide valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR. The radial MVMR approach is particularly useful for identifying SNPs that contribute to global heterogeneity with respect to each included exposure.
Researchers studied the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, also known as fruit flies, over a period of up to 7 days. They used a high-speed camera to record the flies' movements at 100 frames per second, creating a dataset of nearly 2 billion pose instances. The team used a deep learning framework called SLEAP to analyze the data and identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion. They found distinct daily patterns in these behaviors, including trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed.

The study revealed that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies' daily pattern of behavior, and that this time point tracks well with other indicators of health, such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spent moving versus resting. The researchers also found a general decline in proboscis extension and locomotion speed as the fraction of time spent in an idle state increases across days. Additionally, they identified differences in behavioral patterns during the morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily in the grooming component of behavior.

The study provides a new and clearer picture of D. melanogaster behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms. The findings suggest that the flies' circadian cycle is more complex than previously thought, with distinct daily patterns in all measured behaviors, including grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion speed.
Researchers have explored the role of protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type (PTPNs) in the adaptive immune system, but their functions beyond immunoregulation are not well understood. In this study, the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22 was found to have novel functions in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. A non-biased genetic screen identified PTPN-22 as a suppressor of molting defects caused by mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 and NEKL-3, which are involved in membrane trafficking and actin regulation. Proximity labeling studies revealed that PTPN-22 interacts with the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1, and loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed molting defects. PTPN-22 was found to be involved in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes, suggesting a role in maintaining tissue structural integrity. Additionally, PTPN-22 was implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline, where nearly one-third of proteins identified by PTPN-22 proximity labeling are known P granule components. These findings highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions.
Researchers have developed a geostatistical model to predict the spread of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia, a major challenge to malaria elimination efforts. The model uses data from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) gene, which is associated with artemisinin resistance. The study found that the K13 mutation has expanded across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022, with the most significant spatial change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The researchers used a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance, resulting in maps that show the estimated prevalence of the K13 mutation across the region. These maps provide critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia by enabling improved spatial decision support systems on a fine-scale spatial resolution. The study's predictive maps are the first of their kind for artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia and can be used by health organizations to guide the prioritization of surveillance for resistance and policies to improve treatment and prevent the further spread of resistance. The results are consistent with earlier modeling work and underlying data collected to assess the spread of artemisinin resistance.
Researchers have investigated the function-to-find domain (FIIND)-containing proteins, including NLRP1 and CARD8, which play a crucial role in the innate immune response through the inflammasome signaling pathway. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain, resulting in full-length (FL), cleaved N-terminal (NT), and cleaved C-terminal (CT) peptides that form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. The study found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. The Linker3 region in murine NLRP1b (mNLRP1b) and the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 (rNLRP1) and CARD8 mediate these interactions. Additionally, the study explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 (DPP9) in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure. DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains, forming NT-DPP9-CT complexes. However, DPP9 does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. The study provides new insights into the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation, highlighting the complexity of their interactions within the immune response.
Researchers investigated the role of Rer1, a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartments, in regulating protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. They found that loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress, characterized by the activation of the PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). This stress triggers the elimination of Rer1-deficient cells through cell competition, a process where healthier cells outcompete and eliminate compromised cells in growing tissues. The study also showed that Rer1 levels are upregulated in response to Myc-overexpression, which causes overgrowth, and that this upregulation provides cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating proteotoxic stress. The results suggest that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and plays a crucial role in competitive cell survival. The findings are consistent with previous studies in yeast, worms, and mouse cerebral cortex, which have shown that Rer1 deficiency induces ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Rer1 in maintaining protein homeostasis and regulating cell competition in developing tissues.
Researchers investigated the impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) on the function of the CHEK2 protein, which is associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. They used a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS) to test all but two of the 4,887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. The study found that 770 of the non-synonymous changes were damaging to protein function, while 2,417 were tolerated. The results correlated well with previous structure and function data and provided a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. This approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes. The study used a comprehensive library of CHEK2 coding variants created by error-prone PCR, screened the library en masse for rad53 complementation, and used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify complementors in the selected yeast. The results from the rad53 complementation screen correlated well with known function or pathogenicity and were used to functionally classify the 3,187 unique amino acid changes that result from non-synonymous SNVs.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae regulates its epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. The pathogen forms multiple intra-populations with distinct epigenetic and phenotypic traits, such as colony opacity, due to invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant (cod) locus. The researchers found that the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin (TA) system regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, thereby controlling the bacterial epigenome and associated traits. The SpxA1-TenA system is a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, where the toxin TenA is transcriptionally repressed by its antitoxin SpxA1. Overexpression of TenA led to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae, while the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon. The researchers found that TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, reducing the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX, which in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, favoring the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus. The SpxA1-TenA system acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity due to spontaneous variations in the number of AT dinucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon.
Researchers have developed a new method called generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA) to compare two high-dimensional datasets collected under different experimental conditions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), are limited to analyzing one dataset at a time. Contrastive PCA (cPCA) was previously proposed to address this issue, but it requires tuning a hyperparameter, resulting in multiple possible solutions with no clear indication of which is correct. Additionally, cPCA treats the foreground and background conditions asymmetrically, making it unsuitable for comparing two experimental conditions symmetrically.

The new gcPCA method eliminates the need for a hyperparameter, making it a more flexible and reliable approach. It achieves this by introducing a normalization factor to mitigate the bias towards high-variance dimensions. The gcPCA toolbox, available in Python and MATLAB, provides several variants of the method tailored for different scenarios. The authors demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, including the unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and the heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data.

gcPCA is a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method that facilitates the analysis of high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena. It can be used to identify dimensions that exhibit the largest relative changes in variance between conditions, allowing researchers to answer subtle and detailed questions, such as which subsets of neurons or genes are more likely to be up- or downregulated in one condition compared to another.
Researchers have developed a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells, a type of B cell lymphoma. The model reveals feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. This crosstalk was verified in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. The model was also tested in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines with aberrant BCR signaling, showing that BCR aberration does not cause major downstream rewiring. The researchers found that the BL-2-derived network structure forms a solid base to describe signaling networks in DLBCL cell lines. Despite discovering feedbacks and crosstalks in ERK and p38 signaling, no cellular dependency was found in the studied cell lines. However, these signaling motifs are conserved across different B cell lymphoma types, suggesting that insights from this study may apply to other B cell lymphomas. The model was improved by discovering three novel connections: a positive crosstalk from mTOR to JNK, a positive feedback from GSK3 to ZAP70, and a negative crosstalk from p38 on or above RAF/MEK/ERK.
Researchers have investigated the Notch receptor signalling network, which plays a crucial role in tissue growth and maintenance. Notch receptor activity is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: intercellular transactivation and intracellular cis inhibition. The study focused on the Notch ligands DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Using a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, the researchers found that DLL4 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation, while JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. This heteromeric complex enables angiogenic sprouting by regulating the functional differentiation of endothelial cells into leading edge tip cells and trailing stalk cells. The study proposes a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells, which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. The findings suggest that JAG1 directly antagonizes the function of DLL4 through the formation of heteromeric DLL4-JAG1 complexes, which could underlie the observed opposing effects of JAG1 and DLL4 in sprouting angiogenesis. The study contributes to the understanding of Notch signalling and its role in angiogenic patterning, and highlights the importance of heteromeric complexes in regulating Notch receptor activity.
Researchers have developed a new clustering method called Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPMUnc) that takes into account the uncertainty associated with data points. This method is an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm and has been shown to outperform existing methods on simulated data. The researchers applied DPMUnc to cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, which have uncertainty linked to the sample size of the study. DPMUnc successfully separated autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and identified other subgroups, such as adult-onset arthritis.

The researchers also explored the use of DPMUnc to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarized using gene signatures. They introduced a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different from the one where it was discovered, which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. This procedure was applied to three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. The results showed association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets.

The significance of this work lies in demonstrating that when data has associated uncertainty, this uncertainty should be used to inform clustering, and presenting a method that does this, DPMUnc. Additionally, the researchers presented a procedure for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were originally defined, showing the value of this procedure by summarizing gene expression data from patients with IMD using relevant gene signatures and clustering these patients using DPMUnc.
Deep neural networks have been successful in modeling the primate visual system, but they fail to account for the strong shape dependence of primate vision. This is because they rely more heavily on features such as color and texture rather than shape. Researchers designed artificial image datasets where shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict image class, and trained networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations. The results show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, while others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards other features. The bias can be explained by the interactions between weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) developed a bias towards color and texture features, even though they were able to learn shape-based classification. The bias arises from the dynamics of gradient descent learning, specifically from the way that gradients for color and texture features align with image classes. Reducing the alignment between color- and texture-selective gradients enables networks to learn shape-based classification.
Researchers have developed a rule-based model to study the dynamics of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) during liver fibrosis and reversion. Liver fibrosis is a condition characterized by the overproduction of extracellular matrix, leading to impaired liver function in chronic liver diseases. The model uses the Kappa graph rewriting language to simulate the interactions between HSCs and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) molecules, which regulate HSC activation and type I collagen secretion. The model reveals the critical role of HSC inactivation in fibrosis progression and reversion, and shows that reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs (iHSCs) are required to sustain fibrosis. The model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. Using experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, the predicted ECM dynamics were validated. Furthermore, analysis of RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis confirmed the accumulation of iHSCs, identifying them as novel markers of fibrosis progression. This study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease, which can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis. The model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a novel meta-analysis framework to estimate the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, such as gene expression, on complex human traits and diseases. This framework is particularly useful for large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, which comprises multiple cohorts with diverse technologies. The proposed method leverages the asymptotic standard error of the R-squared (R2)-based mediation effect estimation and can account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to varying genomic profiling platforms.

The method was applied to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The results showed that the developed method was more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity.

The meta-analysis framework is available in the R package MetaR2M on GitHub and can be used to estimate the total mediation effect in high-dimensional settings. It can also characterize the overall mediation effect and is applicable to individual significant mediators. The method can be used to evaluate potential heterogeneity across risk factors for common diseases and genomic profiling technologies, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field of genomics and precision medicine.
Researchers have developed a novel method called PDRWH to identify personalized driver genes responsible for cancer development in individual patients. Unlike existing methods that provide a single list of driver genes for a group of patients, PDRWH prioritizes the mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on downstream gene expression across a group of patients with similar genetic mutations and gene expression profiles. The method was tested on 16 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and outperformed existing individual-level and cohort-level methods in identifying known and novel driver genes. PDRWH was able to identify both common and rare drivers, providing a more comprehensive understanding of tumor heterogeneity. The personalized driver profiles generated by PDRWH can improve tumor stratification and aid in the development of targeted treatments. The method was also validated through in vitro cell-based assays, which demonstrated the promoting effect of high expression of the Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on tumor cell proliferation. PDRWH's ability to leverage higher-order relationships between mutated genes and abnormally expressed genes is a significant improvement over existing methods, which often overlook the shared carcinogenic mechanisms among patients with the same driver gene mutations. The results suggest that PDRWH has the potential to assist in the development of optimal personalized treatments for cancer patients.
Researchers have developed a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy, known as the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP), which combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. The VEP generates spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods, allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. A global optimization approach was used to calibrate the VEP models, utilizing a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm called SaCeSS, which enables parallel computation and yields high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. The approach was tested on synthetic data and demonstrated better scalability and superior performance compared to other parallel solvers. Additionally, a Bayesian optimization framework was used for hyperparameter tuning, resulting in significant gains in accuracy and computational cost. An uncertainty quantification phase was also added to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. This study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making. The VEP is a model-based approach that relies on estimating parameters in a high-dimensional state-space representation to accurately identify the network of epileptogenic zones (EZ/PZ) in the brain. By accurately capturing diverse seizure dynamics and generating computer simulations resembling intracranial EEG recordings, the VEP offers a versatile platform to optimize surgical strategy and aid in clinical decision-making.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth in rabbit lungs using a novel, virulent clinical isolate, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid, pBP10. The study aimed to quantify rates of Mtb replication and death in the lungs of infected rabbits. In vitro experiments showed that pBP10 was more stable in HN878 than in a commonly used laboratory-adapted strain, H37Rv. However, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in rabbit lungs did not follow a monotonic decline, instead increasing between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remaining stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection. Mathematical modeling suggested that this non-monotonic change could be explained by the presence of multiple sub-populations of Mtb with different replication and death kinetics. One sub-population expanded early and was controlled, while another, smaller population expanded at later times, causing an increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. The study also found that the HN878 strain formed well-circumscribed granulomas in rabbit lungs, suggesting independent bacterial dynamics within these granulomas. The results highlight differences in Mtb dynamics between rabbits and mice, emphasizing that "rabbits are not mice." The study provides new insights into Mtb growth dynamics in TB granulomas and opens avenues for future research, including correlating estimated replication and death rates with immune response components in individual granulomas.
Researchers have developed a computational tool called GlycanTreeModeler to predict and design glycan structures, which are complex sugar molecules attached to proteins. Glycans play crucial roles in various biological functions, but determining their structures experimentally is challenging. The GlycanTreeModeler algorithm builds glycan structures layer by layer, using data from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations. It was tested on a set of glycan structures of varying lengths and showed high accuracy in predicting native structures. The tool was also used to design glycan structures to shield regions of a protein nanoparticle vaccine from antibody recognition, which was experimentally verified. This approach can aid in glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and experimental structure determination and refinement. The GlycanTreeModeler and associated tools enable accurate modeling of glycans through de novo and density-guided modeling. The algorithm and energy function were optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity, achieving a median de novo root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.7 angstroms. The results demonstrate the potential of the GlycanTreeModeler in predicting glycan structures, building them into known density, and designing glycan-coated protein surfaces. This work contributes to the development of computational methods for glycoprotein modeling and structure determination.
Researchers have identified a new ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, in the fungus Penicillium oxalicum. This pair plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality and gene expression. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF complex, specifically the F-box protein Fbx23, recognizes and activates the transcription factor Ace1 within the nucleus. Ace1 is a ubiquitinated protein that negatively regulates the expression of cellulase genes in various fungi. However, in the absence of Fbx23, the transcription levels of cellulase genes are significantly upregulated, indicating that Fbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator for Ace1.

The study found that most of the Fbx23 protein is present in a free form within the nucleus, while a small portion associates with Skp1 to form a heterodimer or assembles with the SCF complex. Deleting the Fbx23 gene results in the accumulation of all versions of the Ace1 protein, which is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds to target gene promoters. This suggests that Fbx23 is essential for maintaining Ace1's activity. The researchers propose a model where Fbx23 recognizes and activates Ace1, allowing it to regulate gene transcription with different effects under different signals. This study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of cellulolytic enzyme gene expression in fungi and highlights the importance of the ubiquitin-protein ligase system in fungal growth, development, and enzyme synthesis.
Researchers have investigated the process of basement membrane (BM) formation and diversification in Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium. The BM is a crucial structural element of tissues, and its diversification plays a significant role in organ morphogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its formation and diversification are not well understood. The study found that two parallel secretory routes, defined by Rab10 and Rab8, are responsible for BM protein secretion. When both routes are abolished, BM production is completely blocked. However, genetic interactions revealed that these two routes compete with each other. Rab10 promotes lateral and planar-polarized secretion, leading to the formation of BM fibrils, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion, resulting in the formation of a homogenous BM. The dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and Rab10 are present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAPC is essential for fibril formation and can reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route. The exocyst complex has a dual function in this context: it directly interacts with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization and is also required for the Rab8 route. The study proposes that the co-existence of parallel secretory routes orchestrated by these Rab proteins with different cell exit sites defined by cell polarity axes is the basic mechanism to explain BM diversification during development. The findings provide new mechanistic insights into how BM proteins are secreted in epithelial cells and demonstrate that BM diversification during development can arise from the existence of different secretory routes with different cell exit sites.
Researchers have developed a new machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The model, called the Language-Based Universal Model (LBUM), uses a technique called multi-task learning (MTL) to improve predictions. MTL involves training the model on multiple antibodies at once, rather than one antibody per model. This approach has been shown to increase the model's performance and address two key challenges in HIV-1 research: the underrepresentation of certain HIV-1 subtypes in training datasets and the difficulty of determining optimal combinations of bnAbs to avoid resistance.

The LBUM was pre-trained on HIV-1 Env sequences without neutralization data and fine-tuned with sequences that included both non-bnAb and bnAb outcome data. The model was compared to classical machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and gradient boosting machines, and outperformed them in predicting HIV-1 resistance to 33 bnAbs. The researchers also demonstrated that MTL can mitigate bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes and allow the model to learn patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict antibodies' epitopes and select optimal bnAb combinations. The LBUM is publicly available and can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy. The study's findings have the potential to increase the therapeutic benefits of bnAbs and address key challenges in HIV-1 vaccine research.
Researchers have developed new predictive models for multiple myeloma (MM), a type of blood cancer characterized by the abnormal growth of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Current treatments for MM vary in effectiveness between patients, highlighting the need for more accurate prognostic models to inform treatment decisions. Previous models have focused on gene expression data, but this approach has limitations, as the dysfunction of specific pathways is closely linked to disease development and progression. To address this, researchers explored two strategies that incorporate pathway information into predictive models: the pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The pathway score method converts gene expression data into sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting, while group lasso identifies the most relevant pathways associated with the disease. The researchers implemented these methods in microarray data from MM patients and compared their performance to gene-based models and previously published models. The results showed that group lasso incorporating Vax pathway information (Vax(grp)) outperformed the gene-based model and previously published models in both internal and external validation. The new model was also more resistant to missing values, and a missing data imputation method was integrated to facilitate future validation. The findings suggest that pathway-based models, particularly those incorporating immune-related pathways, are competitive alternatives to gene-based models for predicting MM outcomes. These models have been documented in an R package, providing a comprehensive guide for future studies that aim to incorporate prior knowledge into predictive models.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to study the process of mitochondrial fission, which is the division of a mitochondrion into two daughter organelles. Mitochondrial fission is a critical process that occurs in response to cellular injury and is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. The model focuses on Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission, where Drp1 is a protein that plays a key role in the fission process. The researchers used a nonlinear dynamical systems approach to identify parameters that regulate the total fission rate (TFR) as a function of time. They found that the TFR undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, a type of phase transition, with a bifurcation parameter μ, which represents the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. The researchers discovered that the cumulative total fission (TF), which is the total number of fission events over a set time period, depends strongly on only one dimensionless parameter, μ. Interestingly, the TF does not increase monotonically with μ, but rather increases to a certain point and then decreases as μ continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests that interventions targeting certain regulatory parameters, such as the association and dissociation rate constants between Drp1 and Mff, or the concentration of Mff, may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Understanding the impact of these regulatory parameters may assist in the selection of future therapeutic targets.
Researchers have developed a novel CRISPR-based gene drive system to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. The system targets the Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc2) gene in Drosophila suzukii, a notorious fruit pest, and Drosophila melanogaster, a model insect. The gene drive system uses three guide RNAs (gRNAs) to induce nonfunctional mutations in the Tdc2 gene, reducing the formation of functional resistance alleles. This approach aims to mitigate the rapid evolution of resistance to the gene drive.

The researchers found that feeding octopamine to female flies with the Tdc2 mutation restored their egg-laying defects, making it easier to maintain the population. This conditional rescue of the Tdc2 mutant phenotype offers a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects. The study also demonstrated the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency.

The results show that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles, and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity. This study highlights the potential of CRISPR-based gene drives for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests, and the importance of considering the position effect and genetic polymorphisms in the design of gene drive systems.
Research suggests that the brain's ability to learn is not only limited by the energy required for computation, but also by the energy needed to form memories. Studies have shown that even simple learning tasks can be metabolically costly, and more complex tasks, such as learning to recognize images with 95% accuracy, require a significant number of synaptic updates. To conserve energy, the brain may have evolved to learn using the least amount of energy possible. The authors explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks and proposed two algorithms that restrict plasticity to save energy. The first algorithm only modifies synapses with large updates, while the second restricts plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. These algorithms were found to save energy while only slightly increasing learning time. The results suggest that competitively restricting plasticity can help reduce the metabolic energy associated with synaptic plasticity. This research may lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a more efficient match between artificial and biological learning. The findings also have implications for hardware design, as electronic memory storage is also energetically costly. The authors propose that including energy constraints in computational learning rules may lead to a better understanding of observed synaptic plasticity rules.
Researchers investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution can overcome fitness defects caused by genome streamlining in the bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx. They created six variants of ADP1-ISx with deletions of 22- to 42-kilobase regions and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases. The researchers then evolved replicate populations of these strains for approximately 300 generations in chemically defined minimal medium or complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates. The results showed that fitness increased in all cases except for two ancestors that failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd, csrA, and hfq were frequently mutated across all strains, although the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment. The study demonstrates that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments. Overall, the results validate laboratory evolution as a strategy for improving the fitness of reduced-genome strains and provide a path forward for engineering a minimal-genome A. baylyi strain.
Researchers have developed a new tool to control gene expression in zebrafish, a vertebrate model organism. The tool, called RiboFlip, uses a self-cleaving ribozyme to specifically target and reduce the expression of endogenous genes. The ribozyme, T3H48, was inserted into the second intron of the albino gene in zebrafish, resulting in a pigmentation phenotype similar to that of the mutant. The researchers also demonstrated that the ribozyme's activity can be reversed using a base-editing strategy, showing the specificity of the approach. Furthermore, they created a version of the ribozyme, called RiboFlip, that can be activated by Flippase or Cre, allowing for conditional control over gene expression. RiboFlip was also shown to induce mRNA knockdown and recapitulate the albino mutant phenotype. Additionally, a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter was integrated into the RiboFlip cassette, enabling the labeling of knocked-down cells independently of the target gene's expression. The RiboFlip cassette is presented as a flexible tool for controlling endogenous gene expression in vertebrates, offering an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies.
Researchers have developed a user-friendly software called aiSEGcell to segment nuclei and cells in bright field (BF) images without the need for fluorescent labeling. This approach eliminates the need for transgenic or dye labeling, freeing up imaging channels, reducing phototoxicity, and speeding up imaging. The software uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect cellular structures in BF images, which can be challenging, especially in low-magnification and time-lapse imaging of primary cells. aiSEGcell is designed to be accessible to users with no prior coding experience and can be used through a command line interface or a graphical user interface. The software is also adaptable to new use cases, requiring only 32 images for retraining. Evaluation of aiSEGcell showed that it accurately segments nuclei from challenging BF images, similar to manual segmentation, and retains biologically relevant information. The software was tested on a large dataset of 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images from different primary cell types and imaging modalities. The results demonstrate that aiSEGcell is a reliable tool for nucleus segmentation in BF images, which can be used for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. The software is also agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the field.
Researchers investigated whether humans rely on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments. Specifically, they examined whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features change slowly rather than quickly. In two experiments and one preregistered replication, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. The results showed that participants accrued more reward when a bandit's relevant feature changed slowly and its irrelevant feature quickly, compared to the opposite. This effect was not due to differences in generalization to unseen feature values between conditions. Using a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models, the researchers found that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants' performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These findings provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favors slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. The study suggests that humans employ a "slowness prior" to identify potentially relevant features during reinforcement learning, which aids in learning task states in a reinforcement learning domain.
Researchers have identified a new gene, Resf1, as a potential tumor suppressor in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-negative) breast cancer. This type of breast cancer has the worst prognosis and often leads to rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease. Using a mouse model, the study found that reducing Resf1 expression led to increased tumor growth, shorter overall survival time, and more lung metastases. This is consistent with patient data showing that lower Resf1 expression is associated with worse outcomes.

The study used a mouse systems genetics approach to identify genes associated with metastatic susceptibility, and Resf1 was found to be a novel metastasis susceptibility gene. Resf1 is a large, unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure, but with poor amino acid conservation. Mechanistic analysis revealed that Resf1 may play a role in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis.

The study used CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed with the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model (MMTV-PyMT) to demonstrate the role of Resf1 in tumor progression. The results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER-negative breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which Resf1 functions as a tumor suppressor and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target for ER-negative breast cancer.
Researchers investigated the roles of the DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination in yeast. During meiosis, programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11, which activates the DNA damage response (DDR) kinase Mec1 via the checkpoint clamp loader Rad24. The study used two strategies to examine the genome-wide roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination: deletion of the mismatch repair protein Msh2 and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor. The results showed that deletion of RAD24 led to severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in recombination frequency due to a shortened prophase. In contrast, loss of Mec1 function increased recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference, and had less effect on spore viability. The study also found that complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs occurred more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both. Additionally, Mec1 and Rad24 were found to have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers (COs), with CO distributions becoming more random upon loss of either protein. The results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency, with the loss of Mec1 helping to suppress broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model of Pneumocystis jirovecii, a deadly fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. The model identifies metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder the growth of Pneumocystis in vitro, which has been a major obstacle in understanding the pathobiology of this fungus. The model was developed using recently published genome data and bioinformatics tools, and was validated through relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches. The findings provide insights into the biology of Pneumocystis and offer a novel strategy to overcome the challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro.

The model was used to analyze Merali's growth medium and identify its critical components, as well as suggest how to supplement it to enhance Pneumocystis growth. Additionally, the model was able to replicate drop-off and gene knockout experiments, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool in the development of new antifungal drug targets. The researchers also developed a genome-scale metabolic model for the mouse-specific fungal pathogen, Pneumocystis murina, for practical and ethical reasons.

The study demonstrates the potential of in silico metabolic modeling as an alternative approach to address the major bottleneck in Pneumocystis research. The model provides a framework for understanding the metabolic requirements and imbalances of Pneumocystis, and can be used to make predictions regarding its growth and metabolism. Experimental validation of the model's hypotheses is necessary, and the growth of Pneumocystis in vitro should be compared to its growth in vivo in the host.
Researchers investigated the role of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) in cell proliferation. They found that YAP/TAZ induces cell proliferation at low cell density, but at high cell density, the Hippo pathway is activated, leading to YAP/TAZ translocation into the cytoplasm and cell cycle arrest. Cancer cells have higher levels of YAP/TAZ than normal cells, but it is unclear if this increase alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition at high density.

To address this question, the researchers developed a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway. The model simulates cell-cell interactions and cell dynamics, including adhesion, repulsion, and friction. The researchers used this model to investigate the effect of varying YAP/TAZ levels on cell proliferation at high density.

The results showed that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest and enable continuous proliferation, even at high density. This suggests that increased YAP/TAZ alone can bypass contact inhibition and contribute to unchecked proliferation in cancer cells. The model's integration of cell dynamics and intra-cellular dynamics provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of cell density and YAP/TAZ concentration on proliferation. This model may be useful for evaluating cancer malignancy, exploring therapeutic interventions targeting YAP/TAZ, and optimizing drug dosages.
Researchers have investigated the role of low-complexity domains (LCDs) in eukaryotic proteins and RNAs, which are prone to phase separation into biomolecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs can disrupt condensate dynamics, leading to pathological transitions to solid-like states. To understand how the molecular sequence grammar of LCDs governs condensate dynamics, a new energy landscape framework has been developed. This framework operates on a continuous "stickiness" energy scale, rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence, and characterizes sequences by their Wasserstein distance relative to shuffled or random counterparts.

The energy landscape framework reveals that highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. The study found that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, preventing transitions to glassy or solid-like states. The framework also explains recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity.

Using this framework, researchers can systematically program protein condensate viscoelasticity by altering the periodicity and stickiness of LCDs. The study addresses a critical gap in understanding the role of sequence complexity in governing the dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condensates. The energy landscape framework provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties of biomolecular condensates, advancing our understanding of their dynamics and functional roles.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for non-muscle myosin II in the development of ectodermal organs, specifically in the formation of the mouse dentition. The process begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes shape. Signaling by secreted molecules, such as Shh, is essential for epithelial morphogenesis, but how this information leads to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes was not well understood. The study found that Shh signaling induces myosin II activation via the AKT pathway, which promotes cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer of the dental epithelium. This process is critical for the narrowing of the dental epithelium at the neck region and proper invagination of the tooth bud. The researchers showed that pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh, supporting a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination. The study highlights the importance of myosin II in maintaining robust cell-cell adhesion in the stratified dental epithelium, which is essential for the proper development of the dentition.
Researchers have developed a new method called scTGCN, a deep transfer model based on graph convolutional networks, to integrate and analyze large-scale atlas-level single-cell multiomics data. This method enables the transfer of labels from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) data, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of complex biological mechanisms. However, current label transfer methods have limitations in preserving fine-grained cell populations and heterogeneity between datasets.

The scTGCN model addresses these challenges by using a multistage transfer learning strategy and formulates cell-cell relationships and gene expression using graph convolutional networks. This approach enables the integration of gene expression and chromatin accessibility data into a unified multi-omics mouse cell atlas. The model is versatile and can combine different types of measurements, even if the data is unpaired.

The scTGCN method has been shown to accurately transfer cell type annotations across datasets from different tissues, species, and molecular layers, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. This is achieved through the use of multiple kernels for adapting deep representations, which enhances adaptation effectiveness between the mean embeddings of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. The results demonstrate that scTGCN is a powerful tool for integrating and analyzing large-scale atlas-level single-cell multiomics data, with high label transfer accuracy and effective knowledge transfer across different modalities.
Researchers studied the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase, to understand how it interacts with importin proteins to enter the cell nucleus. The NLS is a short motif rich in basic amino acids, but identifying it can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF3) modeling, the researchers found that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. The study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen. The researchers identified specific basic residues within Mcm3's NLS that are critical for its function, including positions 2 and 3, which are essential for interactions with importin alpha. Mutations at these positions result in defective nuclear import, reduced chromatin association, and impaired cell growth. The study highlights the importance of precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS for nuclear transport and chromatin loading of the MCM complex.
Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) is a gene associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type II (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinsonism. The protein encoded by ATXN2 is a potential therapeutic target for these conditions. Research has shown that ATXN2 plays a role in translational activation, repression, mRNA stability, and the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The LSm domain of ATXN2 can stimulate mRNA translation and antagonize mRNP-granule assembly.

Experiments on Drosophila and human ATXN2 proteins revealed that the PAM2 motif, which interacts with polyA-binding protein (PABP), is a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of ATXN2 mRNP granules. In transgenic Drosophila, the Atx2-LSm domain was found to protect against neurodegeneration, while structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions contributed to Atx2-induced cytotoxicity. The data suggest that ATXN2 interactions are remodeled during translational control and that structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation and neurodegeneration.

The PAM2 motif of ATXN2 and its interactions with PABP are not essential for granule assembly but are required to efficiently recruit ATXN2-target mRNAs and specific protein components into ATXN2 granules. ATXN2 may be an RNA-binding protein that remains associated with mRNAs across multiple stages, including RNA processing, transport, translation, and translational control. The protein has been shown to be a translational activator of the Drosophila period mRNA, a repressor of several miRNA reporters, and a facilitator of neuronal mRNP-granule and stress-granule formation.
This study investigated the role of Pitx2 and Pax7 in the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in different anatomical locations, specifically in extraocular muscles (EOMs) and limb muscles. The researchers used genetically modified mice to delete Pitx2 and Pax7 at various stages of development and found that Pitx2 becomes dispensable for MuSC specification and maintenance in EOMs, despite being a major upstream regulator during early development. In contrast, Pax7 is essential for MuSC maintenance in EOMs, and its constitutive inactivation led to a greater loss of MuSCs in EOMs compared to limb muscles. The study proposes a relay between Pitx2, Myf5, and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance.

The researchers also found that MuSCs in EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier than those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult. However, EOMs have a higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally. In the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significantly fewer MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse compared to controls, and they were not proliferative. The study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterization of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and sheds light on the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called VOCs-INN to simulate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants among the human population. This algorithm combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission intensity of various COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. The VOCs-INN algorithm emphasizes learning underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve model optimization and achieve accurate fitting.

The algorithm integrates physical information neural networks (PINNs) with infectious disease models to capture the time-varying nature of parameters. By encoding real VOCs infection data, epidemiological transmission mechanisms, and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) into neural networks, VOCs-INN can accurately fit data and infer complex time-varying parameters.

The researchers tested VOCs-INN using reported infected data of SARS-CoV-2 variants in British Columbia, Canada, and found that it can accurately fit the data and simulate observed or unobserved dynamics. The algorithm can also infer time-dependent parameters and enable short-term predictions. Furthermore, VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data.

The study highlights the importance of simulating the transmission mechanism within the population and determining the time-dependent characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants to evaluate the risk. The researchers aim to integrate VOCs-INN with other advanced machine-learning methods to better fit and predict infectious disease data. The integration of PINNs with infectious disease models, particularly through the proposed VOCs-INN approach, represents a significant research contribution.
Researchers have developed a new approach called CytoSummaryNet, a Deep Sets-based model that improves the prediction of a compound's mechanism of action by aggregating single-cell feature data from image-based cell profiling. The traditional method of averaging across cells fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations, leading to inaccurate predictions. CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework to identify the optimal way to aggregate single-cell profiles. This approach outperforms the average profiling baseline by 30-68% in mean average precision on a public dataset. The model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells. CytoSummaryNet requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in most cell profiling datasets. The model offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets. CytoSummaryNet is an easier-to-apply and better-performing method for aggregating single-cell image feature data compared to previously published strategies. The approach has the potential to be applied to genetic perturbations, expanding its utility in functional genomics.
Researchers have developed a new framework to measure cognitive effort in the brain by analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. This framework identifies discrete dynamical states, known as EEG microstates, and uses optimal transport theory to quantify the effort involved in transitioning between these states. The study applied this framework to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test that requires participants to respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting aspect. The results revealed an increased cost linked to cognitive effort, confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions.

The study's findings highlight the value of characterizing brain dynamics and transition costs in understanding cognitive processes and offer insights into the relationship between neural activity patterns, cognitive effort, and behavioral performance. The researchers employed a stochastic control framework to measure the brain transition cost in an existing EEG dataset and confirmed a correlation between cost and cognitive demand observed during the spatial Stroop task. This is the first application of such a framework to EEG data, providing a computational pipeline to quantify cognitive demand in EEG experiments.

The study bridges the gap between previous research on fMRI data and EEG signals, which measure neural activity more directly. The researchers analyzed an EEG dataset on participants performing a spatial Stroop task and found that the transition cost from the resting condition to the task varied significantly, indicating that the control cost can explain the variation in energy the brain needs to supply for differing cognitive demands.
Researchers investigated the role of atypical memory B cells (aMBCs) in the immune response to Plasmodium vivax malaria. They found that aMBCs specific to P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II (PvDBPII) were elicited during malaria illness and persisted through the recovery phase. These cells were able to produce neutralizing antibodies against the parasite. The researchers isolated single aMBCs and cultured them to demonstrate their ability to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and produce protective antibodies. They found that some aMBC clones produced antibodies with high binding affinity and inhibitory activity against diverse PvDBPII variants. Notably, the B cell receptors of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes, similar to classical MBCs. The study suggests that aMBCs play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria. The findings have implications for the development of effective and long-lasting malaria vaccines, as identifying aMBC subsets that produce protective antibodies could lead to the creation of more effective vaccines. The study also highlights the potential of aMBCs to differentiate into ASCs and produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. vivax invasion into human erythrocytes. Overall, the research provides new insights into the immune response to P. vivax malaria and the potential role of aMBCs in protecting against the disease.
Researchers have developed a new method called mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model, to predict complex trait phenotypes using summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel. This approach addresses the limitations of the original mr. mash method, which requires individual-level data and does not scale well to large datasets. The mr. mash-rss method leverages the sharing of effects across phenotypes to improve prediction accuracy and is computationally efficient. Through simulations, the researchers demonstrated that mr. mash-rss is competitive with, and often outperforms, current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios. The method was also applied to real data from the UK Biobank, where it achieved higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the dataset had a smaller sample size. The mr. mash-rss method is robust to a small to medium amount of missing phenotypes and can be fitted efficiently in specific cases, such as when there is complete sample non-overlap across phenotypes. Overall, the mr. mash-rss method offers a scalable and accurate approach to polygenic prediction, making it a valuable tool for precision medicine and human genetics research.
Researchers have developed a novel modelling framework to improve the accuracy of epidemic predictions by incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into traditional homogeneous models. The framework uses a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles, approximated by a neural network, to develop a Universal Differential Equations (UDE) model. The UDE model is trained using deep learning methods with data from the COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai, while a mechanistic model is calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The study projects the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. The results indicate an attack rate of 80.06% and a peak of new infections of 3.17% of the population, compared to the homogeneous model's projections of 99.97% and 32.78%. This represents an 18.6% improvement in prediction accuracy based on actual data. The simulations also show that heterogeneity in susceptibles decreases herd immunity for approximately 37.36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from 30 days to 70 days, aligning with real-case data. The study provides a new class of models and insights for modelling heterogeneity, which can be applied to various infectious diseases. The framework accurately depicts the epidemic curve of the first large-scale outbreak of the Omicron variant in China, including peak size, final size, herd immunity, and outbreak duration, with significantly enhanced prediction accuracy compared to the homogeneous model.
Researchers have found that synapses in the brain exhibit high levels of noise, which is surprising given the high energy cost of synapses. A new mathematical framework proposes that synapses use this noise to represent uncertainties about the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. This framework views the synapse as an agent interacting with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in an uncertain, dynamic environment. The model suggests that synapses use an internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics, which is updated by a synaptic learning rule similar to established long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) mechanisms. This approach implies that synapses encode their uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential using their inherently noisy synaptic release. The researchers show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network can resolve learning problems such as pattern classification and closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. By coordinating themselves, synapses can represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations. This framework makes precise predictions about the interplay of synaptic and neural dynamics, including synaptic plasticity changes in post-pre-post spike pairing protocols. The model also predicts that synapses should be stochastic to effectively encode uncertainties about the somatic membrane potential. The researchers apply this framework to individual synapses, deriving a synaptic learning rule that enables synapses to adapt their efficacy to predict future postsynaptic spikes.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scuphr for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. This method is designed to overcome challenges associated with single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scuphr uses a distance-based approach and the neighbor-joining algorithm to compute the distance between cell pairs and reconstruct the lineage tree. The method is particularly useful for analyzing healthy tissues, where mutations are scarce, and single-cell DNA sequencing data can reveal more point mutations than other data types.

Scuphr has been tested on synthetic and biological datasets, including a dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage tree topology. The results show that Scuphr can perform faster and more accurately than state-of-the-art methods. The method's robustness has been demonstrated through its ability to handle the challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing data, including distinguishing somatic mutations from sequencing errors and nucleotide substitutions caused by amplification.

The development of Scuphr addresses the need for more sophisticated models and computational methods to analyze single-cell DNA sequencing data. This data type has the potential to reveal more point mutations than other current data types, but it also comes with its own set of challenges. Scuphr's ability to overcome these challenges makes it a valuable tool for researchers studying cell development, differentiation, and cancer progression.
Researchers have proposed the Thanzi La Onse (TLO) model as a tool to evaluate health benefits packages (HBPs) in low-income settings, such as Malawi. HBPs aim to determine which services the public healthcare system should provide, given limited resources. The TLO model simulates the incidence of disease, health-seeking behavior, and the healthcare system's capacity to meet demand under realistic constraints on human resources for health. By calibrating the model to extensive, country-specific data, the researchers simulated the health gains achievable under various HBP strategies for Malawi.

The study found that a linear constrained optimization analysis (LCOA)-based HBP achieved the largest health gain, resulting in an approximately 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) between 2023 and 2042 compared to a benchmark scenario. However, this approach incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of implementation. An alternative approach, prioritizing services based on patient characteristics rather than service type, achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period.

The TLO simulation provides a unique tool for testing HBPs specifically designed for Malawi, allowing for detailed evaluations of the health gains that can be achieved through the relative prioritization of services given realistic constraints in available human resources for health. This approach addresses limitations in other analytic methods commonly used to weigh evidence for different interventions, providing a more realistic representation of resource constraints for the Malawian healthcare system.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of meiotic chromosomal events in the holocentric pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and compared their findings to those in the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori. They used Oligopaint DNA FISH to visualize single chromosomes at sub-chromosomal resolution and found that meiotic homolog pairing in both species is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends. This suggests that this mechanism may be conserved in Lepidopteran insects. The study also revealed that both species form rod-shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple ways at metaphase I. The researchers found that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the center of chromosomes, regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. Sister kinetochores were not paired, and four distinct kinetochores were observed at metaphase I. Despite this, clear end-on microtubule attachments were found, co-orienting these separated kinetochores. These findings challenge the classical view of segregation, where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I. The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, which can lead to the discovery of novel biology. The results suggest that moths employ a novel "center-kinetic" segregation mechanism during spermatogenesis, where kinetochore formation is restricted to the center of the chromosome.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcription factor SOX3 in the development of the pituitary gland, which is regulated by the median eminence (ME) at the base of the hypothalamus. Previous studies have shown that mutations or duplications affecting SOX3 can lead to hypopituitarism, a condition characterized by reduced hormone production. The current study demonstrates that the absence of SOX3 primarily affects the ME, leading to phenotypes that appear in juvenile animals, despite SOX3 expression beginning during embryonic development. In the pituitary gland, hormone levels are reduced due to a lack of endocrine cell maturation. Additionally, the study found that NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential in the ME are also affected.

The researchers discovered that low-dose aspirin treatment or changes in the gut microbiota can rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in SOX3 mutants. This suggests that sufficient numbers of NG2-glia in the ME are necessary to support pituitary cell maturation as the animal becomes independent at weaning. The study highlights a novel role for NG2-glia in the post-weaning formation of a functional ME and its control of pituitary maturation. Furthermore, the results indicate that an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of SOX3 in these cells can be modified by non-genetic factors.
Researchers investigated the role of CED-5/CED-12, a two-component guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), in the morphogenesis of Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. They found that CED-5/CED-12 is essential for embryonic migrations, as its loss leads to embryonic death due to failed epidermal cell migrations. However, surprisingly, CED-5/CED-12 inhibited F-actin formation in the migrating epidermis, which contradicts its expected role as a GEF for CED-10/Rac1. To address this paradox, the researchers investigated whether CED-12 harbors GTPase-activating protein (GAP) functions. They identified a candidate GAP region in CED-12 and found that mutating a critical arginine residue in this region altered the epidermal cell migration function, but not the corpse engulfment function. Furthermore, they discovered that CED-5/CED-12 likely supports the cycling of multiple GTPases, using distinct domains to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation. The researchers also found that CED-5/DOCK-180 and CED-12/ELMO act as a bipartite GEF that promotes active CED-10/Rac1 during corpse engulfment, but a different GEF must work to activate CED-10/Rac1 during embryonic epidermal cell migration.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes information across different timescales in the rodent visual system. They used information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis to examine the timescales of spiking activity in the mouse visual cortex under visual stimulation. The study found that information and correlation timescales increased along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system, while information-theoretic predictability decreased. This suggests that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.

The researchers tested whether the observed increase in timescales was gradual or parallel, and found that a model with a gradual increase had more predictive power for both correlation and information timescales. This suggests a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the mouse visual cortex. The study also explored alternative hypotheses, including the role of feedforward processing and recurrent coupling, and found that stronger recurrent coupling can lead to a reduction of temporal correlations from external stimuli.

The results indicate that network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as an increase in recurrent coupling, are important for shaping the temporal processing hierarchy. The study suggests that the rodent visual system uses intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders, but the underlying neural circuits are not well understood. Researchers used epidural recordings from the cervical spine to study the response of the motor cortex to TMS and develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn. The study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves.

The researchers conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify important pathways and used machine learning to identify common circuit features among these pathways. The analysis revealed that neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs). The total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave.

The results supported the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves, with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The study also found that activation of both afferents to the motor cortex and specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves. This suggests that the cortical origins of afferents may give rise to certain I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation.
Cell-free placental DNA (cfpDNA) is present in the maternal circulation throughout pregnancy and has significant potential as a research and clinical tool. CfpDNA is shed into the maternal bloodstream as early as the fourth week of gestation and can comprise up to 40% of total maternal plasma cell-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cfpDNA has been used in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal genetic aberrations, including chromosomal aneuploidies. However, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility.

CfpDNA is representative of the full placental genome, providing a means for noninvasive genome-wide characterization of the placenta. NIPT has been widely implemented to screen for common fetal aneuploidies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21, by assessing for overrepresentation of the affected chromosomes in maternal plasma cell-free DNA. The effectiveness of NIPT for aneuploidy screening has been reviewed elsewhere. CfpDNA has the potential to be a powerful research tool for longitudinal studies of placental development and disease, which are currently hindered by ethical constraints and limited availability of early- and mid-gestation tissue samples. This could open avenues for many more clinical applications of cfpDNA beyond the current NIPT repertoire, which is limited to genetic screening of the fetus. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the placental physiological processes that generate cfpDNA, its functional role in pregnancy, and how it can be leveraged to study and monitor placental health and disease.
Researchers have identified a common genetic basis for hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers, which account for up to 30% of new cancer diagnoses each year. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed hundreds of cancer-specific risk loci and multiple pleiotropic loci associated with at least two HDCs. While most GWAS variants are dispersed across the genome, several genomic regions harbor variants for multiple cancer types, suggesting common target genes may drive these associations.

The study found 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, with two regions containing risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDCs, and 28 for two HDCs. Integrating GWAS data, epigenomic profiling, and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models, the researchers identified 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles.

The study also pinpointed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factor motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDCs. This approach provides a framework for identifying common target genes driving complex traits and enhances understanding of HDC susceptibility.
Researchers investigated the genetic cause of polymyositis, a muscle disease, in the Kooiker dog breed. They conducted a genome-wide association study and identified a region on chromosome CFA19 associated with the disease. Further analysis revealed a 39-kilobase deletion located 10 kilobases upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. This deletion was found in 81% of affected dogs and 25% of a random sample of the breed. Leukocytes from affected, untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL21 and IL2 when stimulated with mitogens. The study suggests that elements located upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play a crucial role in regulating the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. The penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated to be 10-20% for homozygous dogs and 0.5-2% for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. The study also implies that distant variants upstream of IL21 may be important for human autoimmune diseases associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region. A PCR assay was developed to genotype the deletion allele in Kooiker dogs, providing a tool for breeders to prevent the birth of high-risk dogs and reduce the incidence of polymyositis in the breed.
Researchers have developed a protein language model called ESMtherm to predict the stability of proteins, which is crucial for various applications such as food processing, therapeutics, and identifying pathogenic mutations. The model is trained on a large dataset of 528,000 natural and de novo protein sequences derived from 461 protein domains, allowing it to accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. The study demonstrates that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability, and ESMtherm performs reasonably well on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set.

The researchers also show that training the model on an ensemble of protein domains, rather than mutagenesis studies of a single domain, improves its performance for folding stability prediction. However, the model's performance on larger protein scaffolds lags behind state-of-the-art methods. The study highlights the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature.

The researchers fine-tuned ESM-2, a pre-existing protein language model, to act as an end-to-end stability predictor, named ESMtherm. They observed that ESMtherm performs comparably with state-of-the-art models and generalizes to small protein sequences distal to those of the training set. However, the model is limited to sequences no longer than 72 residues in length, and its performance on larger proteins requires further improvement.
Researchers investigated the role of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIRs) in autoimmunity, specifically in the context of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). iKIRs are a family of receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells that regulate T cell-mediated immunity. The study aimed to determine if iKIRs affect the T cell response in T1D, a disease where T cells play a major role in its development. The researchers conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a dataset of 11,961 individuals with T1D and found that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. This suggests that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. The study's findings were validated in an independent dataset. The results indicate that iKIRs decrease HLA class II protective associations, which is opposite to their effect in chronic viral infections where they enhance protective HLA associations. This study provides new insights into the role of iKIRs in autoimmunity and suggests that iKIRs may modulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. The researchers propose that iKIRs may act in synergy with other immune cells, such as Treg cells, to suppress autoreactive T cell responses and prevent autoimmunity.
Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), a leading cause of vision loss in older adults. FECD is caused by the expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element (CTG18.1) in the TCF4 gene, which is responsible for encoding a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor. The researchers used a combination of long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to analyze primary corneal endothelial cells (CECs) from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18.1-expanded (Exp+) and CTG18.1-independent (Exp-) FECD. The study found that CTG18.1 expansions lead to altered splicing and differential gene expression in Exp+ FECD, resulting in unique transcripts associated with the expansions. Additionally, the researchers identified a subset of Exp- FECD cases with rare and potentially deleterious TCF4 variants, suggesting that TCF4 dysregulation, independent of CTG18.1 expansions, may also contribute to FECD risk. The study's findings support the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, underpin the pathophysiology of FECD. The researchers anticipate that their data will inform the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LTG) in rice, a trait essential for direct seeding in cold climates. They identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) called qLTG11 in the Portuguese rice variety Arroz da Terra, which exhibits rapid seed germination at lower temperatures. Using QTL-seq, the researchers narrowed down the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing the GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h (GF14h) gene. They found that the Arroz da Terra allele of GF14h encodes a functional protein, whereas a Japanese rice variety, Hitomebore, has a 4-bp deletion in the coding region.

Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG, while overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG, indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11. Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost during modern breeding. The researchers generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra, including GF14h, which showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore. The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Researchers investigated the structure of hepatitis B virus (HBV) relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) and its role in the formation of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a persistent form of the virus genome. They created a mutant HBV cell line, HepDES-C1822G, with a specific mutation in the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) coding sequence, altering the 3' terminal redundancy (TR) of the negative strand DNA. The study found that the positive strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wild-type nucleotide at position 1822, indicating that the 5' TR of the negative strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the positive strand DNA. The 3' TR forms a flap-like structure, which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. The researchers also identified the 3' flap endonuclease Mus81 as playing a critical role in cccDNA formation, alongside the 5' flap endonuclease FEN1. The study suggests that the putative 5' and 3' flaps formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursors. The findings provide new insights into HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of the HBV replication cycle.
Researchers developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model (mmGEM) to study the adaptation of microbial communities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The model focused on three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB). The study found that as organic loading rates (OLRs) increased, the community shifted from SOB-dominant to MET-dominant, resulting in a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs and adaptation to high OLRs. Simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under high OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. The model also showed that more cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance. The study highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs. The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.
Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) to guide biological discovery in biomedicine, such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. However, ML models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives when applied to unseen situations. To address this issue, a new framework called CPEC has been proposed, which integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool called conformal prediction. CPEC provides accurate and false discovery rate (FDR)-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. The conformal prediction framework ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. CPEC is expected to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited. The framework allows users to specify their desired FDR tolerance, tailored to the experiment budget or goals, and makes corresponding predictions with a controlled FDR. CPEC's effectiveness is demonstrated using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Hsp90 chaperone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 protein in neurons. Mutations in the TARDBP gene, which codes for TDP-43, can cause familial inherited ALS, suggesting that TDP-43 dysfunction drives the disease. The study used a Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model of ALS to explore the relationship between Hsp90 and TDP-43. The researchers found that disrupting Hsp90 function, either genetically or with small molecule inhibitors, protected against TDP-43 neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration in adult animals. This protection was accompanied by a decrease in total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein levels. The study also showed that Hsp90 mutation or inhibition upregulated key stress-responsive heat shock pathway genes, including hsp-70 and hsp-16.1, and that normal levels of hsp-16.1 were required for Hsp90 mutation effects on TDP-43. Additionally, the researchers found that the neuroprotective effect of Hsp90 dysfunction did not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. These findings demonstrate that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of ALS.
Researchers have created a comprehensive atlas of the adult female reproductive system of Artemia franciscana, a species of brine shrimp, using single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing. This atlas provides a detailed understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system. By comparing the Artemia ovary to the well-characterized Drosophila melanogaster ovary, the study reveals a high level of conservation of expression programs that give rise to cellular identity and function, despite the two species being distantly related.

The researchers identified major cell types in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells, and explored gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis. The study highlights the unique regulatory dynamics of the Z chromosome and the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group. Additionally, the researchers used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to resolve the cellular complexity of the Artemia ovary and identified clusters of cells with distinct expression patterns that share homology with Drosophila ovarian clusters.

The study demonstrates the utility of single-nucleus RNA sequencing as an alternative to traditional approaches for identifying promising models for the study of meiotic sex chromosome regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate or identify nuclei of meiotic cells. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the Arthropod female reproductive system.
Chronic pain, specifically allodynia, is a widespread condition characterized by painful responses to non-painful stimuli, costing the United States around $600 billion in 2010. The exact mechanisms behind allodynia are unclear, but it is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Researchers analyzed biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn, which are thought to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two types of allodynia: static and dynamic.

Using neural firing rate models, the researchers described the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. They then implemented a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit's E-I signaling. The results suggest that disruption of E-I balance occurs due to either downregulation of inhibitory signaling or upregulation of excitatory neuron responses, which can vary depending on the subcircuit structure.

The study provides specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be responsible for allodynia, offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions among multiple interneuron populations in maintaining E-I balance in healthy conditions and its disruption in allodynia.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones in regulating the function of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a crucial protein involved in protein synthesis. They found that Hsp90 and its cochaperones, Hgh1, Cns1, and Cpr7, have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function. Mutations in Hsp90 or its cochaperones resulted in reduced steady-state levels of eEF2 and impaired growth in yeast. Furthermore, mutations in eEF2 that mimic human disease-associated mutations were negatively impacted by the loss of Hgh1, a cochaperone that bridges the interaction between eEF2 and Hsp90 or the TRiC chaperone. The study also found that yeast expressing different groups of Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, which is dictated by a unique post-translational modification on eEF2. The results suggest that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not only by assisting protein folding but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. The study provides further evidence that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones, suggesting that there may be distinct versions of the Hsp90 folding pathway that chaperone different types of clients.
Researchers investigated how people make decisions in social contexts when their individual preferences about risk are disrupted or inaccessible. They used a gambling task where participants made choices alone and after observing others' choices. Participants with lesions in the insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, areas of the brain involved in risky decision-making, showed impaired utility-based risk processing. However, when making socially situated decisions, these participants relied more heavily on following the choices of others, independent of social utility-based computations. This suggests that in social contexts, following others' choices may serve as a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. The study found a parametric relationship between the degree of impairment in utility-based risky decision-making and the use of the "follow others' choices" heuristic. Specifically, individuals with the most disrupted utility-based decision-making showed the greatest conformity with others' choices. This relationship was replicated in an independent sample of control participants, providing evidence for a trade-off between utility-based processes and cognitively less demanding heuristics that facilitate decisions about risky options in social contexts.
Researchers have re-examined Richard Dawkins's iconic model of morphological evolution, known as biomorphs, to investigate how developmental bias influences adaptive evolutionary outcomes. They found that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias, a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes are significantly more likely to appear through random mutations than others. This bias shows a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with lower descriptional complexity. An information-theoretic principle formalizes this bias, which can be understood as evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms. Using population genetics simulations, the researchers demonstrated that moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently through random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result, along with other patterns observed in the structure of variation for biomorphs, such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness, resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps. An analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome can explain these patterns. The researchers postulate that the phenotype bias towards simplicity and other patterns observed in biomorphs may hold more widely for developmental systems.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems, which cannot be predicted analytically. A numerical mode tool was used to compute nonlinear normal modes (NNM) of energy-conservative systems. In a user study, participants controlled a virtual double pendulum with joint compliance through a haptic joystick, aiming to hit two targets. The targets were either aligned with the NNM (Experiments 1 and 2) or offset (Experiment 3). Results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite the resonance and stabilize an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems. This was observed in all experiment variations, including increased task accuracy and targets located away from the NNM. Participants adjusted their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics and align the resonant motions with the task. The study provides data-based evidence of human resonance sensitivity in nonlinear systems, demonstrating the ability to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions. The findings suggest that humans can shape the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness.
In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators (TSRs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase. Two TSRs, ScoC and AbrB, along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR, were found to negatively regulate the production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin. Genetic analysis revealed that all three transcription factors are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced. The expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC was found to be under the control of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR, and correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background. Biochemical analysis showed that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR bind to the yvmC promoter with differing apparent off-rates, indicating tight regulation of pulcherrimin production. The results suggest that PchR and AbrB act as roadblocks to RNA polymerase progression at the yvmC promoter, while ScoC has a weak direct regulatory role and may also have indirect regulation through another factor. The presence of the three repressors is necessary to limit the production of pulcherrimin, providing insight into the regulatory network of pulcherrimin production in bacteria.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how spinal cord injuries (SCIs) affect bladder function and how transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) can improve it. The model replicates the loss of coordinated neural control between the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure, and the urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control bladder emptying. This loss of control can lead to detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the spinal injury. The model shows that TMS applied to the spinal cord after SCI can reduce DSD and incontinence by increasing the density and complexity of interactions among inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons. The researchers used the Hodgkin-Huxley equations to create a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition and added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI. They found that low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) normalized control of voiding after SCI, while high-frequency TMS (30 Hz) enhanced urine storage. The model suggests that neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons are necessary to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition and that both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms by which TMS reduces bladder dysfunction after SCI. This model provides a framework for understanding the neural circuits controlling micturition after SCI and the effects of TMS as a therapeutic intervention.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to estimate the growth rate of fungi, specifically Aspergillus fumigatus, from indirect measurements of optical density (OD600) data. Current methods for quantifying fungal growth rely on direct measurements of morphology-specific data, such as hyphal length, which can be time-consuming and impractical for large-scale collection in clinical microbiology laboratories. The proposed model treats OD600 as an observed variable that is distributed around a linear transform of the true unobserved fungal concentration, explicitly accounting for the indirect nature of OD600 measurements. This approach eliminates the need for calibration data, making it accessible to all microbiology laboratories that collect OD600 data.

The model was evaluated using time-course OD600 data for A. fumigatus and was found to outperform reference models in fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves. The estimated morphology-specific growth rates from the model were also found to be more accurate than those obtained from directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration. The model's ability to estimate growth rates without requiring calibration data makes it a valuable tool for clinical microbiology laboratories, where direct measurement of fungal growth is not feasible. This model has the potential to improve our understanding of fungal growth and aid in the development of effective treatments for severe fungal infections.
Beetles, the most species-rich group of animals, exhibit diverse karyotypes, with most species having XY sex chromosomes, while others use X0 sex determination mechanisms. Researchers generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and analyzed eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera. The study identified ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, that share a conserved set of genes across beetles. The ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles, but independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes have occurred, leading to the evolution of neo-sex chromosomes. These neo-sex chromosomes exhibit stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes, including dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression. The study suggests that beetles provide a novel model to understand the diverse forces driving sex chromosome evolution. A broad phylogenetic sampling of beetles indicates that they will be a promising model to study patterns of karyotype evolution and evolutionary forces operating on sex chromosomes. The researchers used genomic approaches to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera, generating a new chromosome-level assembly for Tribolium confusum and using published assemblies from eleven additional species to broadly reconstruct sex chromosome and karyotype evolution in beetles.
Researchers investigated the role of H2A.Z, a histone variant encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S. cerevisiae, in gene expression regulation. H2A.Z is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex (SWR1-C) and has been implicated in transcription regulation. However, htz1Δ mutants, which lack H2A.Z, exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. The growth defects of htz1Δ mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR1-C subunits, suggesting that previous studies may have been confounded by the deleterious activity of apo-SWR1-C, the SWR1-C complex without its H2A.Z substrate. The researchers generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type, htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea (HU), which induces DNA replication stress. The results showed that H2A.Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. The study also found that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Mapping H2A.Z incorporation before and after HU treatment revealed that decreases in H2A.Z enrichment at transcription start sites were correlated with, but not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure. Overall, the study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A.Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) data plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology. However, classifying transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNASeq experiments into various cell types and identifying lineage relationships for individual cells is a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of the data and the difficulty of obtaining fully annotated datasets. To address this challenge, researchers propose using partial label learning strategies, which involve using a set of candidate labels for each data point, rather than a single correct label. This approach is more feasible than fully supervised learning methods, which require a large amount of annotated data.

The authors extend state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, and logistic regression, to the partial label learning framework and study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods. They focus on the hierarchical structure of the labels, which is commonly observed in developmental processes. The results show that these extensions enable learning from partially labeled data and perform predictions with high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method.

The authors demonstrate that the performance of their methods trained with partially annotated data reaches the same level as fully supervised data. They also study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data and derive prescriptive results on the effect of this uncertainty on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods. Overall, the findings show that hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles, relying on a less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the formation of nuclear compartments, such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli. They found that PIP2 is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription and its localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA. Using mass spectrometry, the researchers identified the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated (RDPA) nuclear proteome in human cells. They discovered that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins, which are enriched for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. The researchers also found that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) associates with PIP2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein. The study suggests that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins, affecting their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation. This implies a pivotal role of PIP2 in establishing a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression. The researchers propose that PIP2 acts as a molecular wedge via RNA association to attract and retain different sets of RDPA proteins, influencing nuclear architecture and gene expression.
Researchers have investigated the genomic mechanisms underlying the development and evolution of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, a species-rich group of insects known for their highly diversified nutrition-responsive traits. The study focused on the Scarabaeinae clade, which includes over 6,000 extant species, and used comparative genomics and developmental assays to identify the evolutionary basis for the development of cephalic horns, secondary sexual weapons that exhibit remarkable intra- and interspecific variation.

Chromosome-level genome assemblies were generated for three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini, including Onthophagus taurus, O. sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella. These assemblies were compared to those of seven other species across the order Coleoptera, revealing evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. The study also contrasted chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females, identifying distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development.

The research highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits and demonstrates that gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals. The study provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group. The findings also shed light on the role of the non-coding genome in the development and evolution of sex- and nutrition-dependent horn formation in dung beetles.
Researchers used a cynomolgus monkey model to study the pathogenesis of Lassa fever, a viral disease caused by the Lassa virus (LASV). The study aimed to understand why some individuals recover from the infection while others experience severe illness and death. The researchers found that lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes, are an early site of LASV replication in all infected animals, regardless of the severity of the disease. However, the virus's tropism, or preference for certain cell types, and its dissemination to other organs vary significantly depending on the disease outcome. In animals that develop fatal Lassa fever, the virus spreads to almost all organs and triggers an excessive inflammatory response, characterized by the infiltration of immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils. In contrast, in animals that recover from the infection, the virus's spread is limited to a few organs and is accompanied by a more controlled immune response. The study used two strains of LASV, Josiah and AV, which cause uniformly fatal and non-severe disease, respectively, in cynomolgus monkeys. The findings provide new insights into the early dynamics of LASV infection and the host immune response, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the different outcomes of Lassa fever. The study highlights the importance of animal models in understanding the pathogenesis of Lassa fever, a disease for which patient access and sample handling are limited.
Researchers investigated the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration (FTD/FTLD), and Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). They found that disruptions in NCT, including the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins, nuclear transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP1, are present in both animal models and human diseases. However, the question of whether these alterations are a primary cause or a downstream consequence of disease remained unclear.

The study used two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration (NemfR86S and NemfR487G) to investigate the role of Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in disease onset. The results showed an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block, cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD, and a pathological interaction between Importin-β and the mutant NEMFR86S protein. The study also identified similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease.

Pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induced key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in the mouse models and in neurodegeneration. The findings suggest that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin-β nuclear import. This has critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function.
Researchers have explored the potential of lytic bacteriophages in medical and biotechnological applications, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms. CRISPR-Cas systems offer a means to investigate these mechanisms through site-specific phage mutagenesis. However, phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage due to extensive DNA modifications, such as cytosine glycosylation, which hinders mutagenesis efficiency. To address this challenge, a study utilized the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagenesis efficiency. This approach enabled precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration, exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. By temporally removing DNA modifications, the study elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions. The results present a strategy for investigating phage epigenome functions and streamlining the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications. The described temporal modulation of the phage epigenome is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental research to comprehend phage infection mechanisms through the generation of mutants. The study demonstrates that DNA modifications protect the genome of phage T4 from nucleolytic cleavage by Cas12, enabling efficient phage lysis. The findings propose an efficient strategy for introducing point mutations into genomes of lytic phages that possess cytosine-based DNA modifications.
Researchers have identified histone variant H2A.Z as a crucial component in maintaining genome stability after DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV light or the chemical 4-nitroquinoline oxide, can interfere with cellular processes like transcription and replication, posing a significant threat to cell metabolism. When these lesions occur on the transcribed strand of active genes, they are repaired by a process called transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). A genetic screen in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that H2A.Z is essential for efficient TC-NER and RNA polymerase II clearance following UV irradiation. In the absence of H2A.Z, repair by TC-NER is severely impaired, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. This highlights the significance of a DNA repair-optimized chromatin environment in maintaining genomic stability. The study found that H2A.Z is required for proficient TC-NER and plays a major role in preventing UV-induced double-strand breaks. Furthermore, the absence of H2A.Z leads to an accumulation of double-strand breaks, which pose a major threat to genome stability. The findings suggest that H2A.Z is a new player in TC-NER and plays a crucial role in regulating RNA polymerase II occupancy and TC-NER repair efficiency upon UV irradiation.
Researchers analyzed gene expression and microbiome composition in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule of Drosophila melanogaster from two divergent populations: one from the European range and one from the African range. They found extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects on gene expression, with tissue-specific effects being stronger than genetic background-specific effects. The two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele-specific expression revealed that both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than in genes with conserved expression, with trans effects being more tissue-specific than cis effects. This observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence. The study also found that the genetic basis of expression variation and the mode of expression inheritance were highly tissue- and genetic background-specific. The results demonstrate that even functionally related, interconnected tissues can show highly divergent regulatory architecture among tissues and genetic backgrounds, highlighting the importance of accounting for context-specificity in evolutionary studies. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the evolution of regulatory architecture, the effects of regulatory variation on tissue specificity, and the effects of genetic background on expression and microbiome variation.
Researchers developed a population dynamics-based modeling framework to estimate the delay between the first SARS-CoV-2 infection and the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded. They validated the framework using simulated data and applied it to two examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first human SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in late 2019. For the Alpha variant, the estimated date of the first infection was August 21, 2020, with a 95% confidence interval of July 23-September 5, 2020. For the Wuhan outbreak, the estimated date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection was November 28, 2019, with a 95% confidence interval of November 2-December 9, 2019. The results are consistent with previous estimates based on genomic data. The framework is generic and can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in various contexts. The study's novelty lies in using a population dynamics approach, which differs from previous studies that relied on genomic information. The researchers found that the median delay between the first SARS-CoV-2 infection and the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded was 52 days, with a 95% confidence interval of 41-78 days. This approach can help quantify the time that emerging epidemics remain undetected before detecting the first cases, which is particularly important for emergent pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.
Researchers have developed an agent-based model to study the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, a process essential for sexual reproduction. The model simulates the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble, taking into account both attractive forces between homologs and repulsive forces between non-homologous chromosomes. The model captures the trajectories of complete chromosome ensembles throughout prophase of meiosis I, allowing for comparison with experimental data and adjustments to species-specific features such as chromosome number and size.

The simulations demonstrate that repulsive forces are most effective when chromosome numbers exceed a certain threshold, reducing the available area per chromosome. Attractive forces come into play once distances between homologs are sufficiently small. A key feature of the model is a repulsive force that shortens the time spent in non-homologous interactions, representing molecular processes that dissociate non-homologous chromosomes from each other.

The model allows for the analysis of individual trajectories for all chromosomes throughout meiotic prophase I, facilitating comparison with experimental data. Modifications of various chromosomal parameters, including chromosome number, size, and movement velocity, as well as attractive and repulsive forces, provide insights into the contributions of each of these factors to homolog pairing. The model suggests that homolog pairing is achieved by two mechanistically distinct, yet temporally coinciding processes: homologs become confined to a nuclear area due to dissociation of interactions with the entire non-homologous chromosome set, and confinement to smaller areas enables homologs to assess similarities, modeled as an attractive force. The model accurately recapitulates the efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed in wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to other organisms.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by inherited mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. MicroRNA miR-34a, a target and modifier gene of p53, plays a crucial role in cancer development. Research on zebrafish has shown that miR-34 triple-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development, but the lack of miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. The miR-34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebrafish and humans, with zebrafish miR-34a and miR-34b/c having similar expression timing in development. DNA damage by camptothecin led to p53-dependent induction of miR-34 genes, while miR-34a mutants were adult-viable and had normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, miR-34a-/- compound mutants with a gain-of-function tp53R217H/R217H or tp53-/- mutants were more cancer-prone than tp53 mutants alone, confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a. Transcriptomic comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization revealed DNA damage-induced transcription, and at 8, 28, and 72 hours post-fertilization, potential miR-34a-regulated genes were determined. Loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of miR-34a suppressed its reporter mRNA, but not p53 target induction, and sensitized injected embryos to camptothecin but not to γ-irradiation.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, sex determination during embryogenesis is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1. The expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. In males, xol-1 is highly expressed, while in hermaphrodites, it is expressed at very low levels. Previous studies suggested that xol-1's low expression in hermaphrodites was of minimal importance in embryonic development. However, this study reveals that xol-1 plays a crucial role in regulating developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics techniques, researchers found that hermaphrodite embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division and a more advanced transcriptional program when xol-1 is lost. Further analysis revealed that xol-1 regulates the timing of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes and the expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. The study also found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape, which can be reversed by the loss of met-2. These findings demonstrate that xol-1 is a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes and that met-2 acts as a downstream effector of xol-1 activity in hermaphrodites.
Researchers have developed a computational framework called MGSurvE (Mosquito Gene SurveillancE) to optimize the placement of mosquito traps for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations. This is particularly relevant for gene drive projects, which aim to control mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. MGSurvE takes into account various biological features of mosquitoes, including their resource requirements, movement patterns, and trap attractiveness, to minimize the time to detection of an allele of interest. The framework can be applied to different mosquito species, such as Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae, and can be used in various landscapes, including urban and rural areas.

MGSurvE was tested on two case studies: an Aedes aegypti population in Queensland, Australia, and an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. The results showed that MGSurvE can effectively optimize trap placement to minimize the time to detection of an allele of interest. For example, in the case of the Aedes aegypti population in Queensland, MGSurvE identified the most effective locations for traps to detect a specific allele, taking into account the mosquito's movement patterns and resource requirements.

MGSurvE is a valuable tool for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance. Its ability to optimize trap placement can help to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes and the emergence of resistant alleles, ultimately contributing to the development of effective strategies for controlling mosquito-borne diseases.
Symbiomonas scintillans, a 1.4 μm heterotrophic microbial eukaryote, was previously thought to harbor endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum. However, a recent study using amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data from two strains of S. scintillans (RCC257 and RCC24) found no evidence of known endosymbiotic bacteria. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis also failed to detect bacterial signals in the cells. Instead, the sequencing data revealed numerous contigs closely related to prasinoviruses infecting green algae such as Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla. The study assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome of a prasinovirus (BpV) infecting Bathycoccus prasinos, as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related viruses from RCC257 and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24, which were collectively called SsVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2, OlVs, and MpVs, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar in morphology and size to the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans. The study concludes that S. scintillans does not harbor an endosymbiotic bacterium, but is instead associated with giant viruses.
The leiomodin (Lmod) family of actin-binding proteins plays a crucial role in muscle function, with mutations in all three family members (LMOD1-3) resulting in human myopathies. Specifically, mutations in the cardiac-predominant isoform, LMOD2, lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense or frameshift mutations, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no LMOD protein is expressed.

Research suggests that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a cellular mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons, underlies the loss of mutant protein from two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations. To investigate this further, steric-blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) were generated to obstruct the deposition of the exon junction complex, preventing NMD of mutant LMOD2 transcripts and restoring mutant protein expression.

The study found that multiple human LMOD2 mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy lead to a lack of LMOD2 protein expression through NMD. The development of SBOs that inhibit NMD of LMOD2 transcripts increased the levels of mutant-truncated protein. This research lays the groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies, suggesting that treatment with an SBO in combination with a drug that promotes translation of the full-length protein could result in rescue of cardiac function in patients with certain mutations in LMOD2.
Researchers investigated how different versions of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, specifically ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. ApoE4 is known to significantly increase the risk of Alzheimer's, while ApoE2 has a modest protective effect. To understand the underlying mechanisms, the researchers used transgenic mice expressing human ApoE genes to study changes in protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, in the brain and liver.

The study found that both ApoE4 and ApoE2 lead to altered regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins in the brain compared to the control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, there was a lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting impaired proteasome and autophagy activity, which can lead to reduced protein quality. In contrast, ApoE2 mice showed an increase in degradation of proteins in the mitochondrial matrix and membrane, indicating a coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. The liver did not exhibit these changes, suggesting that the ApoE effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain.

The study also demonstrated the importance of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to understand proteome regulatory mechanisms. The findings provide new insights into the role of ApoE in Alzheimer's disease and suggest that ApoE2 may enhance brain mitochondrial health by increasing turnover and proteolysis capacity. Further research is needed to elucidate the key factors contributing to these proteostatic changes.
Researchers have developed a new approach called CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRISPR-TRiM) to study gene functions in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The NMJ is a crucial model for understanding various biological processes, including axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and plasticity. However, previous attempts to apply tissue-specific CRISPR to the fly NMJ have been unsuccessful. The new CRISPR-TRiM toolkit allows for efficient tissue-specific gene knockout in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. The researchers validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue and demonstrated its compatibility with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system. They also showed that CRISPR-TRiM can be used to simultaneously knockout multiple redundant genes.

Using CRISPR-TRiM, the researchers discovered an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance and found that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Additionally, they found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. The CRISPR-TRiM approach was used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity. Overall, the CRISPR-TRiM toolkit provides a powerful tool for studying gene functions in the Drosophila NMJ and has the potential to reveal new insights into NMJ biology.
In Drosophila, the process of hematopoiesis, or blood cell formation, relies heavily on the stockpile of progenitor cells present in the blood-forming organ, the lymph gland. During larval stages, these progenitors accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which primes them for differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of JNK, a kinase that upregulates fatty acid oxidation (FAO), facilitating progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Researchers found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing JNK activation. This is achieved through Relish's inhibition of TAK1, a developmental signal that monitors ROS levels and regulates JNK activation. As a result, the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely. The study reveals that integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways is crucial for regulating cell fate transition during development. Relish expression is restricted to the larval progenitor pool, and its overexpression leads to downregulation of FAO. The study also shows that genetic loss of Relish from progenitors leads to activation of the JNK-FAO cascade, causing them to differentiate precociously.
Researchers identified a patient with clinical features of Taybi-Linder syndrome (TALS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. However, genetic analysis revealed that the patient did not have pathogenic variants in the RNU4ATAC gene, which is typically associated with TALS. Instead, a homozygous missense variant in the RTTN gene, RTTN c.2953A>G, was detected through whole-exome sequencing. This variant alters the splicing donor site sequence of intron 23 and has been previously linked to microcephaly, short stature, and polymicrogyria with or without seizures.

To investigate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the RTTN c.2953A>G variant, researchers used patient fibroblasts, engineered RPE1 cells, and CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that were differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) or cortical organoids (COs). The results showed that RTTN-mutated NSCs accumulated in the G2-M phase due to numerous mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell arrest, or cell death. Additionally, RTTN-mutated NSCs exhibited slight misorientation of the mitotic spindles, which may favor premature differentiation into neurons. In cortical organoids, RTTN-mutated cells showed delayed apico-basal polarization of NSCs, leading to a marked delay in rosette formation and overall growth. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease associated with the RTTN c.2953A>G variant and shed light on the mechanisms leading to microcephaly.
Researchers conducted a six-year experiment to study the adaptation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in a state of prolonged resource exhaustion, known as long-term stationary phase (LTSP). They found that E. coli continuously adapts genetically through the accumulation of mutations over time, with a high degree of convergence across independently evolving populations. This means that similar lineages, defined by the same genetic mutations, emerged in multiple populations.

The study used whole-genome sequencing data from hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points to analyze the dynamics of adaptation. The results showed that E. coli populations established long-lasting lineages upon entry into LTSP, with similar lineages arising across populations. This high degree of parallelism enabled the researchers to identify pairs of loci that displayed a significant association in the occurrence of mutations, suggesting historical contingency.

The study found that such associations were highly frequent, with a third of convergently mutated loci involved in at least one such association. The results demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency. The researchers also observed that mutations continued to occur more often than expected by chance in loci mutated across multiple populations, although this trend diminished over time.

The study's findings provide new insights into the dynamics of adaptation in E. coli under LTSP and highlight the importance of considering historical contingency in understanding evolutionary processes.
Researchers have found that the male-specific abdominal (MSA) RNA from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex, previously thought to be non-coding, actually codes for a micropeptide that plays a crucial role in determining how mated females use stored sperm. The MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript, called the iab-8 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which is produced in both sexes in the posterior central nervous system. However, while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide, the iab-8 transcript does not, due to a repressive mechanism. This mechanism relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the two unique 5' exons of the iab-8 lncRNA, which prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames. Using cell culture and transgenic analysis, researchers have shown that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to these uORFs. The iab-8 lncRNA is expressed in the posterior central nervous system, and its loss leads to male and female sterility due to the loss of a microRNA located within its intronic sequences. The MSA transcript, on the other hand, is specifically expressed in the male accessory glands and codes for a micropeptide that mediates sperm usage in mated females.
Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare, multisystemic disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays. Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis, lead to CDG. The clinical variability of CDG suggests that modifier genes may influence the phenotypes. Researchers used evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) to identify common modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes. ERC analysis revealed strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes. The study found that ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allows for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers, providing a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets. The results suggest that known CDG genes are likely candidates for genetic modifiers of other CDG, and that unexplored connections between glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation and GPI anchor synthesis, may need to be studied together. The study also found that previously identified modifier genes for CDG have high ERC values, and in vivo testing of top hits from the analysis had a higher hit rate than previously found in other ERC studies.
A recent study has shed light on the mechanism of hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid assembly and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) encapsidation. The HBV core protein (HBc) has two distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) for capsid assembly and the arginine-rich C-terminal domain (CTD) for pgRNA encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD, particularly at Ser162 and Ser170, is crucial for nucleation with the polymerase (Pol) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation. However, as capsids mature, the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation.

Using a specific antibody, researchers observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state of HBc-Ser170 during pgRNA packaging. The polymerase-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed by substituting a single amino acid in the RNase H domain, which abolished the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry analyses, and protein structural analyses revealed that the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain.

The study found that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in recruiting PP1, which leads to the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170. This dephosphorylation event is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and is associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs). The findings suggest that HBV Pol may play a dual role in bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids.
A recent study investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to environmental change. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and Caribbean, allowing for a "natural experiment" to study how closely related animals evolve and adapt. Researchers sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena, collected on either side of the Isthmus. The study found that the lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts, with those from the Caribbean having the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the TEP did not. This nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Further analysis revealed that the last common ancestor of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage. The study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade. The findings highlight the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions.
Researchers have identified 9,291 bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) from 661 vertebrate genomes, with a notable exception in frogs and salamanders, which contain an unusually high number of TAS2R genes. In contrast to other vertebrates, these amphibians have additional TAS2R gene clusters and more genes per cluster. The study found that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, but the total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages. Interestingly, the number of TAS2R genes is proportional to the number of receptors expressed in extra-oral tissues. In vitro receptor activity assays revealed that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics. This suggests that increases in TAS2R number may have allowed for the acquisition of tissue-specific functions in specific genes, a process known as gene subfunctionalization. The study also found that the TAS2R gene family experienced a rapid expansion in frogs and salamanders, leading to a wider repertoire of these genes than any other lineage of vertebrates examined to date. Transcriptome analysis of seven different tissues in amphibians revealed that TAS2Rs are expressed in extra-oral tissues, similar to humans, mice, fish, and chickens. This study provides new insights into the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in vertebrates, particularly in amphibians, and highlights the importance of extra-oral TAS2Rs in detecting ecologically important xenobiotics.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch dimerization in regulating transcription and its impact on intestinal stem cells. They found that a tri-protein complex containing Notch intracellular domain (NICD), RBPj, and MAML1 binds DNA as a monomer or dimer to regulate transcription. However, mice expressing Notch dimerization-deficient alleles (NDD) of Notch1 and Notch2 develop and age normally, but are sensitized to environmental insults. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids revealed no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene misregulation, but did show impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro and an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts.

Further analysis using TurboID and quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry in a human colon carcinoma cell line revealed an unbalanced interactome in Notch2 dimerization-deficient cells, with reduced interaction with the transcription machinery but preserved interaction with the histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) interactome. Treatment with the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid (VPA) prevented the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitor treatment in mice and spheroids, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and the pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells. These findings suggest that Notch dimerization in mammals is less about transcriptional regulation and more about the overall proteome environment, with indirect consequences to innate immunity and barrier functions.
Background selection, a process where selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites, affects patterns of total neutral diversity (πT) and genetic differentiation (FST) in structured populations. The theory of background selection can be divided into two regimes: the background selection regime, where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are low, and the interference selection regime, where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are high. Previous studies have only quantified the effects of background selection on πT and FST for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime. This study extends previous theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and makes predictions in an island model. Using simulations, the study shows that this theory best predicts FST and πT. The results suggest that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates, as migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size. The study further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans.
The increasing size of genetic and phenotypic data is crucial for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases. However, a significant methodological barrier to performing high-powered studies is the lack of practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions. As sample sizes become more heterogeneous, complex statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed effects models, must be used to correct for confounders that may bias results. Additionally, privacy concerns around Protected Health Information (PHI) restrict the sharing of genetic data, hindering efforts to execute high-powered collaborative studies.

To address these issues, a federated approach has been proposed, which allows sensitive data to remain at local sites without being shared. A federated genetic association testing tool, FedGMMAT, has been developed to utilize a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites. FedGMMAT uses homomorphic encryption and a symmetric One-Time Pad (OTP)-like encryption mechanism to protect intermediate statistics while being aggregated in the federated setting.

Using simulated and real datasets, it has been demonstrated that FedGMMAT can achieve virtually the same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. This approach has the advantage of being flexible to integrate multiple subject-level random effects and can be used in different study designs without explicit changes to the algorithmic setup and formulations.
Researchers have developed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to predict the likelihood of developing prostate cancer, a heritable disease with varying incidence and mortality rates across different populations. While PRSs have shown promise in predicting disease risk, their effectiveness in diverse populations, particularly African and Asian populations, remains a concern for equitable use. To address this issue, a recent study benchmarked the predictive power of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts. The study found modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared to a simple method that prioritizes variants, clumping, and published polygenic risk scores. The findings highlight the importance of improving risk prediction algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts. The study also demonstrated the utility of scores generated from the UK Biobank dataset, showing that genetic risk coupled with participant age is sufficient to predict prostate cancer. The results underscore the need for further research to enhance the effectiveness of PRSs in diverse populations, particularly in reducing overdiagnosis and over-treatment associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Overall, the study contributes to the development of more accurate and equitable risk prediction models for prostate cancer.
Researchers have identified potential new treatments for DPAGT1-CDG, a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DPAGT1 gene. This gene is responsible for the first step in a process called N-linked glycosylation, which is essential for protein function. To find new treatments, the researchers used a Drosophila (fruit fly) model of DPAGT1-CDG, which has a small, improperly developed eye. They screened 1,520 small molecules, 98% of which are approved by the FDA or EMA, and found 42 compounds that improved the eye development in the fly model.

Further analysis revealed that some of these compounds work by inhibiting the dopamine D2 receptor, which is involved in brain signaling. The researchers found that blocking this receptor partially rescued the eye development in the fly model. They also discovered that reducing dopamine synthesis and recycling had a similar effect, suggesting that excessive dopamine signaling is detrimental in DPAGT1-CDG. This finding links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and provides a new potential therapeutic target for treating the disorder.

In addition to the dopamine-related compounds, the researchers identified other potential treatments, including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1. These findings not only provide new options for treating DPAGT1-CDG but also reveal novel biology in the mechanisms underlying the disorder. The study demonstrates the potential of drug repurposing as a strategy for finding new treatments for rare genetic disorders like DPAGT1-CDG.
Researchers have developed a computational model called the topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE) to better understand how the brain processes proprioception, the sense of body position and movement. Proprioception is essential for controlling movement, but the way it is represented in the brain is not well understood. The topo-VAE model uses a large dataset of natural movement data to create a map of the brain's somatosensory cortex, which is responsible for processing sensory information from the body.

The model was tested using data from monkey centre-out reaching movements and was able to reproduce two key features of proprioception: the shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, and the distribution of neuronal preferred directions recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model made several testable predictions, including that encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of preferred directions and that few neurons will encode just a single joint.

The topo-VAE model provides a principled basis for understanding sensorimotor representations and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with potential applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots. The model's ability to generalize to other regions of the sensory cortex and its minimal inductive bias regarding a particular sensory modality make it a valuable tool for understanding the computational principles that drive the mapping of proprioceptive arm representations onto the cortex.
Researchers have explored the role of ethylene in plant growth and development, as well as plant responses to stress. However, the role of ethylene in microbes has been less studied. This study investigated the role of ethylene in Azospirillum brasilense, a beneficial bacterium that associates with plant roots. The researchers identified a functional ethylene receptor in A. brasilense, which they called Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 (AzoEtr1). They found that AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity and that treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces.

The study also used RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to examine the effects of ethylene on A. brasilense metabolism. The results showed that ethylene causes widespread metabolic changes that affect carbon and nitrogen metabolism, leading to the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate. The researchers propose a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism, suggesting that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene. This study provides new insights into the role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions and identifies potential targets for regulating beneficial plant-microbe interactions. The findings suggest that ethylene may play a key role in mediating the interactions between A. brasilense and its plant host.
Researchers investigated the role of the INO80 protein in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. The INO80 protein is a key component of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and transcription regulation. Immunolocalization studies revealed that INO80 is present at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes, suggesting its involvement in the meiotic sex body. Deletion of the Ino80 gene resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes, indicating that INO80 is essential for silencing these genes.

Further analysis showed that the active form of RNA polymerase II was present at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes, suggesting incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. The recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition (MSCI) was also reduced in the absence of INO80, suggesting that INO80 facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes.

The study found that INO80 regulates chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites on the sex chromosomes, independent of the histone variant H2A.Z. INO80 interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC1, facilitating MDC1 recruitment at the sex chromosomes during pachynema. The results suggest that INO80 plays a unique role in silencing sex-linked genes during pachynema in spermatocytes by regulating chromatin accessibility and facilitating the recruitment of DNA repair factors.
Researchers have identified a growth factor called SVH-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in axon regeneration. SVH-1 belongs to the HGF/plasminogen family and has a dual function: it acts as a growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate early development. To understand how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor, scientists investigated the role of cytidine deaminase (CDD) SVH-17/CDD-2. They found that CDD-2 is necessary for axon regeneration by modifying the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor. The researchers discovered that a specific codon exchange in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the CDD-2 defect in axon regeneration. Additionally, they found that a stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1. These findings suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 through modification of svh-1 mRNA. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration and the role of CDD-2 in this process.
Researchers used zebrafish to explore the possibility of controlling collective behavior in biological systems by modifying the characteristics of individual constituents. They genetically modified zebrafish to lack the col11a2 gene, which causes early onset of osteoarthritis, and observed changes in their collective behavior. The mutant fish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent their bodies less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Contrary to expectations, a group of 25 mutant fish showed more orderly collective motion than wild-type fish.

A simple active matter model was used to capture the collective behavior of both wild-type and mutant fish. The model treated the fish as self-propelling agents with varying levels of orientational noise. The results showed that the mutant fish could be modeled as having a higher average orientational noise, which led to their more orderly collective motion. This suggests that genetic modification can be used to control collective behavior in biological systems by changing the characteristics of individual constituents.

The study demonstrates the potential of using active matter models to understand the relationship between genetic traits and physiological changes in biological systems. By modeling the swimming behavior of zebrafish, researchers can reveal physiologically relevant behaviors that are underpinned by changes to the skeleton. This approach can be used to follow genetic mutants and relate behaviors to genetic traits and physiological changes within the body.
Researchers have developed a hybrid model to simulate the formation of capillary-like networks in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines the Cellular Potts model, which predicts individual cell migration and morphology, with continuum mechanics, which quantifies biogel deformation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transport dynamics. By incorporating both mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation, the model showed good agreement with experimental results, demonstrating the formation of capillary-like networks with elongated cells connecting to form network cords and round cells gathering to create cobblestone-like aggregates.

The model revealed that the development of capillary-like networks relies on adequate biogel deformation, a sufficient amount of bound VEGF, and a gradient of bound VEGF to provide spatial cues for endothelial cells. Both soluble and bound forms of VEGF play crucial roles in network formation, with soluble VEGF inducing morphological changes and bound VEGF providing orientational signals. The model suggests that mechanical and chemical coupling must work simultaneously for capillary-like networks to develop in high integrity.

While the computational results matched experiments in certain conditions, the model still has limitations, such as omitting the necessity of bound VEGF in mechanical mechanisms and failing to fully reproduce the results of tilted biogel experiments in chemical mechanisms. This study contributes to the understanding of how mechanical regulation and chemical stimulation interact in capillary network development, which is essential for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.
Researchers have studied the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) family, a group of secreted peptides that play crucial roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are five TGF-β ligands, which can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies. The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well-studied for its role in the innate immune response in C. elegans. This study demonstrates that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens and that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act non-redundantly as part of this response. The two BMP-like ligands, DBL-1 and TIG-2, function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2 and TIG-3, a TGF-β/Activin-like ligand, function together. Structural modeling suggests that TIG-2 and TIG-3 can form heterodimers. Additionally, the study identifies TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers. The study also shows that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival. These findings demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.
This study investigates the role of the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 (Nat4) in the DNA damage response (DDR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nat4 is a histone-modifying enzyme that acetylates the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A. The researchers found that yeast cells lacking Nat4 are more sensitive to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells. Upon DNA damage, Nat4 expression is elevated, and the enzyme is specifically recruited to double-strand breaks. The study shows that Nat4 plays a crucial role in the DNA damage signaling cascade, with nat4-deleted cells exhibiting lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph (γH2A) and diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break. Additionally, Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells, leading to reduced Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effector kinase Rad53, indicative of DNA damage checkpoint activation. The researchers found that the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4. Overall, this study reveals a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR, associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cells, known as cancer phylogenies. These phylogenies provide valuable insights into cancer development and guide treatment strategies. Existing methods for reconstructing cancer phylogenies using bulk DNA sequencing data become inaccurate when dealing with more than 30 mutations or fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Orchard is a fast and accurate algorithm that can reconstruct phylogenies using up to 1000 mutations. It samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, which is a novel result derived in this paper. The algorithm optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). The large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations. The algorithm can reliably reconstruct extremely large mutation trees, alleviating the need to pre-cluster mutations, and can recover larger trees on simulated data.
Researchers have developed a new approach called ImmugenX to predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens, which is crucial for the development of personalized cancer treatments. Neoantigens are proteins produced by cancer cells that can trigger an immune response. However, predicting which neoantigens will be recognized by the immune system is a challenging task due to limited training data and low reactivity rates. ImmugenX is a modular language model that uses a combination of protein language modeling and machine learning to predict the immunogenicity of neoantigens.

The model consists of three main components: a pMHC encoding module, an optional TCR encoding module, and a set of context-specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. The pMHC encoding module is trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, including binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction, and stability. ImmugenX outperforms state-of-the-art models on pMHC immunogenicity prediction, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.619 and an average precision of 0.514. The integration of TCR context information further improves the model's performance.

The researchers also analyzed the model's performance for interpretability, identifying areas of weakness in existing immunogenicity models and highlighting possible biases in public datasets. ImmugenX is designed to be modular, allowing for the addition of new features and inputs, such as TCR sequences, to improve its performance. The model has the potential to revolutionize the development of personalized cancer treatments by allowing for more targeted and effective therapies.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene-based association analysis were conducted on 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to identify genes related to meat lightness and redness. The study found that the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma (PPP1CC) gene was significantly associated with meat color, with a P-value of 8.65E-08. Mendelian randomization analyses further validated the causal relationship between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness. Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout (PPP1CC-SSKO) mice were generated, which showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles, as well as a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Transcriptome and targeted metabolome analyses revealed that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes, and enhanced the glycolysis pathway. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the intron of PPP1CC was found to regulate gene transcription activity. The study also detected differences in meat color phenotypes, myoglobin content, and frequency of the PPP1CC variant between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens. The findings suggest that PPP1CC is the causative gene for meat color, and a novel target gene and variant that can aid in the innovation of meat improvement technology were identified. The study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic basis of meat color for the development of modern meat improvement technology.
Researchers have developed a new technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the functional architecture of the retina. This method combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits in retinal ganglion cells. The technique involves presenting light stimuli at varying positions and angles to create a tomographic reconstruction of subunits, allowing for the identification of subunits within a ganglion cell's receptive field.

Simulations demonstrated that STR can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations, and experimental recordings from primate parasol ganglion cells validated the feasibility of the technique. The method has the potential to reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within a few tens of minutes of recording time, making it suitable for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings. By identifying subunit locations, researchers can create targeted stimuli to characterize the spatiotemporal integration properties, nonlinearities, and functional synaptic weights of each subunit, and evaluate their similarity across multiple subunits within one ganglion cell receptive field.

The STR technique has the potential to revolutionize the study of retinal circuitry by providing a new avenue for investigating the functional architecture of the retina. By reducing the required recording time, researchers can leverage the acquired knowledge for further investigating identified subunits and gain a deeper understanding of the complex computations performed by the retina.
Researchers have developed a new statistical method called CRISPRi-DR to analyze data from CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) experiments. CRISPRi is a technology used to study chemical-genetic interactions (CGIs) by identifying genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics. The goal of CRISPRi-DR is to identify genes whose relative abundance is suppressed or enriched in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted, reflecting synergistic behavior. The method incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation to capture the non-linear interaction between them. This interaction is crucial for identifying genes that interact with antibiotics, as the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs.

The CRISPRi-DR method requires multiple sgRNAs for each target in the library, varying in predicted strength, and the actual efficiencies of the sgRNAs have been experimentally quantified in control conditions. The primary use case for CRISPRi-DR is the identification of chemical-genetic interactions, with drug concentration as a covariate. The model extends the Hill equation, which quantifies dose-response behavior of a growth inhibitor, to incorporate an extra term representing the relative efficiency of each sgRNA targeting a gene. The CRISPRi-DR model captures the non-linear interaction between sgRNA efficiency and drug concentration, where the effect of drug concentration on relative abundance of mutants is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength. This method has been applied to a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources, showing competitive performance with other analytical methods.
Researchers investigated the structure of gene co-expression networks in Drosophila melanogaster using a community detection method called the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM). This method does not assume that genes are organized into assortative modules, which are groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. Instead, the SBM separates genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. The study used RNAseq gene expression data from two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster. The results showed that the SBM found ten times as many groups as competing methods, and several of these groups were not modular. The study also found that the functional enrichment for non-modular groups was as strong as for modular communities. This suggests that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought, and that modularity may not be the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks. The study highlights the need to incorporate other sources of information, beyond assortativity, when exploring biological networks. The results also suggest that alternative organizations of gene interactions may be more common than previously thought, and that more studies using methods that don't rely on modularity maximization are needed to determine whether there are general patterns of non-modular organization.
Researchers investigated the role of cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) in post-transcriptional control in yeast. PABPC is involved in translation initiation, translation termination, and mRNA decay. To understand its direct and indirect roles, the researchers used mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and Ribo-Seq to analyze the yeast proteome and transcriptome in cells lacking the PAB1 gene. The results showed that pab1Δ cells had drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. The defects in translation initiation and mRNA stabilization in pab1Δ cells were partly due to reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex, in addition to the general loss of Pab1's direct role in these processes. Cells lacking Pab1 also exhibited a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination. The study found that PAB1 deletion resulted in major changes in the transcriptome and proteome, but only minimal changes in relative translation efficiency. The researchers also explored the phenotypes of mRNA decay, translation initiation, translation efficiency, and translation termination upon PAB1 deletion, focusing on analyses of pab1Δpbp1Δ cells relative to pbp1Δ cells. The study provided insights into the direct vs. indirect consequences of PAB1 deletion and suggested a new layer of complexity to interpreting genome-wide gene expression alterations in PABPC-depleted cells.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism that contributes to the generation of slow brain rhythms, such as those observed during slow-wave sleep or in pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization. This mechanism involves the interplay between fast-spiking voltage dynamics and a one-dimensional slow dynamics of extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. The study used bifurcation analysis and the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling can generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region, a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase, bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing of the bifurcation structure, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. The researchers suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. This minimal mechanistic model can contribute to a better understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and inform therapeutic strategies. The study highlights the ubiquitous nature of the mechanism by which extracellular potassium dynamics and Na+/K+-ATPase can induce slow rhythms in single neurons and beyond. The findings demonstrate that the interplay between potassium dynamics and neuronal excitability in class I neuron models with SNIC dynamics can give rise to slow bursting under minimal conditions.
Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping has overlooked aspects such as clustering stability and the critical assessment of prognostic relevance. Current frameworks lack a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering methods, highlighting a significant gap in methodology. To address this, the COPS R-package was developed for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. The framework was applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, COPS contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies. The study emphasizes the importance of multi-objective evaluation and applies the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. The findings provide insights into the potential of multi-omics clustering analysis for cancer subtyping and may have implications for improving patient stratification and personalized treatment.
Researchers have investigated the role of the SoxC protein, SEM-2, in the development of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development and the specification of the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage. A novel partial loss-of-function allele of sem-2 was identified, which revealed new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage. The study found that SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage. Additionally, SEM-2 is necessary for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. Furthermore, SEM-2 directly regulates the expression of hlh-8, a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor, which plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage. These findings suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. The study also identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and contributes to the understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.
