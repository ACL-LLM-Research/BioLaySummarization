Researchers conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in human B-lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct individuals to investigate the role of RNA 3'-end processing in regulatory variation. They found that transcript end positions did not occur randomly in untranslated regions, but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3' regulatory elements, including microRNA sites. The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3' motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay. Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes, and validated the regulatory function of 3' cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms. Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5, the researchers established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3'-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation. The study highlights the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3'-end variation: the usage of distinct 3'-end processing signals and the effects of 3' sequence elements that determine transcript fate. The findings suggest that integrating observed 3'-end positions with inferred 3' regulatory motifs will be a critical tool in interpreting human genome variation.
A live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine, SIVΔnef, has been shown to be highly effective in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. However, the mechanisms underlying its protective efficacy are not well understood. Researchers used deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to investigate the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals. They found that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection targeted more variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape. As a result, the CD8 T cell repertoire expanded to target highly conserved epitopes, known as anentropic specificity, and generated new responses to escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period. These findings correlated SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth. The study also demonstrated that epitope escape led to the generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses against novel epitopes and escape variants during chronic infection, and that these responses were maintained as central memory CD8 T cells, contributing to the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response. The results suggest that SIVΔnef is a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the importance of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the protective efficacy of SIVΔnef and has implications for the development of effective HIV/SIV vaccines.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a crucial role in coordinating the neutrophil response to Candida albicans infections in the oral mucosa. Research using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) has shown that IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling is essential for fungal control at the onset of infection. IL-1R signaling affects neutrophils in two ways: it regulates the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. Mice deficient in IL-1R (Il1r1-/-) displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the circulation in response to C. albicans.

The study found that endothelial cells are the primary source of G-CSF during OPC, and they respond to IL-1α released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue. This IL-1-dependent crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. The data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection. Overall, the study identifies two complementary mechanisms by which IL-1 coordinates the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa, which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination and protecting the host from disease.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals through annual mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs in 48 of the 83 identified endemic countries. This significant achievement resulted in an estimated $21.8 billion in direct economic benefits over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the program. The economic benefits were calculated by quantifying the number of clinical manifestations averted and analyzing the savings associated with disease prevention, including direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals.

The study found that the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis resulted in over $2.3 billion in economic benefits. Additionally, the halting of the progression of the disease in over 28 million individuals already infected with LF resulted in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately $19.5 billion. Furthermore, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saved the health systems of endemic countries approximately $2.2 billion. The study concludes that MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits, and with favorable program implementation costs, the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high, making it an excellent investment in global health.
Researchers have developed a new animal model to study Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene. The model, using medaka fish (Oryzias latipes), displays characteristics similar to the neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease in humans, including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brain, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis. Detailed analysis revealed lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. The study found that disrupting α-syn did not improve the lifespan, formation of axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in the GBA-deficient medaka. This suggests that α-syn may not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of neuronopathic Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD), and mutations in the GBA gene have been linked to α-syn accumulation in PD patients. The study provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency and highlights the potential importance of axonal transport of α-syn in the mechanisms leading to PD. The medaka model may serve as a valuable tool for further research into the pathogenesis of neuronopathic Gaucher disease and the development of novel therapies.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to Listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria that can live inside host cells. They found that when L. monocytogenes is contained within a phagosome, a type of cellular compartment, it can suppress the immune system's ability to mount a strong response against it. This suppression is not just due to inefficient antigen presentation, but rather a direct effect on the adaptive immune response. Specifically, the presence of phagosome-confined L. monocytogenes limited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to the rapid production of IL-10, a cytokine that can suppress the immune response. As a result, the immune system's ability to generate protective CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a key role in fighting off infections, was impaired.

The researchers also found that co-infection with both phagosome-confined and cytosolic L. monocytogenes prevented the generation of acquired immunity and limited the expansion of antigen-specific T cells. However, blocking the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88, a protein involved in the immune response, restored protective immunity. These findings suggest that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells. This has significant implications for understanding how microbes interact with the immune system and how to control their pathogenic effects.
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, affecting approximately 60 million people. Genome-wide association studies have previously identified a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 locus, which plays a role in ocular development and optic nerve morphology. Researchers sequenced the SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls, identifying six nonsynonymous coding variants, including five rare and one common variant, Asn141His (rs33912345), which was significantly associated with POAG.

The variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure. The results showed that five variants, primarily found in POAG cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth variant, found only in controls, was benign. One variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation.

Furthermore, the study found a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent on SIX6 genotype: patients who are homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele (His141) have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele (Asn141). The results suggest that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells, thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss.
Researchers have identified a genetic switch, known as the flagellar switch, that controls the production of flagella and toxins in the human intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile. This switch, located upstream of the flgB operon, is a 154-base pair invertible sequence flanked by 21-base pair inverted repeats. The orientation of the flagellar switch determines whether the bacteria express flagellum and toxin genes, produce flagella, and secrete toxins. When the switch is in the "flg phase ON" orientation, bacteria express flagellar and toxin genes, produce flagella, and secrete toxins. In contrast, when the switch is in the "flg phase OFF" orientation, bacteria are attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression, are aflagellate, and show decreased toxin secretion. The orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro. The researchers found that the tyrosine recombinase RecV, which catalyzes inversion at the cwpV switch, is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions. This phase variable flagellar motility and toxin production suggests that these important virulence factors have both advantageous and detrimental effects during the course of infection. The flagellar switch affects transcription of the toxin genes by way of σD, impacting the production of the glucosylating toxins and the cytotoxicity of C. difficile.
Researchers investigated the spore differentiation pathway in Clostridium difficile, an intestinal pathogen that relies on endospore formation for its infectious cycle. They studied the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors, which control gene expression during endospore development. The study found that while the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved, there are significant deviations from the well-studied model organism Bacillus subtilis. Specifically, the activity of σE is partially independent of σF, σG activity is not dependent on σE, and σK activity does not require σG. Additionally, σK is not strictly required for heat-resistant spore formation. These findings indicate reduced temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors, and reduced requirement for the σF-to-σE, σE-to-σG, and σG-to-σK cell-cell signaling pathways. Despite these differences, the study supports the view that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution, with the sigma factors acting as key regulators of the pathway. The results also suggest that differences in the function and period of activity of the sporulation sigma factors in other Clostridial species may be related to the coordination of solventogenesis, toxin production, or other functions with sporulation.
Researchers have developed a simplified framework to model the behavior of proteins with multiple phosphorylation sites, known as allosteric multisite proteins. This framework uses a single auxiliary variable to replicate the steady-state behavior of more complex models, such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model. The model assumes that the activation of the protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant, resulting in optimal ultrasensitivity. This simplification makes the framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications, where multiple multisite proteins interact simultaneously.

The researchers applied this framework to a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast, which measures cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth. They showed that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch, incorporating a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response triggered when the signal reaches a threshold. The framework can also be extended to other types of multisite modifications, such as ligand binding, transcription factor regulation, and ubiquitination.

The model assumes that the protein substrate is phosphorylated by a kinase at possible sites and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase, and that the system is nonsequential, with different phosphoforms of the protein. The number of sites is thought to be relatively large, and the model becomes increasingly precise as the number of sites increases, with good estimates already for around four or more sites.
Researchers used a combination of experimental work and mathematical models to study the quorum sensing (QS) system in E. coli bacteria. Quorum sensing is a mechanism that allows bacteria to communicate with each other and coordinate their behavior. The study focused on the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) QS system, which involves a complex network of regulatory interactions. By separating the network into sub-networks and analyzing each module separately, the researchers identified a new negative feedback interaction that plays a crucial role in the system. They also discovered that the LsrR regulator is a key component of the QS "switch" in E. coli, which is normally masked by interfering regulatory loops. A simple mathematical model was developed to understand the interplay among regulatory sub-structures and their contributions to the overall native functioning network. This "bottom-up" approach allowed the researchers to unravel the complex QS network architecture and shed light on other regulatory pathways within the metabolic networks of bacterial cells. The study's findings can be used to guide the development of new biotechnological applications that incorporate quorum sensing switches. The researchers were able to simulate both the intact network and its sub-systems using their proposed network architecture, providing a mechanistic understanding of the LsrR-mediated genetic "switch" of E. coli QS circuitry. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using a bottom-up approach to analyze complex biological networks, especially when positive and negative regulations exist within the network architecture.
A study was conducted in rural Gabon to investigate the effect of schistosomiasis, caused by the parasite Schistosoma haematobium, on the prevalence and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection in school-age children. The study found that schistosomiasis tends to increase the risk of Plasmodium infection, and when combined with soil-transmitted helminths (STH), such as Trichuris trichiura or hookworm, the risk is significantly increased. The study also found that the incidence of malaria was higher in children infected with Schistosoma haematobium compared to those who were not infected, with a significant delay in the time to the first malaria event in children aged 6-10 years. The study suggests that STH enhance the risk of P. falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children, and that schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children. The study's findings have implications for malaria control programs in areas where both schistosomiasis and malaria are endemic, and suggest that controlling STH and schistosomiasis could be an additional tool for reducing malaria incidence.
Researchers investigated the role of the transcription factor IRF-5 in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania donovani infection. They found that IRF-5-induced inflammation limits CD8+ T cell expansion and induces hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) in dendritic cells. HIF-1α impairs dendritic cell functions, leading to a decrease in IL-12 expression and an increase in IL-10 expression. This results in a higher frequency of short-lived effector CD8+ T cells and reduced CD8+ T cell expansion. Mice with targeted depletion of HIF-1α in dendritic cells showed enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion and reduced parasite burden, suggesting that HIF-1α induction is an immune-evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections. The study suggests that IRF-5-mediated inflammation at early stages of infection plays a detrimental role in the development of protective CD8+ T cell responses. The findings indicate that HIF-1α induction in dendritic cells is a key mechanism by which Leishmania parasites evade the host immune response and establish chronic infection.
Researchers conducted a meta-analysis to identify risk factors for adverse prognosis and death in American visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a serious public health problem in Latin America. They analyzed 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria and examined the methodological quality of the studies using a developed tool. The analysis identified several strong predictors of unfavorable outcomes, including jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age under 5 and over 40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with poor outcomes.

The study found that Leishmania-HIV coinfection was a significant prognostic factor for adverse evolution of VL, with coinfected individuals having a higher risk of poor prognosis. The analysis also highlighted the importance of platelet transfusion in VL patients with platelet counts below 10,000 platelets/mm3, as recommended by the Ministry of Health of Brazil.

The study's findings suggest that the lack of reduction in fatality rates of VL in Brazil can be attributed to limitations in therapy, delayed diagnosis, and inadequate management of high-risk patients. The identification of prognostic factors associated with VL can be a valuable tool for clinical practice, enabling healthcare providers to recognize and manage patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. The study emphasizes the need for the development of externally validated prognostic models to improve the management of VL patients.
Researchers in Algeria investigated the susceptibility of Leishmania parasites to antimony, a common treatment for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, over a 30-year period. The study analyzed 106 isolates from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines collected between 1976 and 2013 in Algeria, as well as 18 isolates from dogs in France. The researchers determined the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of potassium antimony tartrate (Sb(III)) and sodium stibogluconate (Sb(V)) in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively. The epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) values were established to differentiate between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis that were susceptible (S+) or insusceptible (S-) to the trivalent form of antimony. The results showed a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) isolates during the 30-year period, whereas an increase in the frequency of S- phenotypes in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) isolates was observed. The emergence of S- phenotypes correlated with the inclusion of L. killicki (syn: L. tropica) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and have emerged in Algeria during the last decade. The study highlights the need for an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains. The findings provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria and emphasize the importance of preserving the therapeutic efficiency of antimonials to cure leishmaniasis.
Researchers investigated the link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and the development of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory condition. They developed two new models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), a bacterial pathobiont linked to CD. The study found that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont, leading to an increase in immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. This expansion required AIEC resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen. The results suggest that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset. The study also identified AIEC as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals. The researchers used two models to study the comorbidity of acute infectious gastroenteritis in hosts colonized by an AIEC pathobiont, showing that AIEC-colonized mice that develop infectious gastroenteritis have a worsened outcome compared to AIEC-naïve animals exposed to the same infection stimuli.
Researchers have identified a gene called Lachesis (LIS) that plays a crucial role in determining the fate of cells in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis, a flowering plant. The female gametophyte contains two gametic cells, the egg cell and the central cell, as well as five accessory cells, all of which are essential for fertilization. However, the mechanisms that control the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate were previously unknown.

The researchers isolated a mutant called lachesis (lis) that forms supernumerary egg cells, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate. The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. LIS is homologous to the yeast splicing factor PRP4, indicating that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions.

The lis mutant phenotype reveals two levels of cell fate regulation: one between gametic and accessory cells, and one between egg and central cell. The late initiation of cell-specific marker genes indicates that in Arabidopsis, distinct cell fates are only manifested after cellularization. The researchers found that in lis-1 mutant gametophytes, accessory cells differentiate gametic cell fate, and the gametic central cell in lis-1 gametophytes adopts egg cell fate, suggesting that a further, LIS-dependent mechanism suppresses egg cell fate in the central cell.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in a rural highland Ethiopian community to understand the barriers to wearing shoes, which is crucial for preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The study used the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to assess social, behavioral, environmental, educational, and ecological factors influencing shoe use among children. The study involved 242 respondents through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and extended case studies. The results showed that shoe-wearing norms are changing, with going barefoot becoming increasingly seen as "shameful." However, many practical and social barriers prevent people from wearing shoes, including limited financial resources, which make it difficult to purchase and maintain shoes. As a result, shoes are often reserved for special occasions and may not be provided for children until they reach a certain age.

The study identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are relevant to a range of NTDs, including podoconiosis, a disease triggered by exposure to irritant soils in the tropical highlands. These barriers include financial constraints, poor suitability of shoes for daily activities, and low risk perception. The study also found that podoconiosis patients face additional barriers, such as difficulty finding large enough sizes and fear of stigma and labeling. The findings suggest that targeting individuals' beliefs and attitudes about shoe wearing, as well as addressing underlying structural barriers related to poverty, can be effective in promoting consistent use of shoes and preventing NTDs.
The pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us9 protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons. Research has shown that Us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection in vivo. To understand how Us9 promotes axonal sorting of viral proteins, scientists investigated the association of Us9 with lipid rafts on the surface of infected cells. Lipid rafts are microdomains that facilitate the sorting and trafficking of proteins within cells.

The study found that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts and that this association is critical for Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. In non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, Us9 was highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. These findings suggest that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is essential for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system.

The study also demonstrated that Us9 is responsible for the axonal sorting of viral capsids and glycoproteins gB, gC, and gE, and that this sorting is critical for anterograde neuron-to-cell and neuron-to-neuron spread of the virus. Overall, the research provides new insights into the mechanisms of anterograde transport of alpha herpesviruses in the mammalian nervous system and highlights the importance of Us9 in targeting viral proteins to axons.
Research has shown that genetically identical cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit phenotypic variation in growth rate and stress tolerance, even under constant and benign conditions. This phenomenon, known as nongenetic heterogeneity, has significant implications for understanding the behavior of cells in tumors and microbial infections. The study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast-cell growth and acute stress tolerance. Using genetic and chemical perturbations, combined with high-throughput single-cell assays, the researchers found that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, acting through the Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and its target transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, underlies this nongenetic heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, and an endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity, with Msn2 being required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl1, a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance. Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway or by culturing wild-type cells with the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP or the PKA inhibitor H89 significantly impacts survival of acute heat stress. The results suggest that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway, acting through Msn2 and Msn4, underlies nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast-cell growth and stress tolerance.
Researchers analyzed the genetic diversity of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) during an outbreak in the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique in 2013-2014. The study used deep-sequencing technologies to examine the viral genetic diversity present in infected individuals and understand how the virus may have evolved during the outbreak. The analysis revealed changes in the consensus sequence and a diverse range of minority variants present at various levels in the population. Additionally, the study found that the overall diversity of the virus was reduced after single passages in cell lines. An infectious clone of the virus was constructed, and a novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure was identified, which led to increased replication in insect cells. This new UTR structure was not previously found in nature. The study also identified novel variants present in infected individuals, suggesting that CHIKV has rapidly evolved in a short period of time once it entered the naïve population. The findings highlight the need for continued viral diversity surveillance over time to understand the evolutionary potential of CHIKV. The study provides an in-depth look at the minority variants present during the ongoing CHIKV epidemic, identifying novel variants and structural elements. The results were consistent with previous studies, placing the viruses in the Asian Lineage of CHIKV and clustering with the St. Martin strain CNR20236.
Researchers have identified a previously unannotated gene, UBTOR/KIAA1024, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and the mTOR signaling pathway. mTOR signaling is involved in various human diseases, including cancer. The study found that reducing UBTOR function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth and cell growth. Conversely, overexpressing UBTOR suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies revealed that UBTOR stabilizes DEPTOR, a component of the mTOR complex, to inhibit mTOR signaling. In zebrafish models, disrupting the UBTOR gene upregulates mTOR signaling and promotes tumor formation induced by the HRAS G12V mutation. Furthermore, UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model. These findings demonstrate that UBTOR regulates cell growth and neoplasia through mTOR signaling. The study also showed that UBTOR interacts with DEPTOR and mTOR complexes, and that NGF treatment upregulates UBTOR expression, which may help keep mTOR signaling activity in check. Overall, the results suggest that UBTOR is a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling, and its dysregulation may contribute to neoplasia.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of protein complexes in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. This parasite is highly diverged from well-studied eukaryotes, making it challenging to understand its biology and pathogenesis. To address this, the researchers used biochemical fractionation to systematically investigate the co-complex interactions of over 3,300 protein groups in the procyclic life stage of T. brucei. Their analysis led to the identification of 128 high-confidence complexes, encompassing 716 protein groups, including 635 previously uncharacterized proteins. These complexes correlated well with known pathways and proteins co-expressed across the T. brucei life cycle, providing potential functions for a large number of uncharacterized proteins. The researchers validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery, including a candidate involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei. This protein complex map provides an unprecedented view of T. brucei and serves as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins. The study presents the largest proteomics-based interaction map of trypanosomatid parasites to date, offering a useful resource for formulating new biological hypotheses and experimental leads.
Lymph nodes (LNs) are a common site of extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, particularly in the thoracic region. However, the dynamics of Mtb infection in LNs and its impact on LN structure and function are not well understood. Researchers studied thoracic LNs in Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques using PET CT scans, bacterial burden analysis, and immune function assessment. The study found that LNs in Mtb-infected macaques showed increased metabolic activity early during infection, and at necropsy, almost all FDG-avid LNs contained viable Mtb or persistent Mtb DNA. The researchers discovered that Mtb grows to the same level in LNs of both macaque species, but cynomolgus macaque LNs were better able to control the infection compared to rhesus macaque LNs. In contrast to lung granulomas, LNs were found to be poor at killing Mtb, even with drug treatment. Granulomas that form in LNs disrupt their structure, pushing out T cells and B cells, introducing large numbers of macrophages that can serve as niches for Mtb, and destroying normal vasculature. The study suggests that LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection but also serve as important sites for the persistence of significant numbers of Mtb bacilli.
A large collection of 47 nematode-infecting microsporidia has been isolated and cultured from wild nematodes, providing new insights into the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes. The microsporidian Nematocida parisii was found to be the most common pathogen infecting Caenorhabditis elegans in the wild, and six new species in the Nematocida genus were identified. Additionally, two new subclades, Enteropsectra and Pancytospora, were discovered, which are genetically distinct from Nematocida and belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. These microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and primarily infect intestinal cells, except for Pancytospora epiphaga, which replicates in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level, spores of Enteropsectra exhibit a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off the plasma membrane, unlike Nematocida, which exits via exocytosis. The host specificity of these microsporidia varies, with some species infecting multiple nematode species, while others exhibit narrow host specificity. Furthermore, one microsporidian species, Nematocida ausubeli, was found to have evolved mechanisms to prevent the induction of a host response in C. elegans. This collection of microsporidia provides a rich resource for investigating host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts and highlights the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes.
Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein-coupled receptors, play crucial roles in the human immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis and HIV infection. Recent studies have shown that homo- and heterodimers or higher-order oligomers of chemokine receptors modulate receptor function. However, structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interaction with cholesterol is limited. This study used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the spontaneous homo- and heterodimerization of chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2. The results reveal that the closely related CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 share common features with regard to dimerization and interactions with cholesterol, which differ from the previously reported characteristics of CXCR4. Cholesterol was found to modulate the homodimer interfaces of CC chemokine receptors in a subtype-specific manner. The study also provides the first structural information about chemokine receptor heterodimers and elucidates the role of cholesterol in differentiating between the heterodimerization of CXCR4 and the CC chemokine receptors. The findings suggest that cholesterol can increase the dynamic range and versatility of associations of closely related transmembrane receptors. The study provides a comprehensive structural overview of the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related G protein-coupled receptors.
Systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, has been found to present with a wider range of symptoms than previously thought. In addition to the classical form, characterized by prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting, researchers have identified a sub-clinical form and an atypical form. The atypical form presents with depressed immunity, masquerading as a condition where the immune system is non-functional, leading to recurrent secondary infections and a variety of clinical signs and symptoms. This form was discovered in 19.4% of 160 patients referred to a specialized laboratory for immune function evaluation, despite having normal laboratory profiles. The patients with atypical systemic leishmaniasis exhibited dysfunctional macrophages laden with Leishmania parasites. This finding suggests that systemic leishmaniasis is more common than previously diagnosed and is not limited to the pediatric age group, as adults were also affected. The researchers recommend considering atypical systemic leishmaniasis in patients with unexplained depressed immunity and no obvious immunologic defect. The discovery of this atypical form expands the clinical picture of systemic leishmaniasis, which was previously thought to present with a well-defined set of symptoms.
Researchers have analyzed millions of mutations and polymorphisms in human populations to identify potential predictors of disease, drug reactions, microbial infections, and age-related conditions. However, predicting the phenotypic consequences of a sequence variant is a complex task. To address this challenge, the study investigated the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences. A dataset of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and HGMD was used to identify and characterize pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins. The results demonstrate that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins, and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. This finding suggests that information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The study also shows that paralogous disease genes and their variant-pairs can be used for hypothesis generation and as points of departure for further clinical research, and that extending this procedure to include paralogs of known disease genes could identify new disease gene candidates and uncharacterized variants with phenotypic consequences.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria. They used a technique called RNA sequencing to analyze the parasite's gene expression in 44 isolates from Papuan patients. The results showed that parasites causing severe malaria had altered gene expression compared to those causing uncomplicated malaria. Specifically, they found that severe malaria parasites had decreased glycolysis, altered chromatin structure, and reduced expression of surface antigens called PfEMP1. PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity, and their reduced expression may explain why immunity to severe malaria is acquired more rapidly than immunity to uncomplicated malaria.

The study also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments. This suggests that the parasite adapts to or is selected by the host environment in severe malaria. The researchers found that the parasites causing severe malaria had down-regulated genes involved in PfEMP1 surface expression, including skeleton-binding protein 1, which is directly involved in PfEMP1 surface expression. This is consistent with previous studies showing that severe malaria patients have lower levels of antibodies to PfEMP1 and recognize fewer PfEMP1s than uncomplicated malaria patients.

The findings of this study will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and provide insights into how the parasite adapts to or is selected by the host environment in severe malaria.
Researchers have explored the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to rhesus monkeys as a potential approach to prevent HIV-1 infection. In this study, the AAV vector was used to deliver the anti-SIV mAb 5L7 IgG1 to rhesus monkeys, resulting in persisting levels of the delivered mAb ranging from 1-270 μg/ml. However, host antibody responses to the delivered mAb were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys, which limited the concentration of delivered mAb that could be achieved.

Despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge virus, the six monkeys in the AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb group showed significant protective effects against SIVmac239 challenge. These effects included lowering of viral load at peak height, lowering of viral load at set point, and delay in the time to peak viral load from the time of infectious virus exposure. Notably, one monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb completely resisted six successive SIVmac239 challenges, including a final challenge with a dose of 10 i.v. infectious units.

The study demonstrates the continued promise of this approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection. However, the problem of anti-antibody responses to the delivered mAb will need to be understood and overcome for this approach to be effectively realized. The findings suggest that AAV-mediated delivery of mAbs may be a viable strategy for preventing HIV-1 infection, but further research is needed to address the issue of anti-antibody responses.
Researchers have challenged the long-held assumption that protein molecules respond linearly to thermal noise or structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment. This assumption is commonly used in studies of protein dynamics, where conformational motions are analyzed in terms of normal modes and thermal fluctuations are interpreted as the excitation of these modes. A team of scientists investigated the conformational relaxation properties of two motor proteins, myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, using a coarse-grained elastic network approximation. They found that the linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations. In particular, the normal mode description fails completely in describing functional mechanochemical motions in KIF1A. The study suggests that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered, as neither a single normal mode nor a superposition of such modes yields an approximation of strongly nonlinear dynamics. Despite the nonlinearity, the researchers found well-defined conformational relaxation paths in both motor proteins, which are robust against perturbations. These findings indicate that protein dynamics may be more complex than previously thought and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of protein behavior.
Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanisms and functional relevance of crosstalk between different clathrin-independent endocytic pathways. They found that caveolins and cavins, crucial components of caveolae, are independently acting negative regulators of clathrin-independent endocytosis. Specifically, Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4, inhibit the clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment (CLIC/GEEC) endocytic pathway in a process independent of caveola formation. Caveolin-1 (CAV1) and CAV3 also inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon over-expression. Expression of caveolar protein leads to a reduction in the formation of early CLIC/GEEC carriers, as detected by quantitative electron microscopy analysis. The CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV1/Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3. Inhibition by caveolins can be mimicked by the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and is associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid microdomain components. In the absence of cavins, CAV1 is itself endocytosed preferentially through the CLIC/GEEC pathway, but the pathway loses polarization and sorting attributes with consequences for membrane dynamics and endocytic polarization in migrating cells and adult muscle tissue. Noncaveolar Cavin-1 can act as a modulator for the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway, Cdc42. This work provides new insights into the regulation of noncaveolar clathrin-independent endocytosis by specific caveolar proteins, illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways.
Researchers have identified a subset of Receiver (REC) domains, known as Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains, which lack the conserved aspartate (Asp) residue typically phosphorylated by sensory histidine kinases in two-component signaling systems. These systems are crucial for sensing and responding to environmental stimuli in bacteria, Archaea, and plants. The study found that ALR domains are surprisingly common, comprising approximately 4% of all REC domains, and are enriched when attached to rare effector outputs. Analysis of ALR atomic structures, combined with structural, biochemical, and genetic data, suggests that these domains have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation, while retaining canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interfaces. The study also found that some ALR domains have diversified to accommodate signaling inputs from small molecules, such as antibiotics, and Ser-Thr phosphorylation through bacterial eukaryotic-like Ser-Thr kinases and their cognate PP2C phosphatases, which regulate crucial cell envelope-related functions and virulence in many microbes. The researchers identified 74,816 unique REC-containing proteins, 2,976 of which were missing or had substitutions at the conserved Asp position, and renamed this subset of REC-type sequences Aspartate-Less Receivers (ALRs). The study defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains.
Researchers have developed a new type of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) that targets cancer cells by retargeting to specific receptors, such as HER2, which is overexpressed in various cancers. Unlike traditional oHSVs, which are attenuated or over-attenuated due to deletions or mutations, these new viruses are fully virulent in targeted cancer cells while sparing other cells in the tumor. The study investigated the efficacy and safety of a HER2-retargeted, fully virulent oHSV armed with IL-12 (R-115) in immunocompetent mice. The results showed that both the unarmed R-LM113 and the IL-12-armed R-115 inhibited the growth of primary HER2-expressing tumors, with R-115 being more efficacious. Notably, mice that survived the primary treated tumors were protected from the growth of contralateral untreated tumors, indicating an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect. Analysis of the local response revealed that R-115 unleashed an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inducing immunomodulatory cytokines and promoting Th1 polarization. Tumor-infiltrating cells, such as CD4+ and CD335+ cells, were increased in all responder mice, while CD8+, Foxp3+, and CD141+ cells were increased and CD11b+ cells were decreased preferentially in R-115-treated mice. The study demonstrated a durable response, including a breakage of tolerance towards both HER2 and wild-type tumor cells, and underscored a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine response.
A recent study investigated the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors to HIV infection. The study compared the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by adenovirus 5 (Ad5) and canarypox viral vector (ALVAC) to HIV. The results showed that Ad5-specific CD4 T cells were readily susceptible to HIV, while ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. The lower susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells was associated with reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Phenotypic analysis revealed that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-β) but little IL-17. The study also found that ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Depletion of ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. The study highlights the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination and suggests that the choice of vaccine vector may impact the susceptibility of CD4 T cells to HIV infection.
A theoretical population genetic analysis was conducted to investigate the evolution of X inactivation strategies in therian mammals. X inactivation is the process by which one of the two X chromosomes in female somatic cells is transcriptionally silenced. The study found that a single interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes. Random X inactivation (RXI), which equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles, is favored over strict paternally inherited X inactivation (PXI) as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive. However, the criteria for RXI evolution are more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic, meaning alleles deleterious to females are beneficial to males. The study also found that evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness. The results provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes. The study suggests that species-specific properties of mutation and genetic variation can predictably affect patterns of selection for different X inactivation strategies, and that sex-differential selection can influence the relative transmission probabilities of female-deleterious alleles between maternally and paternally derived X chromosomes.
Researchers investigated the antiviral potential of the human zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) against three flaviviruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). They found that overexpression of ZAP blocked JEV infection, while depletion of endogenous ZAP enhanced JEV replication. In contrast, DENV and ZIKV were not affected by ZAP overexpression. ZAP hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3'-5' RNA exosome-mediated degradation. The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity. JEV 3'-UTR, particularly in the region with dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucleotide, was mapped to bind ZAP and confer sensitivity to ZAP. The study identified JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus. ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection. The researchers also found that the zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and antiviral activity against JEV infection. The study provides insight into the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against viral RNA without a 3'-poly(A) tail, suggesting that 3'-5' RNA degradation by the exosome complex is involved in the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against JEV infection.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic virus that causes severe disease in humans and animals, particularly in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Researchers investigated the host response to RVFV infection in mice to understand the pathogenesis of the virus. Two strains of RVFV, wild-type ZH501 and live-attenuated vaccine strain MP-12, were used to infect C57BL/6 mice. The study found that mice infected with MP-12 survived the infection with minimal clinical disease and a low cytokine response, whereas ZH501 infection was lethal, causing lymphopenia, platelet depletion, and a strong systemic cytokine response. The liver was found to be a primary target of RVFV infection, with significant clinical and histological evidence of liver necrosis and hepatitis. However, a pro-inflammatory response was not observed in the liver, but rather a chemokine response indicating the infiltration of immunoreactive cells. In contrast, the brain showed a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response, but with minimal pathology. The study suggests that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with liver dysfunction due to necrosis and hepatitis, while the long-term course of the disease is neurologic in nature. These findings are supported by observations of human disease and the BALB/c mouse model. The study highlights the importance of understanding the host response to RVFV infection to develop effective vaccines and treatments.
Researchers investigated the role of C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) in chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients undergoing taxane-containing chemotherapy. They found that CCL20 levels were significantly elevated in patients who did not achieve a complete response to chemotherapy. The study revealed that CCL20 promotes the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) through the activation of the p65 nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, mediated by protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This activation increases the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs. Additionally, CCL20 promotes the expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane, further contributing to chemoresistance. A positive feedback loop between NF-κB and CCL20 pathways was identified, sustaining chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. The study suggests that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response, and blocking CCL20 or its downstream pathway may reverse taxane resistance in breast cancer patients. The findings propose a novel strategy to overcome taxane resistance in TNBC by combining taxane treatment with the adjuvant pharmacological inhibition of ABCB1.
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that can infect virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. The parasite's ability to infect and manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport "GRA" proteins across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) into the host cell. GRA proteins have diverse roles in Toxoplasma's intracellular lifecycle, including co-opting host cell functions and proteins. However, the translocation process and its machinery are not well understood. A previous study identified a novel protein, TgMYR1, which is essential for GRA transport into the host cell. To identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport, researchers screened Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus. The study found that novel proteins MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell. MYR2 and MYR3 are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1. The researchers also showed that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. Overall, these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell.
Researchers investigated the role of the origin recognition complex 2 (ORC2) in the replication of papillomaviruses, specifically human papillomavirus (HPV) and bovine papillomavirus type-1 (BPV-1). They found that the E2 protein of these viruses binds to ORC2, but surprisingly, ORC2 is not present at the viral origin of replication. Depletion of ORC2 actually increased viral replication in certain cell lines, suggesting that ORC2 suppresses the replicative function of E2. Furthermore, over-expression of HPV E2 decreased ORC2 occupation at mammalian origins of replication, indicating that E2 restricts pre-ORC assembly, which could otherwise compete for host replication complexes necessary for viral genome amplification. The researchers propose that the ORC2 complex with E2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral replication program, and that elevated levels of E2 during the differentiation-dependent amplification stage subvert ORC loading and DNA synthesis at cellular origins. These findings provide new insights into the complex interplay between viral and host replication factors during papillomavirus replication.
A study was conducted to investigate the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan. A total of 564 cow milk samples were collected from 326 herds in 21 villages, and Brucella DNA was detected in 10.3% of the samples using IS711-based real-time PCR. The presence of Brucella DNA was found in both seropositive and seronegative cows, with 100% of seropositive cows and 8.3% of seronegative cows testing positive. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggested that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was likely infected with B. melitensis. The study highlights the need for implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance, control, and eradication programs. The results also suggest that vaccination of cattle with S19 and small ruminants with Rev 1 may be necessary to control Brucella infections in the livestock population. However, further research is required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp. circulating among the livestock in the region. The study's findings are concerning, given the common consumption of unpasteurized dairy products in the region.
Researchers studied the role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me3) in maintaining chromosome stability in the pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. This fungus has eight accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable during cell division and transcriptionally repressed. The researchers deleted the genes responsible for H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, a related histone modification, and analyzed the impact on chromosome and genome stability. They found that the absence of H3K9me3 led to dramatic chromatin reorganization, with H3K27me3 being relocalized to regions enriched with H3K9me3 in wild-type strains. This resulted in many genome rearrangements and the formation of new chromosomes, accompanied by the activation of transposable elements. In contrast, the loss of H3K27me3 increased the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions, without significant changes in gene activity. The study suggests that H3K9me3 is crucial for maintaining genome stability by preventing H3K27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin. The findings provide insights into the role of heterochromatin in genome stability and suggest that H3K27me3 reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes, creating a "metastable" state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome. The study provides a basis for future research on the influence of heterochromatin on structural genome rearrangements using Z. tritici as a model organism.
Researchers evaluated the cost-effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) vaccination strategies for rabies in low-income countries. They found that PEP vaccination is an extremely cost-effective intervention, with costs ranging from $200 to less than $60 per death averted. The study compared intramuscular (IM) and intradermal (ID) administration of PEP and found that switching to ID regimens resulted in significant cost savings due to reduced vaccine volume requirements. This could mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce costs for healthcare providers.

The researchers also explored financing mechanisms to make PEP more accessible and affordable for those in need. They suggest that a universal switch to ID delivery could improve affordability and accessibility of PEP, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths. The study demonstrates that ID delivery of PEP is considerably more cost-effective than IM delivery in terms of averting rabies cases and saving lives.

The study highlights the importance of increasing accessibility, reducing costs, and preventing delays in delivering PEP, particularly in low-income countries where the burden of rabies falls heavily on the poorest sectors of society. The researchers propose concurrent changes in PEP costs to patients, which could improve affordability and provide incentives for compliance without compromising existing health budgets.
Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, has developed a mechanism to acquire nutrients by attracting host organelles to the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) where it replicates. Research has shown that Toxoplasma exploits host lipid droplets (LD), a type of fat storage organelle, as a source of lipids. The study found that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells depleted of LD or impaired in lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. In infected cells, the number of host LD and expression of LD-associated genes increase, and the PV is surrounded by host LD. Toxoplasma can access lipids stored in host LD and incorporate them into its own membranes and LD. The parasite can also intercept and internalize host LD within the PV, some of which remain associated with Rab7 and become wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes (IVN). Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation have a diminished capacity for lipid uptake from host LD. Additionally, parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD. The study highlights Toxoplasma's reliance on host LD for its intracellular development and its ability to scavenge neutral lipids from host LD.
Researchers have identified chalcones, a type of flavonoid derivative, as potential inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cathepsin L enzymes. Fasciola hepatica is a liver fluke parasite that causes fasciolosis, a disease affecting cattle and sheep, and can also infect humans. The parasite's cathepsin L enzymes play a crucial role in its development and survival. Triclabendazole is currently the primary treatment for fasciolosis, but resistance to this drug has been reported in several countries, highlighting the need for new treatment options.

A library of 40 flavonoid derivatives was screened for inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases, and chalcones with phenyl and naphthyl groups were found to be effective inhibitors. One compound, C34, was identified as a potent inhibitor of the juvenile-specific cathepsin L enzyme FhCL3, with an IC50 of 5.6 μM. C34 was shown to bind to the enzyme's active site and inhibit its activity, leading to a reduction in the parasite's ability to migrate through the gut wall and a loss of motility, ultimately resulting in the parasite's death.

This study is the first to report the in vitro screening of non-peptidic inhibitors of Fasciola cathepsin L enzymes. The findings suggest that chalcones may be a promising new class of compounds for the treatment of fasciolosis and potentially other helminthic diseases. Further research is needed to develop these compounds into effective treatments.
Researchers investigated how the visual system transmits information about changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways. They used in vivo imaging to study how bipolar cells (BCs) transmit signals to the inner retina. The study found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters. Individual cells have multiple terminals of varying sizes, with smaller terminals generating faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain, followed by more profound adaptation. Smaller terminals transmitted higher stimulus frequencies more effectively.

Measurements of presynaptic calcium signals in BCs showed a strongly rectifying function of light intensity, causing a steady increase in calcium that was graded with contrast. Voltage-dependent calcium channels in the synaptic terminal of BCs were found to be responsible for the first major non-linear transformation of the visual signal as it is transmitted through the retina.

The study also found that variations in filtering of the presynaptic calcium signal impact the output from the synapse. Smaller terminals responded to a step of light with higher relative release rates, but the resolution was too low to detect modulations at stimulus frequencies above 1 Hz. The synaptic output of BCs was found to be strongly rectified, with an increase in stimulus variance causing an increase in the mean rate of vesicle release even when the mean luminance was held constant.

A model was used to quantify time-dependent changes in synaptic gain, predicting that the rate of vesicle release would depress more profoundly in smaller terminals. Whole-cell recordings from the large terminal of "mixed" BCs were made to compare presynaptic calcium signals in the large and small compartments. The results indicate how one neuron can transmit different temporal components in the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with different adaptational properties.
Researchers have developed a new method for detecting and analyzing individual synapses in the brain using multiplex fluorescence microscopy (muxFM) image data. The method, called a probabilistic synapse detector, uses machine learning algorithms to identify synapses based on their molecular and morphological characteristics. This approach combines the advantages of fluorescence microscopy, which offers high speed and low cost, with the precision of electron microscopy (EM), which is considered the gold standard for synapse detection.

The new method was tested using datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT), which provides both fluorescence and EM images of the same individual synapses. The results showed that the probabilistic synapse detector was able to detect synapses from muxFM data as accurately as human annotators, and accurately reproduced known features of cortical synapse distributions. This method has the potential to enable large-scale synapse detection and analysis, allowing researchers to study the relationships between detected synapses and their parent neurons.

The probabilistic synapse detector may also be useful for analyzing standard confocal and super-resolution FM images, where EM cross-validation is not practical. This new approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density, and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the brain's synaptic networks.
Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including nucleic acid metabolism, gene expression, and immune system function. Impairment of zinc homeostasis can lead to various human pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport is mediated by two families of transporters, ZnT and ZIP, with ZnT2 being responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion into breast milk during lactation. However, the mechanism of action of ZnT2 is not well understood, particularly the coupling of zinc transport to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles.

Researchers have modeled the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and demonstrated that it is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. Using functional zinc transport assays, they showed that ZnT2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles is abolished by bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton ATPase. Additionally, they used LysoTracker Red and Lyso-pHluorin to show that ZnT2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles leads to alkalization of the vesicular pH upon addition of exogenous zinc, which is reversed by TPEN, a specific zinc chelator. Computational energy calculations suggest that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ ions. This indicates that ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger that concentrates zinc in acidic vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm.
Researchers have discovered that 14-3-3 proteins play a crucial role in regulating the processing of stalled replication forks, which is essential for maintaining genome stability. Replication fork integrity is monitored by checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation events, and 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphorylated proteins. The study found that 14-3-3 proteins interact with Exonuclease 1 (Exo1), an enzyme that processes stalled replication forks in yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast cells lacking 14-3-3 proteins, Exo1-dependent single-stranded DNA gaps accumulate at stalled forks, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects. This suggests that 14-3-3 proteins help control the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and other unknown targets, promoting fork progression, stability, and restart in response to DNA replication stress. The study also shows that 14-3-3 proteins facilitate fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations. The findings propose that 14-3-3 proteins act as central integrators of signals that regulate fork stability and processing. The research highlights the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in maintaining genome stability and suggests that they may regulate additional targets during replication stress, possibly through modulation of their phosphorylation.
Researchers investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis using a humanized mouse model. They developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC in lymphoid organs, allowing them to study the effects of pDC depletion on HIV-1 infection. The results showed that pDC play a dual role in HIV-1 infection: they suppress HIV-1 replication by producing type I interferons (IFN-I), but also contribute to HIV-1-induced immunopathogenesis by promoting cell death of human leukocytes, including CD4 and CD8 T cells. During acute HIV-1 infection, pDC depletion abolished the induction of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), leading to increased HIV-1 replication. In contrast, during chronic HIV-1 infection, pDC depletion reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication and reduced cell death of human leukocytes. The study suggests that pDC depletion and IFN-I blockade may provide novel strategies for treating HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective antiretrovirus treatment. The findings highlight the complex role of pDC in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis, and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying HIV-1-induced immunopathogenesis.
Sulforaphane (SFN), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to inhibit HIV infection in primary macrophages through the activation of the transcription regulator Nrf2. Nrf2 is a protein that regulates the expression of anti-oxidant genes, and its activation has been linked to the inhibition of various viruses, including Marburg virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and Dengue virus. However, the impact of Nrf2 activation on HIV infection had not been previously tested.

In this study, researchers found that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages, but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. The anti-viral effects of SFN were found to be mediated through Nrf2, as siRNA-mediated depletion of Nrf2 boosted HIV infectivity in primary macrophages and reduced the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment. The researchers also found that SFN treatment blocks HIV infection after entry, but before the formation of 2-LTR circles, similar to the type I interferon-induced cellular anti-viral proteins SAMHD1 and MX2.

The study suggests that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection and highlights a novel way to trigger this inhibition. The researchers also found that the basal level of Nrf2 present in macrophages is sufficient to establish some anti-viral activity, and that SFN triggers a block to HIV infection in myeloid-derived cells, including primary macrophages, but not in primary T cells.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural western Kenya to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of geohelminth infections among pregnant women. The study found that 76.2% of the 390 participants who provided a stool sample were infected with at least one geohelminth species, with Ascaris lumbricoides being the most prevalent (52.3%), followed by hookworm (39.5%) and Trichuris trichiura (29.0%). Geohelminth infections were associated with the use of an unprotected water source and the lack of treatment of drinking water, but not with clinical symptoms or low body mass index.

The study also found that hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference, and that hookworm infections with an egg count of 1000 or more per gram of feces were associated with lower hemoglobin levels. In contrast, Ascaris lumbricoides infection was associated with a lower risk of malaria parasitemia among women in their second or third trimester of pregnancy. The study suggests that routine provision of antihelminth treatment during antenatal clinic visits may be beneficial, but further evaluation of the impact on pregnancy, malaria, and birth outcomes is needed.
Mycolactone, a compound produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, has been found to have anti-inflammatory effects on the nervous system. Research has shown that mycolactone blocks the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells, leading to immunomodulatory properties. This study investigated whether mycolactone affects the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia, which are involved in pain perception, transmission, and maintenance. The study found that mycolactone suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by these cells without affecting their viability. In fact, nanomolar concentrations of mycolactone efficiently suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators within the first 24 hours of treatment. The study also found that mycolactone prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia, which play a critical role in neuroinflammation. In a rat model of neuropathic pain, mycolactone was injected into the spinal canal to test its effects on neuroinflammation. The results showed that mycolactone decreased the local production of inflammatory cytokines without inducing detectable cytotoxicity. This study provides evidence that mycolactone suppresses the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia, which may contribute to its analgesic properties. The findings suggest that mycolactone may be a potential therapeutic agent for treating chronic pain, particularly neuropathic pain.
Researchers investigated the relationship between genetic variations and the outcome of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Guinea. HAT, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, has varying clinical outcomes in its human host, ranging from rapid progression to a self-curing state. The study aimed to determine if host genetic factors contribute to this diversity. A total of 425 individuals, including 232 HAT cases, 79 individuals with long-lasting positive serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls, were included in the study. Genotypes of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes were analyzed for association with HAT outcome. The results showed that the IL6 rs1818879 allele A was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease. In contrast, the MIF rs36086171 allele G and MIF rs12483859 C allele were associated with an increased risk of latent infections. The APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) was found to be associated with a higher risk of developing HAT, while the APOL1 G1 polymorphism was associated with a lower risk. No associations were found with other candidate genes. These findings suggest that host genes, particularly IL6 rs1818879, play a role in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea. This study contributes to the understanding of host-parasite interactions and may lead to the development of new control tools for HAT.
Researchers conducted deep whole-genome sequencing on 38 individuals from the general population of Singapore, who are primarily descendants of immigrants from Dravidian-language-speaking states in south India. The study aimed to investigate the genetic structure and diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore. The results showed that the samples exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and a higher heterozygous-to-homozygous genotype ratio compared to other Asian populations. When compared to a panel of well-defined Asian Indians, the genetic makeup of the samples was closely related to South Indians. However, eight samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly found in Europeans and showed higher European admixture than the remaining samples. An analysis of ancient admixture with archaic hominins revealed higher levels in East Asian populations than in the Singapore Indian samples. The study's data resource is publicly available and is expected to complement the South Asian samples in Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, exhibits intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides and macrolides due to the expression of the AmrAB-OprA efflux pump. However, a rare subset of clinical isolates from Thailand, including strains 708a, 2188a, and 3799a, showed susceptibility to these antibiotics. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that strain 708a lacked amrB transcripts, while strains 2188a and 3799a had greatly reduced levels. Serial passage on increasing gentamicin concentrations led to the emergence of resistant mutants in 2188a and 3799a, but not in 708a. Transcript analysis showed that the resistance in 2188a and 3799a mutants was due to upregulation of amrAB-oprA expression. Further investigation revealed that the amrAB-oprA operon was missing in 708a due to a large deletion of more than 70 kb of genetic material. This deletion also removed gene clusters for malleobactin and cobalamin synthesis, as well as the anaerobic arginine deiminase pathway, putative type 1 fimbriae, and secreted chitinase. Despite the loss of these genes, strain 708a remained fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model. Whole-genome sequencing and PCR analysis confirmed the absence of these genes in 708a, making it a potential candidate for genetic manipulation experiments using Select Agent compliant antibiotics.
Researchers investigated the early differentiation of naive CD4 T helper cells into Th1 and Th2 states by examining the expression of cytokines and transcription factors in individual cells. Contrary to the expected mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, the study found that they were co-expressed at high levels in individual cells, distinct from basal-level co-expression during lineage priming. Cytokine expression was observed in a small subpopulation of cells, independent of transcription factor expression. This cell-to-cell variation in cytokine expression during the early phase of T helper cell differentiation was significantly larger than in the fully differentiated state. When cytokine signaling was inhibited, the classic mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors was observed, revealing a weak intracellular network overruled by strong extracellular cytokine signals. The results suggest that CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state during early differentiation, instructed by extracellular cytokines. This interplay between extracellular and intracellular signaling components may be a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.
Researchers have identified a protein called PAQR-2 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) that plays a crucial role in adapting to low temperatures. PAQR-2 is similar to insulin-sensitizing receptors found in mammals and is essential for the worm's growth at 15°C, a temperature that is usually tolerable for the organism. To understand how PAQR-2 functions, the researchers screened for genetic mutations that suppress its activity and found that several genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism were affected. These genes included cept-1, pcyt-1, sams-1, ech-7, hacd-1, mdt-15, nhr-49, and sbp-1. The study found that PAQR-2, phosphatidylcholines, sbp-1, and Δ9-desaturases form a regulatory pathway that controls the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This pathway is essential for the worm's adaptation to cold temperatures, as evidenced by the normalization of saturated fatty acid levels in paqr-2 suppressor mutants and the rescue of the paqr-2 mutant by low concentrations of detergents that increase membrane fluidity. The findings suggest that PAQR-2 regulates the activity of Δ9-desaturases through the modulation of phosphatidylcholine levels, leading to an increase in unsaturated fatty acids and improved membrane fluidity during cold adaptation.
Researchers have used electron cryo-tomography to study the structure of human herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) virions, revealing a previously unknown feature at the portal vertex. This feature extends across the tegument layer, forming a connection between the capsid and the viral membrane. The location of this assembly suggests it plays a role in genome release into the nucleus and is important for virion architecture. The discovery was made by comparing the structure of HSV-1 with that of tailed bacteriophages, which share a common evolutionary origin with herpesviruses. Tailed bacteriophages have a specialized tail-like structure that mediates interactions between the portal vertex and cellular components during the viral life cycle.

HSV-1 is a large and complex double-stranded DNA virus that causes a range of diseases, from cold sores and chicken pox to congenital defects, blindness, and cancer. The virus consists of a capsid containing the viral genome, surrounded by a proteinaceous layer called the tegument, and bounded by a glycoprotein-containing lipid envelope. The capsid has a constant diameter of 1250 Å and is composed of pentons, hexons, and triplexes. The discovery of the tail-like assembly at the portal vertex of HSV-1 virions provides new insights into the structure and function of herpesviruses and may have implications for our understanding of the viral life cycle.
Researchers investigated the effects of Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) and recombinant Omega-1 (rω-1) on HIV-1 infection in vitro. They found that SEA and rω-1 can modulate CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses and reduce the susceptibility of T-cells to HIV-1 infection. Specifically, SEA blocked DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 trans-infection by binding to kappa-5, a component of SEA. Additionally, DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th2-promoting conditions induced T-cells that were less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection, but not X4 infection. This effect was not observed when DCs were exposed to SEA under Th1 or Th1/Th2 (Tmix) promoting conditions. Both SEA-exposed and rω-1-exposed DCs induced T-cells with reduced capacity to produce IFN-γ and MIP-1β. Furthermore, the infection profile of T-cells infected with HIV-1 R5 was not associated with down-modulation of CCR5 cell surface expression. However, rω-1-exposed DCs maturing under Tmix conditions induced T-cells with reduced CCR5 expression, which correlated with reduced susceptibility to HIV-1 R5 infection. These findings suggest that SEA and rω-1 can modulate HIV-1 infectivity and may influence disease course in co-infected individuals.
Researchers have identified a phenomenon where neuronal stimulation causes a 30% shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in both grey and white matter. Despite its potential implications for understanding basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A new dynamic model has been developed to explain the ECS shrinkage phenomenon in both wild-type and gene knockout individuals. The model suggests that several factors contribute to ECS shrinkage, including neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride through passive channels, and the action of the Na/K/ATPase pump. Additionally, osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane also plays a role. However, when considering ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na+/K+/Cl− (NKCC1) and Na+/HCO3− (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical for achieving the observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. The model provides a detailed and constrained framework that can guide future experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive models of astroglia-neuron interactions in both normal and pathophysiological situations.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms of transcriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana, a process that suppresses the expression of transposons and repetitive DNA elements. These elements, if transcribed, can be detrimental to the organism. The study focused on the siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway, where long non-coding RNAs produced by RNA Polymerase V (Pol V) guide ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) to chromatin and attract enzymes that establish repressive chromatin modifications. The researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to show that SPT5L/KTF1, a silencing factor and homolog of SPT5 elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcriptional silencing. This binding occurs downstream of Pol V but independently of the presence of 24-nt siRNA. Additionally, SPT5L/KTF1 and AGO4 are recruited to chromatin in parallel and independently of each other. The study found that binding of both AGO4 and SPT5L/KTF1 is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications of several loci. The researchers propose that the coordinate binding of SPT5L and AGO4 creates a platform for the direct or indirect recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional gene silencing and the role of SPT5L/KTF1 in this process.
Researchers investigated the role of the alternative sigma factor RpoS in the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, from ticks to mammals. They found that RpoS-dependent gene expression is essential for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs. In the absence of RpoS, the bacteria are confined to the midgut lumen and transform into an unusual morphotype, known as round bodies, during the later stages of the blood meal. This transformation is reversible and appears to be linked to reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, an enzyme that provides NAD+ for glycolysis. The researchers propose that the bacteria default to an RpoS-independent program for round body formation when they sense that the energy required for transmission is unfavorable. The study highlights the importance of RpoS in the tick-phase of the enzootic cycle and reveals a previously unsuspected role for RpoSBb in the physiological adaptations required for tick-to-mammal transmission. The findings also suggest the existence of a default survival mode, round body formation, triggered when spirochetes are unable to produce sufficient energy for dissemination within the nymph. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex interactions between Borrelia burgdorferi and its tick vector, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the transmission of Lyme disease.
Gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) are two plant hormones that play crucial roles in regulating stamen development in Arabidopsis. Previous studies have shown that GA deficiency leads to male sterility due to the accumulation of DELLA proteins, while JA deficiency also causes male sterility. However, the relationship between GA and JA in controlling stamen development was not well understood. This study investigated the role of GA and JA in regulating the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, which are GA-dependent stamen-enriched genes. The results showed that loss-of-function of two DELLAs, RGA and RGL2, restored the expression of these three MYB genes together with the restoration of stamen filament growth in GA-deficient plants. Genetic analysis revealed that the myb21-t1 myb24-t1 myb57-t1 triple mutant conferred a short stamen phenotype leading to male sterility. Further studies demonstrated that GA suppresses DELLAs to mobilize the expression of the key JA biosynthesis gene DAD1, leading to increased JA content in young flower buds. The study concluded that GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, establishing a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA in regulating stamen development. The findings suggest that modulation of the JA pathway by GA is essential for normal stamen development in Arabidopsis.
Researchers investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in the lifespan extension caused by dietary restriction (DR) in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that a deletion mutant of hif-1 showed significant lifespan extension, suggesting that HIF-1 plays a role in regulating lifespan. Genetic epistasis experiments indicated that HIF-1 functions downstream of the nutrient-responsive target of rapamycin (TOR)-S6K pathway to modulate lifespan. Using a modified DR regime, the researchers found that HIF-1 is involved in DR-mediated lifespan regulation, with overexpression of HIF-1 diminishing lifespan extension under DR. The study also showed that HIF-1 acts downstream of the TOR-S6K pathway to determine lifespan in C. elegans. Furthermore, the researchers found that HIF-1-dependent lifespan extension is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE-1) and is associated with lower levels of ER stress. Tissue-specific expression of egl-9, which increases HIF-1 activity, diminished the lifespan extension under DR, but this effect was rescued by expression of egl-9 in specific neurons and muscles. Overall, the study demonstrates a novel role for HIF-1 in modulating lifespan extension by DR in C. elegans, involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway.
Researchers have investigated how human skin cells called epidermal keratinocytes transition between different functional states, such as differentiation and migration. They found that when these cells differentiate or migrate, they form unique combinations of regulatory elements called enhancers and super-enhancers that are specific to each state. These super-enhancers are linked to genes that confer functions associated with the respective cell state and are also enriched with genetic variants associated with skin diseases.

The study focused on a transcription factor called GRHL3, which promotes both differentiation and migration. GRHL3 binds preferentially to super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes and to promoters in migrating keratinocytes, where it represses the expression of genes that inhibit migration. The researchers also found that GRHL3 regulates the formation of enhancers, including the suppression of non-keratinocyte enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes.

Key epidermal differentiation transcription factor genes, including GRHL3, are located within super-enhancers, and many of these transcription factors bind to and regulate super-enhancers. GRHL3 represses the formation of a number of progenitor and non-keratinocyte super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes. The study suggests that GRHL3 regulates divergent gene expression programs in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes by switching the location of chromatin binding in the context of enhancer landscapes that are distinct for each state. This research provides insight into how a single transcription factor can control distinct gene expression programs under different physiological states within the same cell type.
A study on the coevolution of endogenous and exogenous retroviruses in sheep has revealed a complex interplay between these viruses and their host. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have been transmitted vertically from generation to generation. Some ERVs have been found to interfere with the replication of related exogenous retroviruses, suggesting that they may be used by the host as restriction factors to block pathogenic retroviral infections.

The study focused on the evolutionary history and molecular virology of 27 endogenous sheep retroviruses (enJSRVs), which have been integrating in the host genome for the last 5-7 million years. Two enJSRV proviruses, enJSRV-56A1 and enJSRV-20, were found to have acquired a defective Gag polyprotein resulting in a transdominant phenotype that blocks late replication steps of related exogenous retroviruses. These transdominant proviruses became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication, approximately 9,000 years ago.

Interestingly, a provirus that escapes the transdominant enJSRVs has emerged recently, likely within the last 200 years. This suggests that the evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses is a continuous process that has not reached equilibrium. The study provides evidence that ERVs have been used by the host to fight exogenous pathogenic retroviral infections, and that the transdominant proviruses may have been selected to defend the host against related ERVs already colonizing the host genome.
Researchers evaluated the effectiveness of real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for diagnosing imported schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma species. Current diagnosis relies on microscopic detection of eggs in stool or urine samples and serological assays, but these methods have limitations. The study aimed to assess the performance of two in-house Schistosoma PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematobium in excreta, biopsies, and sera for diagnosing active infections and monitoring treatment efficacy.

The researchers analyzed 412 samples from patients with suspected schistosomiasis, including urine, stool, biopsy, and serum samples. The results were compared to microscopic examination and serological assays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect haemagglutination (HA), and Western Blot (WB) assay. The study found that Schistosoma PCRs significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis, from 4% to 10.5% and from 33.7% to 48.8%, for S. haematobium in urine and S. mansoni in stools, respectively. The overall sensitivity of PCR on serum samples was 72.7% and reached 94.1% in patients with positive excreta (microscopy).

The specificity of serum PCR was 98.9%. After treatment, serum PCR positivity rates slowly declined from 93.8% at day 30 to 8.3% at day 360, whereas antibody detection remained positive after 1 year. The study suggests that Schistosoma PCRs outperform standard microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of reference methods combined with WB-based serology. Serum PCRs provide species information to guide further clinical exploration when serological assays are positive and microscopy is negative.
Researchers have successfully applied machine learning (ML) to estimate the conformational energies of large and complex molecules, such as the natural product Archazolid A. This molecule is a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase and is derived from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra. By using Gaussian process regression, a type of Bayesian non-parametric ML method, the researchers were able to model the relationship between the molecular structure and quantum mechanical (QM) properties of Archazolid A. The simple molecular representation used in the study was sensitive to structural variations in relaxed geometries and enabled the finding of correlations between simulated conformations and computed energy values at the density functional theory (DFT) level.

The study demonstrates that ML models can be developed for structurally complex and pharmaceutically relevant compounds, potentially enabling significant speed-ups in simulations of larger molecular structures. The researchers trained ML models to capture the relationship between relaxed Archazolid A conformations and their DFT-D3 energies using a simple matrix representation based on nuclear charges and inter-atomic distances. Semi-empirical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the AM1 Hamiltonian, and the starting structure of Archazolid A was modeled using NMR constraints. The study achieved mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol for energies of relaxed conformations at the DFT/BLYP-disp3/def2-TZVP level of theory. This approach has the potential to provide access to long-term simulations of challenging chemical and biomolecular systems.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect ebolavirus antibodies in wild great apes using non-invasive fecal samples. This approach allows for the monitoring of ebolavirus infections in wild ape populations, which is crucial for understanding the impact of the virus on these animals. The study found that 10% of gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DCO) region tested positive for ebolavirus antibodies, indicating that exposure or infection with the virus is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was detected in gorillas that were previously thought to be unexposed to ebolavirus, suggesting that the virus may be more widespread than previously believed.

This new method has significant implications for the protection of wild great apes from future ebolavirus infections. It will enable early detection of increased incidence of exposure, identification of immunologically naïve at-risk populations for vaccination, and tracking of vaccine efficacy if implemented. The study also highlights the potential for human ebola virus disease (EVD) to be linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, underscoring the importance of identifying great ape outbreaks for public health in local communities. The findings of this study contribute to the development of a strategy to protect wild great apes from ebolavirus infections and promote their survival.
Researchers have identified a novel type III effector protein, XopL, from the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which causes disease in tomato and pepper plants. XopL exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, a function typically found in eukaryotic cells, and is capable of inducing plant cell death and suppressing plant immunity. The E3 ligase activity is associated with the C-terminal region of XopL, which interacts with plant E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and forms predominantly K11-linked polyubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of the XopL C-terminal domain revealed a novel fold, termed XL-box, which is distinct from previously characterized E3 ligases. Mutations in the central cavity of the XL-box disrupt E3 ligase activity and prevent XopL-induced plant cell death. The N-terminal region of XopL contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which may serve as a protein-protein interaction module for ubiquitination target recognition. The E3 ligase activity of XopL is required for inducing plant cell death, while the LRR domain is necessary for suppressing PAMP (pathogen-associated molecular pattern) responses. This study highlights the unique structural fold of the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain in XopL and demonstrates the diversity of bacterial pathogen effectors that mimic eukaryotic functions to subvert host biology.
Researchers studied the interaction between T follicular helper cells (cTfh) and B cells in individuals with early and late acute HIV infection. They found that cTfh function was impaired in individuals treated in the late acute stage (stage 3) compared to those treated in the early acute stage (stage 1/2). This impairment was associated with lower B cell survival and IgG secretion in cocultures of cTfh and B cells from stage 3 individuals. Elevated plasma viral load in stage 3 was linked to decreased cTfh-mediated B cell IgG production, suggesting a role for increased viremia in cTfh impairment and dysfunctional humoral response. Additionally, phenotypic perturbations were observed in the mature B cell compartment, including a decrease in resting memory B cells in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with higher viremia. The study suggests that early antiretroviral treatment (ART) for acutely HIV-infected individuals could prevent immune dysregulation while preserving cTfh function and B cell memory. The findings indicate that cTfh-mediated B cell responses are significantly altered in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with increased inflammation and a reduction in memory B cells.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The current treatment, praziquantel, has several limitations, making it essential to develop new anthelmintics. The study focused on a serotonergic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, called Sm.5HTR, which is involved in the efficacy of praziquantel. A miniaturized screening assay was used to pharmacologically profile Sm.5HTR and identify novel classes of parasite-selective inhibitors. The assay employed a split luciferase-based biosensor to measure cellular cAMP levels, allowing for the resolution of GPCR modulation in intact cells. The results showed a divergent pharmacological signature between Sm.5HTR and its closest human homolog, Hs.5HTR7, indicating the feasibility of optimizing parasitic-selective pharmacophores. New ligands and chemical series with potency and selectivity for Sm.5HTR over Hs.5HTR7 were identified in vitro and validated for in vivo efficacy against schistosomules and adult worms. Additionally, Sm.5HTR displayed an unusual antagonist-evoked inactivation mechanism, similar to Hs.5HTR7, which enhances its appeal as a target for anthelmintic ligand design. The study demonstrates the feasibility of profiling flatworm GPCRs in a high-throughput screening format and highlights the potential of Sm.5HTR as a chemotherapeutically vulnerable node for the development of next-generation anthelmintics.
During embryonic development, the formation of germ layers is crucial for the organization of the metazoan body. The ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm layers must be separated to prevent intermixing, yet the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary also serves as a substratum for mesoderm migration. Research has shown that localized detachment resulting from contact-induced signals at the boundary is essential for ectoderm-mesoderm segregation. EphrinB/EphB signaling plays a key role in this process, with multiple ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors expressed on each side of the boundary. Forward signaling across the boundary, involving partially redundant ligands and receptors, activates Rac and RhoA, leading to cell detachment and tissue separation. This mechanism differs from a simple differential adhesion process of germ layer formation, as it involves localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle that allows for cell migration across a cellular substratum. The ephrinB/EphB mechanism of tissue separation has been observed in various organisms, including flies, fish, and amphibians, and is thought to be conserved in these cases. The study highlights the importance of signaling across the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary in regulating cell detachment and tissue separation, rather than relying solely on permanent adhesion differences between cells.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 83 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers to identify biochemical markers that could support behavioral diagnoses. The study focused on metabolite concentrations of the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transulfuration pathways. Using advanced statistical analysis, the researchers were able to correctly classify 96.1% of the neurotypical participants and 97.6% of the ASD cohort. Additionally, they used kernel partial least squares to predict adaptive behavior, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite score, with an R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation. This level of accuracy exceeds previous approaches in the field and suggests that the metabolites under consideration are strongly correlated with an ASD diagnosis. The study's findings have the potential to enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses of ASD by incorporating biochemical data into the diagnostic process.
Researchers analyzed reported incidence data of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil over a 10-year period (2001-2010) using Bayesian geostatistical models. The study aimed to identify spatial and temporal patterns, as well as important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors of the diseases. The models were fitted using integrated nested Laplace approximations to perform fast approximate Bayesian inference. Bayesian variable selection was employed to determine the most significant risk factors for both types of leishmaniasis.

The results showed that precipitation and socioeconomic proxies were identified as important risk factors for both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. The predicted number of cases in 2010 was 30,189 (standard deviation: 7,676) for cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4,889 (standard deviation: 288) for visceral leishmaniasis. Spatially explicit, high-resolution incidence maps predicted the highest numbers of infected people in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively.

The study produced countrywide, model-based incidence maps for both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil at a high spatial resolution (88 km). The results provide a deeper understanding of the determinants of the two diseases and identified priority areas where leishmaniasis control efforts should be targeted to reduce disease incidence.
A large-scale study conducted in southern Vietnam compared the clinical features of dengue infection in adults and children. The study, which included 647 adults and 881 children with confirmed dengue, found significant differences in the pattern of complications between the two age groups. Children were more likely to experience signs of vascular leakage and shock, while adults were more prone to bleeding manifestations and organ involvement. Adults also experienced more severe thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by abnormally low platelet counts.

The study found that secondary infection, but not serotype, was independently associated with greater thrombocytopenia, although the effect was smaller than that of age group. Notably, healthy adults were found to have intrinsically lower platelet counts compared to children, even several weeks after recovery from the infection. This suggests that age-related physiological differences contribute to the distinct patterns of complications seen in adults and children with dengue.

The study's findings have important implications for the development of management guidelines for dengue infection. The use of prophylactic platelet transfusions, which are becoming increasingly common in some dengue-endemic countries, is not supported by evidence and may not be necessary for all patients. The study highlights the need for further research on the use of blood products in dengue treatment and the development of age-specific guidelines for managing the disease.
Researchers studied SIVsmm infection in sooty mangabeys, a natural host species, and found that despite robust virus replication, the infection is non-pathogenic. They identified a novel mutation in the CCR5 gene, which encodes a truncated molecule that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in vitro. This mutation, known as CCR5Δ2, was present in 26% of a large sooty mangabey colony and was also found in wild animals in West Africa. The researchers found that 8% of animals were homozygous for defective CCR5 alleles and 41% were heterozygous. Notably, the prevalence of natural SIVsmm infection was not significantly different in animals lacking functional CCR5 compared to those with wild-type CCR5. Furthermore, animals lacking functional CCR5 had robust plasma viral loads, which were only modestly lower than those of wild-type animals. The researchers also found that SIVsmm primary isolates infected both homozygous mutant and wild-type PBMC in a CCR5-independent manner in vitro, using alternative coreceptors such as CXCR6, GPR15, and GPR1. These findings suggest that SIVsmm relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in sooty mangabeys and raise the possibility of novel CCR5-negative target cells that may be more expendable than CCR5+ cells, enabling the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcription factor MEF2 in the development and progression of leiomyosarcomas (LMS), a rare type of soft tissue cancer. They found that MEF2 can have both pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities, depending on its interaction with co-activators or co-repressors. MEF2 regulates histone modifications associated with gene activation and repression, such as H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation. The study identified class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) as critical regulators of MEF2's repressive activity. In LMS, high levels of MEF2 and class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, are associated with poor patient outcomes. The researchers found that knocking out HDAC9 in LMS cells suppressed the transformed phenotype and restored the transcriptional activity of some MEF2-target genes. Additionally, they discovered that class IIa HDACs do not bind all regulatory elements bound by MEF2, allowing for the coexistence of actively transcribed and repressed MEF2-target genes. Overall, the study suggests that class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, are potential therapeutic targets for LMS treatment.
Researchers have used a combination of protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and electron cryo-microscopy to study the structure of hydrophobin films composed of two class II hydrophobins, HFBI and HFBII, produced by the fungus Trichoderma reesei. Hydrophobins are proteins that play a crucial role in the interaction between fungi and their environment, and their unique properties at interfaces have led to various industrial applications. The study aimed to gain a detailed understanding of the surface structure of hydrophobin films at the atomic level.

The researchers found that the experimentally observed unit cell size for the 2-D crystal structure of the hydrophobins matches one of the lattice vectors of a close-packed arrangement of the proteins, suggesting a unit cell composed of six proteins. However, computational results indicate the possibility of an alternate ordering with a three-protein unit cell with P3 symmetry and a smaller unit cell size. A Monte Carlo simulation of a spin model representing the hydrophobin film was used to show how this alternate metastable structure may play a role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydrophobin films.

The study's findings suggest that the unique macroscopic properties of hydrophobin films arise from cooperative effects in the stabilization of the film resulting from interactions between the interlocking proteins in the structured surface network they form. The research has implications for both biology and nanotechnology, highlighting the importance of understanding the structure and behavior of hydrophobin films at the atomic level.
Researchers have identified Leishmania donovani threonyl tRNA synthetase (LdThrRS) as a potential therapeutic target for treating visceral leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. LdThrRS is an enzyme essential for protein synthesis, and its inhibition could disrupt the parasite's ability to survive and replicate. The researchers expressed and purified recombinant LdThrRS (rLdThrRS) in E. coli and determined its kinetic parameters, finding that it displayed aminoacylation activity. Immunofluorescence analysis suggested that LdThrRS is localized to both the cytosol and mitochondria.

Heterozygous mutants of LdThrRS were generated in Leishmania promastigotes, which showed a restrictive growth phenotype and attenuated infectivity. These mutants were also more susceptible to inhibition by the known ThrRS inhibitor, borrelidin. However, attempts to obtain ThrRS homozygous null mutants were unsuccessful, indicating that LdThrRS is essential for the parasite's survival. Borrelidin showed a strong affinity for LdThrRS, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.04 μM, and effectively inhibited the aminoacylation activity of rLdThrRS with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.06 μM. The researchers also found that borrelidin inhibited the promastigote stage of the parasite with an IC50 of 21 μM. These findings suggest that LdThrRS is a promising target for antileishmanial drug discovery efforts.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the innate immune system through the presence of a 5'-triphosphate (5'-ppp) on the viral RNA in association with a 3' poly-U/UC tract. The poly-U/UC tract is composed of a 34-nucleotide poly-uridine "core" and interspersed ribocytosine nucleotides. Research has shown that the poly-uridine core is essential for recognition by the RIG-I protein, which is a key component of the innate immune system. RIG-I recognizes long poly-uridine regions as non-self motifs within 5'-ppp RNA. The affinity of RIG-I/RNA binding interactions and critical contacts between the PAMP RNA and RIG-I helicase domain define an HCV RNA recognition sequence in which long poly-uridine sequences (>U17) with interspersed ribocytosines induce anti-HCV responses in vitro and hepatic innate immune responses in vivo. The presence of a 5'-ppp and the 34-nt poly-U core within the HCV poly-U/UC tract are required for non-self recognition of HCV RNA by RIG-I. These findings define a multi-motif PAMP signature of non-self recognition by RIG-I that incorporates a 5'-ppp with poly-uridine sequence composition and length. This HCV PAMP motif drives potent RIG-I signaling to induce the innate immune response to infection, offering insights into the antiviral therapeutic potential of targeted RIG-I signaling activation.
Researchers investigated the role of eosinophils in supporting the growth of Trichinella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle. They found that eosinophils and the cytokine IL-4 are necessary for normal larval growth, and that eosinophils from IL-4 competent mice can support growth even in the absence of adaptive immunity. The study suggests that eosinophils promote larval growth by limiting local inflammation and influencing nutrient homeostasis in muscle. This is achieved through the redistribution of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and phosphorylation of Akt, leading to enhanced glucose uptake and glycogen storage by the larvae. The researchers propose that eosinophils promote larval growth by an IL-4 dependent mechanism that limits interferon-driven responses, which would otherwise alter nutrient metabolism in infected muscle. The study also found that the effect of eosinophils on larval growth is independent of ILC2 cells, and that IL-4-/- eosinophils are unable to support larval growth. The findings demonstrate a novel interaction between the parasite and host, where the worm has evolved a strategy to co-opt an innate host cell response to facilitate its growth. Further experimentation is needed to fully elucidate the mechanism by which eosinophils support larval growth.
Genome-wide replication timing studies have suggested that mammalian chromosomes consist of large domains of coordinated origin firing separated by originless transition regions. However, a quantitative genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in HeLa cells contradicts this view. DNA combing in HeLa cells sorted into four temporal compartments of S phase shows that replication origins are spaced at 40 kb intervals and fire as small clusters whose synchrony increases during S phase. Replication fork velocity remains constant and narrowly distributed through S phase, with a mean speed of 0.7 kb/min and a maximum speed of 2.0 kb/min.

Multi-scale analysis of a genome-wide replication timing profile reveals a broad distribution of replication timing gradients with no regions larger than 100 kb replicating at less than 2 kb/min. This suggests that HeLa cells lack large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Instead, temporal transition regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at a rate that increases during S phase. Replication timing gradients are set by the delay and spacing between successive origin firings rather than by the velocity of single forks.

Analysis of published origin maps in HeLa cells and other cell types corroborates these findings, with the exception of embryonic stem cells where regions of unidirectional fork progression seem more abundant. The results suggest that origins fire independently of each other but under the control of long-range chromatin structure, or that replication forks progressing from early origins stimulate initiation in nearby unreplicated DNA. These findings provide a new understanding of the replication timing program of mammalian genomes and a general model for their replication kinetics.
Researchers investigated how the nervous system can efficiently recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables such as perspective or lighting conditions. They proposed that this ability is learned by exploiting the fact that object identities typically vary more slowly in time than contextual variables or noise. The study aimed to implement this "temporal stability" or "slowness" approach within the limits of biologically realistic spike-based learning rules.

The researchers first showed that slow feature analysis, an algorithm based on slowness, can be implemented in linear continuous model neurons using a modified Hebbian learning rule. This approach provides a link to the trace rule, another implementation of slowness learning. They then demonstrated that for linear Poisson neurons, slowness learning can be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific learning window.

The study found that the outcome of STDP learning is not governed by the learning window alone but by the convolution of the learning window with the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). The researchers derived STDP learning windows that implement slow feature analysis and the "trace rule" and showed that these windows are compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. The analysis also revealed that the learning window can be split into two functionally different components sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of the input statistics.
Researchers have identified a new phenomenon in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), where cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells when exposed to cancer therapy. This behavior was observed in a study using a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit to engineer phenotypically diverse NSCLC cells with mutations in Dicer1, a gene involved in small non-coding RNA genesis. The researchers used a three-dimensional growth platform to monitor the growth dynamics of mutant and wild-type cells individually or in co-culture under unstimulated or drug pressure conditions. Mathematical modeling and flow cytometry were used to characterize the growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures, revealing that the combination of wild-type and mutant cells in co-cultures allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug-sensitive cells despite drug pressure. This growth was attributed to a cooperative game theoretic change in the fitness values of the cells. The study also used an ex vivo human tumor model to determine that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates with prognostic failure of multiple clinically-approved and off-label drugs in individual NSCLC patient samples. These findings suggest that profiling for druggable targets alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy, and that understanding how tumor cells interact with each other to promote resistance is critical to improving the effectiveness of cancer therapeutics.
A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted in the Mbeya Region of Southwestern Tanzania to estimate the prevalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae. A total of 1,228 participants aged 5 years and above were randomly selected from nine communities, stratified by age, altitude, and ownership of domestic mammals. The study found a high seroprevalence of 67.9% for SFG rickettsiae, with a range of 42.8-91.4% across the nine sites. Multivariable analysis revealed associations between SFG seropositivity and age, warmer temperatures, male gender, and low population density. Additionally, higher cattle density was associated with higher seroprevalence at higher elevations. The study suggests that SFG rickettsial infection is common in the rural population of Mbeya Region, and its spread may be limited by temperature and elevation. The findings are consistent with previous descriptions of SFG rickettsioses in sub-Saharan Africa and highlight the need for further research to determine the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses in the population. The study also emphasizes the importance of examining the local transmission cycle and validating the identified risk factors in a prospective study.
A recent study has identified a crucial role for the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Researchers conducted an RNAi screen to identify regulators of innate immune defense genes and found that two stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturases, which synthesize oleate in C. elegans, are essential for the pathogen-mediated induction of immune defense genes. The study found that C. elegans deficient in oleate production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse human pathogens, which can be rescued by the addition of exogenous oleate. However, oleate is not sufficient to drive protective immune activation on its own.

The researchers also investigated the relationship between oleate and other polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as γ-linolenic acid (GLA) and stearidonic acid (SDA), which have previously been shown to be required for innate immune activation in C. elegans. They found that oleate affects immune effector expression and pathogen resistance through a distinct mechanism, separate from the effects of GLA and SDA. The study suggests that oleate plays a critical role in innate immune activation and pathogen defense in C. elegans, adding to the known health-promoting effects of monounsaturated fatty acids. The findings also imply an ancient link between nutrient stores, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection.
Researchers have identified a novel compound, PC1, that selectively inhibits the growth of certain bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens, by targeting guanine riboswitches. Guanine riboswitches are regulatory elements that control the expression of genes involved in purine metabolism, which is essential for nucleotide production in cells. When guanine binds to the riboswitch, it stabilizes a specific mRNA structure, leading to the repression of downstream gene expression. By designing a pyrimidine compound that mimics the structure of guanine, the researchers created PC1, which selectively binds to guanine riboswitches and inhibits bacterial growth. This bactericidal activity is only observed in bacteria that use guanine riboswitches to control the expression of the guaA gene, which codes for a GMP synthetase. The researchers tested PC1 against various bacterial species and found that it was effective against several clinical strains that exhibit multiple drug resistance. In a mouse model, the administration of PC1 was shown to reduce Staphylococcus aureus infection in mammary glands. This study demonstrates the potential of using existing structural knowledge to design novel antibiotics that target guanine riboswitches, which could provide a new approach to treating bacterial infections, particularly those caused by community-acquired pathogens. The discovery of this new guanine riboswitch target is significant, as it may lead to the development of more effective and selective antimicrobial compounds.
Researchers studied how macaque monkeys navigate a virtual reality maze to find a reward, examining their navigation behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity. They found that cells in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in spatial memory, responded not only to the animal's position in space but also to other variables such as head direction, point of gaze, and task context. Many cells fired in response to a single landmark in a viewpoint- or task-dependent manner, encoding the animal's situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. The hippocampal activity was best described by a fine-grained state space comprising current position, view, and action contexts. This suggests that the primate hippocampus embodies multidimensional, task-situated knowledge related to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in the construction of space. The study's findings are consistent with previous research in rodents and provide a comprehensive analysis of the variables controlling hippocampal cell activity. The results indicate that the primate hippocampus codes for the target of gaze in an informed manner, embedding self-position with respect to elements in the environment and to action context. The study bridges the gap between research in rodents and primates, including humans, collected in real and virtual environments, and provides a useful framework for cross-species comparisons.
Researchers have studied the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB) in vertebrate development, a region characterized by a specific pattern of gene expression. This pattern is established and maintained by a regulatory network between several transcription and secreted factors, but the details of this network are not yet fully understood. Using a Boolean analysis of spatial gene expression patterns at the murine MHB, the researchers identified key regulatory interactions in this network. They found that Fgf8 maintains, rather than induces, Wnt1 expression, a relationship that was unclear from previous data. Experimental evidence from mouse anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures confirmed this finding, showing that Fgf8 only maintains ectopic Wnt1 expression in these explants. The researchers constructed a regulatory network between key transcription and secreted factors at the MHB, including Otx2, Gbx2, Fgf8, Wnt1, En, and Pax. Analysis of this network using Boolean, differential equation, and reaction-diffusion models confirmed that it can explain the stable maintenance of the MHB and the time-courses of expression patterns under wild-type and various knock-out conditions. The study demonstrates that spatial expression patterns can be used to gain information about the structure of regulatory networks, and that the spatial gene expression patterns around the MHB help to understand the maintenance of this boundary on a systems level.
Theileria annulata, an apicomplexan parasite, transforms infected host cells, inducing uncontrolled proliferation and clonal expansion of the parasitized cell population. The parasite develops into a schizont, which remains tethered to host cell microtubules (MTs) and engages with the cell's astral and central spindle MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis to secure its distribution between the two daughter cells. The molecular mechanism by which the schizont recruits and stabilizes host cell MTs is not known.

Research has shown that the plus ends of growing MTs provide the first point of contact with the parasite, and the end-binding protein 1 (EB1) is a central component of the MT plus end protein interaction network and key regulator of host cell MT dynamics. The study found that T. annulata p104, a polymorphic antigen expressed on the schizont surface, functions as a genuine EB1-binding protein and can recruit EB1 in the absence of any other parasite proteins. The binding strictly depends on a consensus SxIP motif located in a highly disordered C-terminal region of p104.

The interaction between the schizont and host cell EB1 is cell cycle regulated, and this is the first description of a pathogen-encoded protein to interact with EB1 via a bona-fide SxIP motif. The findings provide new insight into the mode of interaction between Theileria and the host cell cytoskeleton. The schizont's interaction with host cell MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis is crucial for the persistence of the parasite in its transformed host.
Research has shown that broken replication forks in DNA can lead to DNA breaks, which are typically repaired through homologous recombination or break-induced replication (BIR). A study in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae found that a mutation in the replicative ligase Cdc9 resulted in a population of cells with persistent DNA damage, constitutive activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, and longer telomeres. This telomere lengthening was dependent on functional telomerase, the DNA damage signaling cascade Mec1-Rad9-Rad53, and components of the BIR repair pathway, including Rad51, Rad52, Pol32, and Pif1.

The study found that the Mec1-Rad53-induced phosphorylation of Pif1, a protein previously known to inhibit telomerase at double-strand breaks, was also crucial for Pif1's role in BIR and telomere elongation in Cdc9 mutant cells. Similar results were observed in two other mutants with impaired DNA replication, Cdc44-5 and Rrm3Δ, where the long telomere phenotype was dependent on the Pif1 phosphorylation locus.

The researchers propose a model in which the passage of BIR forks through telomeres promotes telomerase activity and leads to telomere lengthening. They suggest that the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Pif1 promotes telomere-stabilizing telomere extension while repressing deleterious de novo telomere addition events at DNA breaks. This mechanism may explain previous reports of constitutive activation of Rad53 and longer telomeres in Rrm3 mutants, which suffer from replication fork pausing and breakage.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool for onchocerciasis, a parasitic infection caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The tool, called luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), uses a mixture of four recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens (Ov-FAR-1, Ov-API-1, Ov-MSA-1, and Ov-CPI-1) to detect antibodies in patient sera. The LIPS assay was tested on a large cohort of sera from patients with proven parasitic infections, including Onchocerca volvulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, Strongyloides stercoralis, and other potentially cross-reactive infections. The results showed that the LIPS assay had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera from uninfected control sera. The assay was also able to differentiate between Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera and sera from patients infected with other filarial parasites, such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongyloides stercoralis. The simplified method of using a mixture of the four Onchocerca volvulus antigens simultaneously in the standard format or a quick 15-minute format (QLIPS) showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera from uninfected control sera. The QLIPS format had the best performance, with 100% sensitivity and specificity values of 76%, 84%, and 93% for distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus from Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongyloides stercoralis-infected sera, respectively. The multi-antigen LIPS assay can be used as a rapid, high-throughput, and specific tool for diagnosing individual Onchocerca volvulus infections and for early detection of recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Onchocerca volvulus infection.
A 54-month iron-folic acid and de-worming program was implemented in a rural population of women in northern Vietnam to assess its effectiveness in reducing anemia, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted helminth infections. The program involved weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming. The study found that after 54 months, 76% of participants were taking the iron-folic acid supplement and 95% had taken the most recent deworming treatment. The mean hemoglobin level increased from 122 g/L to 131 g/L, and the prevalence of anemia decreased from 38% to 18%. Iron deficiency fell from 23% to 8%, and iron deficiency anemia was reduced to 4%. The prevalence of hookworm infection decreased from 76% to 11%, and the level of moderate or heavy infestation of any soil-transmitted helminth was reduced to less than 1%. These results indicate that population-based interventions can efficiently and effectively reduce anemia and practically eliminate iron deficiency anemia and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted helminth infections, maintaining them below the level of public health concern.
Researchers have identified a novel immune evasion mechanism used by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to avoid detection by the immune system. The virus encodes a protein called gp150, which is heavily glycosylated and expressed during the late phase of viral replication. This protein interferes with the presentation of antigens on the surface of infected cells, making it difficult for the immune system to recognize and attack the virus. Specifically, gp150 inhibits the presentation of antigens by HLA class I, HLA class II, and CD1d molecules, which are responsible for triggering T-cell and iNKT cell responses. The mechanism of gp150-mediated immune evasion does not involve the degradation of antigen-presenting molecules or the cytoplasmic tail of the protein. Instead, the abundant glycosylation of gp150 creates a shield that impedes the surface presentation of antigens. This is an unprecedented immune evasion mechanism for herpesviruses. The study found that B cells infected with a gp150-null mutant EBV displayed rescued levels of surface antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA class II, and CD1d, suggesting an important role for iNKT cells in fighting EBV infection. The results indicate that EBV gp150 prolongs the timespan for producing viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the viral life cycle.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp) in the invasion of host cells by pathogenic chlamydial species. Tarp is a conserved protein among all pathogenic chlamydial species, and its actin binding domain is essential for its function. A peptide antiserum specific to the Tarp actin binding domain inhibited actin polymerization in vitro and chlamydial entry in vivo, indicating its importance in chlamydial pathogenesis. Sequence analysis of Tarp orthologs from various chlamydial species revealed multiple putative actin binding sites, and GST-Tarp fusions from multiple species were found to bind and nucleate actin in vitro. These findings suggest that Tarp-mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species and plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells. Chlamydial species such as Caviae, C. muridarum, and various C. trachomatis serovars were found to harbor at least one and up to four functional actin binding domains, and purified recombinant Tarps from all species were capable of nucleating actin filament formation in vitro. A peptide antiserum targeting the actin binding domain prevented Tarp-mediated actin nucleation and reduced host cell susceptibility to chlamydial infection when delivered into host cells. These results indicate that the actin nucleating activity of Tarp is required for C. trachomatis invasion and suggest that the actin binding domain plays an important role in bacterial entry.
Researchers have developed a new procedure, the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (FEA-SD) technique, to accurately quantify Schistosoma japonicum eggs in bovine feces. This technique is crucial for determining the prevalence and intensity of S. japonicum in mammalian hosts, which is essential for calculating transmission rates and assessing environmental contamination. The FEA-SD method involves a series of steps, including filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation, to remove bulk debris and cellulose material that often obscures schistosome eggs in fecal samples. This allows for improved microscopic visualization of S. japonicum eggs and provides an accurate quantitative method for estimating infection in bovines and other ruminant reservoir hosts.

The FEA-SD technique was tested using fecal samples from naturally infected Chinese water buffaloes and carabao (water buffalo) in the Philippines, and it was found to be as efficient as real-time PCR (qPCR) for determining schistosome prevalence in bovines but is less costly to implement. This new method can be used as a surveillance tool for animal reservoirs of S. japonicum, particularly in areas with low to high infection intensity or where there is suspected elimination of schistosomiasis japonica. The FEA-SD technique is an improved tool for visualizing schistosome eggs and determining the prevalence and intensity of S. japonicum infection in bovines, which is essential for controlling and eliminating schistosomiasis japonica.
Researchers investigated the effects of collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation on skeletal tissues. Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) were previously identified as causes of recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI). These proteins, along with cyclophilin B, form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the α1(I) chain and has cis/trans isomerase activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 is not required for collagen structural stability, but its absence may disrupt protein-protein interactions and lead to collagen over-modification.

To distinguish between the functions of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex, researchers generated knock-in mice carrying a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic site of P3H1. This substitution abolished P3H1 activity but retained its ability to form a complex with CRTAP. The knock-in mice showed no prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of the α1(I) and α1(II) collagen chains but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. The mice were normal in appearance, had no growth defects, and normal cartilage growth plate histology, but showed decreased trabecular bone mass.

These findings suggest differential tissue consequences due to selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. The study highlights the importance of this complex in collagen modification and maintenance of bone mass.
Researchers have identified a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenomenon in Drosophila simulans, a species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster. This phenomenon is characterized by abnormal phenotypes, including sterility, in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains collected in different years. A survey of 181 strains found that approximately 20% of strains induce hybrid dysgenesis. Genomic and transcriptomic data revealed that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element, a selfish genetic element that was previously thought to be exclusive to D. melanogaster.

The study found that the P-element invaded D. simulans rapidly and nearly simultaneously across three continents and over 27 years, with strains containing the P-element being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Notably, strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element, as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype.

Comparative analysis with D. melanogaster showed that the spread of the P-element in D. simulans was surprisingly fast, with lower rates of P-element induced gonadal dysgenesis observed in D. simulans compared to D. melanogaster. This suggests that D. simulans may have a selective advantage in suppressing the effects of the P-element, which could hinder its spread. The study highlights the evolutionary challenge posed by selfish genetic elements and the rapid adaptation of species to mitigate their effects.
Researchers have developed a new method to mark the body and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using rhodamine B, a fluorescent dye. This technique allows for the assessment of mating success and dispersion of sterilized males in the wild, which is crucial for controlling Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus populations using male-based sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT). The method involves feeding male mosquitoes on a sugar solution containing rhodamine B, which is then transferred to their body tissue and seminal fluid. The study found that all concentrations of rhodamine B tested (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8%) resulted in over 95% transfer to females and successful body marking after 4 days of feeding. The 0.4 and 0.8% solutions produced the longest-lasting body marking. Importantly, the study found that rhodamine B marking had no effect on male mating competitiveness. Field releases demonstrated successful transfer of marked seminal fluid to females and recapture of marked males. The results suggest that rhodamine B is a useful evaluation method for male-based SIT/IIT control strategies and a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture experiments. This method is less expensive and less time-consuming than other methods, such as PCR and stable isotope semen labeling.
Bacterial superantigens, a diverse family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. Researchers have discovered that these toxins must bind directly to the CD28 homodimer interface on T cells to elicit inflammatory cytokine gene expression and toxicity. CD28 is a costimulatory molecule that plays a crucial role in the immune response by interacting with its B7 coligands. The study found that preventing access of the superantigen to CD28 suffices to block its lethality. Mice were protected from lethal superantigen challenge by short peptide mimetics of the CD28 dimer interface and by peptides selected to compete with the superantigen for its binding site in CD28. The superantigen uses a conserved β-strand/hinge/α-helix domain to engage CD28, and mutation of this domain abolished inflammatory cytokine gene induction and lethality. Structural analysis revealed that CD28 can be accommodated as a third superantigen receptor in the quaternary complex, with the CD28 dimer interface oriented towards the β-strand/hinge/α-helix domain in the superantigen. The findings identify the CD28 homodimer interface as a critical receptor target for superantigens, broadening the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms. This novel role of CD28 as a receptor for a class of microbial pathogens, the superantigen toxins, highlights the importance of CD28 in the immune response.
The Wnt/Tcf1 pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Unlike its mitogenic effect in somatic cells, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway triggers an anti-proliferative effect in mESCs through the activation of the Ink4/Arf tumor suppressor locus. The Wnt-effector Tcf1 is recruited to the promoter of cell cycle repressor genes, such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a, and p19Arf, which mediate the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in mESCs. This effect is dependent on β-catenin and Tcf1, but not Tcf3, indicating specialized and non-overlapping functions of Tcf/Lef factors in mESCs. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in the downregulation of some cell differentiation genes, while the expression of pluripotency genes remains unperturbed. The Wnt/Tcf1 pathway restricts mESC proliferation by increasing the expression of negative regulators of the cell cycle, such as the tumor suppressors Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b. In contrast to its mitogenic effect in somatic cells, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has an anti-proliferative effect in mESCs via Tcf1 activity. This study demonstrates that the Wnt/Tcf1 pathway controls mESC pluripotency and proliferation through non-overlapping functions of distinct Tcf factors.
Researchers investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the immune response to dengue virus (DENV) infection. They found that pDCs from patients with mild dengue fever exhibited higher frequencies of membrane TRAIL (mTRAIL) expression compared to those with severe dengue or healthy controls. Additionally, plasma levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and soluble TRAIL were increased in mild dengue patients, correlating with pDC activation. In vitro experiments showed that exposure to DENV-2 induced mTRAIL expression on pDCs and relocalized TRAIL from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited this process, suggesting that endocytosis is involved in DENV-2 activation of pDCs. Coculture experiments revealed that pDCs can reduce viral load in infected monocytes through IFN-α production. The study suggests that TRAIL-expressing pDCs may play a crucial role in the outcome of dengue fever, with higher pDC activation associated with milder disease. The findings provide new insights into the immune response to DENV infection and highlight the potential importance of pDCs in controlling viral replication and disease severity.
Researchers have investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. TNF plays a crucial role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. However, TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been linked to an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation. This study used a computational approach to analyze the effects of anti-TNF therapy on Mtb infection. The researchers extended their previous mathematical models to investigate the roles of soluble TNF (sTNF) and transmembrane TNF (tmTNF) in controlling Mtb infection. They simulated the effects of two commonly used anti-TNF therapies, a TNF-neutralizing antibody and a soluble p75 TNF receptor fusion, in virtual clinical trials. The study found that the bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor contributing to the reactivation of latent TB infection. Additionally, the researchers discovered that even low levels of sTNF are essential for controlling Mtb infection. The study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed to balance the reduction of inflammation with the need to maintain resistance to infection. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified to minimize the risk of TB reactivation.
A recent study investigated inter-population differences in retrogene loss and expression in humans. The researchers used data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Illumina BodyMap project to analyze the variation in loss of ancestral retrocopies among different human populations. They also developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the reference human genome. The study identified 193 retroduplication variations (RDVs), with the majority resulting from retrocopy deletion. Most of these RDVs had not been previously reported.

The researchers experimentally confirmed the existence of the detected retrocopies and determined their presence or absence in the human genomes of 17 different populations. They found that 11 ancestral retrogenes underwent deletion in certain individuals, and the frequency of their deletion was very low. The expression, conservation, and low rate of deletion of the remaining 10 retrocopies may suggest some functionality.

The study also searched for differences in retrocopy expression levels between populations and found 9 retrogenes that undergo statistically significant differential expression. The researchers developed an approach to detect and characterize hitherto undiscovered retroduplication variations in the human genome. Their findings suggest that retrocopy polymorphisms can provide great insight into ongoing evolutionary processes and can be used as markers for human population history. The study's results complement previous studies, which mainly focused on RDVs from recent retroposition events, by revealing RDVs resulting from retrocopy deletion.
Researchers investigated how the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the brain affects the inflammatory response to praziquantel treatment in pigs with neurocysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is a disease caused by the infection of the central nervous system by Taenia solium cysticerci. The study used histological specimens from 11 pigs naturally infected with Taenia solium cysticerci to compare the inflammatory responses to cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma, meninges, or both tissues. The researchers found that cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma provoked a significantly greater level of pericystic inflammation after treatment with praziquantel compared to those located in the meninges or partially in contact with both the parenchyma and meninges. The inflammatory response to cysticerci located in the meninges was significantly decreased compared to those in the parenchyma. The study also found that the disruption of the blood-brain barrier was associated with treatment only in parenchymal tissue. These findings suggest that the location of cysticerci in the brain may influence the inflammatory response to praziquantel treatment, which could explain why subarachnoid neurocysticercosis is generally refractory to treatment compared to parenchymal neurocysticercosis.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in two districts of Ghana to investigate the presence of yaws, a treponemal infection caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue, in areas where mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin had previously been conducted for trachoma control. The study aimed to determine whether resistance to azithromycin had emerged in T. pallidum ssp. pertenue or if alternative infections were responsible for reported cases of yaws. A total of 90 children aged 5-17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled from 30 communities in the two districts. Samples were collected for treponemal serology, lesion PCR, and syphilis serology. The results showed that all children had negative treponemal and non-treponemal serology, indicating they had never been infected with yaws. PCR for T. pallidum ssp. pertenue was negative in all children, but Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. The study found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws in these communities, which had previously been treated for trachoma. However, H. ducreyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, and the majority of lesions remained unexplained. The study highlights the need for integration of diagnostic testing into both pre- and post-MDA surveillance systems to better inform yaws control programs.
Researchers have identified a potential strategy to combat HIV persistence by targeting the Jak-STAT pathway, which plays a crucial role in the establishment and maintenance of the HIV reservoir. The HIV reservoir is a group of dormant cells that harbor the virus, making it difficult to eradicate with current antiretroviral therapy (ART). The Jak-STAT pathway is involved in regulating the homeostasis of memory T cells, which are the primary hub of the HIV reservoir. Two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, were evaluated for their ability to block the seeding and maintenance of the HIV reservoir in vitro. The results showed that these inhibitors reduced the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA and blocked viral production from infected cells. Additionally, the inhibitors prevented the transmission of infectious particles to bystander activated T cells. The study also demonstrated that the Jak-STAT pathway is involved in HIV persistence in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro, and that pSTAT5 strongly correlates with increased levels of integrated viral DNA in vivo. The findings suggest that dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is associated with viral persistence and that Jak inhibitors target key events downstream of cytokine ligation to their receptors, impacting the magnitude of the HIV reservoir in all memory CD4 T cell subsets. These results provide a potential therapeutic modality to prevent key events of T cell activation that regulate HIV persistence and may be integrated into future curative strategies.
Researchers studied the response of Spodoptera exigua larvae to infection with two types of baculoviruses, SeMNPV and AcMNPV, using a microarray to analyze gene expression. Contrary to the expected host transcriptional shut-off, the larvae showed a balanced number of up- and down-regulated genes in the first 36 hours after infection. Immune-related genes, including those involved in pattern recognition, signaling, and immune pathways, were found to be down-regulated. This down-regulation was also observed in the larval gut, where immune-related genes play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of gut microorganisms. The researchers hypothesized that the down-regulation of immune-related genes after baculovirus infection may lead to an increase in gut bacterial load. Subsequent experiments confirmed this hypothesis, showing an increase in gut bacterial load after infection. Furthermore, the presence of gut microbiota was found to enhance baculovirus virulence, pathogenicity, and dispersion. The study suggests that the host immune response processes and pathways affected by baculoviruses, as well as the role of gut microbiota in viral infection, warrant further investigation.
Researchers have made a significant breakthrough in understanding and engineering apomixis, a process of asexual clonal reproduction through seeds. Apomixis is of great interest in agriculture due to its potential to produce genetically identical offspring without the need for fertilization. A key component of apomixis is apomeiosis, where meiosis is deregulated, resulting in a mitotic-like division. Scientists have isolated and characterized a novel gene that controls entry into the second meiotic division. By combining mutations in this gene with two others that affect meiotic processes, they created a genotype called MiMe, where meiosis is replaced by mitosis.

In the MiMe genotype, plants produce functional diploid gametes that are genetically identical to their mother. This is a crucial step towards understanding and engineering apomixis. The researchers demonstrated that fully penetrant apomeiosis can be induced in a sexual plant, where a mitotic-like division replaces meiosis. The MiMe plants generate dyads and are fertile, producing quasi-wild type levels of viable and apomeiotic ovules and pollen grains. The gametes produced by MiMe plants retain the mother plant's heterozygosity for every genetic marker tested, confirming that they undergo a mitotic-like division instead of a normal meiotic division. This breakthrough has significant implications for the development of apomixis in agriculture, allowing for the production of genetically identical offspring without the need for fertilization.
Researchers have developed a new approach to prioritize genes that cause diseases by incorporating tissue-specific information into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Current methods use a generic PPI network to identify disease-causing genes, but this approach may not accurately reflect the complex interactions within specific tissues. To address this limitation, the researchers constructed tissue-specific PPI networks for 60 healthy human tissues using gene expression data from those tissues. They then applied a gene prioritization algorithm to both the original and tissue-specific PPI networks and compared their performance in a cross-validation setting. The results showed that the tissue-specific variant of the algorithm yielded higher accuracy and correctly ranked the disease-causing gene more often than the original variant. Furthermore, the researchers found that a large majority (71-83%) of known disease-causing genes are significantly expressed in the corresponding disease-associated tissue, supporting the hypothesis that a gene is likely to be expressed in a healthy tissue for its mutation to clinically manifest in that tissue. By incorporating tissue-specific information, the researchers were able to enhance the performance of the gene prioritization algorithm and infer new disease-tissue associations. This approach has the potential to improve the identification of disease-causing genes and provide insights into sub-clinical tissue effects that may escape early detection.
Researchers have developed a two-locus model to study the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito species that transmit diseases such as malaria. The model allows for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide, as well as varying selection pressures and dominance values depending on the concentration of insecticide encountered. The model was used to investigate the relative merits of sequential use of insecticides versus their deployment as a mixture to minimize the spread of resistance. The study found that both strategies can be effective in delaying the spread of resistance, with mixtures favored when insecticide effectiveness is high and exposure is low. However, if insecticides do not reliably kill homozygous susceptible mosquitoes, sequential deployment may be a more robust strategy. The study also found that using a mixture of insecticides can slow the spread of resistance, but may not always outperform sequential use. The results suggest that the choice between mixture and sequential deployment depends on various factors, including the attributes of the insecticides, their application, mosquito behavior, and genetics. The study emphasizes the importance of considering these factors when designing vector control strategies to minimize the spread of insecticide resistance.
Researchers have investigated the saliva of Rhodnius neglectus, a vector of Chagas disease, using next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification. This study aimed to catalog the transcripts of R. neglectus salivary glands with probable functions in hematophagy. The analysis revealed a set of 636 coding DNA sequences (CDS) of proteins of putative secretory nature, 73 of which were confirmed by proteomic analysis. The sialome of R. neglectus was characterized, and serine protease transcripts were detected. The study found the presence of ubiquitous protein families, including lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5, as well as less abundant metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding protein families. The data improve our understanding of hematophagous arthropod sialomes and the complex interplay among vectors and their vertebrate hosts. The study also highlights the importance of deep sequencing in discovering new biological molecules in the saliva of bloodsucking insects, offering a new array of substances to be further investigated and functionally characterized. The findings suggest that the expression of putative trypsin-like serine proteases in the salivary glands of R. neglectus may correlate with the blood sources of this species of triatomine. Further research is needed to analyze the role of these secreted proteins in hematophagy.
Researchers used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study the interaction between nematodes and soil bacteria in grasslands. They isolated bacteria from grassland soils and exposed C. elegans to these bacteria to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to different bacterial environments. Transcriptional profiling revealed that many of the regulated genes are involved in metabolism and innate immunity, suggesting that similar genes could influence nematode community dynamics in natural systems. The researchers then used mutations to inactivate 21 of the identified genes and found that most contribute to lifespan and/or fitness in a given bacterial environment. They also showed that changes in food source, such as those that occur in environmental disturbance, can have a significant impact on gene expression and fitness. Furthermore, the researchers used regression analysis to demonstrate that the degree of differential gene expression between two bacterial environments can predict the magnitude of the effect of the loss of gene function on life history traits in those environments. These findings suggest that the genomic response of C. elegans to soil bacteria can predict environment-specific genetic effects on life history traits, providing new insights into the complex interactions between nematodes and their bacterial environment.
Researchers have investigated the role of gene expression noise in the development of mammalian embryos, specifically the formation of the inner cell mass and trophoectoderm. Using multi-scale, stochastic modeling, they found that gene expression noise enhances the robust organization of the early mammalian blastocyst. The study made three key predictions, which were supported by quantitative imaging: (1) stochasticity in gene expression promotes cell plasticity and plays a critical role in accurately organizing the developing mouse blastocyst; (2) asymmetry in the levels of noise variation of Cdx2 and Oct4 provides a means to gain the benefits of noise-mediated plasticity while minimizing its detrimental effects; and (3) the embryo temporally modulates plasticity by controlling the timing and pace of cell fate specification, creating a time window for cells to adjust their fate based on their environment.

The results suggest that noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst. The study found that noise in Cdx2 expression improves organization, while noise in Oct4 expression does not. The researchers also found that the amount of expression noise within embryos is consistent with the amounts required to provide a benefit. These findings indicate that gene expression noise is essential for the correct structural arrangement of mouse blastocysts, adding significant robustness to the process. Overall, the study highlights the importance of gene expression noise in the development of mammalian embryos.
Researchers investigated the ability of germline antibody gene segments to encode polyspecific antibodies, which can bind to multiple antigens. They used computational design to predict antibody sequences that could bind to diverse antigens and found that these sequences matched germline gene sequences to a remarkable degree. This suggests that germline gene-encoded antibodies are optimal for polyspecificity. The researchers used the Rosetta multi-state design process to predict antibody sequences for the entire heavy chain variable region, including framework, CDR1, and CDR2 mutations. They found that key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework are critical contributors to polyspecificity in germline antibodies. In contrast, designing antibodies to bind a single antigen returned sequences similar to mature antibody sequences, mimicking natural antibody maturation. The study demonstrates that the Rosetta computational design algorithm captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition. The findings suggest that computational design of antibodies capable of binding multiple antigens may allow the rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecificity for diverse epitope binding.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the collective behavior of locusts, specifically the transition from a solitary to a gregarious phase, which is a key factor in the formation of destructive locust outbreaks. The model incorporates the interplay between phase change and spatial movement at the individual level to predict the dynamics of hopper band formation at the population level. Stability analysis of the model reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large-scale transition to the gregarious phase. The model also enables the quantification of the temporal dynamics of each phase, the proportion of the population that will eventually gregarize, and the time scale for this to occur.

Numerical simulations of the model provide descriptions of the aggregation's structure and reveal transiently traveling clumps of gregarious insects. The researchers found that in the limit of low densities, both phases are uniformly spread and the solitarious phase dominates. However, for sufficiently large populations, a dense, traveling patch of gregarious locusts suddenly emerges, while solitarious locusts become more and more scarce. The critical density beyond which the gregarious group forms and the final ratio of gregarious to solitarious locusts are calculated through analysis of the model.

The model also reveals that locust clustering at high densities is associated with the onset of a hopper band, and the most unstable cluster spacing is determined. Numerical simulations illustrate the rapid transitions that take place once gregarization is initiated, with dense packs of gregarious locusts forming and growing, and sweeping up solitarious locusts in their vicinity.
Researchers have characterized a structural intermediate in the membrane fusion process of flaviviruses, a type of virus that causes diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis. The study used tick-borne encephalitis virus as a model to investigate the fusion process, which involves the conversion of a viral envelope protein called E from a dimer to a trimer with a hairpin-like structure. By exposing the virus to alkaline pH instead of acidic pH, the researchers were able to trap the virus in an intermediate conformation where the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide, but do not proceed to merge the membranes. Further treatment with low pH led to fusion, suggesting that the monomers correspond to an intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. This finding provides new insights into the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion and suggests that the fusion process can be dissected into two separate steps: the insertion of multiple copies of E monomers into the membrane and the formation of hairpin-like trimers. The study's use of non-physiological conditions allowed for the identification of a previously elusive intermediate in the flavivirus fusion process, shedding light on the complex mechanisms involved in viral membrane fusion.
A recent study investigated the drivers of extinction risk in plants, focusing on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot. The researchers compared Red List data for the British and South African floras and found that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs significantly between regions, contradicting a simple, trait-based model of extinction. Using a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape, the study revealed a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant extinction risks, but found that the most threatened species cluster within short branches at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals.

The study analyzed the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades and suggested that mode of speciation best explains the unusual phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. The results indicate that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. Critically, the study found that the most vulnerable plant species are marching towards extinction at a more rapid pace, but independently from anthropogenic effects.

The study's findings have important implications for conservation priorities and cast doubts on the utility of current Red List criteria for plants in regions such as the Cape, where speciation has been rapid. The results also suggest that species turnover (speciation and extinction) might be rapid generally for plants, and high extinction rates may not be unusual over evolutionary timescales. The study highlights the need for detailed knowledge of interspecific phylogenetic relationships within higher taxa to estimate the true impact of plant extinctions on the loss of evolutionary history across the angiosperm tree-of-life.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav1, that interact with the Dectin-1 receptor in macrophages to facilitate the phagocytosis of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Dectin-1 is a key receptor involved in the innate immune response against fungal infections. The study found that BTK and Vav1 are recruited to the phagocytic cup, a structure that forms around the pathogen during phagocytosis, and colocalize with the lipid PI(3,4,5)P3 and F-actin. However, they are absent from mature phagosomes. Using a selective BTK inhibitor, the researchers showed that BTK contributes to the synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG) at the phagocytic cup, which is necessary for the recruitment of PKCε. BTK- or Vav1-deficient macrophages displayed a defect in phagocytosis of both zymosan and C. albicans, and bone marrow-derived macrophages lacking BTK or Vav1 showed reduced uptake of C. albicans, comparable to Dectin1-deficient cells. Furthermore, BTK- or Vav1-deficient mice were more susceptible to systemic C. albicans infection than wild-type mice. These findings highlight the importance of BTK and Vav1 in immune responses against C. albicans and suggest that targeting these proteins may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating fungal infections.
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans in Madagascar. The 2008-2009 outbreak highlighted the need to identify at-risk environments to optimize surveillance efforts. This study aimed to identify environmental factors and areas favorable to RVF transmission to both cattle and humans, as well as human behaviors contributing to human infections in Malagasy contexts.

Using a Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models, the study analyzed environmental, cattle, and human serological data collected at the national level. The results showed that humid environments and high cattle density were positively associated with cattle and human seroprevalence rates. Specifically, areas with high cattle density were at risk, and frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection.

The study identified the eastern-coast, western, and north-western parts of Madagascar as high-risk areas for RVF transmission in cattle. The association between cattle seroprevalence, humid environments, and high cattle density suggests that concomitant vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintaining RVF enzootic transmission. Vectorial transmission, facilitated by Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes, likely occurs in both cattle and humans in these at-risk areas.

The study's integrated approach provides new insights into RVF transmission patterns in Madagascar, highlighting the need to evaluate the relative contribution of vectorial and direct transmissions in different eco-climatic areas.
Researchers have investigated the transmission barriers of prions, self-propagating protein conformations, between non-identical proteins. They used a yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-based experimental system to explore the nature of transmission barriers. The study found that Rnq1's prion domain carries multiple prion determinants that can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the [PIN+] prion state in vivo. Analysis of [PIN+] transmission between Rnq1 fragments with different sets of prion determinants revealed that one common QN-rich region is required and usually sufficient for transmission, but barriers of different strength can impede transmission, even in the absence of amino acid mismatches in transmitting regions. This suggests that multiple prion determinants act cooperatively to attain the final prion conformation, and transmission barriers are determined by this cooperative fold. The study also found that the [PIN+] prion domain is located in the QN-rich C-terminus of Rnq1, but no one QN region is essential for maintaining the prion state, indicating that Rnq1 prion domain carries multiple determinants capable of independently supporting the prion state.
Researchers have developed a new method for analyzing population genetic data using deep learning, a type of machine learning technique. This approach allows for the inference of complex population genetic models without the need for likelihood calculations, which can be computationally infeasible. The method uses a multilayer neural network to learn a feature-based function that maps input data, such as summary statistics, to output parameters of interest, such as population genetic parameters.

The researchers applied this method to a dataset of 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia, inferring both the overall demography and regions of the genome under selection. The results showed that many regions of the genome have experienced hard sweeps, while fewer have undergone soft sweeps or balancing selection. Notably, soft sweeps and balancing selection were found to occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome.

The study also found that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster were too extreme. The researchers suggest that deep learning can provide a complimentary approach to existing likelihood-free inference methods in population genetics, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) or Support Vector Machines (SVM). They propose that deep learning could be used to select optimal statistics for ABC or other methods, or to classify regions as neutral or selected for subsequent demographic inference.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes, specifically E6 and E7, have been found to disrupt the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, leading to increased sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents such as cisplatin. Research has shown that cells expressing E6/E7 are hypersensitive to cisplatin and have defects in repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The study reveals that E6/E7 activates the FA pathway by increasing FancD2 monoubiquitination and foci formation, but inhibits the completion of the repair process through multiple mechanisms. Specifically, E6/E7 impairs the colocalization of FancD2 with double-strand breaks (DSBs), hindering the recruitment of the downstream protein Rad51 to DSBs. Additionally, E6 expression causes delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination, a critical process for effective ICL repair. This delay is associated with increased chromatin retention of FancD2, which hinders the de-ubiquitinating activity of USP1 and activates ATR/CHK-1/pS565 FancI signaling. Furthermore, E6-mediated p53 degradation does not affect the cell cycle-specific process of FancD2 modifications but abrogates repair by disrupting FancD2 de-ubiquitination. The study also found that E6 reduces the expression and foci formation of Palb2, a repair protein downstream of FancD2. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and the response to cisplatin therapies.
In the Southern Chiapas focus of onchocerciasis in Mexico, a major onchocerciasis focus in Latin America, semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin has been conducted since 1998 in all 559 endemic communities. In 2003, the treatment frequency was increased to four times a year in 50 communities, and in 2009, an additional 113 communities were added to the quarterly treatment regimen. An in-depth epidemiologic and entomologic assessment was conducted in six sentinel communities that had undergone two rounds of ivermectin treatment per year and three extra-sentinel communities that had undergone four rounds of ivermectin treatment per year. The results showed that none of the 67,924 Simulium ochraceum s.l. black flies collected during the dry season of 2011 contained Onchocerca volvulus parasite DNA, indicating an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of the infective rate in the vectors of 0.06/2,000 flies examined. Serological assays conducted on 4,230 children aged 5 and under revealed that only 2 individuals (0.05%) were exposed to O. volvulus. These findings meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community. The Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas aims to eliminate new ocular morbidity caused by O. volvulus infection and eventually eliminate transmission of the parasite in all 13 foci in Latin America.
Researchers have identified a small peptide pheromone, pPplA, secreted by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes that enhances its ability to escape from host cell vacuoles and replicate within the host cell cytosol. The pPplA pheromone is generated through the proteolytic processing of the PplA lipoprotein secretion signal peptide. Studies have shown that bacteria lacking the pPplA pheromone are significantly attenuated for virulence in mice and have a reduced efficiency of bacterial escape from the vacuoles of non-professional phagocytic cells. However, mutational activation of the PrfA transcriptional activator restores virulence and eliminates the need for pPplA-dependent signaling, suggesting a possible linkage between pPplA function and PrfA activation. The pPplA peptide pheromone is thought to signal to L. monocytogenes its presence within the host cell vacuole, stimulating the expression of gene products that contribute to vacuole escape and facilitating PrfA activation to promote bacterial growth within the cytosol. Experimental evidence suggests that the pPplA peptide is released by L. monocytogenes following its cleavage and processing from the secretion signal sequence of the PplA lipoprotein, and its production enhances L. monocytogenes escape from host cell vacuoles and is required for full bacterial virulence.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera, adapts to the hostile environment of the host's small intestine during infection. They used a technique called whole-genome transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes involved in the bacterium's resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced by the host as a defense mechanism. The study found that mutants of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, such as MutS, had a colonization advantage in mice with high levels of ROS, but not in mice treated with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). This suggests that the MMR system plays a role in the bacterium's ability to adapt to oxidative stress.

Further analysis revealed that the accumulation of catalase-overproducing mutants and rugose colony variants in NAC-treated mice was the leading cause of MutS mutant enrichment. Rugose variants can revert back to smooth colonies when grown in a laboratory setting. The study also found that the mutation rate of wild-type V. cholerae colonized in NAC-treated mice was significantly higher than in mice not treated with NAC. These findings suggest that V. cholerae employs a temporal adaptive strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in the enrichment of certain phenotypes. The study's results also provide a model for studying hypermutation in other pathogens and identifying novel stress resistance mechanisms.
Researchers investigated the role of the Mlh1-Mlh3 endonuclease in meiosis and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in baker's yeast. They analyzed 60 new mlh3 alleles and identified five that specifically disrupted MMR and one that specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. The Mlh1-mlh3-32 allele, which disrupted crossing over, displayed wild-type endonuclease activity in vitro, while the Mlh1-mlh3-45 allele, which disrupted MMR, did not. The Msh2-Msh3 complex stimulated the endonuclease activity of Mlh1-mlh3-32 but not Mlh1-mlh3-45, suggesting that Mlh1-mlh3-45 is defective in MSH interactions. Whole-genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type and mutant strains, revealing that all mlh3 mutants showed increased noncrossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative pathways. The study provides a structure-function map for Mlh3 and highlights the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3's enzymatic activity. The results also demonstrate how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights into the regulation of meiotic recombination pathways.
Researchers have found that the structure of the host population plays a significant role in the reversion of bacterial populations to drug sensitivity after treatment is discontinued. The study focused on diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, Staphylococcus aureus, and gonorrhea, where the use of antibiotics has led to increasing levels of drug resistance. The researchers discovered that the heterogeneity in the number of contacts within the host population affects the distribution of resistant and sensitive strains during treatment and after treatment is stopped. This, in turn, influences the competition dynamics between the two strains, leading to a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability of reversion to sensitivity at the population level.

The study used simulations to confirm that contact heterogeneity lowers the probability of reversion back to sensitivity, even when a substantial fraction of the pathogen population is sensitive at the time treatment is stopped. The researchers found that large fitness differences between sensitive and resistant strains result in a non-trivial distribution of sensitive and resistant infections over the network, which affects the reversion dynamics. The study suggests that the effects of contact heterogeneity are largest when the fitness costs of resistance are small, which is a biologically relevant parameter range for many pathogen-drug combinations. The study provides a framework for understanding the emergence of resistance during treatment and the subsequent competition dynamics between resistant and sensitive strains after treatment is discontinued.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable and characterized by social interaction and communication deficits, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. While several highly penetrant ASD gene variants have been identified, evidence suggests that combinatorial effects from multiple loci may also play a causal role. Researchers used Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) to study the interactions between genes affected by large de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals with autism. These CNVs were found in the genomes of individuals with autism, including a patient with a 22q11.2 deletion.

The study examined synaptic and circadian neurological phenotypes resulting from dosage variants of unique human-fly orthologues in Drosophila. The researchers observed numerous synergistic interactions between pairs of informatically-identified candidate genes whose orthologues were jointly affected by large de novo CNVs. Dosage alterations of the unique Drosophila orthologues of candidate genes from de novo CNVs that harbor only a single candidate gene displayed neurological defects similar to those previously reported in Drosophila models of ASD-associated variants.

The study found significant synergistic effects following the simultaneous dosage change of gene pairs drawn from a single CNV in three out of four CNVs with complete orthologous relationships. The phenotypic variation observed at the Drosophila synapse supported a concordant phenotypic outcome across all interacting gene pairs following the direction of human gene copy number change. The results suggest that synergistic effects resulting from large structural variation can contribute to human disease, and that different interactions affect divergent synaptic processes, demonstrating distinct molecular aetiologies.
Researchers investigated the role of CD8+ T cells in the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. They found that CD8+ T cells accumulate in the brains of mice infected with both ECM-inducing and non-inducing strains of the parasite, but exhibit arrested behavior in the perivascular spaces specifically during ECM-inducing infections. This behavior is characterized by the formation of long-term interactions with antigen-presenting cells within the brain. Despite these interactions, the depletion of antigen-presenting cells did not prevent the development of ECM. The researchers also observed that pathogenic CD8+ T cells colocalize with rare apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, within the brain during ECM. However, cellular apoptosis was a rare event and did not result in loss of cerebral vasculature. The study suggests that the arrest of T cells in the perivascular compartments of the brain is a unique signature of ECM-inducing malaria infection and implies an important role for this event in the development of the ECM-syndrome.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Vihiga County, Kenya to determine the burden of Tungiasis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans. The study involved 437 participants aged 5 years and above from 21 villages in three sub-locations. The overall prevalence of Tungiasis was found to be 21.5% (95% CI: 17.7-25.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the occurrence of Tungiasis was associated with low economic status, as indicated by a monthly income of Ksh ≤ 1000 (adjusted odds ratio 27.85; 95% CI: 4.13-187.59), lack of toilet facilities (4.27; 0.82-22.34), age of participant ≤14 (27.41; 10.02-74.99), no regular use of closed footwear (1.98; 0.987-3.97), and common resting place inside the house (1.93; 0.96-3.89). The study used Geographic Information System (GIS) to map the geographic distribution of Tungiasis in the area, showing that Chambiti and Selelwe villages had the highest concentration of cases. The findings suggest that Tungiasis is an important health problem in Vihiga County, largely due to the low economic status of the affected population. The study highlights the need for cost-effective and accessible control strategies to address the disease.
A computational model of auxin transport in the Arabidopsis root tip has been developed to understand the dynamics of the regulatory network between auxin and cytokinin. The model considers hormonal regulation of auxin transporters within a spatial context, taking into account cell shape, polarity, and cell walls. Analysis of the model reveals that an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels is theoretically unlikely and not required for correct and robust auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response allow for the necessary feedbacks, which can amplify and stabilize the auxin maximum. The model demonstrates the importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for pattern robustness and predicts a role of AUX1 and LAX1/2 auxin influx transporters in vascular patterning. The model also shows that polar localization of PIN1 generates an auxin flux circuit that stabilizes the accumulation of auxin within the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for auxin to accumulate specifically in the xylem-pole pericycle cells, an important early step in lateral root initiation. Furthermore, the model reveals that pericycle cells on opposite xylem poles compete for auxin accumulation, consistent with the observation that lateral roots are not initiated opposite to each other. The model provides insights into the dynamics of transverse auxin transport and will play an important role in future attempts to construct three-dimensional models of auxin transport and root growth in Arabidopsis.
A recent study has identified a key mediator of environment-induced behavioral plasticity in migratory locusts. The study found that the transcription factor CREB-B plays a crucial role in the neuropeptide F (NPF)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, which regulates phase-related locomotor plasticity. Specifically, CREB-B directly activates brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression by interacting with the NOS promoter region. The phosphorylation of CREB-B at serine 110 site changes dynamically in response to population density variation and is negatively controlled by NPF2. The study also found that protein kinase A (PKA) mediates the regulatory effects of NPF2 on CREB-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription. RNAi experiments and behavioral assays validated the involvement of CREB-B in NPF2-regulated locomotor plasticity. The study reveals a precise signal cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity in migratory locusts. The findings suggest that the NPY/PKA/CREB-B signaling cascade may represent a common mechanism underlying behavioral plasticity in animals. The study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of NOS transcription in insects and sheds light on how neuromodulator/TF/effect gene networks contribute to environment-induced behavioral plasticity.
Researchers investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. They used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map regions bound by ZLD before, during, and after the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), a period when the zygotic genome is activated. The study found that ZLD binds to thousands of regions in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. Early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage, but surprisingly, ZLD also binds to the promoters of genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is strong, suggesting that ZLD plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT. The study also found that ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. These findings suggest that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a central role in regulating genome activity at the MZT. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ZLD activation and its role in early embryonic development.
Researchers have identified 109 new protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among circadian clock proteins, which play a crucial role in regulating various biological processes. These interactions are essential for the proper functioning of the circadian clock, a fundamental cellular timing mechanism that governs physiological processes over a 24-hour period. Using a yeast-two-hybrid approach, the researchers found that the interaction between protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL1 resulted in the destabilization of BMAL1. A dynamic circadian PPI network was constructed using circadian expression data, which predicted the timing of PPIs. Systematic analysis of the network revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, suggesting that regulatory interactions are restricted to specific phases. The researchers also found that circadian PPIs dynamically connect various cellular processes, such as signal transduction and cell cycle regulation, contributing to the temporal organization of cellular physiology. The study provides a systems-wide view of circadian PPI dynamics, which is essential for understanding the regulation of circadian rhythms. The findings highlight the importance of precisely timed PPIs for the proper functioning of the circadian clock and suggest that time-of-day dependent PPIs play a crucial role in regulating circadian output processes.
Researchers have determined the solution structure of ABA-1A, a repeating unit of the nematode polyprotein allergen (NPA) of Ascaris suum, using protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The structure reveals a novel seven-helical fold, consisting of a central helix surrounded by two hollow four-helical bundles on either side. Two discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets are found in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, which are capable of binding fatty acids and other hydrophobic compounds. One of the binding sites is occupied by a tightly-bound ligand of bacterial origin in recombinant ABA-1A. This is the first time a mature, post-translationally processed unit of a naturally-occurring tandemly-repetitive polyprotein has been structurally characterized. The structure of ABA-1A belongs to a new structural class and has no counterparts in vertebrates, making it a potential target for drug or immunological intervention. NPAs are unique to nematodes and play a crucial role in the transport and distribution of small hydrophobic compounds between tissues, as well as in nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation, and IgE antibody-based responses in infection. The structure of ABA-1A may contribute to the understanding of the immunodominance and allergenic properties of NPAs, which are associated with naturally-acquired resistance to infection in humans.
Between 1998 and 2008, there were 39,677 reported cases of ciguatera fish poisoning in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), with a mean annual incidence of 194 cases per 100,000 people. This represents a 60% increase from the reported annual incidence of 104 cases per 100,000 people between 1973 and 1983. Taking into account under-reporting, an estimated 500,000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from ciguatera over the last 35 years. Ciguatera is a type of fish poisoning caused by consuming coral reef fish contaminated with ciguatoxin, which can lead to acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, as well as chronic neurologic symptoms lasting weeks to months. The disease is often under-diagnosed and under-reported, with only 2-10% of cases reported to health authorities. Ciguatera is a significant public health problem, particularly in vulnerable island communities, and its incidence is expected to increase due to environmental changes such as global warming, eutrophication, and coastal development. The study highlights the need for well-funded multidisciplinary research teams to address this issue and translate research advances into practical management solutions.
A study investigated the impact of benznidazole treatment on the functional response of Trypanosoma cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells in chronic Chagas disease patients. Thirty-eight patients with chronic Chagas disease (20 asymptomatic and 18 symptomatic) and 12 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble T. cruzi antigens to analyze cytokine and cytotoxic molecule production by CD4+CD8+ T cells before and after benznidazole treatment. The results showed that the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells was higher in chronic Chagas disease patients compared to healthy donors. Benznidazole treatment reduced the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells and decreased the ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations. Additionally, the co-expression level of inhibitory receptors was reduced after treatment, while the multifunctional capacity of CD4+CD8+ T cells was enhanced. The treatment also increased the frequency of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF-α. These findings suggest that CD4+CD8+ T cells play an important role in controlling T. cruzi infection and that benznidazole treatment partially reverses the exhaustion process caused by the infection, improving the functional response of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells. The study provides new insights into the immune response against T. cruzi infection and the efficacy of benznidazole treatment in patients with chronic Chagas disease.
Researchers have identified Arabidopsis thaliana phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C2 (AtPLC2) as the primary enzyme responsible for phosphoinositide metabolism in plants. Phosphoinositides play a crucial role in plant development and stress response. To understand the function of AtPLC2, the researchers isolated and analyzed knockout mutants of multiple AtPLC isoforms in Arabidopsis. Lipidomic profiling of phosphoinositides in the mutants revealed that AtPLC2 is the primary phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C in phosphoinositide metabolism.

The study found that AtPLC2 is highly expressed in specific tissues, including trichomes, young floral buds, and vascular tissues, and is localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types. A knockout mutant of AtPLC2 (plc2-1) showed impaired seedling growth and increased levels of its substrates, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The plc2-1 mutant also showed hypersensitivity to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, suggesting a link between phosphoinositide signaling and ER stress response.

The researchers concluded that AtPLC2 is essential for seedling growth and ER stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. The study highlights the importance of phosphoinositides in plant development and stress response and provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of phosphoinositide signaling in plants. The findings also suggest that plants may possess a distinct regulatory mechanism to transduce phosphoinositide signals under ER stress.
The article challenges the reductionist assumption that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. A principled measure of intrinsic cause-effect power, integrated information (Φ), is employed to evaluate the causal power of systems across different spatial and temporal scales. By considering all possible black boxes, which are macro elements consisting of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates, it is shown that a macro level can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements. This reveals the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a result, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which stable local maxima of Φ are identified during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, providing a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries. The results refute the reductionist assumption that causal power resides exclusively at the micro level and demonstrate the emergence of new cause-effect properties at the macro level.
Researchers have investigated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) using a rule-based model that accounts for electron transport, proton translocation, and transmembrane electrochemical potential generation. The model was fitted to experimental data from rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate, and it accurately predicted the dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse electron transport from succinate through complex I. The analysis revealed an association between ROS production and the levels of specific radicals of individual electron transporters and their combinations in complexes I and III. It was found that the phenomenon of bistability, previously observed in complex III, remains valid for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted and confirmed experimentally. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ROS production in the RC. The model describes various states of respiratory complexes formed during electron transport, including those containing free radicals that can pass unpaired electrons to oxygen, forming superoxide radicals and other forms of ROS. The contributions of various radicals to ROS production were clarified by comparing measured ROS production and the levels of free radicals predicted by the model for the same conditions.
Researchers have investigated the effects of mutations in motor proteins on intracellular transport in eukaryotic cells. Motor proteins convert chemical energy into kinetic energy to transport cargo over long distances. Disruptions in transport mechanisms, often caused by mutations, can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease. A recent study found that phosphorylation of the kinesin motor domain at a specific serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, resulting in lowered single motor stalling forces.

A semi-analytical approach was developed to analyze the transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. The study found that mutants with altered stall forces can determine the average velocity and run-length even when outnumbered by wild-type motors in the ensemble. Additionally, mutants gain a competitive advantage and increase the expected run-length when the load on the cargo is near the mutant's stalling force or a multiple of its stalling force.

The researchers also developed a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types. This technique determines transition rates between various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo, enabling the computation of biologically relevant quantities such as average velocity and run-length without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations. The method can be used to introduce alterations of single motor parameters to model a mutation and deduce effects on the transport of a common cargo by multiple motors.
Researchers investigated the role of the CACNA1C gene in learning by selectively ablating the gene in mice and analyzing their behavior on an operant cue discrimination task. The CACNA1C gene codes for the α subunit of the Cav1.2 L-type calcium channel, which is essential for synaptic plasticity and learning. Previous studies have linked altered expression of Cav1.2 channels and the CACNA1C gene to severe learning deficits and psychiatric disorders. In this study, mice with a selective knockout of the CACNA1C gene were compared to matched controls on a 2-choice operant cue discrimination task. The task consisted of three phases and required the mice to perform a nose poke response based on the position of a light square on a touchscreen screen. The results showed that the CACNA1C knockout mice did not exhibit impaired learning in general, but rather adapted an outcome-based strategy to increase reward feedback across trials. In contrast, the majority of control mice adopted the experimentally intended cue-association rule. The findings suggest that the CACNA1C gene plays a specific role in learning and highlight the importance of examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential behavioral strategies. The results may also have implications for treating psychiatric disorders associated with the CACNA1C gene.
Researchers investigated the impact of cyclical heat stress on Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are being released to suppress arbovirus transmission worldwide. The study found that three types of Wolbachia infections (wMel, wAlbB, and wMelPop-CLA) responded differently to diurnal temperatures ranging from 26-37°C. The wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections showed reduced expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation induced by Wolbachia, and a sharp decrease in Wolbachia density in adults. Furthermore, these infections were not transmitted to the next generation when mosquitoes were exposed to 26-37°C across all life stages. In contrast, the wAlbB infection was maintained at a high density, exhibited complete cytoplasmic incompatibility, and was transmitted from mother to offspring with high fidelity under the same temperature conditions. These findings have significant implications for the potential success of Wolbachia interventions across different environments and highlight the importance of temperature control in rearing. The results suggest that wMel and wMelPop-CLA-infected mosquitoes may not be as effective in suppressing arbovirus transmission in areas with high temperatures, whereas wAlbB-infected mosquitoes may be more suitable for such environments.
Researchers studied adenoviruses in non-human primates, including great apes and macaques, to better understand the natural history of adenovirus infections. They found that these animals shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in their stool, even when they appeared to be healthy. This was a surprising discovery, as it suggests that adenoviruses can establish chronic infections that may not be clinically relevant. The researchers isolated and sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 from macaques, and found that they could be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B, C, and E. They also found evidence of intraspecies recombination between adenoviruses and cross-species transmission events. The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence of zoonotic transmissions warrants caution for primate handling and housing. The presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut should also be considered in the design and interpretation of human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors. The study's findings have implications for the use of adenoviruses as vectors for gene therapies and genetic vaccines, and highlight the need for further research into the natural history of adenovirus infections.
Researchers have used molecular dynamics simulation to study the process of unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural units of chromatin, where DNA wraps around a core of histone proteins. To function in cellular processes, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, but the details of this process at an atomic level were not well understood. The study used an enhanced sampling method to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. The results showed that the free energy change for unwrapping is about 11.5 kcal/mol, which agrees with values obtained in single-molecule experiments. The simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating multiple potential paths to outer superhelical turn unwrapping, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. The study found that the unwrapping process starts at one end of the DNA, where the first five base pairs unwrap, followed by a second five base pairs unwrapping at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then proceeds at the other end of the DNA, where 10 base pairs are unwrapped. The results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which a protein called Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) protects cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can damage cell membranes, particularly those of lysosomes, which are essential for maintaining cellular function. ApoD, an extracellular lipid-binding protein with antioxidant properties, is secreted by astrocytes, a type of cell in the nervous system, to help neurons cope with oxidative stress. Previous studies have shown that ApoD has a protective role, but the underlying mechanism was unknown.

     The study found that ApoD is endocytosed and targeted to a subset of vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. ApoD is functionally stable in the acidic environment of the lysosome and helps maintain lysosomal pH gradients by preventing membrane permeabilization. This process is essential for the recovery of lysosomes from oxidation-induced alkalinization in both astrocytes and neurons.

     The researchers also discovered that ApoD is required for two lysosome-dependent biological processes: myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and the optimization of neurodegeneration-triggered autophagy in a Drosophila in vivo model. The study reveals a previously unknown function of ApoD and sets a lipoprotein-mediated regulation of lysosomal membrane integrity as a new mechanism critical for the outcome of various neurodegenerative diseases. The findings open up therapeutic opportunities by providing a route of entry and a repair mechanism for lysosomes in pathological situations.
Researchers studied the biology and susceptibility to Leishmania donovani of Phlebotomus orientalis sand flies from two geographically distant localities in Ethiopia: Melka Werer, a non-endemic site in the lowlands, and Addis Zemen, an endemic focus of human visceral leishmaniasis in the highlands. The study aimed to determine if genetic differences between the two colonies could explain the absence of visceral leishmaniasis in Melka Werer. However, genetic analyses using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI mitochondrial genes did not reveal any genetic differences between the two colonies.

The researchers found marked differences in life-cycle parameters between the two colonies, including distinct requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. F1 hybrids developed successfully with higher fecundity than the parental colonies. Experimental infections with L. donovani showed that even the lowest infective dose tested (2×10^3 per ml) was sufficient for successful establishment of L. donovani infections in about 50% of the P. orientalis females. Using higher infective doses, the infection rates were around 90% for both colonies. The development of L. donovani in P. orientalis was fast, with the presence of metacyclic promastigotes in the thoracic midgut and the colonization of the stomodeal valve by haptomonads recorded in most P. orientalis females by day five post-blood feeding. Both colonies were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donovani strains, with an infective dose of one or two L. donovani promastigotes per sand fly blood-meal.
Researchers conducted a study to quantify the quality of life and disability of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica in a hyperendemic county in China. The study aimed to provide updated data for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and inform evidence-based decision-making in China's national schistosomiasis control program. A patient-based quality-of-life evaluation was performed using a short questionnaire, physical examination, ultrasonography, and laboratory testing on 215 confirmed cases of advanced schistosomiasis japonica. The European quality of life questionnaire with an additional cognitive dimension (EQ-5D plus) was used to assess disability and morbidity.

The study found that most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, including pain or discomfort, usual activities, and anxiety or depression. The overall disability weight (DW) for advanced schistosomiasis japonica was estimated to be 0.447, with age-specific DWs ranging from 0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged 60 years or older. The DW was positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were found to be protective factors for quality of life. The study's findings suggest that advanced schistosomiasis japonica has a significant impact on patients' quality of life and disability, highlighting the need for updated data in the GBD study and evidence-based decision-making in China's national schistosomiasis control program.
A study in Kenya examined the relationship between tsetse fly habitats and population vulnerability to Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, and African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT), also known as nagana. The study used national census data from 1999 to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's 7 tsetse belts, where tsetse flies are capable vectors for T. b. rhodesiense and other trypanosoma agents that cause AAT. The researchers used a multilevel study design to estimate the likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, nested within tsetse fly habitats of varying levels of poverty.

The study found that tsetse fly habitats were significantly associated with increased disability prevalence, particularly in areas with high levels of poverty. The researchers identified two exposure pathways through which tsetse flies impact disability: directly, through the bite of a pathogenic tsetse fly resulting in HAT infection, and indirectly, as the potential for AAT takes land out of agricultural production and diseased livestock leads to livestock morbidity and mortality, contributing to nutritional deficiencies and poverty.

The study suggests that incorporating reports on disability from national census data is a promising surveillance tool that may enhance future HAT surveillance programs in sub-Saharan Africa. The combined burdens of HAT and AAT, as well as the opportunity costs of agricultural production in AAT areas, are likely contributors to disability within tsetse-infested areas. Future research will assess changes in the spatial relationships between high tsetse infestation and human disability following the release of the Kenya 2009 census at the local level.
Researchers investigated the mechanism by which hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) induces cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells. They found that HMBA activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of HEXIM1 and the release of active positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) from its inactive complex with HEXIM1 and 7SK small nuclear RNA (snRNA). The released P-TEFb is then recruited to the HIV promoter, stimulating transcription elongation and viral production. However, the released P-TEFb rapidly reassembles with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1 in the presence of HMBA. The researchers also found that a mutant HEXIM1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released from P-TEFb and 7SK snRNA via the PI3K/Akt pathway antagonizes HMBA-mediated induction of viral production. This suggests that modifications in the equilibrium between active and inactive P-TEFb could contribute to cell differentiation. The study provides a mechanism by which HMBA targets the pivotal cellular co-factor P-TEFb for the reactivation of HIV. The findings indicate that HMBA disrupts the complex between P-TEFb, HEXIM1, and 7SK snRNA in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner, leading to the recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV promoter and successful transcription elongation.
Researchers have identified a link between the Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) and the development of severe forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), including mucosal (ML) and disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). These forms of the disease are characterized by the spread of the parasite from the initial skin lesion to other parts of the body, leading to significant morbidity. Studies have shown that LRV is responsible for elevated parasitaemia, destructive hyper-inflammation, and an overall exacerbation of the disease.

To detect LRV in Leishmania parasites, researchers have developed an anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody (J2) that can specifically and quantitatively recognize double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in a sequence-independent manner. This antibody can be used in various techniques, including immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot, as well as nucleic acid purification and quantitative real-time PCR. These methods have been evaluated and demonstrated to be effective in detecting LRV in several parasite strains, a freshly isolated patient sample, and lesion biopsies of infected mice.

The researchers propose that these methods could be refined and transferred to the field for use as a diagnostic tool to detect the presence of LRV and assess the LRV-related risk of complications in cutaneous leishmaniasis. This could potentially help predict which patients are at risk of developing severe forms of the disease and inform treatment decisions.
Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are closely-related pathogens that attach to intestinal epithelial cells, efface microvilli, and promote cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. To trigger pedestal formation, EPEC employs the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHEC relies on the multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU. Research has shown that the ability to generate these structures correlates with bacterial colonization in animal models, but the precise function of pedestals in infection remained unclear. A study investigated the colonization properties of EPEC and EHEC during infection of polarized epithelial cells and found that both pathogens formed distinct bacterial communities, or "macrocolonies," that encompassed multiple host cells. The study revealed that Tir and EspFU, as well as the host Arp2/3 complex, were critical for the expansion of macrocolonies over time. Notably, EspFU accelerated the formation of larger macrocolonies compared to EPEC Tir, as EspFU-mediated actin assembly drove faster bacterial motility to cell junctions, where bacteria formed a secondary pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one of the daughters to disengage and infect the second cell. These findings suggest that EspFU enhances epithelial colonization by increasing actin-based motility and promoting an efficient method of cell-to-cell transmission.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of two methods for purifying extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the parasitic worm Fasciola hepatica. The two methods, differential centrifugation (DC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC), are commonly used to isolate EVs from other pathogens. The study found that SEC-purified EVs were smaller and less diverse in size compared to DC-purified EVs. Additionally, SEC-purified EVs had a higher purity to protein yield ratio, with reduced contamination from free excretory-secretory proteins (ESP) and tegumental components.

Proteomic analysis revealed that DC-purified EVs contained a higher number of protein identifications, many of which were previously identified in ESP and tegument proteomic studies. In contrast, SEC-purified EVs had a less diverse proteome and different gene enrichment profiles. The study suggests that DC and SEC purification methods do not isolate equivalent EV population profiles, and caution should be taken when choosing a purification method for downstream studies.

The researchers propose that SEC methods should be used for EV purification prior to downstream studies, as they result in a higher EV purity to protein yield ratio and reduced contamination from ESP and tegumental components. This is particularly important for studying the role of EVs in host-pathogen communication, as recent discoveries have shown that EVs can promote or inhibit host immunity. The study highlights the need for reliable protocols for EV isolation, away from ESP, to ensure accurate results in downstream studies and application development.
Researchers used a reverse-engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation in the development of Drosophila melanogaster, specifically focusing on the gap genes Krüppel, knirps, and giant. This method involves fitting models to data to infer and analyze regulatory mechanisms. The study used detailed, quantitative datasets of mRNA and protein expression to solve and fit a model of post-transcriptional regulation, establishing its structural and practical identifiability. The results showed that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for patterning in this system, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. The study demonstrated that the uniqueness and specificity of a fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal pattern formation, increasing the potential of reverse engineering for the study of development and other complex biological processes. The researchers applied this methodology to a complex regulatory problem, the dynamics of spatio-temporal pattern formation in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster, to test the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in animal development. A high-resolution quantitative dataset of mRNA expression patterns for the gap genes Kr, kni, and gt was created, covering the entire blastoderm stage.
Researchers investigated the age-dependent mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial innate immune response to rotavirus infection in an oral mouse model. They found that the expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), a receptor for viral double-stranded RNA, was low in the epithelium of suckling mice but strongly increased during the postnatal period. This increase in TLR3 expression inversely correlated with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in TLR3 or the adaptor molecule Trif exhibited higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial expression of pro-inflammatory and antiviral genes compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in TLR3 or Trif did not display impaired cell stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. The study also found that the non-hematopoietic cell compartment contributed to the Trif-mediated antiviral host response in adult animals. Furthermore, a significant age-dependent increase in TLR3 expression was detected in human small intestinal biopsies. The results suggest that the upregulation of epithelial TLR3 expression during infancy may contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. The study highlights the importance of TLR3 and Trif-mediated innate immune signaling in protecting adult mice from symptomatic rotavirus infection.
Researchers analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 1,039 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 870 controls to identify rare genetic variations associated with the condition. The data was collected from two centers using different methods for sequencing and variant calling. To ensure consistency, the researchers filtered the variants based on missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative to reference reads. They evaluated the results using seven samples sequenced at both centers and found that the distribution of rare variation was similar between the two centers.

The researchers then considered how to combine the data from the two centers, deciding between meta-analysis (combining statistics across centers) and mega-analysis (combining data and then analyzing it). They found that mega-analysis had better power than meta-analysis for gene-based tests. Before analyzing the data for association, they explored the impact of population structure on rare variant analysis and found that principal component-based analyses were sufficient to control for ancestry and produce test statistics with appropriate distributions.

Using various gene-based tests and both meta- and mega-analysis, the researchers found no new risk genes for ASD in this sample. Their results suggest that standard gene-based tests require much larger samples of cases and controls to be effective for gene discovery, even for a disorder like ASD. The study highlights the challenges of identifying rare genetic variants associated with complex traits like ASD and the need for larger sample sizes to achieve genome-wide significance.
A study investigated the association between genetic polymorphisms in the chitotriosidase and AMCase genes and the risk of mycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis in a Sudanese population. Madurella mycetomatis is the most prevalent causative agent of eumycetoma in Sudan, an infection characterized by the formation of grains. The study found that a polymorphism in the chitotriosidase gene, which results in impaired chitinase activity, was associated with an increased risk of mycetoma. This polymorphism was found in 112 eumycetoma patients and 103 matched controls. The study used PCR-RFLP to determine the genotypes of the participants and histological staining to confirm the presence of chitin in the fungal grain. The results showed that individuals with the impaired chitotriosidase activity had a 2.9 times higher odds of developing mycetoma compared to those with normal chitotriosidase activity. No association was found between the polymorphisms in the AMCase gene and the risk of mycetoma. The study suggests that impaired chitotriosidase activity may play a role in the development of mycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency, a state where the virus remains dormant in the body without causing symptoms. Traditionally, HSV latency was thought to be characterized by two distinct phases: an acute or lytic phase, where the virus replicates and causes symptoms, and a latent phase, where the virus remains dormant. However, recent studies have suggested that the lytic phase may not be as clear-cut as previously thought.

Using a highly sensitive Cre-marking model, the study found that around half of the HSV spread leading to latently infected sites occurred beyond the initial acute infection. Furthermore, the study provides direct evidence that lytic promoters, which drive the expression of viral genes, can be active during latency. This challenges the traditional view of latency as a state of complete viral dormancy.

The study also found that lytic promoters can drive the expression of proteins during latency, including those associated with immune recognition. This suggests that the immune system may be able to detect and respond to the virus during latency, potentially halting reactivation. The study's findings are consistent with the idea that limited stochastic lytic gene expression may be an integral part of latency, or that the early presentation of viral proteins to the immune system may provide an opportunity for reactivation to be halted.
Researchers studied the accumulation of a misfolded protein called PrPSc in the brains of mice infected with three different strains of scrapie, a type of prion disease. They used a technique called dual-staining immunohistochemistry to compare the pattern of PrPSc accumulation in neurons and glial cells, such as astroglia and microglia, at early stages of the disease. The results showed that each strain had a distinct pattern of PrPSc accumulation, with strain 22L mainly associated with astroglia, strain ME7 mainly associated with neurons and neuropil, and strain RML showing a mix of both patterns depending on the brain region.

The researchers also analyzed the expression of 90 genes involved in neuroinflammation in the thalamus at early stages of the disease. Surprisingly, despite the differences in PrPSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains, and the small differences observed correlated with variations in the early disease tempo. The upregulation of these genes was associated with the activation of both astroglia and microglia before the onset of vacuolar pathology or clinical signs. This is in contrast to two acute viral CNS diseases, LaCrosse virus and BE polytropic Friend retrovirus, which showed a different profile of upregulated genes despite similar levels of reactive gliosis. These findings suggest that the neuroinflammatory response in prion diseases may be more complex and nuanced than previously thought.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study the 3D organization of chromosomes, which is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long, densely packed polymers that are topologically constrained, making it challenging to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate their behavior. To address this challenge, the researchers proposed a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Their approach accurately accounts for the polymer entanglement length and volumic density, allowing for a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and enabling the study of long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics.

The researchers used their formalism to investigate the time evolution of chromosome 3R (20 Mbp) in drosophila during one cell cycle (20 hours). They showed that a combination of their coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduces experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predicts that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle. The study demonstrates the utility of their coarse-graining approach to study chromatin organization in drosophila and highlights the necessity to adequately account for the time evolution of chromosome organization in quantitative models of chromosomes, especially for higher eucaryotes where chromosomes are strongly topologically constrained. The approach is generic and can be applied to any self-avoiding polymers and off-lattice systems.
Researchers conducted an integrative analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to understand the mechanisms underlying cell type specificity of eQTLs. They analyzed eQTL data from 11 studies on 7 cell types and integrated it with CRE data from the ENCODE project. The study found that eQTL SNPs that overlap with cell type-specific CREs, such as enhancers, promoters, and repressive chromatin marks, are associated with cell type-specific eQTLs. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. The researchers developed a random forest classifier that uses cell-specific CRE-SNP overlap as features to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. They demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and showed that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. The study suggests that integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our understanding of the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation. The findings have implications for the interpretation of GWAS results and the development of mechanistic models of disease.
Researchers have developed a new cell line for producing HIV-1 vaccine immunogens with specific glycosylation patterns. The cell line, created using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, limits glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This is achieved by inactivating the MGAT1 gene, which is responsible for adding sialic acid to glycans. The resulting immunogens exhibit improved binding to broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bN-mAbs) that recognize glycan-dependent epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120. The new cell line, called MGAT1− CHO, preserves the structure of glycan-independent epitopes, such as those recognized by the VRC01 antibody. The MGAT1− CHO cell line grows well and can be used for large-scale production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens. This is a significant advancement in HIV vaccine research, as previous vaccines have struggled to elicit bN-mAbs that recognize glycan-dependent epitopes. The development of the MGAT1− CHO cell line addresses a major challenge in HIV vaccine production, which is the incorporation of complex and hybrid glycosylation patterns in standard Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. The new cell line is expected to be useful for producing HIV-1 vaccine immunogens that can elicit bN-mAbs and provide protection against HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have identified trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP) from the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi as a promising target for developing anthelmintic drugs. T6PP is essential for the survival of nematodes, including those that cause lymphatic filariasis, a major cause of long-term disability in tropical regions. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, T6PP is necessary for survival due to the toxic effects of trehalose 6-phosphate accumulation. The researchers determined the X-ray crystal structure of T6PP from B. malayi, revealing a stabilizing N-terminal domain and a catalytic C-terminal domain. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses identified five key residues important for binding and catalysis. A model of the T6PP-trehalose 6-phosphate complex suggests a substrate-binding mode driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions. In contrast to other carbohydrate-binding proteins, the trehalose binding site in T6PP is not dominated by hydrophobic residues. The conservation of key binding site residues among T6PP enzymes from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria suggests that a common strategy for inhibitor design could be used to develop both anthelmintics and antibiotics. The structure of T6PP from B. malayi provides a platform for designing high-affinity inhibitors that take advantage of substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl-binding pocket and non-native binding to the trehalose pocket.
Researchers have developed a novel computational framework to simulate the transport of fluid through whole, heterogeneous tumours in silico. This framework incorporates realistic tumour vasculature and spatially heterogeneous parameters, such as blood vessel lumen and interstitial permeabilities, to accurately predict tumour fluid dynamics. The model couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, allowing for the simulation of blood flow through the tumour vasculature and interstitial fluid flow throughout the cancerous tissue.

The framework was applied to an orthotopic murine glioma and a human colorectal carcinoma, and sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the key biological mechanisms that determine tumour fluid transport. The results showed that incorporating realistic tumour vasculature is crucial for accurately predicting spatial flow heterogeneities induced by blood vessels. Contrary to previous literature, the study found that reducing tumour interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) is not necessary to increase tumour interstitial perfusion, and that developing an IFP gradient across the tumour is the key response. Additionally, the study hypothesised that vascular normalization alters interstitial hydraulic conductivity within tumours, suggesting that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumours. The framework enables highly-controlled experiments to be performed, providing insight into how tumour vascular heterogeneity contributes to tumour fluid transport.
Researchers have investigated how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads from cell to cell, a process known as cell-cell transmission, and how it is affected by neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors. Neutralizing antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to the virus, preventing it from entering host cells, while entry inhibitors block the virus's ability to fuse with host cells. The study found that the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors varies depending on their mode of action. Specifically, antibodies that target the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of the virus, such as the potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody VRC01, lose potency during cell-cell transmission. In contrast, antibodies that target the gp41 protein, which is involved in the fusion of the virus with host cells, remain active. This suggests that CD4bs antibodies are more effective at blocking free virus transmission, while allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts. The study's findings have implications for the design of HIV vaccines and entry inhibitors, as they indicate that both cell-free and cell-cell spread of HIV may need to be blocked with equal efficacy. The results also provide a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and rapidly escapes potent and broadly active CD4bs-directed antibody responses in the body.
A new model of attention has been proposed to explain the diverse effects of attention on neural firing rates and receptive field structure in the visual system. This model suggests that attentional modulation targets higher levels of the visual system, such as areas V4 and MT, rather than input areas like V1. The proposed mechanism involves modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. Feedback connections redistribute the top-down modulation to lower areas, altering the inputs of other higher-area cells, including those that did not receive the initial modulation. This produces changes in firing rates and receptive field structure, including receptive field expansion towards the focus of attention.

The model reproduces the observed attentional effects on response rates and receptive field structure without modifying model parameters. It also makes a novel prediction that attentional effects on response curves should shift from response gain to contrast gain as the spatial focus of attention drifts away from the studied cell. The model suggests that the observed effects of attention arise spontaneously from the interaction of feedback connections between higher and lower areas with short-range divisive mutual inhibition between neighboring cells within each area. The source of attentional modulation in the model is a plain response modulation of the "top" layer, which models the intermediate layers of the visual cortex. This is in contrast to most existing models of attentional effects, which posit that attention operates through gain modulation of inputs to the studied layer.
In Drosophila, the posterior signalling centre (PSC) plays a crucial role in controlling hemocyte homeostasis in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. The PSC acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling in hematopoietic progenitors, preserving their multipotent character necessary for differentiation into lamellocytes, a specific immune cell type required to fight wasp parasitism. A short type I cytokine-related receptor, CG14225/Latran, has been identified as essential for switching off JAK/STAT signalling in prohemocytes, allowing for massive differentiation of lamellocytes upon wasp parasitization. Latran forms heteromers with Domeless, the Drosophila type I cytokine signalling receptor, and antagonizes Domeless activity in a dose-dependent manner. In response to wasp parasitism, there is a strong decrease in cytokine mRNA levels in the lymph gland, followed by an increase in the Latran/Domeless ratio, leading to the complete inhibition of residual JAK/STAT signalling. This regulatory mechanism is crucial for Drosophila to mount a dedicated cellular immune defense. The specific function of Drosophila Latran is the first in vivo example of a role for a non-signalling receptor in controlling a dedicated immune response, raising the question of whether short, non-signalling receptors also control specific aspects of vertebrate cellular immunity.
Researchers studied the recombination patterns of two begomoviruses, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus (ToLCV), during a 120-day experimental infection of tomato plants. They found that the recombination patterns were complex and influenced by factors such as local degrees of sequence similarity between the viruses, but not by genomic secondary structure. The study also showed that natural selection played a significant role in shaping the overall patterns of recombination, favoring the preservation of co-evolved protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.

The researchers observed a wide range of recombinant genomes, with some containing up to 58 detectable recombination breakpoints, which is more complex than previously reported in similar studies. They also found that the viability of recombinant genomes was influenced by the disruption of intra-genomic interactions, such as those required for proper protein and nucleic acid folding. The study suggests that selection against recombinants with disrupted interactions was strong enough to leave an imprint on the sequence tracts involved in these interactions.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of recombination in begomoviruses and highlight the importance of natural selection in shaping the evolution of these viruses. The study's results also have implications for understanding the emergence of begomoviral crop pathogens, which have been attributed to natural inter-species recombination.
Researchers investigated the relationship between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution in eukaryotes and archaea. Nucleosomes, the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin, have been suggested to influence the evolution of eukaryotic genomes by altering the propensity of DNA to mutate and by selection acting to maintain or exclude nucleosomes in particular locations. The study found that despite fundamental differences between eukaryotic and archaeal nucleosomes, the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution is conserved between humans and the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The researchers examined whether selection or mutation could explain the concordant substitution patterns in the two kingdoms, but found that neither model was sufficient to explain the observed association. Instead, they demonstrated that nucleosome-associated substitution patterns are more consistent with a model where sequence divergence results in frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. The study showed that nucleosome repositioning is both necessary and largely sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased substitution patterns. This finding highlights the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change.
Researchers have identified key positions in proteins that are crucial for maintaining conformational diversity, which is essential for protein function. Conformational diversity refers to the ability of a protein to exist in multiple shapes or conformations, allowing it to bind to different ligands and perform various functions. The study used a novel method to analyze 188 paired protein structures in their ligand-free and ligand-bound forms. By applying normal mode analysis, the researchers selected key positions that are most involved in the conformational change when a ligand binds to the protein. These positions were found to be evolutionary conserved, meaning they are preserved across different species, and are mostly buried aliphatic residues located in regular structural regions of the protein, such as beta-sheets and alpha-helices.

The researchers found a negative correlation between the effects of mutations on the normal mode subspaces associated with ligand-binding and position-specific evolutionary conservations. This suggests that mutations at these key positions can significantly alter the protein's ability to bind to ligands. The study's findings provide new insights into the importance of conformational diversity in protein function and identify key positions that are essential for maintaining this diversity. The results have implications for understanding how proteins adapt to different ligands and how mutations can affect protein function. Overall, the study highlights the importance of conformational diversity in protein function and identifies key positions that are crucial for maintaining this diversity.
Researchers have investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium responsible for tuberculosis. FBA is a key enzyme in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, and its inactivation has been explored as a potential target for new chemotherapies. An Mtb strain with regulated FBA levels was engineered, and the results showed that depleting FBA led to the clearance of Mtb in both acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo, as well as loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, when cultured on mixtures of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources, the essentiality of FBA could be overcome. In vitro studies revealed that the lack of FBA could only be compensated for by a specific balance of glucose and butyrate, where growth and metabolism of butyrate depended on Mtb's ability to co-catabolize glucose. These findings suggest that FBA is a potential drug target for both replicating and persistent Mtb, and provide new insights into the multiplicity of in vitro conditions that define the essentiality of Mtb's FBA in vivo. The research also highlights the importance of understanding Mtb's metabolism in the development of new chemotherapies, as Mtb mutants lacking metabolic enzymes are among the most attenuated in the mouse model of tuberculosis.
A study investigated the role of the mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (mTXNPx) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. Leishmania lacks catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases, making the discovery of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins crucial for peroxide removal in these organisms. The study found that mTXNPx null mutants (mtxnpx−) were unable to thrive in a murine model of infection, despite being indistinguishable from wild-type promastigotes. However, the avirulent phenotype of mtxnpx− was not due to the lack of peroxidase activity of mTXNPx, as these mutants behaved like controls when exposed to oxidants added exogenously or generated by macrophages during phagocytosis ex vivo. Furthermore, mtxnpx− were avirulent when inoculated into murine hosts unable to mount an effective oxidative phagocyte response. A peroxidase-inactive version of mTXNPx was able to rescue the non-infective phenotype of mtxnpx−, suggesting that mTXNPx has a novel function as a molecular chaperone. This premise was supported by the observation that mTXNPx was able to suppress the thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro. Additionally, mtxnpx− were more sensitive than controls to a temperature shift from 25°C to 37°C, a phenotype reminiscent of organisms lacking specific chaperone genes. These findings change the paradigm that regards all trypanosomatid 2-Cys peroxiredoxins as peroxide-eliminating devices and demonstrate that these enzymes can be determinant for pathogenicity independently of their peroxidase activity.
Researchers conducted a multicenter study to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Histoplasma urine antigen (HUAg) test, specifically the IMMY ALPHA Histoplasma EIA, for diagnosing progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) in HIV-infected patients. The study included 288 patients with suspected PDH from two secondary and eight tertiary-care facilities in Mexico. The results showed that the sensitivity of the HUAg test was 67.1% and the specificity was 97.5%. The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2. The study found that 29.5% of patients had PDH, and in 10.5% of these cases, a co-existing opportunistic infection was diagnosed, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection. The study suggests that the HUAg test may be useful for starting early antifungal treatment, but a culture-based approach is necessary due to the high frequency of co-infections. The results are consistent with previous studies, which have reported varying sensitivities and specificities for the HUAg test. The study highlights the importance of a culture-based approach for diagnosing PDH in HIV-infected patients, as a negative HUAg result does not rule out the disease. The findings of this study are relevant for regions outside the United States, where an on-site HUAg test is preferred due to logistics, costs, and turn-around time of results.
Researchers conducted a metagenomic analysis of stool samples from 12 children with acute diarrhea to identify the viral communities present. The study employed a novel approach called "micro-mass sequencing," which requires minimal sample quantity (less than 100 mg of stool) and limited sequencing (384 reads per sample). This method allowed for the detection of known enteric viruses as well as multiple sequences from putatively novel viruses with limited similarity to existing viruses in the GenBank database.

The study aimed to explore the diversity of viral communities in pediatric patients with diarrhea, anticipating that the viral communities would vary significantly from specimen to specimen. The results showed that micro-mass sequencing can define the diversity of viral communities found in fecal samples from diarrhea patients, detecting both known and novel viruses. This approach has the potential to lay the foundation for future studies assessing whether novel or unexpected viruses play a causal role in human diarrhea.

This study expands on previous metagenomic investigations of human stool, which have been limited to analysis of a small number of specimens from healthy patients. The pediatric samples used in this study provided smaller volumes of stool, requiring a strategy to minimize purification steps to analyze as little as 30 mg of archived fecal matter. The results of this study will serve as a springboard for further investigations into the roles of diverse viruses in the gastrointestinal tract.
Researchers analyzed national surveillance data from the Dominican Republic to compare the transmission dynamics of Zika and dengue viruses. The study found that dengue cases were predominantly reported among individuals under 20 years old, whereas Zika infections were more evenly distributed across the population. Dengue attack rates were marginally higher among males, while Zika infections were significantly more common among females, with age-adjusted attack rates of 7.64 per 10,000 population compared to 2.72 per 10,000 population among males. Reproductive number (R0) calculations also showed a higher metric among females. However, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) attack rates were slightly higher among males. The study suggests that existing dengue immunity had little impact on reported Zika attack rates at the population level. The findings indicate that community awareness campaigns may have influenced increased reporting among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. The study recommends media campaigns and screening for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Additionally, future research should focus on clinical Zika outcomes among dengue seropositive individuals.
Researchers have investigated the role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) in Arabidopsis, a plant species, in response to DNA damage and immune responses. Unlike in animals, where PARP1 is the primary enzyme responsible for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, the study found that PARP2 is the predominant PARP in Arabidopsis. PARP2 plays a crucial role in DNA repair processes and immune responses, including the restriction of pathogenic bacteria growth and reduction of DNA double-strand breaks. The study also found that PARG1, a poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase enzyme, is the primary enzyme responsible for removing poly(ADP-ribose) from acceptor proteins in Arabidopsis.

The study used Arabidopsis mutants with mutations in PARP1 and PARP2 to examine the functional importance of these enzymes in plant poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA damage responses. The results showed that knockout of PARP2, rather than PARP1, severely depleted detectable PARP activity in Arabidopsis, indicating that PARP2 is the primary enzyme responsible for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in response to DNA damage. The study also found that PARP1 and PARP2 physically interact with each other and with PARG1 and PARG2, suggesting direct regulatory interactions among these enzymes.

The study's findings suggest that core aspects of plant poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation are mediated by substantially different enzymes than in animals, indicating potential differences in regulation. Overall, the study highlights the importance of PARP2 in Arabidopsis DNA damage and immune responses, and provides new insights into the regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in plants.
Researchers have identified a new signaling pathway in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that regulates synapse formation and learning. This pathway, composed of the kinases MIG-15, NSY-1, JKK-1, and JNK-1, is distinct from the previously known Pam/Highwire/RPM-1 (PHR) pathway, which also regulates synapse formation and axon termination. The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway specifically suppresses defects in synapse formation in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants, but does not affect axon termination. This suggests that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway acts as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1 in regulating glutamatergic synapse formation.

Transgenic overexpression of the kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway is sufficient to impair synapse formation in wild-type animals, indicating that this pathway plays a crucial role in regulating synapse development. The kinases in this pathway function cell autonomously in the mechanosensory neurons and localize to presynaptic terminals, providing further evidence of their role in synapse development. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling also suppresses defects in habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit that is likely to arise from impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. These findings suggest that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway can restrict both glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning.
Researchers studied the sex-determination protein TRA-1 in hermaphroditic nematodes, specifically Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that TRA-1 is bipotential, meaning it can both activate and repress the same target genes in response to changing signals. The study identified a co-factor, TRR-1, which is required for spermatogenesis and works with TRA-1 to control the sperm/oocyte decision. TRR-1 is part of the Tip60 Histone Acetyl Transferase complex and promotes the expression of Cbr-fog-3, a gene necessary for spermatogenesis. Epistasis tests revealed that TRR-1 works through TRA-1 to activate Cbr-fog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision, demonstrating that TRA-1 is indeed bipotential. The study also found that TRR-1 regulates the development of the male tail and that Cbr-tra-2 and Cbr-trr-1 double mutants resemble Cbr-tra-1 null mutants, indicating that these two regulatory branches control all TRA-1 activity. The researchers observed striking differences in the relationship between these two branches of the switch between C. briggsae and C. elegans, suggesting that the relationship between the two halves of a bipotential switch can shift rapidly during evolution.
Researchers have developed a new measure of integrated information, ΦE and ΦAR, to quantify the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts as it transitions between states. This measure can be applied to time-series data and overcomes the limitations of previous measures, such as ΦDM, which is defined only for discrete Markov systems. The new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, are easy to apply in practice and can be used to examine information integration in real and model systems.

The researchers used simulations to demonstrate the applicability of the new measures and to explore their properties. The results provide new opportunities for examining the relationship between integrated information, consciousness, and other neurocognitive processes. However, the findings also pose challenges for theories that ascribe physical meaning to the measured quantities.

Previous measures of integrated information, such as ΦDM, were formulated in the context of the integrated information theory of consciousness (IITC). According to the IITC, consciousness is integrated information, and has the status of a fundamental property of the universe. However, the new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, are framed in terms of process, rather than capacity, and can be applied to time-series data. This distinction carries implications for theories, such as the IITC, that ascribe physical meaning to measures of integrated information.

Future work will empirically examine integrated information for time-series data acquired from neuroimaging and other biological datasets, and investigate how integrated information is modulated by input and output relations of a system embedded in a surrounding environment.
Researchers have used Bayesian geostatistical analysis to investigate the spread of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda. The study aimed to identify environmental and climatic factors contributing to the disease's spatial distribution and to assess the role of livestock trade in its spread. Building on a previous study that used simple logistic regression methods, this research incorporated spatial autocorrelation and uncertainty in input data and model parameters to provide a more robust analysis. The results support the hypothesis that HAT was introduced to the study area through the movement of infected, untreated livestock from endemic areas. The study also found that health care accessibility and minimum land surface temperature have a significant impact on the disease's distribution. Predictive mapping revealed an increased risk of high HAT prevalence in areas surrounding livestock markets, highlighting the importance of treating livestock at the point of sale to prevent disease spread. The study demonstrates the utility of Bayesian geostatistical modeling in predicting HAT prevalence based on external covariates and provides evidence for targeted control measures to combat the disease. The findings emphasize the need for adherence to government policy to treat livestock at the point of sale to prevent the spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda.
A long-held assumption in the field of ecology is that complex ecosystems are more stable than simpler ones. However, a recent study challenges this idea by examining the feasibility of equilibria in large ecosystems. The researchers found that in species-rich systems, the existence of a feasible equilibrium, where all species coexist with positive abundances, is not guaranteed. In fact, the probability of observing such an equilibrium decreases exponentially as the size of the network grows. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of ecosystem dynamics, as it suggests that local stability criteria, which assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, may not be applicable in all cases.

The study also explored the effects of interaction strength and network architecture on the feasibility of equilibria. The researchers found that in systems with weak interactions, non-trivial feasible equilibria are only found in ecologically-inspired systems, where the interactions are structured in a way that is consistent with real-world ecosystems. This suggests that the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture plays a crucial role in determining the stability of ecosystems. The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and highlight the need for a more nuanced approach to understanding the relationship between complexity and stability in ecosystems.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Kenya to investigate the sero-epidemiology of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, in humans and cattle. Serum samples from 2049 humans and 955 cattle in 416 homesteads were analyzed for C. burnetii antibodies. The overall sero-prevalence of C. burnetii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle. However, no correlation was found between cattle and human seroprevalence within households or when accounting for spatial proximity between households.

Multilevel regression analysis revealed that several factors contributed to exposure to C. burnetii in both humans and cattle. Cattle obtained from markets and those residing in areas with lower precipitation levels had higher sero-prevalence. In humans, the youngest age group had the highest odds of seropositivity, and variations were observed between ethnic groups. Frequent livestock contact, particularly grazing and dealing with abortion material, was also a risk factor for human exposure.

The study highlights the importance of livestock contact in the transmission of C. burnetii and suggests that environmental factors may play a role in cattle exposure patterns. However, human exposure patterns are likely driven more strongly by livestock contacts. The findings indicate that livestock markets may be a suitable target for interventions to reduce the risk of Q fever transmission.
Researchers have identified three vasa-like DEAD-box RNA helicases in the genome of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease. These helicases, Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3, are members of the Vasa/PL10 DEAD-box subfamily and exhibit conserved motifs characteristic of this family. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed their membership in this subfamily. The expression of these genes was found to be elevated in various developmental stages of S. mansoni, including sporocysts, adult females, eggs, and miracidia, with particularly high expression in undeveloped eggs. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 are transcribed in the posterior ovary, where oocytes mature. This germ cell-specific expression of schistosome vasa-like genes provides an informative landmark for germ line transgenesis of schistosomes. Transgenesis is a technique used to introduce genetic modifications into an organism, and it can be used to study the function of specific genes. The identification of vasa-like genes in S. mansoni may aid in the development of novel anti-schistosomal interventions. Furthermore, these genes may be valuable markers in functional genomics of schistosomes to monitor the introduction of transgenes into the schistosome germ line.
Researchers have identified a critical role for VGLL4 in the development and maintenance of heart valves. VGLL4 is a transcription cofactor that plays a key part in the Hippo signaling pathway, which is essential for organ development and tissue homeostasis. The study found that VGLL4 is mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-embryonic development stage and remains present until adulthood. Tissue-specific knockout of VGLL4 in different cell lineages revealed that loss of VGLL4 in endothelial cells, but not other cell types, leads to valve malformation and abnormal valve morphology. Furthermore, semi-knockout of YAP, a key component of the Hippo pathway, in VGLL4-ablated hearts rescued the valve malformation phenotype, indicating that VGLL4 is required for normal valve development by antagonizing YAP activity. The study also found that YAP plays a role in post-embryonic valve development and that VGLL4 is critical for balancing cell proliferation and apoptosis during development and tissue homeostasis. The findings suggest that manipulation of the Hippo pathway, particularly VGLL4, may be a potential therapy for preventing the progression of congenital heart valve disease. Overall, the study highlights the importance of VGLL4 in heart valve development and maintenance, and identifies a previously unknown function of VGLL4 in valve remodeling and homeostasis.
Recent studies have reported the presence of soft selective sweeps in various organisms, including humans, Drosophila, and HIV, based on large-scale data analyses. However, other researchers have questioned the validity of these findings, arguing that soft sweeps are likely to be rare. To reconcile these opposing results, three recent studies were evaluated using population genetic theory and extensive simulation. The analysis revealed that all three examples are prone to extremely high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. Furthermore, it was found that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns of genomic variation. The authors argue that the lack of sufficient model testing and statistical performance analyses underlying these claims of recurrent soft sweeps has led to inaccurate views of the evolutionary processes governing these organisms. The generalization of these results has resulted in misleading answers to decades-old questions in population genetics, with some suggesting a dominant role for positive selection in shaping patterns of genomic variation.
Researchers investigated the role of Neuropeptide Y-Like Receptors (NPYLRs) in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for dengue fever. They identified eight NPYLRs in the Ae. aegypti genome and screened them for sensitivity to a panel of peptides, including Head Peptide-I, a candidate peptide that inhibits host-seeking behavior after a blood meal. Four NPYLRs responded to one or more peptide ligands, but only NPYLR1 responded to Head Peptide-I and short Neuropeptide-F peptides (sNPFs). The researchers also found that NPYLR1 homologues in the Lyme disease vector Ixodes scapularis were sensitive to Head Peptide-I.

Injections of synthetic Head Peptide-I and sNPF-3 inhibited host-seeking behavior in non-blood-fed female mosquitoes, while control injections had no effect. To determine if NPYLR1 is necessary for blood-feeding-induced host-seeking inhibition, the researchers generated npylr1 null mutant strains using zinc-finger nucleases and tested them for behavioral abnormalities. However, npylr1 mutants displayed normal behavior in various tests, suggesting that NPYLR1 alone is not required for host-seeking inhibition.

The study deorphanized four Ae. aegypti NPYLRs and identified NPYLR1 as a candidate sNPF receptor sensitive to Head Peptide-I. However, the relationship between NPYLR1 and the regulation of mosquito feeding behavior remains unclear. The researchers propose two models for the regulation of host-seeking behavior, suggesting that NPYLR1 may function redundantly with other receptors to modulate mosquito behavior.
Researchers used satellite-derived environmental data to model the risk of schistosomiasis transmission in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State, Nigeria. Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease, is influenced by environmental factors such as rivers, elevation, slope, land surface temperature, land use/cover, and rainfall. The study aimed to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission using multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Saaty's analytical hierarchy process (AHP). AHP was used to assign weights to individual risk factors, including temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/cover. The weighted overlay analysis identified areas vulnerable to schistosomiasis transmission. The prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in the study area was also determined through parasitological analysis of urine samples collected from random sampling. The results showed that 82% of the area falls under the high and very high risk category, with one community (Oba Ile) having the lowest risk and four other communities (Iju, Igoba, Ita Ogbolu, and Ogbese) having increased risk. The predictions made by the model correlated strongly with observations from the field study, indicating that environmental factors can be used to identify and predict schistosomiasis transmission and monitor disease risk in newly established rural and agricultural communities. The study suggests that remote sensing and geographical information system-based spatial analyses can be used to determine the geographical limit of disease distribution, understand disease ecology and epidemiology, and support prevention, surveillance, and control efforts.
Bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal meningitis) is a serious infection of the brain that can lead to long-term disabilities and cognitive impairments in survivors. A key factor contributing to the neuropathogenic potential of pneumococci is the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin. Research has shown that pneumolysin plays a significant role in disrupting the regulation of glutamate in the brain, leading to synaptic damage. In post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumococcal meningitis, selective synaptic loss was observed in the superficial layers of the frontal neocortex. A similar effect was observed in mice with pneumococcal meningitis when the bacteria expressed pneumolysin.

Exposure of mouse brain slices to non-lytic concentrations of pneumolysin caused permanent dendritic swelling, dendritic spine elimination, and synaptic loss. The NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and D-AP5 reduced this pathology. Pneumolysin increased glutamate levels within the mouse brain slices, and in mouse astrocytes, pneumolysin initiated the release of glutamate in a calcium-dependent manner. The study proposes that pneumolysin plays a significant role in pneumococcal meningitis by initiating glutamate release from astrocytes, leading to subsequent glutamate-dependent synaptic damage. This research highlights the importance of pneumolysin in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying synaptic damage in this disease.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a major cause of human cancers, and understanding their infectious life cycle is crucial for developing new prevention methods, such as vaccines and microbicides. Research has shown that HPVs infect the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but the reason for this specific location has not been fully understood. A recent study used chemical biology approaches to investigate the requirements for HPV infection and found that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for the establishment of HPV infection. The study used infectious HPV16 particles and synchronized human keratinocytes to demonstrate that the recipient cell must enter the M phase of the cell cycle for HPV infection to occur. Inhibitors of the G1, S, G2, and early M phases of the cell cycle prevented infection, while late M phase inhibitors had no effect. The study suggests that host cells need to pass through early prophase for successful onset of transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes. This finding provides one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia, where cells are actively dividing. The study's results have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of HPV infection and may inform the development of new prevention strategies. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in primary keratinocytes and in vivo models.
Researchers have identified microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in the thermal dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei, which causes systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. The study used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze small RNAs in both mycelial and yeast phases of the fungus. The results revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, with 17 in the mycelial phase and 7 in the yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins, and the gene qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 is more closely related to homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp.

The study found that dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in the mycelial phase than in the yeast phase. Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in the mycelial phase. The biogenesis of both milRNAs was found to be dependent on dcl-2, but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The study also showed that the mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in a knockdown strain, supporting the regulatory function of milRNAs. These findings provide the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and the possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.
Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in French Polynesia in 2013 and spread throughout the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. Two potential Aedes mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, may have contributed to the transmission of ZIKV. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the vector competence of wild Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis populations from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain that circulated in the region during the 2013-2017 outbreak. Field-collected mosquitoes from three Ae. aegypti and two Ae. polynesiensis populations were orally exposed to a ZIKV strain isolated in the region in 2014. The results showed that ZIKV infection rates were heterogeneous between Ae. aegypti populations, but dissemination rates were moderate and more homogeneous. For Ae. polynesiensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between the two populations tested. The transmission rate and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study. The study found that Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis from the Pacific region had a low ability to transmit ZIKV. The results suggest that other factors, such as vector density, mosquito lifespan, or a large immunologically naive fraction of the population, may have contributed to the rapid spread of ZIKV in the Pacific region during the 2013-2017 outbreak.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Targeted Structure-Seq to study the structure of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Xist in cells. Xist is a master regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells, and understanding its structure is crucial for understanding its function. Targeted Structure-Seq combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing, allowing for high coverage of the target RNA with relatively few sequencing reads. This approach enriches for signals from the RNA of interest, making it a targeted and scalable method for analyzing RNA conformation in cells.

Using Targeted Structure-Seq, the researchers probed the full-length Xist lncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat A element in the 5'-end of Xist. The analysis also identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved, including a new element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function. The repeat A region of Xist is known to be a functional element important for gene repression.

The researchers validated the utility of Targeted Structure-Seq to study lncRNA conformation in mammalian cells and expect it to be particularly useful for advancing the mechanistic understanding of lncRNAs. The data obtained from Targeted Structure-Seq can be used to develop a conformational model of full-length Xist, providing new insights into RNA function, molecular evolution, and modularity.
A new statistical framework has been developed to evaluate the predictive power of genetic variants for complex diseases. The framework connects various predictive indices, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), mean risk difference, net reclassification improvement, and proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of population at the highest risk. The framework allows for the estimation of these indices and the construction of graphs to visualize the performance of risk models, such as the ROC curve, density of risks, and predictiveness curve. The results from simulations match well with theoretical estimates, and the methodology is applied to nine complex diseases to evaluate the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants.

The framework addresses the limitations of using AUC alone to judge the predictive value of genetic tests. A high level of statistical significance does not necessarily equate to good predictive power, and a more comprehensive assessment of prediction model performance may be achieved by complementing AUC with other available prediction indices and graphs, such as net reclassification improvement and risk distribution plots. The framework provides a unifying approach to evaluate the performance of genetic risk prediction models, which is essential for determining the clinical utility of genetic tests based on genomic profiles of susceptibility variants.
Researchers developed a new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), using recombinant antigens. The new test, SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, was compared to an existing RDT produced using native antigens (SD BIOLINE HAT) and the traditional Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT). A total of 57,632 individuals were screened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and 260 HAT cases were confirmed by parasitology. The results showed that SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 had the highest sensitivity (71.2%), followed by CATT (62.5%) and SD BIOLINE HAT (59.0%). CATT was the most specific test (99.2%), while SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 had specificities of 98.9% and 98.1%, respectively. The sensitivity of the tests was lower than previously reported, likely due to the fact that they identified cases from partially overlapping sub-populations. Combining two or three tests resulted in a significantly increased sensitivity, with SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 combined reaching 98.4% in passive screening and 83.0% in active screening. The recombinant antigen-based RDT was more sensitive than SD BIOLINE HAT and as specific as CATT.
Researchers conducted a decade-long study in the municipality of Comapa, Guatemala, to evaluate the effectiveness of vector control activities against Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease prevalent in Latin America. The study aimed to assess the impact of indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS) and other control measures on the infestation of Triatoma dimidiata, the primary vector of Chagas disease. Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 1999, 2007, and 2015 to measure entomological and serological indices. The results showed a significant decrease in the infestation index, from 39% in 2001-2002 to 27% in 2011, following multiple rounds of IRS. Household construction materials alone accounted for less than 10% of infested houses. The seroprevalence of Chagas disease in school-aged children declined by 10-fold, from 10% in 1999 to 1% in 2015. However, seroprevalence in women of childbearing age remained above 10%. The study suggests that while vector control activities have reduced transmission, the continued risk of vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to the 2022 Chagas disease elimination goal. To achieve this goal, systematic integrated vector control and improved Chagas disease screening and treatment programs for congenital and vector-borne disease are necessary in regions with persistent vector infestation.
Citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, similar to the human pathogens enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Research has shown that the genome of C. rodentium is unstable due to large-scale genome recombination and the active transposition of mobile genetic elements, such as prophages. This instability is consistent with the idea that C. rodentium is a recently evolved pathogen.

The genome of C. rodentium strain ICC168, a widely studied isolate, displays characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen, including a large number of pseudogenes and IS elements. A new strain, EX-33, was sequenced to confirm that ICC168 is representative of the species and that many inactivating mutations are common to both isolates. These mutations likely occurred early in the evolution of the pathogen.

The instability of the C. rodentium genome is similar to that of other bacterial pathogens, suggesting that it may have emerged alongside the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease. The pathogen's virulence strategy is shared with EPEC and EHEC, and many of the functions that confer this virulence are located on horizontally acquired mobile genetic elements. The large-scale genomic rearrangements and functional gene loss in C. rodentium suggest that it has only recently emerged as a significant pathogen and is still adapting to its new lifestyle.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to analyze stochasticity in gene expression, which refers to the random fluctuations in protein levels across cell populations. Despite numerous theoretical models explaining these fluctuations, there was a lack of a robust and assumption-free approach to infer the underlying molecular mechanisms. The new method infers sets of biochemical rate constants that govern chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from protein expression distributions. By deriving analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution, the researchers found that these four moments completely capture the shape of protein distributions. An efficient algorithm was developed to infer gene expression rate constants from the moments of protein distributions. Using this algorithm, the researchers found that most protein distributions are consistent with a large number of different biochemical rate constant sets, but the solution space of rate constants almost always informs on underlying mechanism. The method was able to distinguish between regimes where transcriptional bursting occurs and regimes reflecting constitutive transcript production. The framework developed here will be a powerful tool for deducing the contributions of particular molecular mechanisms to specific patterns of gene expression. The method was able to obtain estimates of individual biochemical rate constants or meaningful ratios of rate constants in 91% of tested cases, and identified all underlying rate constants in some cases.
Researchers have developed a new approach to protect against monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection using a recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vector-based vaccine. The vaccine, which expresses different MPXV glycoproteins, was tested in STAT1 knockout mice, which are highly susceptible to MPXV infection. The study found that the BoHV-4-based vaccine was safe and effective in protecting the mice against lethal MPXV challenge, with 100% protection when administered alone and 80% protection when administered in combination with two other BoHV-4 vectors. This is significant because MPXV is an emerging zoonotic disease in Africa, and there are currently no FDA-approved therapies against the virus. Smallpox vaccination provides some cross-protection against MPXV, but the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, leaving a large proportion of the population unprotected. The study's findings suggest that the BoHV-4-based vaccine could be a promising tool for preventing MPXV infection, particularly in areas where the virus is endemic. The use of BoHV-4 as a vaccine vector platform also offers a safer alternative to traditional smallpox vaccines, which are associated with morbidity and contraindicated in a large proportion of the population. Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of the BoHV-4-based vaccine in humans.
Researchers have identified the ApaH-like phosphatase TbALPH1 as the major mRNA decapping enzyme in trypanosomes. Unlike other eukaryotes, trypanosomes lack homologues to the subunits of the decapping complex. Instead, they use TbALPH1 to remove the cap from deadenylated mRNAs, allowing them to be degraded by the 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRNA. RNA interference (RNAi) depletion of TbALPH1 is lethal and results in a massive accumulation of deadenylated mRNAs that have not yet started 5'-3' decay. This suggests that TbALPH1 acts downstream of deadenylation and upstream of mRNA degradation, consistent with a function in mRNA decapping.

In vitro experiments show that recombinant TbALPH1 protein sensitizes the capped trypanosome spliced leader RNA to yeast Xrn1, but only when an RNA 5' polyphosphatase is included. This indicates that the decapping mechanism of TbALPH1 differs from the decapping mechanism of Dcp2 by leaving more than one phosphate group at the mRNA's 5' end. This is the first reported function of a eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatase, a bacterial-derived class of enzymes present in all phylogenetic super-groups of the eukaryotic kingdom. The substrates of eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatases are unknown, but the substrate of the related bacterial enzyme ApaH, diadenosine tetraphosphate, is highly reminiscent of a eukaryotic mRNA cap.

TbALPH1 localizes to P-bodies and its depletion causes the accumulation of deadenylated mRNA molecules that have not yet started degradation. Its exclusive co-localization with the 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRNA suggests that both enzymes are members of the same pathway.
Researchers have discovered that inactivating the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, triggers their conversion into functional β-like cells that produce insulin. This process, known as neogenesis, can occur at any age and is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass and reverse diabetes. The study used a combination of conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches to demonstrate that the loss of Arx in α-cells leads to the continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine cell fate, resulting in the generation of glucagon+ cells that are subsequently converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition.

The researchers found that the ectopic expression of Pax4, a gene previously shown to induce the conversion of glucagon+ cells into β-like cells, is dispensable for this process, indicating that Arx is the main trigger of α-cell-mediated β-like cell neogenesis. Importantly, the loss of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass and reverse diabetes following toxin-induced β-cell depletion. The study suggests that strategies aimed at inhibiting the expression of Arx or its molecular targets/co-factors may pave new avenues for the treatment of diabetes. The findings provide evidence that the sole loss of the Arx gene in α-cells is sufficient to initiate a continuous cycle of glucagon+ cell neo-formation and their conversion into β-like cells, leading to islet hypertrophy due to β-like cell hyperplasia.
Eukaryotic cells have thousands of replication origins in their genome, and preventing re-initiation at these origins is crucial for maintaining genome stability. To achieve this, cells employ a range of regulatory mechanisms that reduce the activity of replication initiation proteins. However, research suggests that these mechanisms may not be uniform across all origins, as some origins re-initiate with varying efficiencies when these mechanisms are disabled. This raises the possibility of an additional layer of replication control that can differentially regulate re-initiation at distinct origins.

Studies have identified novel genetic elements, termed re-initiation promoters (RIPs), which are necessary for preferential re-initiation of certain origins and sufficient to confer preferential re-initiation on heterologous origins when the control of re-initiation is partially deregulated. These elements map to approximately 60 base pair AT-rich sequences that act in a distance- and sequence-dependent manner. The RIPs do not enhance the S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins, indicating that they specifically act as re-initiation promoters.

The findings suggest that the RIP elements can overcome a block to re-initiation imposed after the Mcm2-7 complex associates with origins. This local level of control creates a complex genomic landscape of re-replication potential, which is revealed when global mechanisms preventing re-replication are compromised. The discovery of RIPs provides new insights into the regulation of eukaryotic replication origins and highlights the possibility that some regions of the genome may be more susceptible to genomic alterations than others.
Invasive amebiasis (IA) caused by Entamoeba histolytica is a significant health concern, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and those co-infected with HIV-1. A study of 170 HIV-1-infected Japanese men with IA found that the clinical presentation of the disease was similar to that in non-HIV-1-infected individuals, with high fever, leukocytosis, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis, while three died from unrelated causes. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in 165 cases, and luminal treatment was provided to 83 patients following initial treatment. However, amebiasis recurred in 6 of these patients, a frequency similar to those who did not receive luminal treatment. Recurrence was more common in individuals with hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies and those who acquired syphilis during follow-up. Genotyping of E. histolytica was performed in 14 patients, but no correlation was found between genotype and clinical features. The study suggests that metronidazole and tinidazole treatment is effective for uncomplicated amebiasis in HIV-1-infected individuals, but luminal treatment following initial therapy does not reduce recurrence in high-risk populations, likely due to re-infection.
A study was conducted in the Mandoul focus in Chad to assess the impact of adding tsetse control to medical activities on the transmission of Gambian sleeping sickness, also known as Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). The disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and is transmitted by riverine species of tsetse flies. Prior to 2014, control of HAT relied solely on case detection and treatment, which led to a gradual decrease in the number of cases. However, due to the persistence of transmission and detection of new cases, the addition of vector control to case detection and treatment was investigated.

The study involved deploying "tiny targets" that attract and kill tsetse flies in the riverine habitats of tsetse in 2014, 2015, and 2016. The impact of tsetse control on the incidence of sleeping sickness was assessed through nine tsetse monitoring surveys and four medical surveys of the human population in 2014 and 2015. Mathematical modeling was used to assess the relative impact of tsetse control on incidence compared to active and passive screening.

The results showed that the deployment of tiny targets reduced the number of tsetse flies in the area, which may have interrupted transmission. The study found that 70.4% of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 can be attributed to vector control, with the rest due to medical intervention. Model predictions suggest that elimination of HAT as a public health problem could be achieved by 2018 in this focus if vector control and screening continue at the present level.
A study of 1245 cases of imported strongyloidiasis in Spain from 2009 to 2017 found that most patients were immigrants from South America, with 66.9% of cases originating from this region. The majority of patients were asymptomatic, but 82.2% had eosinophilia at the time of diagnosis. Detection of Strongyloides stercoralis larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients, while serological tests were used to diagnose the remaining cases. The study found that treatment with ivermectin, compared to albendazole, was the most strongly associated factor with achieving a cure, with an odds ratio of 2.34.

The study also highlighted the importance of screening for S. stercoralis infection in patients coming from or traveling to endemic areas, particularly those with immunosuppressant conditions, due to the long latency of the infection and the risk of developing a severe presentation. The results of this study contradict those of a previous study in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which found that ivermectin treatment was not effective in eliminating the parasite in all patients. The study suggests that a combination of diagnostic techniques, including classical parasitological methods, serology, and PCR, may be necessary to accurately diagnose strongyloidiasis.
Researchers have explored the relationship between the amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen used in a vaccine, known as the inoculum dose, and its impact on host immunity and morbidity. A higher inoculum dose can stimulate a stronger immune response, but may also cause more severe side effects and limit population coverage in the event of vaccine shortages. To determine the optimal inoculum dose, a combination of mathematical models and experimental data can be used. The authors developed a modeling framework to study the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity using data from influenza A virus (IAV) and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infections in mice and cotton rats. The model was used to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity, and to explore how this framework could be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. The results showed that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen, and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. The authors propose that this framework can be used to rationally design vaccines and determine the optimal amount of inoculum dose for a given vaccine and setting. This approach can help to more efficiently determine the optimal dose and could be applied to data from specific vaccine candidates.
Researchers studied the expression of the hetR gene in Anabaena filaments, a cyanobacterium that undergoes a process of development in response to nitrogen deprivation. The hetR gene is essential for the differentiation of heterocysts, specialized cells that fix nitrogen. The study used a chromosomally-encoded translational hetR-gfp fusion to measure the fluctuations in hetR expression at the individual cell level in wild-type and mutant filaments. The results showed that expression fluctuations of hetR in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic spatial range of approximately two to three cells. This coupling is primarily due to intercellular molecular transfer and less due to cell division. The study also found that under nitrogen-rich conditions, the basal, steady-state expression of the HetR inhibitor PatS, cell-cell communication influenced by the septal protein SepJ, and positive HetR auto-regulation are essential determinants of fluctuations in hetR expression and its distribution along filaments. The study highlights the differences between the two HetR inhibitors PatS and HetN, as well as the differences in specificity between the septal proteins SepJ and FraC/FraD. The results demonstrate that proteins involved in activation, inhibition, and cell-cell communication combine to control the coupled fluctuations of gene expression that give rise to a one-dimensional developmental pattern in Anabaena.
Researchers investigated the replication efficiency of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) and genotype III (GIII) in avian and porcine cells, as well as in young domestic ducklings. The study aimed to understand the reasons behind the shift in JEV genotype dominance from GIII to GI in China. A serological survey in JEV-non-vaccinated pigs revealed a higher ratio of GI to GIII infections, indicating co-circulation of both genotypes with GI being more prevalent. The replication kinetics of seven JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, were compared in mosquito C6/36 cells, chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1), and porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIEC). The results showed that GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII strains in DF-1 and PIEC cells, with titers reaching 22.9-225.3 fold higher than those of GIII strains. This enhanced replication efficiency was also observed in young domestic ducklings inoculated with GI and GIII strains, which developed higher viremia titers and displayed a longer viremic duration than GIII-inoculated ducklings. The study suggests that the enhanced replication of GI viruses in birds may contribute to their increased transmission efficiency in the birds-mosquitoes-birds enzootic transmission cycle, leading to the observed genotype shift. The 36 amino acid differences between GI and GIII viruses may be responsible for the enhanced replication efficiency of GI viruses in birds.
Researchers studied the genetic network that regulates biofilm formation in Candida albicans, a type of fungus that can cause infections. The network consists of six transcription factors (Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Ndt80, Rob1, and Tec1) that work together to control biofilm formation. To understand how these factors interact, the researchers created all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network genes and analyzed their effects on biofilm formation. The results showed that the network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbations, with all six heterozygous mutants affecting biofilm formation. Many double heterozygous mutants were as severely affected as homozygous deletions, indicating that the network is highly interdependent. The researchers found that the network has properties of a "small-world" network, which is efficient but not robust. They also discovered that Tec1 is a key component of the network, whose expression is sensitive to small perturbations in other transcription factors. Additionally, they found that Rob1's expression is dependent on both auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other network transcription factors. The study provides new insights into the functions of individual transcription factors and the role of the overall network topology in regulating biofilm formation. The findings suggest that the structure and function of the biofilm transcription factor network contribute to its ability to respond to small perturbations and regulate biofilm formation.
Researchers investigated the role of asparagine synthetase A (AS-A) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. AS-A is an enzyme responsible for converting aspartate into asparagine, an essential amino acid, using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. This enzyme is absent in humans and present in trypanosomatids, making it a potential target for drug development. Previous studies suggested that AS-A is essential for the survival of Leishmania donovani, another species of Leishmania. However, the current study found that Leishmania infantum AS-A (LiAS-A) is not essential for parasite survival, growth, or infectivity in normal in vitro and in vivo conditions. The researchers generated LiAS-A null mutants by targeted gene replacement and found that these parasites did not display any significant growth or infectivity defects. However, when cultured in asparagine-limiting conditions, the null mutants showed a severe impairment of in vitro growth. This suggests that LiAS-A is important for parasite survival under asparagine limitation, but not in normal conditions. As a result, the researchers conclude that AS-A is not a suitable drug target against Leishmania infantum parasites. This study provides new insights into the role of AS-A in Leishmania species and has implications for the development of new treatments for leishmaniasis.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between human toxocariasis and epilepsy. The review included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries, involving a total of 4740 subjects, including 2159 people with epilepsy and 2581 without epilepsy. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the association between epilepsy and Toxocara spp. seropositivity was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01), indicating a positive association between the two conditions. Meta-regression analysis showed no significant association between covariates and outcome. The association was consistently reported in restricted analyses, including studies using Western Blot as a confirmatory or diagnostic test, younger populations, and population-based studies. The results suggest that Toxocara seropositivity is associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. The study highlights the need for health strategies to reduce the impact of Toxocara spp. and further research to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxocara-associated epileptogenesis. The updated meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy, mainly supported by population-based studies.
Researchers have identified a new pathway in cells that helps repair DNA damage caused by double-strand breaks (DSBs). This pathway involves a protein called ATM, which is activated in response to DNA damage, and a microRNA called miR-335. When ATM is activated, it leads to the downregulation of miR-335, which in turn targets a protein called CtIP. CtIP plays a crucial role in the repair of DSBs through a process called homologous recombination repair (HRR). The researchers found that when miR-335 is overexpressed, it reduces the levels of CtIP and impairs the repair of DSBs, making cells more sensitive to radiation. Conversely, when miR-335 is downregulated, CtIP levels increase, and cells are better able to repair DSBs. The researchers also found that a protein called CREB is responsible for the expression of miR-335, and that ATM phosphorylates CREB in response to DNA damage, reducing its activity and leading to the downregulation of miR-335. The study suggests that the ATM-CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis plays a critical role in the selection of HRR for the repair of certain DSB lesions. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells respond to DNA damage and how this response can be modulated to improve cancer treatment outcomes.
Researchers investigated the role of mentalizing, or attributing mental states to others, in learning during social interactions. Participants played repeated games against artificial mentalizing agents with varying levels of sophistication, presented in either a social or non-social context. In the social context, participants believed they were playing against another person, while in the non-social context, they believed they were gambling in a casino. Results showed that participants performed better against the sophisticated mentalizing agents in the social context and worse in the non-social context. Additionally, their choice sequences were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian learning models only in the social context. This study demonstrates the added value of mentalizing in learning during repeated social interactions and suggests that deciphering intentional behavior relies on attributing mental states to others. The findings support the "social Bayesian brain" hypothesis, which proposes that the brain assumes others are also Bayesian learners and updates recursive beliefs based on others' behavior. The study's results indicate that mentalizing is essential for learning in social contexts and that domain-general learning heuristics are vulnerable to artificial mentalizing agents in non-social contexts.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FastGGM for inferring Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) in biological networks. GGMs are statistical models that describe the conditional dependence structure of a set of random variables, which is useful for analyzing biological networks. However, existing methods for estimating GGMs are either not statistically rigorous or inefficient for high-dimensional data. The new algorithm, FastGGM, addresses these limitations by providing a fast and accurate method for estimating GGMs and obtaining p-values and confidence intervals for each edge in the graph. Through simulation studies, the researchers demonstrated that FastGGM is several orders of magnitude faster than existing methods without sacrificing accuracy. The algorithm was applied to two real data sets: transcriptomic data from a childhood asthma study and proteomic data from an Alzheimer's disease study. The resulting networks revealed interesting interactions and differential networks between cases and controls that showed functional relevance to the diseases. The researchers conclude that FastGGM provides a computationally efficient and statistically sound procedure for constructing GGMs and making inferences with high-dimensional biological data. The algorithm has been implemented in an R package called "FastGGM" and is available for download.
Researchers investigated the optimal balance of the striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) network, which plays a crucial role in learning and executing movement sequences. They found that the network's population firing rates vary coherently on slow, behaviorally relevant timescales, and that this activity emerges in a model of a local MSN network at realistic connectivities and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs). The study examined how MSN network-generated population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical driving activity, simulating a behavioral task. The results showed that at high connectivity, the network enters a stable "winners-take-all" regime, where only a small number of population firing rate components interact with cortical stimulus variations. In contrast, at lower connectivity, the network transitions to a more dynamically active regime, where all cells constantly switch between activity and quiescence. This regime is characterized by weak changes in cortical driving interacting with many population components, resulting in reproducible activation of sequential cell assemblies for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset. The study found that this activity is maximized at striatally realistic connectivities and IPSP sizes. The researchers suggest that the local MSN network is optimized to generate stimulus-dependent activity patterns for long periods after variations in cortical excitation, neither too stable nor too unstable.
Researchers investigated the relationship between polarized exocytosis and endocytosis in yeast cells. Polarized exocytosis transports membrane components to specific locations on the cell cortex, while endocytosis retrieves these components before they can diffuse away. The study found that the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p plays a crucial role in coupling polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization, which induces endocytosis. After polarized exocytosis, Sec4p binds to Las17/Bee1p, a complex with Sla1p and Sla2p, during actin patch assembly. Mutations that inactivate Sec4p or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2p inhibit actin patch formation, while the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays showed that GTPγS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation. The results suggest that Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis, promoting actin polymerization and triggering compensatory endocytosis to control surface expansion and refine cell polarization.
Acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice is a widely used model for studying drug-induced liver injury in humans. Researchers have been trying to understand the underlying mechanisms of this injury to develop effective strategies to prevent or reverse it. A key feature of acetaminophen-induced liver injury is that necrosis, or cell death, begins near the central vein of the liver lobule and spreads outward. However, the exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is still unclear. One hypothesis, known as the NAPQI zonation hypothesis, suggests that differences in the formation of a toxic metabolite called NAPQI within the liver lobule are responsible for the location-dependent necrosis.

To test this hypothesis, researchers used a virtual model of the liver, called virtual hepatocytes, to simulate the effects of acetaminophen on the liver. The virtual model was designed to mimic the structure and function of real liver cells and was used to test the NAPQI zonation hypothesis. The results showed that zonation of NAPQI formation alone was not sufficient to explain the observed necrosis pattern. Therefore, the researchers proposed two additional features that could contribute to the phenomenon: a decrease in glutathione levels and a decrease in the ability to repair mitochondrial damage, both of which decrease in the direction of the central vein. When both features were included in the model, it successfully replicated the observed necrosis pattern, providing a more comprehensive explanation for the mechanism of acetaminophen-induced liver injury.
Researchers conducted a study to improve the early diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in children born to infected mothers. They analyzed the relationship between conventional diagnosis methods and quantitative DNA amplification in congenitally infected children. The study involved 51 children, grouped into three categories based on their diagnosis: those diagnosed within the first month after birth (Group A), those diagnosed at six months of age (Group B), and those diagnosed by serology at around 1 year old (Group C).

The results showed that parasitemia levels varied significantly among the groups. Group A had a median parasitemia of 1,700 parasites per milliliter (Pe/mL), while Group B had a median parasitemia of 20 Pe/mL at 1 month and 500 Pe/mL at 6 months. Group C had the lowest parasitemia levels, with a median of 5 Pe/mL, 800 Pe/mL, and 20 Pe/mL at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively.

The study found that some children had parasitemia levels below the detection limit of the conventional INP micromethod, highlighting the need for more sensitive diagnostic methods. The researchers also isolated T. cruzi parasites from 19 children and genotyped them, finding that 18 belonged to the DTU TcV (formerly TcIId) lineage and one belonged to TcI. The study's findings suggest that current trypanocidal treatment is effective in curing infected children, but more sensitive diagnostic methods are needed to ensure early diagnosis and prompt treatment.
A biophysical model of Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been developed to predict growth rate and cellular composition based on a coarse-grained representation of its genome. The model assumes that E. coli is in a state of balanced exponential steady-state growth in a temporally and spatially constant environment rich in resources. The model was applied to past measurements of growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio in seven E. coli strains with varying rRNA operon copy numbers, ranging from one to seven. The results showed that growth rate decreased for strains with fewer than six copies, and the model was able to reproduce these measurements. The model suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules inside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied, and that increasing the copy number beyond seven results in a densely packed cytoplasm. This overcrowding is predicted to weaken binding affinities, leading to a plateau in growth rate beyond the wild-type (WT) growth rate. The model also predicts that changing the rRNA operon copy number of WT E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does not substantially increase their growth rate. The model's predictions are consistent with other observations regarding strains with altered rRNA operon copy numbers, such as nucleoid compaction and the rRNA operon feedback response.
A recent study investigated the role of RADIALIS-LIKE SANT/MYB 1 (RSM1) in Arabidopsis seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity. RSM1, a MYB-related transcription factor, was found to interact with the transcription factors ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) and HY5 HOMOLOG (HYH) to modulate seed germination and seedling development. The study showed that down-regulation or up-regulation of RSM1 expression altered the sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to ABA, NaCl, and mannitol. RSM1 expression was dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl, and genetic analyses revealed that RSM1 mediated multiple functions of HY5 in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. Pull-down and BiFC assays confirmed the interaction between RSM1 and HY5/HYH in vitro and in vivo. The study suggests that RSM1 and HY5/HYH may function as a regulatory module in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, RSM1 was found to bind to the promoter of ABA INSENSITIVE 5 (ABI5), thereby regulating its expression, and stimulate HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. The results indicate that HY5/HYH and RSM1 may converge on the ABI5 promoter and independently or dependently regulate ABI5 expression and ABI5-downstream ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes, thereby improving plant adaptation to the environment.
Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complex proton pump in the respiratory chain, plays a crucial role in cellular energy metabolism by linking electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Defects in complex I have been implicated in various degenerative disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and biological aging. Recent X-ray structural analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic complex I revealed that the redox reactions occur in the hydrophilic peripheral arm of the L-shaped molecule, far from the membrane domain. This suggests that the proton pumping within the membrane arm of complex I is driven indirectly through long-range conformational coupling. However, the molecular mechanism and the number, identity, and localization of the pump-sites remain unclear.

To investigate this, researchers deleted the gene for a small accessory subunit of the Yarrowia complex I, resulting in a stable subcomplex (nb8mΔ) that lacks the distal part of the membrane domain. Analysis of the subunit composition of the holo and subcomplex revealed that two subunits (ND4 and ND5) with homology to bacterial Mrp-type Na+/H+ antiporters were missing in nb8mΔ. Despite this, nb8mΔ still pumped protons at half the stoichiometry of the complete enzyme. These findings suggest that the membrane arm of complex I harbors two functionally distinct pump modules connected in series by a long helical transmission element.
Researchers investigated the effect of febrile temperatures on the binding affinity of antibodies to malarial and dengue antigens. They used Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to measure the binding affinity of specific monoclonal antibodies to these antigens at different temperatures: 37°C (physiological temperature), 40°C (febrile temperature), and 42°C (pathophysiological temperature). The results showed that the binding affinity of the antibodies to the antigens increased significantly at 40°C compared to 37°C or 42°C. This increase in affinity was observed for both malarial and dengue antigens. The researchers also found that thermal equilibration of the protein partners prior to measurement further increased their binding affinity. This suggests that fever may play a positive role in modulating the immune response to infection by enhancing the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens. The study highlights the potential benefits of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein affinity, particularly for samples with limited availability. The findings have implications for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for infectious diseases caused by malarial and dengue viruses.
Researchers have investigated how actomyosin-based cortical flow, a fundamental process in cellular morphogenesis, is controlled by local remodeling of cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors. They developed a computational model that incorporates minimal requirements for contractile stress production and dissipation, including asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links, and filament turnover. The model predicts that filament turnover is necessary to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady-state flow in response to external stress. Steady-state stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τm, then decreases with lifetime above τm. Effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τc, and then becomes independent of filament lifetime and sharply dependent on cross-link dynamics. These dependencies define multiple regimes of steady-state flow. When filament lifetimes are shorter than both τc and τm, the dependencies of effective viscosity and steady-state stress on filament turnover cancel each other, resulting in flow speed being insensitive to filament turnover and showing a simple dependence on motor activity and cross-link dynamics. The study provides a framework for understanding how animal cells control cortical flow through local control of network remodeling. The findings suggest that local interactions among actin filaments and myosin motors are sufficient to drive macroscopic contraction of disordered networks in vitro, supporting a mechanism based on asymmetrical filament compliance and filament buckling.
Researchers have identified a genetic locus, GSQ11, in Arabidopsis thaliana that confers sugar insensitivity in seedlings. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed on a Col/C24 F2 population, and GSQ11 was mapped to the ANAC060 gene. Allelism tests and transgenic complementation confirmed that GSQ11 lies within ANAC060. The Col ANAC060 allele was found to be dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele and conferred sugar insensitivity. Genomic and mRNA analyses revealed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Col ANAC060 that affects splicing patterns, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the transmembrane domain (TMD) present in the C24 ANAC060 protein. This truncated protein is localized to the nucleus and is found in approximately 12% of natural Arabidopsis accessions. The expression of GSQ11/ANAC060 is induced by glucose in a process that requires abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and transient expression analysis showed that ABI4 directly binds to the GSQ11/ANAC060 promoter to activate transcription. Interestingly, Col ANAC060 reduced ABA sensitivity and Glc-induced ABA accumulation, and ABI4 expression was also reduced in Col ANAC060 lines. This suggests that the sugar-ABA signaling cascade induces ANAC060 expression, but the truncated Col ANAC060 protein attenuates ABA induction and ABA signaling, resulting in sugar insensitivity.
Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that can form biofilms and exhibit various motility behaviors. c-di-GMP is a second messenger molecule that regulates numerous cellular functions, including the transition from planktonic cells to biofilm communities. To understand how c-di-GMP signaling achieves specificity, the study focused on the HptB regulatory cascade, which controls biofilm formation, motility, and chemotaxis in P. aeruginosa. The researchers discovered that the diguanylate cyclase HsbD interacts with the HptB pathway to regulate these behaviors. HsbD is a c-di-GMP synthase that produces c-di-GMP, which in turn affects the activity of the HptB pathway. The study found that HsbD and another c-di-GMP synthase, SadC, have distinct roles in the HptB-dependent regulation of biofilm formation and motility. While SadC is involved in biofilm formation and hyper-swarming, HsbD affects swimming and twitching motility. The researchers propose that HsbD acts locally at the cell pole and that the two c-di-GMP synthases intersect within the same global regulatory network, the Gac/Rsm cascade, in a hierarchical order. This study provides an example of how c-di-GMP signaling gains output specificity in P. aeruginosa and sheds light on the evolution of c-di-GMP signaling in bacteria. The findings suggest that the rewiring of c-di-GMP signaling into the HptB cascade relies on the interaction between HsbD and HsbA, an anti-anti-sigma factor, and the control of HsbD's dynamic localization at the cell poles.
Researchers investigated how humans learn and generalize visuomotor mappings, which are associations between visual cues and motor responses. Participants performed a rapid target-pointing task while visual feedback was manipulated to require different visuomotor mappings depending on the target shape. The target shapes were morphed between spiky and circular shapes, and participants learned to associate each shape with a specific visuomotor mapping. After training, participants were tested on novel target shapes that had not been learned previously.

The results showed that participants applied the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that was most similar to the current one, consistent with a Bayesian learning model. This model predicts that learning should slow down with increased numbers of training pairs, which was confirmed by the results. The study found a good correspondence between the Bayesian learning model and the empirical results, suggesting that this model may be a possible mechanism for learning multiple visuomotor mappings.

The study also investigated whether participants could explicitly extract the linear relationship between target shape and visuomotor mapping and generalize accordingly. However, the results showed that learning the associations required explicit awareness of the cues' role, and participants applied the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that was most similar to the current one. This suggests that the learning process is more complex than a simple linear relationship between shape and mapping. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how humans learn and generalize visuomotor mappings, and may have applications in fields such as robotics and rehabilitation.
Researchers investigated the relationship between climbing fiber bursts and olivary sub-threshold oscillations in the inferior olivary nucleus, a key input to the cerebellum. Climbing fibers transmit information from the inferior olivary nucleus to the cerebellum and are thought to play a role in timing motor commands and motor learning. Previous studies suggested that the size of the climbing fiber burst is related to the phase of the olivary cell's sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation. A three-compartmental model of an inferior olivary cell was used to explore the factors determining the size of the climbing fiber burst. The results showed that the phase-dependency of the burst size is present but limited, and that charge flow between the soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the climbing fiber burst. The study also found that phenomena such as cell ensemble synchrony can affect the climbing fiber burst size through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells. The findings suggest that the inferior olivary nucleus may be able to transmit more information per event than previously thought, potentially allowing for a coarse, low-resolution encoding of temporal information. The study's results have implications for understanding the electrophysiological properties of the inferior olivary nucleus and its role in the cerebellar system.
Researchers have developed a computational model of liver iron metabolism to better understand how the liver regulates iron levels in the body. Iron is essential for life, but excessive levels can be toxic, leading to various diseases. The liver plays a crucial role in maintaining safe iron levels through a complex biochemical network involving iron absorption, transport, storage, and regulation. A peptide hormone called hepcidin is secreted by the liver to regulate systemic iron metabolism.

The model was constructed based on known mechanisms of regulation and kinetic properties obtained from several publications. It was validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data and was able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. The model was used to simulate a time course of iron metabolism following an oral dose of iron, which recreated the dynamics and time scale of the system's response to iron challenge. Additionally, a disease state simulation of haemochromatosis was created by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene mutation, providing a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease.

This model provides a comprehensive description of liver iron regulation and can be used to elucidate the link from genotype to phenotype, as demonstrated with hereditary haemochromatosis. The model's predictions about liver iron regulation should be investigated further, and it can be used to identify valuable drug targets and design experiments to improve our understanding of this system. This computational model constitutes a clinical translational approach, integrating data from multiple sources to improve our understanding of human iron metabolism.
Researchers have developed a computational model to simulate the process of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC is a critical structure that regulates the movement of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. The model takes into account the hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins (kaps) and Phe-Gly (FG) repeat domains, which play a key role in the transport process. The researchers used Brownian dynamics simulations to study the movement of cargo complexes through the NPC.

The model predicts that the first-passage time for a 15-nanometer cargo complex is approximately 2.6 milliseconds, with an inverse Gaussian distribution. The simulations also show that the cargo complex is primarily attached to the channel wall and interacts with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel. The model suggests that the kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, allowing for efficient translocation through the NPC. Additionally, the researchers found that almost all eight hydrophobic binding spots on kap-β are occupied simultaneously during transport.

The study also investigated the role of cytoplasmic filaments in the selectivity barrier of the NPC. The results show that cytoplasmic filaments-deficient NPCs have a high degree of permeability to inert cargos, indicating that these filaments play a crucial role in the selectivity barrier. The model provides new insights into the molecular events that occur during NCT and can be used as a foundation for future studies on this complex process.
Determining the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for nonhuman primate (NHP) models is crucial for testing interventions against human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. A limiting dose challenge model, where only a fraction of animals become infected, is often used to minimize animal use while achieving statistically significant and biologically meaningful results. However, this approach requires careful titration of the infectious agent to avoid false negative or false positive results.

To address this challenge, a new protocol has been developed to determine the dose of pathogen that infects 50% of the time, known as the AID50. This protocol minimizes the number of animals and resources required while providing an estimate of the AID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value. The method involves iterative exposures of cohorts of animals to a dilution of the pathogen stock, adjusting the dose between each round to achieve 50% infection.

The protocol is generalizable to any pathogen and animal model, but is most critical for NHP models where ethical considerations mandate minimization of animal use. On average, the protocol requires 15 animals, 3 phase 1 rounds, and results in an estimate of the AID50 within 40% of the true value. By following this protocol, investigators can efficiently determine the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for NHP models, reducing the need for excessive animal use and resources.
Researchers studied the auditory neuron AN2 in crickets to understand how sensory systems adapt to changes in their environment. They found that the AN2 neuron adapts to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli by shifting its response curve towards higher stimulus intensities, with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery. This means that the neuron reduces its response to low-intensity sounds.

The researchers tested whether this adaptation improves the representation of the signal by comparing it to two competing hypotheses: infomax and selective coding. Infomax predicts that the neuron should maximize the information conveyed about the entire signal range, while selective coding suggests that the neuron should enhance "foreground" signals and suppress "background" signals.

To test these hypotheses, the researchers presented the AN2 neuron with signals with two or three peaks in their amplitude distributions, mimicking auditory scenes with multiple signals. They found that adaptation reduces the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals, contradicting the infomax principle. Additionally, the response curve changes were not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis, as the amount of information conveyed about the loudest part of the signal remained nearly constant, and less information was transmitted about signals with lower intensity.

These findings suggest that the adaptation mechanism in the AN2 neuron does not follow either of the two proposed principles, and further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of sensory adaptation in the cricket auditory system.
Researchers have investigated the role of polybasic domains in the prion protein (PrP) in the propagation of prion diseases. Prions are infectious proteins that can cause fatal neurodegenerative disorders, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Previous studies suggested that polybasic domains on the prion protein (PrPC) interact with the disease-associated conformer (PrPSc) to facilitate prion propagation. To further explore this interaction, researchers created mutant prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains and expressed them in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. These mutant proteins were used as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) reactions, which mimic the process of prion propagation.

The results showed that prions lacking the central polybasic domain (ΔC-PrPSc) were formed after several rounds of sPMCA. Surprisingly, these ΔC-PrPSc prions could bind to and induce the conversion of mutant prion proteins lacking polybasic domains into PrPSc molecules. However, ΔC-PrPSc prions displayed reduced or absent biological infectivity compared to wild-type PrPSc, despite their ability to seed sPMCA reactions in normal mouse brain homogenate. This suggests that the interaction between PrPC and PrPSc through polybasic domains may be necessary for generating prion infectivity. The findings indicate that the propagation of PrPSc molecules may not rely on a single mechanism, and that the interaction between PrPC and PrPSc through polybasic domains may be required for prion infectivity.
Researchers have developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify animal behavioral strategies from behavioral time-series data. This framework was applied to the thermotactic behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a type of nematode worm, to understand how they make decisions in response to temperature changes. The study found that fed C. elegans worms use both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative to navigate a thermal gradient, employing two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). DM involves efficiently reaching specific temperatures, while IM involves moving along a constant temperature. In contrast, starved C. elegans worms use only the absolute temperature to avoid the cultivation temperature. The researchers also investigated the neural basis of these strategies by applying the IRL framework to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. The results suggest that the IRL-based approach can identify animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and could be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making in other organisms. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the IRL framework in understanding animal behavior and decision-making processes.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of Chrysochromulina tobin, a type of haptophyte algae, and analyzed its transcriptome over a 24-hour light/dark cycle. Haptophytes play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to carbon sequestration, forming harmful blooms, and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms. Despite their importance, the nuclear genome of only one haptophyte, Emiliania huxleyi, has been previously sequenced.

The Chrysochromulina tobin genome is small, compact, and encodes approximately 16,777 genes, with a high proportion of protein-coding genes. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression over the circadian photoperiod. The genome also harbors a unique hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene complex and encodes potential anti-microbial peptides and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic compound extrusion.

The study also identified a new haptophyte xanthorhodopsin and two "red" RuBisCO activases shared across many algal lineages. The Chrysochromulina tobin genome provides new insights into the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes. The findings have implications for understanding the fundamental metabolic processes associated with harmful algal bloom events and may support commercial endeavors such as aquaculture feed stocks, nutraceuticals, plastics, or biofuel production.
Research has shown that triple-negative breast cancers, which lack the clinical markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2, often belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype and are associated with defective Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways. Mouse genetic studies have demonstrated that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution. Furthermore, the concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors are poorly differentiated and exhibit histologic features common among human Brca1-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses reveal that the tumors share attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, two molecular subtypes encompassed by the broader, triple-negative class defined by clinical markers.

The study found that concomitant inactivation of all three tumor suppressor pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, malignant carcinomas. Brca1 inactivation accelerated tumorigenesis compared to TP tumors, but no statistical difference was observed between chromosomal copy number transitions in tumors with or without Brca1. Mouse models that mimic the complexity of triple-negative breast cancer will be invaluable tools for defining the diverse cellular biology and behavior of these tumors and for rigorously triaging new drug candidates. The study demonstrates that mammary tumors caused by inactivation of the pRb family of proteins, together with Brca1 and p53 inactivation, mimic several aspects of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer, including rapid tumor progression, poor differentiation, distant metastasis, necrosis, metaplasia, and genomic instability.
Aedes aegypti (L.) is the primary vector of dengue, a major arboviral infection worldwide. To prevent and control dengue transmission, accurate predictions of vector populations are essential. Aedes aegypti primarily develops in artificial water-holding containers, and most adult mosquitoes do not disperse over long distances. Containers in areas with high development site density are more likely to be used as oviposition sites and produce adult mosquitoes at a higher rate.

A study conducted in rural Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, from 2004 to 2007, collected 84,840 samples of water-holding containers to estimate model parameters. Regression modeling was used to assess the effect of larval development site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity. The results showed that the number of suitable larval development sites and their density in the environment were the primary determinants of the distribution and abundance of Aedes aegypti pupae.

The study found that the productivity of most container types increased significantly as habitat density increased. An ecological approach, accounting for development site density, is essential for predicting Aedes aegypti population levels and developing efficient vector control programs. The study's findings suggest that incorporating development site density into vector control efforts, along with research on the ecology within larval development sites, will lead to a more cohesive understanding of Aedes aegypti population dynamics and contribute to the design of increasingly effective vector interventions.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the conserved Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) plays a crucial role in regulating phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental cues and feeding state. Research has shown that TORC2 acts in the intestine to modulate neuronal expression of the daf-7 TGF-β and daf-28 insulin-like peptide genes, which reflect bacterial-diet dependent feeding status. This integration of food signals with external cues is essential for the regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression and the execution of appropriate behavioral and developmental decisions.

During larval development, pheromone, bacterial food, and temperature regulate the expression of daf-7 and daf-28 in sensory neurons, promoting a binary decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. In the adult, TORC2 also acts in the intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging behaviors via a PDF-2/PDFR-1 neuropeptide signaling-dependent pathway.

Genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with these traits have been identified. These findings suggest that TORC2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding state information from the gut to the brain, contributing to the modulation of neuronal function by internal state. The research highlights the importance of TORC2 in regulating phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental cues and feeding state in C. elegans.
Researchers have identified clusters of genes that are upregulated in pluripotent cells, including embryonic stem (ES) cells and primordial germ cells. These genes are involved in various biological processes such as transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. A novel computational algorithm, CompMoby, was developed to systematically predict short DNA motifs that regulate gene expression. CompMoby combines analyses of aligned and non-aligned sequences between different genomes with a probabilistic segmentation model. The algorithm was used to identify conserved overrepresented motifs in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells. These motifs were found to be preferentially active in undifferentiated mouse ES and embryonic germ cells in a sequence-specific manner and can act as enhancers in the context of an endogenous promoter. Importantly, the activity of these motifs is conserved in human ES cells. The transcription factor NF-Y was identified as a regulator of gene expression in ES cells that is required for their proliferation. NF-Y specifically binds to one of the motifs and is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells and suggests that this systematic approach can be broadly applied to understanding transcriptional networks in mammalian species. The findings have implications for understanding the transcriptional regulatory networks that underlie early mammalian embryogenesis and ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency.
Researchers have characterized the structure of a complex between the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus. The complex, consisting of a variant of N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues (NΔ21) and a 60-amino acid peptide of P (P60), was crystallized in a decameric circular form and solved at 3.0 Å resolution. The structure reveals how the molecular recognition element (MoRE) of P binds to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization.

Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy experiments confirmed the binding of the MoRE and showed that the flanking regions of P remain flexible in the complex. The structure of the complex suggests a mechanism for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis. NMR spectroscopy also confirmed that the MoRE of P binds to N in solution as in the crystal structure, and the regions of P flanking the MoRE remain flexible in the complex.

The study demonstrates that the reconstituted NΔ21-P60 complex is a suitable model for the viral N0-P complex. The crystal structure and NMR spectroscopy experiments show that the MoRE of P, which adopts a stable conformation upon binding to N, includes residues 6 to 35 and corresponds closely to the fragment previously identified as essential and sufficient for maintaining N in a soluble form. The structure of the decameric form of the NΔ21-P60 complex reveals the molecular mechanisms by which the N0-binding MoRE of P attaches to N.
Researchers investigated the role of gap junctions in the fly visual system, specifically in the vertical system network, which plays a key role in visual processing. Gap junctions are electrical synapses that allow for direct communication between neurons. The study found that the presence of axonal gap junctions enables the vertical system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation of the fly's ego motion within 10 milliseconds of visual input onset. This encoding efficiency is near-optimal, meaning it approaches the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input. The study also found that a subset of triplets of vertical system cells, connected via gap junctions, encodes motion more efficiently than the entire network and is robust to a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. This efficient encoding is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. The study suggests that gap junctions only impact the system's readout, while maintaining the dendritic input intact, indicating that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be more complex than previously thought. The findings provide new insights into how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli and may encourage exploration of gap junctions as a common mechanism for improving information transmission in other neuronal systems.
Researchers have identified human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) as a cellular receptor for Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a major causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children. EV71 has also been linked to various neurological diseases, including fatal cases in large outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region. PSGL-1 is a sialomucin expressed on the surface of leukocytes that serves as a high-affinity counterreceptor for selectins and mediates leukocyte rolling on the endothelium. The interaction between PSGL-1 and P-selectin requires sulfation of at least one of three clustered tyrosines and an adjacent O-glycan expressing sialyl Lewis x in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1.

To elucidate the molecular basis of the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction, researchers generated a series of PSGL-1 mutants and identified the post-translational modifications critical for binding of PSGL-1 to EV71. They found that O-glycosylation on T57, which is critical for PSGL-1-selectin interaction, is not necessary for PSGL-1 binding to EV71. In contrast, site-directed mutagenesis at one or more potential tyrosine sulfation sites in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 significantly impaired PSGL-1 binding to EV71. Furthermore, an inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, blocked the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction and inhibited PSGL-1-mediated viral replication of EV71 in Jurkat T cells in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 is critical for EV71 infection.
Researchers investigated the therapeutic potential of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in treating leishmaniasis, a serious global health problem caused by Leishmania parasites. Leishmaniasis can be treated with various agents, but drug toxicity and the emergence of resistant strains limit their effectiveness. The study tested the efficacy of three mTOR inhibitors - rapamycin, GSK-2126458, and KU-0063794 - in controlling infection with Leishmania major in mice. The results showed that treatment with a clinically relevant dose of rapamycin or GSK-2126458 significantly reduced footpad swelling and parasite load in the draining lymph node, while KU-0063794 had no effect. Importantly, rapamycin did not kill the parasites in vitro. The study also found that rapamycin treatment reduced IL-4 production and increased the IFN-γ:IL-4 production ratio, indicating a T helper-type 1 (Th1)-skewed cytokine profile. Additionally, the expression level of CD69, an early activation marker, was enhanced on splenic and lymph node CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in rapamycin-treated mice. These findings suggest that select mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and GSK-2126458, may be used to manage leishmaniasis by modulating the immune response. The study proposes that the adjuvanticity of mTOR inhibitors could also be exploited in vaccination strategies against Leishmania species.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the DNA uptake sequence (DUS) and its receptor, ComP, in the process of natural transformation in Neisseria species. Natural transformation is a process by which bacteria take up free DNA, incorporate it into their genomes, and become genetically altered. To prevent the uptake of foreign DNA, some bacteria preferentially take up their own DNA, which contains specific DUS watermarks. A recent study identified ComP as the DUS receptor in Neisseria species, paving the way for a functional analysis of the DUS-ComP interdependence.

The study found that ComP is essential for transformation, both in the presence and absence of DUS. The inner bases of DUS (positions 7-10) are critical for recognition by ComP and subsequent transformation. Single base mutations in these positions led to impaired interaction with ComP and transformation. Furthermore, naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisseria commensals, differing from DUS by only one or two bases, were found to be similarly impaired for transformation of Neisseria meningitidis.

The study also showed that a ComP homolog from a commensal species specifically binds its cognate DUS variant and mediates DUS-enhanced transformation when expressed in a comP mutant of Neisseria meningitidis. These findings suggest that a similar mechanism is used by all Neisseria species to promote transformation by their own or closely related DNA. This research sheds new light on the molecular events involved in the earliest step of natural transformation and reveals an elegant mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species sharing the same niche.
In fission yeast, cytokinesis requires the coordinated closure of a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and the synthesis of a cell wall structure called the division septum. Research has identified many CAR proteins, but how they interact with septum synthesis enzymes to form the septum remains unclear. A genetic study in fission yeast found that cooperation between the paxillin homolog Pxl1 and the enzyme Bgs1, responsible for linear β(1,3) glucan synthesis and primary septum formation, is essential for stable anchorage of the CAR to the plasma membrane before septation onset and for cleavage furrow formation. Without Pxl1 and Bgs1, the CAR fails to contract and the cell wall overgrows towards the cell lumen without septum formation. The study also found that Pxl1 concentration at the CAR increases during cytokinesis and that this increase depends on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. The absence of Pxl1 is lethal when Cdc15 function is affected, suggesting additional functions for both Pxl1 and Cdc15 proteins. The findings indicate that CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane through Cdc15 and Pxl1, and concomitant Bgs1 activity, are necessary for CAR maintenance and septum formation in fission yeast. The study suggests that Pxl1 and Bgs1 cooperate to maintain the position and integrity of the CAR during cytokinesis and are essential for the synthesis of the entire septum structure.
A recent outbreak of glanders, a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei, occurred in Bahrain. To investigate the outbreak, researchers used high-resolution genotyping and comparative whole-genome sequencing to analyze B. mallei isolates from infected horses and a camel. The results suggest that the outbreak was caused by two different B. mallei strains, indicating multiple introduction events. The isolates from the Bahrain outbreak were compared to samples from a 2004 outbreak in the United Arab Emirates and placed into a broader phylogeographic context using previously published B. mallei data. The analysis revealed that the Bahrain isolates were more closely related to B. mallei from horses in the UAE in 2004 than to other B. mallei strains, suggesting repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources. High-resolution genotyping and whole-genome analysis confirmed the same phylogenetic patterns among the samples. The close relationship between the Dubai/UAE B. mallei populations may indicate a similar geographic origin that has yet to be identified for the infecting strains. The emergence of glanders in Bahrain, combined with global horse trading, poses a new risk for human infections.
A cross-sectional observational study was conducted to investigate the clinical and parasitological features of patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) who did not respond to treatment with meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime). The study included 43 patients from three Colombian Army National reference centers for complicated ACL. The majority of patients (95.4%) were infected with Leishmania braziliensis, and 35% of the isolated parasites showed a significant decrease in in vitro Glucantime susceptibility after previous administration of the medication. The study found a negative correlation between lesion size and in vitro infectivity of the parasite, as well as a negative correlation between lesion size and parasite resistance to Glucantime. Leishmania braziliensis was the main parasite species associated with treatment failure or relapse. The study suggests that the indication of a second round of treatment with pentavalent antimonial derivatives in cases of therapeutic failure of ACL caused by L. braziliensis is debatable. The study's findings highlight the need for further research on the mechanisms of resistance to Glucantime and the development of new treatment strategies for ACL. The study's results also emphasize the importance of species confirmation in the diagnosis and treatment of ACL, as L. braziliensis is more prone to treatment failure than other Leishmania species.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores and the colibactin genotoxin in Escherichia coli. Siderophores are small iron-scavenging molecules, while colibactin is a genotoxin that contributes to the virulence of E. coli. Both pathways require a 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) for their production. Two PPTases, EntD and ClbA, have been identified, with EntD being part of the core genome and ClbA encoded on the pks pathogenicity island. The pks island is associated with the high pathogenicity island (HPI) in highly virulent E. coli strains.

The study found that ClbA can contribute to the synthesis of siderophores, including enterobactin, yersiniabactin, and salmochelins. Inactivation of both EntD and ClbA abolished the virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) in a mouse sepsis model. The presence of either functional EntD or ClbA was required for the survival of ExPEC in vivo. This suggests that ClbA is a promiscuous PPTase that can contribute to the synthesis of both the genotoxin and siderophores. The association of the pks island with HPI in highly virulent E. coli strains may have been selected because of this ability. The study highlights the complex regulatory interaction of various virulence features in E. coli and identifies potential targets for anti-virulence therapy strategies.
Researchers have developed a new probabilistic model for calculating the probability of a multiple sequence alignment given a phylogenetic tree and an evolutionary model. This model accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, which are not considered in widely used phylogenetic models. The new model is based on a continuous Markov process and assumes that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time.

The model was applied to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip, which uses the Felsenstein peeling algorithm to efficiently calculate the probability of an ungapped multiple alignment. The extended program, dnamlε, was tested on simulated data and real ribosomal RNA alignments using standard benchmarking methods and a new "concordance test" benchmark. The results showed that dnamlε improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm.

The new model has the potential to integrate evolutionary modeling into probabilistic models used for other sequence analysis problems, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs). This could improve the accuracy of phylogenetic tree inference and other sequence analysis tasks.
Researchers investigated how the immune system responds to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection in human skin. They found that Langerhans cells (LCs), a type of immune cell in the epidermis, are initially infected with HSV. These infected LCs then undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death, and are taken up by dermal dendritic cells (DCs) in the dermis. The dermal DCs, specifically BDCA3+ and DC-SIGN+ cells, are thought to play a crucial role in presenting HSV antigens to T cells in the lymph nodes and dermis.

The study used human foreskin explants, biopsies from initial genital herpes lesions, and isolated skin cells to examine the interaction between LCs and dermal DCs. The results showed that infected LCs form clusters with dermal DCs in the dermis, and that the dermal DCs take up HSV-expressing LC fragments. This process, known as viral antigen relay, allows the immune system to recognize and respond to HSV infection.

The study suggests that targeting dermal DCs with mucosal or intradermal immunization may be an effective way to prevent HSV infection. The researchers also found that the inner foreskin model is a useful tool for studying the initial interactions between epithelia-tropic viruses and human skin. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of HSV infection and the role of dermal DCs in the immune response.
Researchers studied the behavior of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in mouse macrophages infected with two species of Leishmania parasites, L. major and L. amazonensis. PVs are membrane-bound compartments that form around the parasites, allowing them to survive and replicate within the host cell. The study used multidimensional imaging to observe the formation and remodeling of PVs in live cells, providing new insights into the biology of Leishmania infection.

The researchers found that PVs formed around L. major amastigotes were typically small and tight-fitting, while those formed around L. amazonensis amastigotes were larger and more dynamic. They observed that L. major PVs underwent fission, a process where the PV splits into two smaller compartments, while L. amazonensis PVs underwent homotypic fusion, where two PVs merge to form a larger one. The study also found that the number of acidic vesicles in the host cell decreased during PV fission or enlargement, suggesting that these vesicles contribute to PV biogenesis.

The researchers used a fluorescent probe called Lysotracker to visualize acidic vesicles in the host cell and found that approximately 50 acidic vesicles were consumed during intracellular infection, contributing a hypothetical volume of 30 micrometers cubed to Leishmania PVs. This study provides new information on the dynamic behavior of Leishmania PVs and sheds light on the mechanisms of Leishmania infection, which could be useful for understanding other intracellular microorganisms.
Researchers investigated how chromatin structure influences the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair in the chicken B cell line DT40. Immunoglobulin genes in DT40 undergo regulated sequence diversification by gene conversion, a process templated by pseudogene donors. The study found that the immunoglobulin Vλ pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. To directly demonstrate the importance of chromatin structure for gene conversion, the researchers used a regulatable experimental system in which the heterochromatin protein HP1 was tethered to polymerized lactose operators integrated within the pseudo-Vλ donor array. Tethered HP1 diminished histone acetylation within the pseudo-Vλ array and altered the outcome of Vλ diversification, resulting in nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations. This suggests that chromatin structure regulates homologous-directed repair. The study also found that histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences. The results have practical implications for developing strategies that harness a cell's capacity for homology-dependent repair to promote gene therapy. The study's findings suggest that permissive structure at the donor will be an important design parameter in developing donor genes for therapeutic applications.
The cerebellum plays a crucial role in adjusting motor behavior to meet the demands of a given situation. Traditionally, it is believed that cerebellum-based motor learning is guided by the difference between desired and actual behavior, or error information. This error information is thought to induce lasting changes in parallel fiber synapses on Purkinje cells, which in turn mediate behavioral adjustments. However, the role of olivary climbing fibers, which connect with Purkinje cells, has been a subject of debate. Climbing fibers are believed to convey information on instant errors needed for synaptic modification, but not to contribute to error memory.

Recent studies have challenged this concept, including a previous study on short-term saccadic adaptation, which observed patterns of complex spikes (CS) that contradict the assumptions of the traditional model. In this study, researchers used a random error saccadic adaptation paradigm to investigate the role of climbing fibers in cerebellum-based motor learning. The results show that CS not only reflect the error at the time of its occurrence but also reverberate later, before a new manifestation of the behavior. This suggests that climbing fibers may play a more significant role in error memory than previously thought. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of cerebellum-based motor learning and the role of climbing fibers in this process.
Researchers have identified a potential therapeutic target for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons and the presence of inclusions containing the protein TDP-43. Using a yeast model of ALS, the study found that overexpression of TDP-43 leads to cell shape changes and reduced ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of a reporter construct. However, overexpression of the Hsp40 chaperone Sis1 was shown to reduce TDP-43's effects on toxicity, cell shape, and proteolysis. This protective effect was also observed in primary rodent cortical neurons when the mammalian Sis1 homologue, DNAJB1, was overexpressed. The study suggests that Sis1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS and related conditions characterized by cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of DNA/RNA binding proteins such as TDP-43. The researchers propose that overexpression of Sis1 or its homologues may be a potential means of extending neuronal survival in ALS. The study's findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ALS and highlight the potential of Hsp40 chaperones as therapeutic targets for the disease.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the parasite load and molecular diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of Brazil. A total of 65 patients were recruited, with 35 (53.8%) testing positive for the parasite using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old, with a median of 20.05 parasite equivalents per milliliter (par.Eq./mL). The parasite load ranged from 0.12 to 153.66 par.Eq./mL, with a median of 2.54 par.Eq./mL for all positive patients.

The researchers used a multilocus conventional PCR and qPCR approach to genotype the parasite and identify the discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi. Of the patients with positive qPCR, 80% were able to identify the DTU, with 40% infected with TcVI, 17.1% with TcII, and 14.3% with a mixed infection of TcVI and TcII. Two patients were infected with TcV, and one patient was co-infected with TcIII and TcVI. The parasite load was higher in patients infected with TcII compared to those infected with TcVI.

The study highlights the importance of age and DTU in determining the parasite load and clinical manifestations of Chagas disease. The results contribute to the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and suggest that TcII infection is associated with higher parasite loads and a lower frequency of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC).
A study on bat rabies in Guatemala was conducted between 2009 and 2011 as part of a larger pathogen detection program. A total of 672 bats from 31 species were sampled and tested for rabies virus (RABV). The overall prevalence of RABV detection among all collected bats was low, at 0.3%. However, two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) were found to be infected with RABV, with viral antigens detected and infectious virus isolated from their brains, as well as from oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene showed that the two viruses were 100% identical, while sequencing of the glycoprotein gene revealed a single non-synonymous substitution. The two vampire bat RABV isolates were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody, indicating exposure to the virus. The proportion of seropositive bats varied significantly across trophic guilds, suggesting complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RABV perpetuation. This study is the first to report and isolate RABV from bats in Guatemala, highlighting the need for novel strategies to prevent and control bat-associated zoonoses in tropical regions.
Researchers investigated the role of A-type lamins in herpesviral DNA targeting and heterochromatin modulation. They found that A-type lamins play a crucial role in the downregulation of heterochromatin and the activation of gene expression. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA initiates replication in replication compartments near the inner edge of the nucleus, where histones are excluded. In cells lacking A-type lamins (Lmna−/−), viral replication compartments are reduced in size and fail to target to the nuclear periphery. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies showed that HSV DNA is associated with increased heterochromatin in Lmna−/− cells. This suggests that A-type lamins are necessary for targeting the viral genome and reducing heterochromatin on viral promoters during lytic infection. The study found that lamin A/C is required for viral gene expression, DNA replication, and growth, with the greatest effect on viral replication at low multiplicity of infection. The results indicate that the nuclear lamina can serve as a molecular scaffold for DNA genomes and the protein complexes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin histone modifications. The study provides evidence that lamin-dependent targeting of the HSV genome to the nuclear periphery is associated with a reduction of heterochromatin on viral lytic genes. The findings suggest that the nuclear lamina plays a role in providing a platform for recruitment of viral DNA and chromatin-modifying enzymes that keep the viral genome in an active chromatin conformation.
Researchers have investigated the structure and function of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex in hydrogenosomes, a type of mitochondria found in the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. Hydrogenosomes are metabolically specialized anaerobic organelles that are thought to have originated from proteobacterial endosymbionts. The TOM complex plays a crucial role in the import of proteins into mitochondria, but its structure and function have been poorly understood in many eukaryotic lineages.

The study found that the TOM complex in T. vaginalis, called TvTOM, forms a translocation channel to conduct protein import into hydrogenosomes. TvTOM is composed of four subunits, including two tail-anchored proteins, Tom36 and Tom46, which can bind hydrogenosomal preproteins and function as receptors. A third subunit, Tom22-like protein, has a short cis domain and a conserved Tom22 transmembrane segment, but lacks a trans domain. The fourth protein, hydrogenosomal outer membrane protein 19 (Homp19), has no known homology.

Electron microscopy revealed that TvTOM forms three pores and has an unconventional skull-like shape. The study suggests that the triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LECA), while receptors responsible for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages. The findings provide new insights into the evolution and function of the TOM complex in eukaryotic cells.
Researchers have investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. They used a technique called eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) analysis to study how genetic variations affect the expression of genes in these cells. This approach allowed them to identify specific genetic variants associated with autoimmune diseases, including a trans-acting regulatory locus at chromosome 12q13.2 that contains a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the RPS26 gene.

The study found that a common missense variant in the IL27 gene, which is associated with type 1 diabetes, results in decreased functional activity of the protein and reduced expression levels of downstream genes IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. This suggests that the variant may confer protection against type 1 diabetes by inhibiting the expression of these genes. In contrast, the study also found that IL-27 may promote autoimmunity towards pancreatic islets via the upregulation of the STAT1 pathway.

The researchers also identified a distinct lineage of CD4+ T cells, regulatory T cells, which play a central role in controlling the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Genome-wide association studies have previously identified thousands of SNPs associated with various immune-related diseases. The study's eQTL mapping in purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells revealed multiple effects on the regulation of genes associated with autoimmune diseases, highlighting the importance of cell-type specificity in understanding the genetic regulation of the immune system.
A qualitative study was conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to investigate community perspectives on the treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. The study aimed to understand the socio-cultural and economic factors that hinder the uptake of screening and treatment of HAT in the DRC. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with current and former HAT patients, healthcare providers, and program managers of the national HAT control program in the Bandundu and Kasaï Oriental provinces, where HAT prevalence is high.

The study found that community members and healthcare providers adhere to strict prohibitions after HAT treatment, including avoiding work, sexual intercourse, hot food, and walking in the sun for six months. These prohibitions are believed to prevent serious and potentially deadly complications, but are not evidence-based and were originally intended to mitigate the adverse effects of the outdated melarsoprol regimen. However, with the introduction of safer and more effective treatment options, such as nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT), these restrictions may no longer be necessary.

The study highlights the importance of addressing community perceptions and attitudes towards HAT treatment to improve control efforts. The prohibitions associated with HAT treatment are a significant barrier to community participation in screening and treatment activities, compromising the national control program's ability to achieve its objectives. Understanding the origins and rationale behind these prohibitions is essential to develop effective HAT control strategies in the DRC.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 45 villages of Al-Gureisha locality in eastern Gedaref State, Sudan, to estimate the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The survey, conducted between May and June 2011, involved door-to-door interviews with 17,702 households, representing a population of 94,369 inhabitants. The crude mortality rate over the mean recall period of 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people per day, with VL being a possible or probable cause for 19% of all deaths. The VL-specific mortality rate was estimated at 0.9/1000 per year.

The overall incidence of VL over the past year was 7.0/1000 persons per year, or 7.9/1000 per year when deaths possibly or probably due to VL were included. A total of 12.5% (11,943/95,609) of the population reported a past VL treatment episode. The survey found that active VL case detection had a very low yield in this specific setting with adequate access to care, suggesting that it may not be the priority intervention to enhance control in similar contexts.

Visceral leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania donovani and L. infantum, transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. It mainly affects areas in South Asia and Eastern Africa, with Sudan being the most affected country. The disease is characterized by persistent fever, splenomegaly, weight loss, and lymphadenopathies, and can lead to post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a skin rash that appears after treatment and can last for months or years.
Researchers investigated the relationship between DNA supercoiling and transcription elongation in bacterial chromosomes. They found that the supercoil density (σ) of Escherichia coli (E. coli) chromosomes is 15% higher than that of Salmonella enterica. The supercoil density is composed of two forms: diffusible supercoil density (σD) and constrained supercoil density (σC). The study used a 9 kb "supercoil sensor" to monitor supercoil density and transcription elongation rates in Salmonella strains. The results showed that RNA transcription causes negative supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Topoisomerase I (Topo I) relaxes excess upstream supercoiling, while gyrase replenishes downstream supercoil losses to maintain an equilibrium state. Mutations in the gyrase gene (gyrB) caused significant supercoil losses, ranging from 30% to a total loss of σD at most chromosome locations. These losses were influenced by transcription, as adding rifampicin (Rif) caused supercoil density to rebound throughout the chromosome. The study also found a link between RNA polymerase elongation speed and gyrase turnover, suggesting that bacteria with fast growth rates may generate higher supercoil densities than slow-growing species. The results indicate that the mean supercoil density of Salmonella DNA is determined by a mechanism that links the catalytic efficiency of gyrase to the elongation rate of transcription.
Leishmania amazonensis, a protozoan parasite, replicates within parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in host cells, which share characteristics with late endosomes and lysosomes. Research has shown that the size of PVs expands significantly during infections, but the impact of PV size on parasite intracellular survival was unknown. This study found that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate the transcription of the LYST/Beige gene, which regulates lysosome size. Mutations in LYST/Beige led to further PV expansion and enhanced L. amazonensis replication, while overexpression of LYST/Beige resulted in small PVs that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of LYST/Beige overexpressing cells with vacuolin-1 reversed this phenotype, expanding PVs and promoting parasite growth. In contrast, E-64d reduced PV size in LYST-Beige mutant cells and inhibited L. amazonensis replication. The study suggests that enlarged PVs protect parasites from oxidative damage, as inhibition of nitric oxide synthase had no effect on L. amazonensis viability within large PVs, but enhanced their growth within LYST/Beige-induced small PVs. These findings indicate that the upregulation of LYST/Beige in infected cells functions as a host innate response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV volume and inhibiting intracellular survival.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms underlying psychomotor retardation, a condition characterized by motor and cognitive impairment, using a zebrafish model. The study focused on the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), an X-linked disorder associated with mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene, which plays a crucial role in thyroid hormone (TH) transport. Previous studies using MCT8 knockout mice failed to replicate the neurological and behavioral symptoms of AHDS patients, despite altered TH levels. To address this discrepancy, the researchers generated an MCT8 mutant (mct8−/−) zebrafish using zinc-finger nuclease-mediated targeted gene editing. The mct8−/− larvae exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to light and dark transitions, and increased sleep time. High-throughput behavioral assays revealed altered expression of myelin-related genes and neuron-specific deficiencies in circuit formation. Live imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses in mct8−/− larvae showed reduced filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons, as well as decreased synaptic density in motor neurons. Treatment with TH analogs that can enter cells in the absence of MCT8 restored myelin and axon outgrowth deficiencies in mct8−/− larvae. These findings suggest that MCT8 regulates neural circuit assembly and mediates sensory and motor control of behavioral performance. The study proposes that early administration of TH analogs may reduce neurological damage in AHDS patients.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread virus that primarily affects newborns and individuals with weakened immune systems. The virus uses distinct entry pathways to infect various cell types, involving different forms of the gH/gL glycoprotein complex. Research has shown that the minimal fusion machinery required for cell-cell fusion involves only the gH/gL and gB glycoproteins. A recent study has demonstrated that HCMV gB and gH/gL form a stable complex early in the virus's life cycle, even in the absence of other viral proteins. This complex includes up to 16-50% of the total gH/gL in HCMV virus particles. The study also found that gH/gL can interact with gB mutants that are unable to mediate cell-cell fusion, suggesting that the interaction between gB and gH/gL is not dependent on the fusion activity of gB. These findings have significant implications for models of herpesvirus entry, which suggest that gH/gL interacts with gB to mediate membrane fusion. The study's results provide direct evidence for this interaction, showing that HCMV gB and gH/gL form stable complexes that are incorporated into virions without the need for receptor binding or membrane fusion.
Researchers have identified a new gene, Gimap3, that plays a crucial role in regulating the segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in leukocytes. Mitochondrial DNA sequence variants can lead to disease, and understanding how they segregate is essential for understanding disease onset and severity. The study used a heteroplasmic mouse model to demonstrate that Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, is a critical regulator of mtDNA segregation in leukocytes. Gimap3 is also important for T cell development and survival, suggesting that leukocyte survival may be a key factor in the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and in modulating human mitochondrial diseases.

The study found that Gimap3 regulates the rate of mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues and that segregation of mtDNA haplotypes in mouse hematopoietic tissues is a complex genetic trait regulated with age but independent of mtDNA copy number. Analysis of the Gimap3 protein sequence did not reveal a direct physical interaction with mtDNA, suggesting that a cell-specific context or pathway is required to alter mtDNA segregation. The study also found that mitochondrial genome copy number regulation has been proposed to influence the segregation of mtDNA haplotypes and human mtDNA mutations. Overall, the discovery of Gimap3 as a regulator of mtDNA segregation in leukocytes provides new insights into the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and has implications for understanding human mitochondrial diseases.
Researchers studied the incubation period of Buruli ulcer (BU), a skin and soft-tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, in Victoria, Australia. The incubation period is the time between exposure to the bacteria and the onset of symptoms. The study found that the mean incubation period of BU in Victoria is approximately 4-5 months, with a range of 2-9 months. This estimate is consistent with a previous study of patients who acquired the infection in a different geographic location. The researchers analyzed data from 443 cases of BU notified in Victoria between 2013 and 2016, including 20 new cases identified in short-term visitors to endemic regions. The study found no association between incubation period and age, sex, location of exposure, duration of exposure to an endemic region, or location of the BU lesion. The results suggest that the mode of transmission of BU is similar in different geographic regions in Victoria. This knowledge can guide clinicians in diagnosing and treating the disease. The study's findings are significant because BU is a geographically-restricted infection, and delayed diagnosis is common among non-residents of endemic areas. Understanding the incubation period can help raise awareness and improve public health responses to the disease.
Researchers have identified a protein in the parasite Toxoplasma gondii that is related to the Niemann-Pick, type C1 (NPC1) protein found in humans. This protein, named TgNCR1, contains a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) and shares significant identity with human NPC1, which is involved in cholesterol synthesis, regulation, trafficking, and signaling. TgNCR1 localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the plasma membrane of Toxoplasma, rather than endo-lysosomes like its human counterpart. When expressed in mammalian cells lacking NPC1, TgNCR1 restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from endo-lysosomes, indicating a conserved activity with human NPC1.

To investigate the role of TgNCR1 in Toxoplasma, the researchers genetically disrupted the NCR1 gene and analyzed the resulting mutant parasites. They found that the ΔNCR1 strain had normal cholesterol levels but overaccumulated several species of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides. The mutant parasites also exhibited abundant storage lipid bodies and long membranous tubules derived from their parasitophorous vacuoles. Notably, the ΔNCR1 strain was more virulent in mice than the parental strain and could generate multiple daughters per single mother cell at high frequencies, allowing for fast replication in vitro.

These findings suggest that TgNCR1 plays a role in lipid homeostasis in Toxoplasma, controlling the intracellular levels of several lipids and regulating lipid storage, membrane biosynthesis, and parasite division.
Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by eye malformations, most commonly bilateral anophthalmia, and post-axial oligosyndactyly. Recent studies have identified homozygous mutations in the SMOC1 gene in eight unrelated families, which is associated with the development of OAS. The SMOC1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) antagonist during embryonic development. Loss of BMP antagonism is thought to contribute to the limb and eye phenotypes observed in humans and mice with OAS. A targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mutation of the orthologous mouse gene, Smoc1, resulted in highly penetrant hindlimb post-axial oligosyndactyly and eye malformations, including coloboma and cleft palate, in homozygous mutant animals. These findings suggest that partial loss of Smoc-1 results in a convincing phenocopy of the human disease. The SMOC1 gene is one of the two mammalian paralogs of Drosophila Pentagone, an inhibitor of decapentaplegic. The orthologous gene in Xenopus laevis, Smoc-1, also functions as a BMP antagonist in early embryogenesis, further supporting the conserved non-redundant function of SMOC-1 during ocular and limb development.
Researchers have identified a protein called TRIM22 as a key mediator of the interferon response, which restricts HIV replication in human cells. Interferons are proteins that are produced by cells in response to viral infections, and they play a crucial role in the body's defense against viruses, including HIV. The study found that TRIM22 is one of the most strongly up-regulated genes in response to interferon treatment, and that over-expression of TRIM22 inhibits HIV replication. The researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to deplete TRIM22 in cells treated with interferon and found that HIV particle release was significantly increased in the absence of TRIM22, suggesting that TRIM22 acts as a natural antiviral effector. Further studies showed that TRIM22 specifically targets the HIV Gag protein, which is essential for the assembly and release of the virus. The researchers found that TRIM22 disrupts the proper trafficking of the Gag protein, preventing it from reaching the plasma membrane where it is needed for virus assembly and budding. Mutational analyses revealed that the catalytic amino acids Cys15 and Cys18 of the RING domain of TRIM22 are required for its antiviral activity. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which interferons inhibit HIV replication and highlight the potential of TRIM22 as a target for the development of new antiviral therapies.
Researchers have investigated the stability of the fig-pollinator mutualism, a symbiotic relationship between fig trees (Ficus) and their host-specific pollinator wasps (Agaonidae). In this mutualism, wasps pollinate the trees and receive resources for their offspring in return. However, the stability of this relationship is puzzling, as "cheater" wasps should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. A study on Ficus rubiginosa found that offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium, while inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. This gradient in offspring viability may contribute to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, reducing their galling rates and promoting mutualism stability. The study suggests that parasitic wasps may play a previously unidentified role in maintaining the fig-pollinator mutualism by forcing pollinators to focus on a subset of ovules. This mechanism may contribute to mutualism persistence independently of plant defenses against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints on pollinators. The study provides new insights into the complex dynamics of the fig-pollinator mutualism and highlights the importance of considering the role of parasitic wasps in maintaining this symbiotic relationship. The findings have implications for understanding the evolution and maintenance of mutualisms in general.
Researchers conducted six controlled growth trials on an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population to investigate how genetic and environmental factors influence plant height. The study found that plant height is a heritable, polygenic trait that is affected by water availability, planting density, and growth environment. The results suggest that plant height is a functionally continuous developmental process that is under strong genetic control but can be influenced by environmental factors.

The study used a combination of field and controlled environmental analysis to dissect the genetic and environmental components of plant height in Setaria. The researchers identified 37 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with plant height throughout development within the RIL population across 12 different experiments varying water availability and planting density. Analysis of ortholog positions suggests that known height-affecting genes from the Poaceae family account for only a fraction of the identified loci.

The study found that alleles inherited from the weedy S. viridis parent act to increase plant height early in development, while a larger number of small-effect alleles inherited from the domesticated S. italica parent collectively act to increase plant height later in development. The results support a chronological genetic model of plant height, where the contribution of genetic loci is influenced by temporal and environmental factors. This model may explain the differences in plant height observed when parental lines are grown in controlled environments versus field settings.
A recent study conducted in the Nhecolândia sub-region of the Brazilian Pantanal has confirmed the presence of Ilheus virus (ILHV) in the region. The Pantanal, a vast wetland area, is home to a diverse range of wildlife species and hematophagous arthropods, creating an environment conducive to the circulation of zoonotic arboviruses. Previous studies had detected neutralizing antibodies to various flaviviruses, including ILHV, in horses from the area, but virus isolation had not been confirmed. To investigate further, researchers collected and tested 3,234 adult mosquitoes from 16 species in 2009 and 2010. One pool of 50 non-engorged female Aedes scapularis mosquitoes tested positive for ILHV by culture and real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1,000. The full-length genomic sequence of the isolated virus showed 95% identity to the only available full genome sequence for ILHV. This finding confirms the circulation of ILHV in the Brazilian Pantanal. The study highlights the potential medical importance of ILHV in the region and warrants further investigation by the Brazilian arbovirus surveillance program and local physicians.
A preclinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of single-dose moxidectin (MOX) compared to two-dose ivermectin (IVM) in a porcine scabies model. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive either MOX (0.3 mg/kg once), IVM (0.2 mg/kg twice), or no treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed by evaluating mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies reductions. At day 14 post-treatment, all four MOX-treated pigs were mite-free, while only two IVM-treated pigs were mite-free. MOX efficacy was 100% and remained unchanged until study-end (D47), compared to 62% for IVM. Clinical scabies lesions, pruritus, and anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies had completely disappeared in all MOX-treated but only 75% of IVM-treated pigs. MOX persisted ~9 times longer than IVM in plasma and skin, enabling long-lasting efficacy. The study demonstrates that oral single-dose MOX was more effective than two consecutive IVM-doses, supporting MOX as a potential therapeutic approach for scabies. The findings suggest that MOX may be a promising alternative to current treatments, which are often insufficient and may lead to drug resistance. Further studies are needed to investigate the efficacy and dose selection of MOX in humans.
Researchers studied the peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis machine in Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive pathogen known for its antibiotic resistance and prevalence in hospitals. The PG synthesis machine is responsible for synthesizing the main component of the bacterial cell wall and is the target of many antibiotics. By deleting seven of the nine genes encoding PG synthesis enzymes from the S. aureus genome, the researchers created a strain capable of PG biosynthesis catalyzed only by two penicillin-binding proteins, PBP1 and the bi-functional PBP2. This minimal PG synthesis machinery allowed the bacteria to grow and divide normally in vitro. However, in clinically relevant environments, the bacteria became highly susceptible to cell wall-targeting antibiotics and host lytic enzymes, and displayed impaired virulence in a Drosophila infection model. This suggests that the expendable PG synthesis enzymes play an important role in the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus. The study identifies the minimal PG synthesis machinery of S. aureus and highlights the importance of a complex molecular machine in environments other than in vitro growth. The findings have implications for the development of antibiotics capable of inhibiting the final stages of PG synthesis.
Researchers investigated the role of iron-acquisition systems in the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes the disease melioidosis. They found that the major siderophore malleobactin and the pyochelin gene clusters are not essential for the bacterium's virulence in a murine melioidosis model. Deletion of these gene clusters revealed a residual siderophore activity that is unrelated to other known Burkholderia siderophores. The researchers also found that the hemin uptake loci, hmu and hem, are required for the utilization of hemin and hemoglobin, but Hem cannot complement a Hmu deficiency. A mutant lacking both Hmu and Hem was still able to use ferritin as an iron source and was lethal in an acute murine melioidosis model. These findings suggest that Burkholderia pseudomallei may employ a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway to sustain in vivo growth. The results also indicate that the bacterium's ability to adapt to adverse conditions within the host may allow it to acquire iron through alternative mechanisms, such as upregulating the production of other siderophores or iron-acquisition mechanisms. The study provides new insights into the biology and virulence of Burkholderia pseudomallei, an emerging pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical regions.
Researchers have developed a new tool called COMMGEN to improve the accuracy and usability of genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models (GSMs). GSMs are comprehensive representations of cellular function, but their usability is often hindered by inconsistencies between different models. COMMGEN automatically identifies and resolves these inconsistencies, creating a consensus model that is more accurate, comprehensive, and consolidated than individual GSMs. This tool is particularly useful for complex scenarios where manual curation is not feasible, such as for eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions.

COMMGEN works by comparing two or more distinct GSMs of the same organism and identifying similarities, dissimilarities, and complements of the metabolic networks. It uses novel algorithms to resolve common problems that arise during GSM integration. The tool has been tested on four organisms, and the results show that automatically generated consensus models are predictive and increase the coherence of knowledge representation. In fact, these models often have higher predictive power than manually curated GSMs and can be comparable to manually constructed consensus models.

The use of COMMGEN increases the balance between coherence with the actual biological system and predictive power, making GSMs more usable and reliable for elucidating cell function interactions. This tool has the potential to significantly contribute to the consolidation of knowledge of metabolic function, particularly in complex scenarios where manual curation is not feasible.
Researchers have discovered that cartilage matrix plays a crucial role in regulating the timing of endochondral ossification, a process by which cartilage is replaced by bone tissue. They found that mutations in two genes, fam20b and xylt1, which are involved in the production of proteoglycans (PGs) in cartilage matrix, lead to premature maturation of chondrocytes, the cells that produce cartilage. This premature maturation triggers the formation of bone tissue in the perichondrium, the layer of tissue surrounding the cartilage, earlier than normal.

The researchers used zebrafish mutants to study the effects of fam20b and xylt1 mutations on cartilage development. They found that the mutants had decreased cartilage matrix and increased bone formation in the perichondrium. Further analysis revealed that the mutants failed to produce normal levels of chondroitin sulfate PGs, which are essential components of cartilage matrix. As a result, the chondrocytes in the mutants began to mature prematurely, leading to the formation of bone tissue in the perichondrium earlier than normal.

Ultrastructural analysis of the mutants showed that the cartilage matrix was disorganized and the chondrocytes had features of hypertrophic differentiation, indicating premature maturation. The researchers also found that the mutants had increased expression of genes associated with bone formation, such as runx2b and collagen type 10a1. These findings suggest that cartilage matrix plays a critical role in regulating the timing of endochondral ossification by inhibiting chondrocyte maturation, and that mutations in fam20b and xylt1 disrupt this process, leading to premature bone formation.
Researchers investigated the role of Topoisomerase II (Top2) in the separation of heterochromatic regions during Drosophila melanogaster female meiosis. They used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Top2 expression in the later stages of meiosis and observed specific defects in the separation of heterochromatic regions. In Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, heterochromatic regions of both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes often failed to separate during prometaphase I and metaphase I, resulting in abnormal projections with centromeres localizing near the tips. Despite these anomalies, bipolar spindles were observed in most Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes. However, the obligately achiasmate 4th chromosomes exhibited a near complete failure to move towards the spindle poles during prometaphase I, and both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes displayed defects in biorientation. Embryos from Top2 RNAi-expressing females frequently failed to initiate mitotic divisions. The study suggests that Topoisomerase II is involved in the resolution of heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I and that these entanglements must be resolved for meiosis to be completed. The results indicate that Top2 plays a crucial role in resolving homologous DNA entanglements in Drosophila oocytes, supporting the idea that Top2 is involved in releasing the bonds that hold heterochromatic regions together during prophase.
Researchers conducted a field study to evaluate the effectiveness of using deltamethrin-impregnated collars to control and prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in a highly endemic area in Brazil. The study involved two areas: an intervention area where seronegative dogs were collared, and a control area where only conventional CVL control measures were applied. Dogs were reevaluated every 7-8 months for almost two years, and those that remained seronegative in the intervention area received new collars and newly identified seronegative dogs were included and collared. Dogs that tested seropositive in both areas were marked for euthanasia as mandated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

The study found that the seroprevalence of CVL was similar in both areas at the first evaluation. However, at the second evaluation, significant reductions in seroprevalence were seen in both areas, with the intervention area reducing to 6.0% and the control area increasing to 11.0%. The estimated relative risk (RR = 0.55) indicated protection against CVL in the intervention area. Although CVL incidence did not differ significantly between the areas, an increased tendency was observed in the control area.

The study suggests that the use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars may provide protection against CVL over time. However, the evaluation of the effectiveness of this measure as a community-wide public health control measure was inconclusive. The study highlights the operational challenges of implementing this strategy in endemic areas, indicating the need for adjustments, including improved collar design.
Researchers investigated the unique characteristics of the mammalian X chromosome, specifically its non-random gene content. They proposed that the X chromosome's haploid expression, where one copy of the chromosome is present in males, limits the maximal expression level of genes on the X chromosome. This limitation, known as a "transcriptional traffic jam," prevents genes with very high maximal expression levels from being tolerated on the X chromosome. The study used data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project to test this hypothesis. The results showed that the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is significantly lower than that of genes on autosomes, with an average of three times lower expression. Additionally, autosome-to-X retroposition events resulted in lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X chromosome compared to X-to-autosome retroposition events on autosomes. The study also found that X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression compared to autosomal genes, particularly for highly expressed genes. These findings support the "weak X" model, which suggests that the upper limit for the highest attainable level of gene expression for X-linked genes is lower than for autosomal genes. The study's results provide a simple yet robust explanation for several peculiar features of the X chromosome's gene content, expression, and evolution.
A recent study investigated the prevalence and population structure of Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, in Baka Pygmies, a subgroup of the Western Pygmies from Cameroon. The study found that Baka Pygmies had a significantly lower H. pylori infection rate (20.8%) compared to their non-Baka, agriculturalist neighbors (80.2%). Multilocus haplotypes were generated for each H. pylori isolate, but no Baka-specific lineages were identified, and most isolates were assigned to the hpNEAfrica or hpAfrica1 populations. The hpNEAfrica population was further divided into East African and Central West African subpopulations, while a new hpAfrica1 subpopulation was identified among Cameroonians, suggesting eastern and western expansions of Bantu languages. An age-structured transmission model suggested that the low H. pylori prevalence among Baka Pygmies could be achieved within a few hundred years due to demographic factors such as small population size and low life expectancy. Coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference indicated that Baka Pygmies almost certainly acquired their extant H. pylori through secondary contact with their agriculturalist neighbors. The study's findings suggest that Baka Pygmies were either H. pylori-free or lost their ancient lineages during past demographic fluctuations.
Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 5 (NS5) plays a crucial role in the replication and capping of the viral RNA genome. The C-terminal 18 amino acid region (Cter18) of NS5 is highly conserved among DENV serotypes and is responsible for its subcellular localization. Research has shown that DENV2 NS5 localizes to the nucleus during infection, whereas DENV1 NS5 remains in the cytoplasm. A combination of functional and structural analyses revealed that the Cter18 region is sufficient to direct NS5 to either the cytoplasm or nucleus, depending on the serotype. The Cter18 region binds to the nuclear import receptor importin-alpha (Impα) with low micromolar affinity, and structure-guided mutational analysis identified a conserved arginine residue (R888) essential for NS5 subcellular localization. Mutating R888 to alanine resulted in a completely non-viable virus, while mutating it to lysine led to a severely attenuated phenotype. The R888 residue forms a hydrogen bond with tyrosine 838, which is conserved in all flaviviruses. These findings suggest that the Cter18 region of NS5 has an evolutionarily conserved function, possibly in RNA interactions critical for replication, independent of its role in subcellular localization. The study highlights the importance of the Cter18 region in regulating NS5 subcellular localization and its potential role in DENV pathogenesis.
A novel integrated mapping protocol, known as the Integrated Threshold Mapping (ITM) Methodology, has been developed and field-tested for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH). The protocol aims to determine whether a threshold has been reached to trigger public health interventions in an implementation unit. The ITM methodology is designed to be resource-efficient and relies on World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators in disease-specific age groups. The protocol was tested in one district each in Mali and Senegal by comparing it to current WHO mapping methodologies for each targeted disease. The results showed that the ITM methodology reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies regarding the initiation of public health interventions for trachoma, LF, and STH, but resulted in more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. The ITM methodology was found to be practical, feasible, and cost-saving compared to the standard, non-integrated, WHO methodologies. This integrated mapping tool has the potential to facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries. The ITM methodology does not provide prevalence figures, but rather determines whether a disease has reached the threshold for public health intervention by balancing epidemiologic rigor and field practicality.
Researchers investigated the process of mitotic exit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, focusing on the release of the phosphatase Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin. Cdc14 is essential for the exit from mitosis, and its release is regulated by two redundant pathways: the FEAR network and the MEN. The study found that the ubiquitination of histone H2B by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase is necessary for Cdc14 release when the MEN is inactivated. This function is mediated by the activation of histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (meH3K4 and meH3K79), but not by the histone deacetylase Sir2, which associates with Cdc14 on nucleolar chromatin. Additionally, the study found that histone H3 lysine 36 methylation (meH3K36) and an HDAC recruited by this modification are also required for Cdc14 release. These histone modifications represent previously unappreciated factors necessary for the accessibility to and/or action on nucleolar chromatin of FEAR network components. The non-redundant role of these modifications in this context contrasts with the notion of a highly combinatorial code by which histone marks act to control biological processes. The study provides evidence for a role for histone ubiquitination in the early phase of mitotic exit and suggests that histone modifications may be required for efficient exit from mitosis.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework, GeneProgram, to identify and characterize expression programs in human gene expression data. An expression program is a set of co-expressed genes that orchestrate normal or pathological processes. GeneProgram addresses challenges in identifying these programs, such as cellular inhomogeneity, genetic and environmental variation, and uncertainty in the number of programs and sample populations. The framework uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to simultaneously organize tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior. GeneProgram produces maps of expression programs, which are sorted by generality scores that exploit the automatically learned groupings. Using synthetic and real gene expression data, GeneProgram outperformed several popular expression analysis methods. The researchers applied GeneProgram to a compendium of 62 short time-series gene expression datasets, exploring the responses of human cells to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. GeneProgram produced a map of 104 expression programs, many of which were significantly enriched for genes involved in key signaling pathways and/or bound by NF-κB transcription factors. The discovered map of expression programs involved in the response to infection is expected to guide future biological experiments. Genes from programs with low generality scores may serve as new drug targets, while genes from high generality programs may maintain common physiological responses that go awry in disease states. GeneProgram is a multipurpose method that can be applied to novel compendia of biological data.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drives epigenetic imprinting of the interferon-gamma (IFNG) locus in NKG2Chi natural killer (NK) cells. NKG2Chi NK cells, which are expanded in HCMV-seropositive individuals, undergo epigenetic remodeling of the IFNG conserved non-coding sequence 1 (CNS1) region, similar to memory CD8+ T cells and TH1 cells. This epigenetic imprinting enhances IFN-γ transcriptional activity in response to NKG2C and 2B4 engagement, leading to consistent IFN-γ production in NKG2Chi NK cells. The accessibility of the CNS1 region is crucial for this process, acting as an important enhancer of IFN-γ transcriptional activity.

The study found that only HCMV-specific NKG2Chi expansions and cytokine-primed NK cells displayed an open configuration at the IFNG CNS1, which is a hallmark of adaptive features and IFN-γ memory in NK cells. A broader epigenetic remodeling accompanies these adaptive features, demonstrating that both inflammatory and pathogen cues induce epigenetic remodeling of NK cells. This observation suggests that common epigenomic features may be functional hallmarks of memory-like NK cells and memory T cells. The study provides a molecular basis for the regulation of adaptive features in innate cells and highlights the importance of HCMV infection in shaping the human NK cell repertoire.
Researchers have discovered a novel mechanism by which the bacterium Legionella pneumophila regulates its effector proteins within host cells. The protein LubX, secreted by L. pneumophila, functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the bacterial effector protein SidH for degradation by the host cell's proteasome. This process is crucial for modulating the activity of SidH at different stages of infection. The study reveals that LubX acts as a "metaeffector," a term coined to describe an effector protein that regulates the function of another effector within the host cell. The temporal regulation of SidH by LubX and the host proteasome system demonstrates a sophisticated level of coevolution between eukaryotic cells and L. pneumophila. This finding highlights the importance of spatiotemporal regulation in modulating distinct activities of effectors at different stages of infection. The study also suggests that LubX may have multiple targets within host cells, including the host kinase Clk1, and that effector proteins functioning as E3 ubiquitin ligases are prevalent among many plant and animal bacterial pathogens. The discovery of LubX as a metaeffector provides new insights into the complex interactions between bacterial effectors and host cells, and has implications for understanding the mechanisms of bacterial infection and pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated the diversification of HIV-1 env coding sequences in 81 very early B subtype infections to understand the host environment and immune responses experienced by the newly transmitted virus. They found evidence of adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env and identified a subset of codon sites that diversified more rapidly than expected under a model of neutral evolution. Of 24 such rapidly diversifying sites, 14 were either embedded in CTL epitopes or in a nucleotide context indicative of APOBEC-mediated G-to-A substitutions. This suggests that APOBEC may facilitate early immune escape. Ten rapidly diversifying sites could not be explained by CTL escape or APOBEC hypermutation, including the most frequently mutated site in the fusion peptide of gp41. The study also examined the distribution, extent, and sequence context of insertions and deletions, and found that the length variation seen in hypervariable loop regions of the envelope glycoprotein is a consequence of selection, not mutational hotspots. The results provide a detailed view of the process of diversification of HIV-1 following transmission, highlighting the role of CTL escape and hypermutation in shaping viral evolution during the establishment of new infections.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study epigenetic silencing in budding yeast. The model incorporates two key chromatin marks, H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation, and explores how the presence of multiple marks affects the system's behavior. The study finds that having both modifications is crucial for the robustness of epigenetic silencing. Additionally, the model reveals a novel state with bivalent marks, where chromatin is both active and silenced, under certain perturbations such as knock-out mutations or inhibition/enhancement of enzymatic activity. This bivalent state leads to patchy silencing. The researchers also investigate the titration effect, where a limited supply of silencing proteins can result in counter-intuitive responses. The study systematically examines the design principles of the silencing system and assesses disparate experimental observations within a single theoretical framework. The model can be extended to include other silencing and active marks, providing insights into which marks are essential for resolving epigenetic fate and which reinforce one fate over another. The study sheds light on the complex mechanisms of cooperativity in the budding yeast silencing system, including cooperativity in histone modification states and cooperative interactions of Sir proteins. The findings have implications for understanding the role of multiple marks in epigenetic silencing and the emergence of stable bivalent chromatin states.
Researchers conducted a study in Uganda to investigate the differences in gut microbiota (GM) composition between children hospitalized with oedematous and non-oedematous severe acute malnutrition (SAM). The study included 87 children aged 6-24 months, with 62% suffering from oedematous malnutrition. The researchers found that the GM composition differed between the two groups, with non-oedematous children having lower GM alpha diversity. However, beta diversity analysis did not reveal significant differences between the GM of children with oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. The study suggests that non-oedematous SAM children have lower GM diversity compared to oedematous SAM children, but no clear compositional differences were identified. This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between gut microbiota and malnutrition, particularly in the context of oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. The findings have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to address malnutrition in developing countries, where SAM remains a major health problem. The study highlights the need for further research on the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of SAM and the potential benefits of probiotics and prebiotics in treating malnutrition.
Researchers investigated the variation in telomere length among 112 wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates, specifically focusing on the species Saccharomyces paradoxus. They found extensive telomere length variation among these isolates, with European strains having extremely short telomeres (less than 150 base pairs) and American isolates having telomeres approximately three times as long (over 400 base pairs). The researchers used a URA3 gene insertion near telomeres to accurately analyze individual telomere lengths and telomere position effect (TPE). They found that crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telomere lengths, suggesting that multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are involved in telomere length maintenance. Genotyping F1 segregants identified several QTLs associated with telomere length and silencing variation, including the YKU80 and TLC1 genes, which were validated as telomere-length QTLs in the two S. paradoxus subpopulations. The researchers also detected transgressive segregation for both phenotypes and proposed that sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer generates negative epistasis in one of the allelic combinations, resulting in very short telomeres.
Researchers investigated the cognitive and neural processes underlying human decision-making in a sequential choice paradigm, where participants were free to collect multiple pieces of information before deciding. Traditional sequential sampling models (SSMs) assume that decisions emerge from a bounded evidence accumulation process, making response times (RTs) predictable. However, these models do not account for the possibility of a decision maker choosing to delay the choice and terminate the accumulation process temporarily.

To address this limitation, the researchers developed several SSMs for predicting RTs from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. In these studies, participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues and were free to respond at any time. The standard SSM implementations did not adequately describe RT distributions, but adding a mechanism for postponing decisions to the model resulted in an accurate fit to the data.

Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-band frequencies, indicating that responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited. This supports the existence of a decision not to decide. The extended model also accounted for the results of an adapted version of the paradigm in which participants had to press a button for sampling more information. The findings suggest that computational modeling of decisions and RTs can provide a deeper understanding of the hidden dynamics in cognition.
Researchers identified a genetic mutation in the SUV39H2 gene as the cause of hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HNPK) in Labrador Retrievers. HNPK is a skin disorder characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum of affected dogs. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using 13 HNPK cases and 23 controls, which revealed a strong association signal on chromosome 2. Further analysis identified a missense variant in the SUV39H2 gene, which encodes a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in chromatin silencing and epigenetic regulation.

The mutation, c.972T>G, changes an asparagine to a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme, predicted to affect its function. Histopathological analysis of the nasal planum in HNPK-affected dogs revealed delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, rather than hyperproliferation, as the underlying cause of the disorder. This suggests that SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and sealing of the epidermis.

The study provides new insights into the epigenetics of keratinocyte differentiation and the role of SUV39H2 in maintaining the integrity of the epidermis. The findings also highlight the importance of tissue-specific expression profiles of histone-modifying enzymes in determining the clinical phenotype of genetic disorders.
Researchers investigated the process of genetic reassortment between avian and swine influenza A viruses (IAVs) in swine, which can lead to the emergence of pandemic strains. They co-housed influenza-seronegative pigs with pigs infected with avian H1N1 IAV and swine H3N2 IAV, and analyzed 571 isolates from nasal wash samples and respiratory tract tissues. The study found that 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants emerged, with the largest genomic diversity in viruses from the lower respiratory tract. Reassortants from the lower respiratory tract also showed the largest variations in growth kinetics in respiratory tract epithelial cells. The researchers found that the cold temperature in swine nasal cells selected for the type of reassortant viruses shed by the pigs. One reassortant was consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower respiratory tract tissues and was efficiently transmitted between pigs. The study suggests that genetic reassortments occur in the lower respiratory tract during mixed infections of avian and swine IAVs, and tissue tropism plays a key role in selecting for transmissible reassortants. The findings have implications for understanding the emergence of pandemic strains and the potential for feral swine to serve as an intermediate host for generating and transmitting reassortant viruses to domestic swine and humans.
Researchers investigated the impact of maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and praziquantel treatment during pregnancy on Schistosoma mansoni infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five years. The study, conducted in Uganda, involved 1343 children whose mothers were either treated with praziquantel or a placebo during pregnancy. The results showed that 2.4% of the children had Schistosoma mansoni infection at age five years, with no significant difference in infection prevalence between children of treated or untreated mothers. Cytokine and antibody responses to Schistosoma antigens were higher among infected children compared to uninfected children. However, praziquantel treatment during pregnancy had no effect on immune responses, except for IL-10 responses to Schistosoma worm antigen (SWA), which were higher in offspring of women treated with praziquantel during pregnancy. The study found no evidence that maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy influence the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection or effector immune response among offspring at age five years. However, the observed effects on IL-10 responses to SWA suggest that maternal Schistosoma mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. This may have implications for the pathogenesis of the disease.
Macrophages, a type of immune cell, play a crucial role in clearing infectious pathogens from the body. When activated by inflammatory stimuli, macrophages undergo a reprogramming of their endocytic machinery, shifting from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis, a process that allows for the rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes. This reprogramming is mediated by the phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, which activates phosphoinositol (PI)-3-kinase activity necessary for macropinocytic uptake.

Research has shown that the expression of a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 is sufficient to induce PI-3-kinase activation and macropinocytosis, even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. This suggests that coronin 1 phosphorylation is the key molecular switch that reprograms macrophages from a phagocytic uptake mode to macropinocytosis.

Studies have demonstrated that when macrophages express a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1, they are able to internalize large amounts of cargo, including mycobacteria and IgG-coated beads, through macropinocytosis, even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. This indicates that coronin 1 phosphorylation is sufficient to redirect phagocytic cargo via macropinocytosis to lysosomes, where it can be eliminated.

These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in the internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation, and highlight the importance of coronin 1 phosphorylation in regulating the switch from phagocytosis to macropinocytosis in macrophages.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in Arua District, North West Uganda, to assess community acceptance of tsetse control baits, which are used to combat sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis or HAT). The study involved 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages across the district. The results showed that community members perceived tsetse baits differently, with those who had never seen traps before expressing fear, anxiety, and panic due to associations with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river." In contrast, villagers living in areas where traps had been used previously had positive attitudes towards them and were aware of their purpose and benefits. The study suggests that acceptance of traps varies markedly between villages and is related to the duration of experience with tsetse control programs. The success of community-based interventions against tsetse will depend on early engagement with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns that reach all communities, especially those living in areas new to such interventions. The study highlights the importance of community acceptance of traps for effective tsetse control, citing examples from other regions where negative attitudes towards traps led to operational failure.
Researchers have investigated the process of recombination in Drosophila melanogaster, a fundamental biological process with significant evolutionary implications. Recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations, but direct tests of this prediction have been limited due to a lack of detailed characterization of recombination rate variation across genomes and within species. A new study provides the first integrated high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination, distinguishing between crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC), the two outcomes of meiotic recombination. The researchers characterized the products of 5,860 female meioses in D. melanogaster by genotyping 139 million informative SNPs and mapped 106,964 recombination events at a resolution of 2 kilobases. This approach allowed for the creation of whole-genome CO and GC maps, as well as a detailed description of variation in recombination among individuals of this species. The study found that CO rates exhibit extreme and highly punctuated variation along chromosomes, with hot and coldspots, while GC rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome. Recombination events are associated with numerous sequence motifs and tend to occur within transcript regions, suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple layers of variation in recombination rates to accurately estimate recombination rates and understand the interaction between selection and linkage.
IDN2, a protein involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in Arabidopsis thaliana, forms a complex with two paralogs, IDP1 and IDP2. Affinity purification of IDN2 revealed the presence of IDP1 and IDP2, which are essential for de novo DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional gene silencing. IDP1 and IDP2 have partially overlapping roles, but unlike IDN2, they are unable to bind double-stranded RNA. The coiled-coil domain of IDN2 is necessary for its homodimerization, but not for its interaction with IDP1 and IDP2. In contrast, the XH domain of IDN2 is required for its interaction with IDP1 and IDP2, as well as for its function in RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing. Mutations in the XH domain of IDN2 resulted in a failure to complement the DNA methylation defect of the idn2 mutant at a canonical RdDM target. The IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex is essential for the RdDM pathway, and IDP1 and IDP2 have distinct roles compared to IDN2. The XH domain of IDN2 is highly conserved in the IDN2 family but not in other proteins, suggesting its functional specificity. The study highlights the importance of the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex in RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis.
Researchers investigated how neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, respond to Leishmania braziliensis, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and are rapidly recruited to the site of infection. The study found that exposure to L. braziliensis triggers neutrophil activation, characterized by the expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CD62L, and the release of inflammatory mediators like TNF-α and neutrophil elastase. Additionally, neutrophils infected with L. braziliensis displayed markers of early apoptosis, or programmed cell death.

In vivo, neutrophil accumulation was observed at the site of L. braziliensis inoculation, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro, neutrophils exposed to serum-opsonized L. braziliensis promastigotes showed increased production of superoxide, a hallmark of neutrophil activation. The study also found that co-inoculation of L. braziliensis and neutrophils decreased lesion size, whereas depletion of neutrophils and monocytes had the opposite effect, increasing parasite load and lesion size. These findings suggest that neutrophils play a crucial role in the early stages of L. braziliensis infection and may contribute to parasite elimination. The study highlights the complex interaction between neutrophils and L. braziliensis, with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis.
Researchers explored the potential benefits of using cattle vaccination as a supplementary control measure for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain. Currently, vaccination is not used in international control programs and is prohibited in the EU due to interference with the tuberculin skin test, which is used to determine if animals, herds, and countries are bTB-free. However, new diagnostic tests that can Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA) offer the possibility of introducing vaccination within existing eradication programs. The study used within-herd transmission models to assess the feasibility of using BCG vaccination in combination with DIVA testing. The results showed that the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than its sensitivity, is the main barrier to achieving a herd-level benefit from vaccination. To see a protective benefit of vaccination without increasing the risk of missed infections, a DIVA test with a specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of over 40% is required. The study found that a cocktail of three DIVA antigens could achieve this target specificity while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3% relative to post-mortem detection. The researchers estimated that vaccination could reduce the number of animals condemned as reactors, the number of tests needed to clear restrictions, and the number of infected animals left in herds after restrictions are lifted. However, the potential negative effects of vaccination could be mitigated through relaxation of testing, which could potentially increase the hidden burden of infection within officially TB-free herds.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds called dihydrobenz[e][1,4]oxazepin-2(3H)-ones that show promise as a treatment for trichuriasis, a parasitic infection caused by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura. This infection affects around 500 million people worldwide and can lead to physical growth and educational performance problems. Current treatments are limited and often ineffective, making it essential to develop new treatments. The researchers used a model parasite, Trichuris muris, to screen a library of 480 small molecules and identified the dihydrobenzoxazepinones as a new class of anthelmintic compounds. These compounds paralyze the adult parasite and reduce the ability of treated eggs to establish infection in the host in vivo. The most active compounds have an EC50 value of around 25-50μM, comparable to the existing anthelmintic levamisole. The dihydrobenzoxazepinones also show low cytotoxicity against murine gut epithelial cells, demonstrating selectivity for the parasite. This new class of compounds has the potential to be developed into a novel oral pharmaceutical treatment for trichuriasis. Furthermore, the researchers found that one of the compounds, OX02983, reduces the ability of embryonated T. muris eggs to establish infection in the mouse host in vivo, suggesting an alternative strategy of developing a therapeutic that acts in the environment to interrupt the parasite lifecycle. The dihydrobenzoxazepinones demonstrate considerable scope for further optimization to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties, with the aim of developing a clinical agent.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of "date" and "party" hubs in protein-protein interaction networks, which were previously thought to play distinct roles. Date hubs were characterized by low co-expression with their interaction partners, while party hubs had high co-expression. However, the study found that the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of highly central hubs, which do not display low expression correlation with their partners. This challenges the idea that date hubs are global connectors and party hubs are local coordinators. The study also found that the bimodal distribution of hub co-expression, which motivated the date/party distinction, is not robust to methodological changes. Additionally, topological properties of hubs do not generally correlate with co-expression. In contrast, the study found significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional similarity of interacting proteins. The researchers suggest that thinking in terms of a date/party dichotomy for hubs in protein interaction networks is not meaningful and that it might be more useful to consider roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins. The study's findings indicate that the roles of hubs in protein interaction networks are more diverse than previously thought and cannot be explained by a simple dichotomy.
Researchers have developed methods to reconstruct transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks using whole genome sequence data. However, a major limitation of these approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales. This means that the position of infected individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between the sampled pathogen genomes. To address this limitation, the concept of "transmission divergence" was introduced, defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs. Using simulated outbreak scenarios and sequence evolution models, researchers estimated transmission divergence for ten major outbreak-causing pathogens. The results showed that transmission divergence is generally very low, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. This limited genetic diversity had a significant impact on the ability to reconstruct outbreaks using genetic sequence data. The study found that rapidly evolving pathogens, such as RNA viruses, can provide valuable information on individual transmission events, while pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information about individual transmission events. The study highlights the informational limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak scenarios and emphasizes the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data.
Researchers have investigated the phenomenon of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals, where most genes on one X chromosome are silenced. They analyzed the expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells to identify genes that escape XCI. The study used a binomial model to assess allelic expression and found a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X (Xi) chromosome. The results showed that few genes (3-7%) escape XCI in any of the mouse tissues examined, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro system represented by the embryonic-kidney-derived Patski cell line showed a higher density of escape genes (21%), representing both kidney-specific escape genes and cell-line specific escape genes. The study also found that allele-specific RNA polymerase II occupancy and DNase I hypersensitivity at the promoter of genes on the Xi correlated well with levels of escape, consistent with an open chromatin structure at escape genes. Additionally, allele-specific CTCF binding on the Xi clustered at escape genes and was denser in brain compared to the Patski cell line, possibly contributing to a more compartmentalized structure of the Xi and fewer escape genes in brain compared to the cell line. The findings suggest that XCI and escape from XCI are tightly controlled in vivo, and that the probability of bi-allelic versus mono-allelic expression can be calculated using a new algorithm.
A novel cysteine protease of Plasmodium vivax, designated as Vivapain-4 (VX-4), has been identified and characterized. VX-4 is one of four closely related cysteine protease genes found in P. vivax, with orthologs also present in other primate Plasmodium species. Recombinant VX-4 demonstrated dual substrate specificity, with optimal activity against certain substrates at acidic pH (5.5) and others at neutral pH (6.5-7.5). The enzyme preferred positively charged amino acids and glutamine at the P1 position, with less strict specificity at P3 and P4. Three amino acids in the S2 pocket of VX-4 were found to be different from those in VX-2 and VX-3, with the substitution of glutamic acid at position 180 being crucial for pH-dependent substrate preference. VX-4 was localized in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocytic stage of P. vivax and showed maximal activity against actin at neutral pH and against P. vivax plasmepsin 4 and hemoglobin at neutral/acidic and acidic pH, respectively. The study suggests that VX-4 may function as a hemoglobinase in the acidic parasite food vacuole, a maturase of P. vivax plasmepsin 4 at neutral or acidic pH, and a cytoskeleton-degrading protease in the neutral erythrocyte cytosol. The identification and characterization of VX-4 provide insights into the biological roles of P. vivax cysteine proteases and potential targets for antimalarial drugs.
Researchers have developed a novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) for the model acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii. This ME-model, named iJL965-ME, captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as pathways to synthesize RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. The model represents the first ME-model of a Gram-positive bacterium and significantly broadens the scope and predictability of microbial systems biology.

Using the ME-model, researchers were able to accurately predict the secretion of multiple fermentation products, including acetate, ethanol, and glycerol, during changing carbon and metal availability. The model also revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in acetogens. Furthermore, the model predicted the formation of glycerol, a novel product for C. ljungdahlii, thus broadening the metabolic capability of this model microbe.

The ME-model also enabled the prediction and experimental validation of changing secretion rates based on different metal availability, providing new knowledge about the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens. This knowledge can be used to develop new design strategies for acetogens, which are ideal candidates for the biotechnological production of commodity chemicals due to their ability to ferment a broad range of substrates, including H2:CO2 or syngas.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the genetic control of transcript isoform variation in human osteoblasts (HObs) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). They used a panel of HObs to perform a transcriptomic survey, similar to recent studies in LCLs, and found that the distinct nature of HObs and LCLs is reflected by the preferential grouping of cell type-specific genes within biologically and functionally relevant pathways unique to each tissue type. The study identified genetic variations of transcript isoforms in HObs and found that differential expression of transcript isoforms is partly controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants. These isoforms are regulated by genetic variants in both a tissue-specific and tissue-independent fashion, and the associations were confirmed by RT-PCR validation.

The study suggests that multiple transcript isoforms are often present in both tissues and that genetic control may affect the relative expression of one isoform to another, rather than having an all-or-none effect. Examination of the top SNPs from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bone mineral density showed overlap with probeset associations observed in this study. The top hit corresponding to the FAM118A gene was tested for association studies in two additional clinical studies, revealing a novel transcript isoform variant.

The study's approach to examining transcriptome variation in multiple tissue types is useful for detecting the proportion of genetic variation common to different cell types and for the identification of cell-specific isoform variants that may be functionally relevant, an important follow-up step for GWAS.
Saccharomyces eubayanus, the non-S. cerevisiae parent of the lager-brewing hybrid S. pastorianus, is unable to utilize maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer's wort. Unlike most S. cerevisiae and S. pastorianus strains, S. eubayanus lacks maltotriose transporter genes, despite harboring four SeMALT genes that enable uptake of the α-di-glucoside maltose. Researchers subjected S. eubayanus strain CBS 12357T to laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltotriose-enriched wort, resulting in an evolved strain that showed improved maltose and maltotriose fermentation in 7 L fermenter experiments on industrial wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel mosaic SeMALT413 gene, resulting from repeated gene introgressions by non-reciprocal translocation of at least three SeMALT genes. The predicted tertiary structure of SeMalT413 was comparable to the original SeMalT transporters, but overexpression of SeMALT413 sufficed to enable growth on maltotriose, indicating gene neofunctionalization had occurred. The mosaic structure of SeMALT413 resembles the structure of S. pastorianus maltotriose-transporter gene SpMTY1, which has high sequence identity to alternatingly S. cerevisiae MALx1, S. paradoxus MALx1, and S. eubayanus SeMALT3. The evolution of the maltotriose transporter landscape in hybrid S. pastorianus lager-brewing strains is likely to have involved mechanisms similar to those observed in this study.
Researchers have identified a correlation between the antigenic variation of influenza viruses and the excess mortality they cause. By developing a simplified host-virus interaction model, the study found a direct and positive correlation between the extent of antigenic variation and the total excess mortality caused by an influenza virus. This relationship allows for the rapid estimation of the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by accurately predicting the antigenic distance between A (H1N1) strains based on their HA sequences.

The study proposes a method to rapidly assess the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by predicting the antigenic distance between A (H1N1) strains. This method, called EADpred, has been shown to predict antigenic distance with a relatively high accuracy, suggesting its potential utility in the rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden. The study also found that the predicted antigenic distance of A (H1N1) virus correlates well with the observed excess mortality.

The researchers believe that this method will be useful for rapid assessment of the influenza mortality burden of other future A (H1N1) variants and is also applicable to the antigenic variants of human A (H3N2) and B viruses with proper modification. This rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden can help develop a timely and sensible preparedness program that balances the gains of public health and the social and economic costs.
Researchers have identified a small cysteine-rich protein from the Asian soybean rust fungus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, that suppresses plant immunity. This protein, named PpEC23, is one of several small, secreted cysteine-rich proteins (SSCRPs) encoded by the fungus's genome. The study found that PpEC23 interacts with a soybean transcription factor called GmSPL12l, which acts as a negative regulator of soybean defenses. When GmSPL12l is silenced, soybean plants exhibit constitutively active immunity, suggesting that GmSPL12l plays a key role in suppressing plant immune responses. The researchers also found that PpEC23 is able to suppress soybean immune responses and physically interact with GmSPL12l. This interaction is thought to be a conserved protein-protein interaction platform used by rust fungi to manipulate host immune responses. The study provides evidence for a virulence function of a rust SSCRP and sheds light on the molecular mechanisms by which P. pachyrhizi interacts with its host plant. The discovery of PpEC23 and its interaction with GmSPL12l has implications for understanding the complex interactions between rust fungi and their host plants, and may lead to the development of new strategies for controlling soybean disease epidemics caused by P. pachyrhizi.
Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, invades host cells to replicate inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion. The bacterium recruits and modulates multiple host proteins to support its development. Research has identified the EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2) as a cell surface tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in Chlamydia infection. EphA2 is involved in the activation of the PI3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which is essential for efficient Chlamydia replication. Studies have shown that interfering with EphA2 binding to Chlamydia, downregulating EphA2 expression, or inhibiting EphA2 activity significantly reduces Chlamydia infection. Chlamydia interacts with and activates EphA2 on the cell surface, leading to the internalization of both the bacterium and the receptor. During Chlamydia replication, EphA2 remains active and accumulates around the inclusion, interacting with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to support the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Overexpression of full-length EphA2 enhances PI3K activation and Chlamydia infection, while a mutant form of EphA2 lacking the intracellular cytoplasmic domain does not have this effect. Additionally, Chlamydia infection induces the upregulation of EphA2 through the activation of the ERK pathway, which keeps the infected cell in an apoptosis-resistant state.
Researchers have long known that neurons have active ion channels in their dendrites, which can support non-linear summation and dendritic spikes. However, the functional role of these active dendritic conductances has remained unclear. This study proposes that the primary function of active dendritic conductances is to enhance the dynamic range of neurons, allowing them to detect and amplify weak signals while saturating slowly for stronger inputs.

The study used a model of an active dendritic tree and found that its average output is a highly non-linear function of its afferent rate, achieving extremely large dynamic ranges (above 50 dB). The model also yielded double-sigmoid response functions, similar to those observed in retinal ganglion cells. The researchers suggest that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have larger dynamic ranges and that blocking active conductances should lead to a decrease in dynamic range.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how neurons process information. The dynamic range problem is a universal challenge in signal processing, where there is a trade-off between sensitivity and saturation. The researchers propose that active dendrites can solve this problem by amplifying weak signals and saturating slowly for stronger inputs. The study's results also suggest that dendritic spikes can lead to a double-sigmoid behavior in the neuron's transfer function, rather than a simple Hill-like saturating curve.
Researchers have developed methods to infer regulatory interactions and quantitative models of gene regulation from time-series transcriptomics data. However, these methods often rely on assumptions that may not be valid, such as equating mRNA abundance with protein concentrations and neglecting global physiological effects. To address this, the authors investigated the importance of these assumptions using a combination of models and experiments. They measured the activity of genes involved in the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network in real-time and in vivo, and estimated protein concentrations and global physiological effects using kinetic models of gene expression. The results showed that correcting for the bias of commonly-made assumptions improves the quality of the models inferred from the data. The authors also demonstrated that this improvement is expected to be even stronger for systems with longer protein half-lives and varying gene expression machinery activity. The study proposes new controls for transcriptome experiments, including the use of constitutively-expressed genes, and mathematical models for reconstructing protein concentrations and integrating global physiological effects into the network inference process. The approach is broadly applicable to learning about the structure and dynamics of regulatory networks using time-series transcriptome data. The study also highlights the importance of global physiological effects and the regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters in the FliA-FlgM module.
Researchers conducted a four-year longitudinal study in the Agua Buena region of Panama to investigate the spatial-temporal distribution of Oligoryzomys fulvescens, a rodent species that serves as a reservoir for hantavirus. The study aimed to understand the environmental factors influencing the abundance of this species and its role in maintaining and transmitting zoonotic pathogens. The researchers analyzed data collected from 2006 to 2009, using a 90-node grid to create a base map of the study area, which spanned 6.43 square kilometers.

The study found that O. fulvescens populations exhibited heterogeneous patterns in density and dispersion, varying across seasons and years. The species was typically absent during the late transitional months of the season, only to re-establish itself in subsequent years. Spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed that local populations were approximately 300-600 meters in size, with sharply demarcated borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats. The researchers observed a well-defined spatial pattern that evolved over time, leading to changing aggregation and shifting hotspots of abundance.

The study highlights the challenges in monitoring and predicting zoonotic disease outbreaks at the level of reservoir populations, which are subject to fluctuations over time and are geographically restricted. The findings suggest that rodent-borne zoonoses are sensitive to reservoir population size, demographic characteristics, and population persistence, as well as temporal changes in host population distribution. The study's results provide valuable insights into the complex dynamics of O. fulvescens populations and their role in maintaining and transmitting zoonotic pathogens.
Researchers have developed a computational method to infer the relationship between genetic mutations and their impact on the antigenic properties of the influenza A (H3N2) virus. This method, called antigenic tree inference, allows for the identification of amino acid changes that affect the virus's ability to evade pre-existing host immunity, which is crucial for the development of effective vaccines. The technique uses a least-squares optimization procedure to fit pairwise antigenic distances between isolates onto an evolutionary tree for the major antigenic determinant of the virus.

The researchers applied this method to study the antigenic evolution of the influenza A (H3N2) virus over a 35-year period, from 1968 to 2003. The results showed that the method accurately predicted antigenic distances and identified both known and novel sites with antigenic impact. This information can be used to identify isolates and associated changes with large antigenic impact, which is essential for updating vaccine strains prior to antigenic type transitions. The method can also be applied to the study of other systems, both within and across species, where homologous genetic sequences and associated pairwise phenotype distances are available.

The antigenic tree inference method provides a more fine-grained resolution of the antigenic impact of individual changes than existing methods, such as antigenic cartography, without the need for time- and cost-intensive experimental analysis. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of the antigenic evolution of the influenza A (H3N2) virus and inform the development of more effective vaccines.
A large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen was conducted to identify host cell factors and processes involved in human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infection. The study revealed that nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) during mitosis is crucial for the nuclear import of the viral DNA (vDNA) into the nucleus. In interphase cells, the virus is endocytosed, routed to the perinuclear area, and uncoated, but the vDNA fails to be imported into the nucleus. However, when the nuclear envelope is perforated in interphase cells, HPV16 infection occurs. During mitosis, the vDNA and L2 protein associate with host cell chromatin on the metaphase plate. This suggests that HPV16 requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for access of the vDNA to the nucleoplasm. The study highlights the importance of mitosis in HPV16 nuclear entry and provides a resource for future virus-host cell interaction studies. The findings also underscore the value of RNAi screens in analyzing pathogen-host interactions.
Black Sigatoka or black leaf streak disease, caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis, is a major threat to global banana production. The disease requires frequent fungicide applications, which can lead to the rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains, resulting in disease-control failures worldwide. To combat this issue, the genomes of two P. fijiensis strains were sequenced and assembled using a new genetic linkage map. The 74-Mb genome of P. fijiensis is highly expanded by LTR retrotransposons, making it the largest genome within the Dothideomycetes. The genomes of two closely related members of the Sigatoka disease complex, P. eumusae and P. musae, also show similar expansions.

Genetic analysis revealed chromosome-length polymorphisms and high genetic diversity in P. fijiensis field populations, indicating strong selection and limited gene flow. The frequency of fungicide resistance in treated plantations was significantly higher than in untreated wild-type P. fijiensis populations. A homologue of the Cladosporium fulvum Avr4 effector, PfAvr4, was identified in the P. fijiensis genome, which triggered a hypersensitive-like response in the resistant banana variety Calcutta 4. This suggests that Calcutta 4 may carry an unknown resistance gene recognizing PfAvr4.

The P. fijiensis genome will aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules and improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs. Diversifying and increasing host resistance in banana may be the only way to slow the devastation caused by this fungus in the future. The availability of the P. fijiensis genome sequence will facilitate the development of resistant cultivars in banana breeding programs.
Researchers have developed a new framework to study the evolution of lineage-specific transcription factor binding sites without relying on detailed cross-species alignments. This approach, based on a birth-death model, allows for the identification of novel regulatory elements that contribute to species-specific traits. By analyzing ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors (GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, and ETS1) along the human lineage after the human-mouse common ancestor, the researchers found that a substantial fraction (58-79%) of binding sites in humans have originated since the divergence with mouse. Over 15% of all binding sites are unique to hominids and are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways. These elements also harbor more common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) than older binding sites in the human genome. The results demonstrate the ability of this method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and shed light on their roles in shaping variation in gene regulation across species. The approach does not rely on fixed cross-species alignments, which are often of low quality in non-coding regions of the genome, and instead focuses on the increased rate of creation of binding sites along a specific lineage. This method has the potential to provide new insights into the evolution of regulatory elements and their contribution to species-specific traits.
Researchers investigated how light regulates the expression of the period2 (per2) gene in zebrafish, a vertebrate model for studying the circadian clock. They found that light induces the expression of per2 in most zebrafish cell types in vivo and in vitro, and identified a Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the per2 promoter that is necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression. The LRM contains E- and D-box elements, which are critical for its function. The E-box directs circadian clock regulation by mediating BMAL/CLOCK activity, while the D-box confers light-driven expression. The zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF) binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression. TEF mRNA levels are light-inducible, and knockdown of TEF expression attenuates light-driven transcription from the per2 promoter in vivo. These findings support a model where a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression. The study reveals a novel mechanism that combines light-induced and clock-regulated transcriptional control, which may lead to a better understanding of the phenomenon of gated light entrainment of the circadian clock and other photic cellular responses. The LRM sequence is conserved in other vertebrate per2 genes, even in species lacking directly light-sensitive peripheral clocks, and the human LRM can substitute for the zebrafish LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zebrafish cells.
The actin filament-binding protein coronin plays a crucial role in regulating motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite. Research has shown that coronin is essential for efficient transmission of the parasite from mosquitoes to mice, as parasites lacking coronin or expressing mutated coronin exhibit defects in salivary gland invasion and reduced transmission efficiency. The study found that coronin localizes to the periphery of sporozoites in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner and actively contributes to parasite motility through actin filament-binding. In the absence of coronin, sporozoites frequently detach from the substrate and struggle to re-attach, suggesting a function for coronin in adhesion formation. The data suggest a crucial interplay between TRAP-family adhesins, actin filaments, and actin-regulating proteins for adhesion formation as a prerequisite for sporozoite migration. The study also found that protein kinase A contributes to actin filament disassembly, and that calcium and cAMP-mediated signaling regulate a switch from rapid parasite motility to host cell invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics. Overall, the research highlights the importance of coronin in regulating motility and transmission of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites.
Amphotericin B (AmB) is a crucial treatment for leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. However, the emergence of resistance to this drug is a significant concern due to the limited availability of alternative treatments. Researchers have identified four novel AmB-resistant Leishmania mexicana lines, which exhibit altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that one line had a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol C5-desaturase, while three lines showed reduced expression of sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT), a gene responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. SMT is encoded by two tandem gene copies with different expression levels, and reduced overall expression was associated with the loss of the 3' untranslated region of the dominant gene copy due to structural variations at the locus. These variations were linked to local regions of sequence homology and the presence of SIDER1 retrotransposon elements that promote multi-gene amplification. The loss of SMT expression was not associated with a loss of virulence in primary macrophages or in vivo in at least one case. This study highlights the potential for genomic instability at the SMT locus to contribute to AmB resistance in Leishmania parasites, which could have significant implications for the treatment of leishmaniasis.
Researchers investigated how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain. They used electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity from human observers performing a simple visual task. Participants attended or ignored a stream of gratings with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable orientations. The results showed that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features. Attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain, particularly for mismatch information evoked by surprising stimuli. This finding supports a recent version of predictive coding theory, which proposes that attention optimizes the expected precision of predictions by increasing the gain of prediction errors.

The study found a significant effect of attention on mismatch response profiles in response to surprising stimuli, but not unpredictable stimuli. This suggests that attention boosts mismatch prediction errors evoked by surprising stimuli. The results are consistent with the "mismatch information model," which proposes that attention optimizes the expected precision of predictions by modulating the synaptic gain of prediction error units. The study's findings advance our understanding of how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain and support the theory that attention optimizes precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.
Researchers investigated the differences in resistance to killing by trypanolytic factor 1 (TLF-1) between two sub-groups of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, a parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans. T. b. brucei is unable to infect humans due to its sensitivity to TLF-1 found in human serum, while T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense are resistant to lysis by TLF-1. The two sub-groups of T. b. gambiense, group 1 and group 2, differ genetically and in their human serum resistance phenotypes. Previous studies suggested that group 1 T. b. gambiense is resistant to TLF-1 due to reduced uptake of TLF-1 mediated by reduced expression of the TLF-1 receptor gene, haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HpHbR). However, this study found that group 2 T. b. gambiense also expresses the HpHbR gene at similar levels and internalizes fluorescently labeled TLF-1 in a similar fashion to T. b. brucei. Despite this, group 2 T. b. gambiense is innately resistant to the main lytic component of TLF-1, APOL1. The study suggests that group 1 and group 2 T. b. gambiense have different mechanisms of human serum resistance, with group 1 avoiding TLF-1 and group 2 being innately resistant to APOL1.
Researchers have investigated the role of DNA methylation in controlling HIV-1 latency, a state in which the virus remains dormant within infected cells. They found that methylation of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) acts as an additional epigenetic restriction mechanism, controlling the virus's resistance to reactivation signals and determining the stability of latency. This mechanism is not required for the initial silencing of the virus, but rather acts as a late event during the establishment of latency. The study used an in vitro model of reactivable latency and a latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected patients to demonstrate the role of CpG methylation in controlling HIV-1 latency. The results showed that the latent reservoir of some patients contained high proportions of non-methylated 5' LTR, while the latency controlled solely by transcriptional interference and chromatin-dependent mechanisms was leaky and easily reactivable. In contrast, the latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected individuals without detectable plasma viremia contained hypermethylated HIV-1 promoters and enhancers, which were resistant to reactivation. However, even dense methylation of the HIV-1 5' LTR did not confer complete resistance to reactivation with certain histone deacetylase inhibitors and protein kinase C agonists. The study proposes a two-step model of epigenetic control of HIV-1 latency, highlighting the importance of CpG methylation in maintaining the latency of HIV-1 proviruses and its potential implications for strategies aimed at eradicating HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have created a comprehensive catalog of genetic variations in Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism commonly used in scientific research. The catalog includes over 3.6 million distinct genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and complex variants. These variations were identified in 39 inbred lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) using next-generation sequencing technology.

The study found that the density of genetic variations is higher near other variations, but this is not due to the variations themselves being mutagenic. Instead, the increased density is likely the result of population-level processes. The researchers also mapped cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) for over 2,000 genes, which revealed that insertions and deletions have a larger impact on gene expression than SNPs.

Interestingly, the study found that most cis-eQTLs are sex-specific, indicating a partial decoupling of the genomic architecture between males and females. This suggests that genetic factors play a significant role in mediating sex-biased gene expression in Drosophila. Additionally, the researchers validated the majority of strong cis-eQTLs in heterozygous individuals using RNA-seq-based allelic expression imbalance analyses.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the complexity and evolution of the cis-regulatory architecture of gene expression in Drosophila. The comprehensive catalog of genetic variations will serve as a valuable resource for future research on the genetic basis of phenotypic variation in this model organism.
Researchers investigated the impact of amplitude cancellation on the relationship between the neural drive to muscle and the rectified electromyography (EMG) signal. Amplitude cancellation occurs when motor unit action potentials overlap, resulting in a loss of EMG amplitude. This can distort the spectrum of the rectified EMG and its correlation with the neural drive. The study used analytical derivations and a computational model to examine the effect of amplitude cancellation on the correlation between the neural drive and the rectified EMG signal. The results showed that an ideal rectified EMG signal without amplitude cancellation (EMGnc) is a better estimator of the neural drive than the actual rectified EMG signal. However, the correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive decreased linearly with increasing amplitude cancellation. The simulations also found that a stronger neural drive resulted in a stronger correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive, but amplitude cancellation distorted this correlation mainly for low-frequency components of the neural drive. The study concluded that amplitude cancellation impairs the ability of the rectified EMG signal to reflect the neural drive to the muscle, except in conditions with low contraction levels and/or highly variable common synaptic input. The results suggest that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism behind the inhibition of root growth in Arabidopsis plants exposed to aluminium (Al) stress. They found that the YUCCA (YUC) genes, which encode flavin monooxygenase-like proteins, play a crucial role in regulating local auxin biosynthesis in the root apex transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. The study showed that Al stress up-regulates the expression of YUC3, YUC5, YUC7, YUC8, and YUC9 in the root-apex TZ, leading to the accumulation of auxin and subsequent root growth inhibition.

The researchers discovered that ethylene signalling is involved in the regulation of YUC expression in response to Al stress. Increasing or disrupting ethylene signalling resulted in enhanced or reduced up-regulation of YUCs in the root-apex TZ, respectively. Furthermore, the study found that ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) directly regulates YUC9 transcription, and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) acts as a transcriptional activator for YUC5, YUC8, and YUC9. PIF4 promotes Al-inhibited primary root growth by regulating the local expression of YUCs and auxin signalling in the root-apex TZ.

The results suggest that YUCs regulate local auxin biosynthesis in the root-apex TZ, mediating root growth inhibition in response to Al stress. The study highlights a regulatory cascade involving YUCs, ethylene signalling, and PIF4 in the response to Al stress. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying root growth inhibition in plants exposed to Al stress.
Researchers have found that certain peptides from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can suppress the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in rhesus macaques. NK cells are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off viral infections. The SIV peptides bind to a specific molecule called Mamu-A1*002, which is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule on the surface of infected cells. This binding stabilizes the interaction between Mamu-A1*002 and another molecule called Mamu-KIR3DL05, which is an inhibitory receptor on NK cells.

The study found that 28 out of 75 SIV peptides bound by Mamu-A1*002 suppressed the cytolytic activity of NK cells, including three immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes that are previously known to stabilize Mamu-A1*002 tetramer binding to Mamu-KIR3DL05. Substitutions at the C-terminal positions of these peptides changed their effect from inhibitory to disinhibitory, and vice versa, without altering their binding to Mamu-A1*002. The study also found that low concentrations of inhibitory peptides dominated to suppress NK cell responses in assays with mixtures of inhibitory and disinhibitory peptides.

The researchers observed that SIV replication was significantly higher in Mamu-A1*002+ CD4+ lymphocytes co-cultured with Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells than with Mamu-KIR3DL05- NK cells. These findings suggest that viral peptides can modulate NK cell responses by modulating MHC class I interactions with inhibitory KIRs, providing a mechanism by which immunodeficiency viruses may evade NK cell responses.
Bacterial pathogens, such as Haemophilus influenzae, must adapt to dynamic microenvironmental stressors to survive and establish chronic infections. Researchers hypothesized that strains adapted to survive nutrient deprivation are more adept at colonization and establishment of chronic infection. A study investigated the microevolution of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) in response to transient heme-iron restriction. The study found that a mutation in the icc gene resulted in decreased 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity. This mutation led to a significant decrease in the recovery of effusion from ears infected with the icc mutant strain in a preclinical model of NTHI-induced otitis media (OM). In contrast, the icc mutant strain formed significantly more intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) than the parental strain early during experimental OM. The number of IBCs formed by the parental strain increased at later stages of OM, coinciding with the absence of recoverable effusion, suggesting the presence of a mucosal reservoir following resolution of clinical disease. These findings provide insight into NTHI microevolution during nutritional limitation and demonstrate the presence of IBCs in a preclinical model of chronic OM. The study suggests that strains adapted to nutrient limitation may be more adept at colonization and evasion of host immune responses, leading to persistence.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, modulates host iron homeostasis to facilitate iron availability and intracellular survival. Infection of primary macrophages with B. pseudomallei resulted in downregulation of ferroportin, leading to increased iron availability within macrophages. Exogenous modification of iron export function by hepcidin or iron supplementation stimulated B. pseudomallei growth, while the iron chelator deferoxamine reduced bacterial survival. Iron-loaded macrophages exhibited a lower expression of immune-related genes and activation of caspase-1. Infection of mice with B. pseudomallei caused a diminished hepatic ferroportin expression, higher iron retention in the liver, and lower iron levels in the serum. In vivo administration of ferric ammonium citrate promoted bacterial growth and inflammatory response, while limitation of iron availability significantly ameliorated bacterial clearance, attenuated serum cytokine levels, and improved survival of infected mice. The study suggests that modulation of cellular iron balance is a strategy of B. pseudomallei to improve iron acquisition and restrict antibacterial immune effector mechanisms, promoting its intracellular growth. Furthermore, changes in host iron homeostasis can influence susceptibility to melioidosis, and iron chelating drugs may be an additional therapeutic option.
Researchers have developed a new technique called functional mode analysis (FMA) to identify collective motions in proteins that are directly related to their biological function. Traditional methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and normal mode analysis (NMA), can extract large-scale and low-frequency modes, but may not necessarily reveal motions relevant to protein function. FMA addresses this limitation by detecting the collective motion that is maximally correlated to a specific functional quantity, such as a geometric, electrostatic, or chemical observable. This is achieved by analyzing an ensemble of protein structures and their corresponding functional states. Two correlation measures are used: the Pearson correlation coefficient, which assesses linear correlation, and mutual information, which evaluates any kind of interdependence. The technique estimates the motion that is most likely to induce a substantial change in the functional quantity, allowing for the derivation of a model for the functional state in terms of a single collective coordinate. FMA has been applied to various biomolecules, including a polyalanine-helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein, demonstrating its potential to elucidate relations between collective motions and protein function. This approach complements experimental methods and molecular dynamics simulations, providing a new tool for understanding protein dynamics and function.
Researchers studied the order of intron removal from transcripts of the tubA and gapC genes in Euglena gracilis, a type of eukaryotic cell. These genes contain two types of introns: nonconventional and spliceosomal. Nonconventional introns are unique to euglenids and marine diplonemids and do not have the conserved borders characteristic of spliceosomal introns. They form a stable secondary structure but do not resemble self-splicing or tRNA introns. The study found that nonconventional introns are removed rapidly but later than spliceosomal introns. Intermediate products of splicing were analyzed using the PacBio Next Generation Sequencing system. The results suggest that there may be a time gap between the removal of conventional and nonconventional introns. The study provides new insights into the splicing process in euglenids, a group of eukaryotic cells that are distinct from other eukaryotes. Nonconventional introns have been extensively studied in euglenids, but this is the first study to examine the order of intron removal in transcripts containing both types of introns. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution and function of nonconventional introns in euglenids.
Researchers investigated the long-term effects of a mild coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection in infants on the development of the heart. They created a mouse model of juvenile infection with a subclinical dose of CVB3, which showed no immediate symptoms. However, when the infected mice were subjected to cardiac stress in adulthood, they developed cardiac hypertrophy and dilation, indicative of heart failure. The study found that CVB3 efficiently infected cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in the juvenile heart, leading to a significant and sustained reduction in the number of CPCs in the adult heart. This reduction in CPCs impaired the heart's ability to increase capillary density in response to increased load, suggesting a link between juvenile CVB3 infection and the development of heart failure later in life. The researchers also observed that viral protein expression colocalized with c-kit and Sca-1, indicating that CPCs were preferentially targeted for infection in the juvenile heart. The study provides evidence that a self-limited juvenile CVB3 infection may have lasting effects on the ability of adult mice to undergo compensatory vascular remodeling under cardiac stress.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of cell death in macrophages infected with Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis. They found that the pathogen regulates IL-1β and IL-18 production through the NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes, leading to pyroptosis and caspase-1 activation. In the early phase of infection, caspase-1 processing and pyroptosis were found to be dependent on NLRC4, but not NLRP3. A pathway involving caspases-9, -7, and PARP was identified downstream of NLRC4 and caspase-1. However, at later time points, caspase-1 activation and cell death became NLRC4-independent. The researchers also found that caspase-1/11-deficient macrophages underwent apoptosis, which was dependent on the activation of apoptotic initiator and effector caspases. The flagellin FliC and T3SS3 effector protein BopE were found to play a role in caspase-1 processing, while a T3SS3 inner rod protein BsaK mutant failed to activate caspase-1, leading to reduced cell death and IL-1β secretion. Intranasal infection of mice with the BsaK mutant resulted in decreased mortality, lower bacterial loads, and reduced inflammation. The study suggests a major role for the T3SS3 in early NLRC4-mediated caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis, and a contribution of late caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death mechanisms in the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei infection.
Researchers investigated the role of the Arabidopsis KINβγ subunit of the SNF1-related protein kinase 1 complex in pollen germination on the stigma. They found that KINβγ is a cytoplasm- and nucleus-localized protein in the vegetative cells of pollen grains. The pollen of the Arabidopsis kinβγ mutant could not germinate on the stigma, although it germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed that the hydration of kinβγ mutant pollen on the stigma was compromised. The addition of water to the stigma promoted the germination of the mutant pollen in vivo, suggesting that the compromised hydration of the mutant pollen led to its defective germination. The researchers also found that the kinβγ mutant exhibited reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pollen. The addition of H2O2 in vitro partially compensated for the reduced water absorption of the mutant pollen, and reducing ROS levels in pollen by overexpressing Arabidopsis CATALASE 3 resulted in compromised hydration of pollen on the stigma. These results indicate that Arabidopsis KINβγ is critical for the regulation of ROS levels by mediating the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is required for pollen-stigma interactions during pollination. The study provides new insights into the mechanism underlying the interactions between the pollen and the stigma.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the enzyme RNase III plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from the expression of toxin genes carried by two prophages, Skin and SPβ, through the degradation of antisense RNA. Unlike in other bacteria, the RNase III gene is essential for the survival of B. subtilis, and its absence leads to the expression of these toxin genes. The toxin-encoding mRNAs, txpA and yonT, are specifically targeted by RNase III for degradation, preventing their translation into toxic proteins. In the absence of these prophages or the toxin-encoding mRNAs, the deletion of the RNase III gene does not significantly affect the growth rate of the bacteria. The essential function of RNase III in B. subtilis is distinct from its role in ribosomal RNA maturation and mRNA turnover in other bacteria. The enzyme is not required for the final steps of rRNA maturation, and its contribution to the stability of antisense RNAs is minor. This study highlights the unique role of RNase III in B. subtilis as a key component of the host defense mechanism against viral infection. The findings suggest that RNase III-mediated degradation of toxin-encoding mRNAs is essential for the survival of B. subtilis in the presence of the Skin and SPβ prophages.
Researchers have investigated the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by the filarial nematode Brugia malayi, a parasite responsible for Lymphatic Filariasis. The study aimed to profile EV release across all life stages of the parasite, including microfilariae, L3, L4, adult male, and female worms. Using Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, the researchers found that EVs were released by all life stages, with discrete vesicle populations and a conserved secretory process. The EVs were internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for life stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector molecule trafficking.

Proteomic profiling of adult male and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the adult EV proteome, indicating sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomodulatory cargo. The study also found that ivermectin, a commonly used anti-filarial drug, rapidly inhibited EV release by all Brugia life stages. This effect was also observed in the related filarial nematode Dirofilaria immitis, but not in an ivermectin-unresponsive field isolate, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for this drug. The findings provide new insights into the biogenesis of Brugia EVs and highlight the potential for ivermectin to target EV release as a mechanism of action.
A population-based survey conducted in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands found that scabies and impetigo are highly prevalent in the region. The study, which included 1908 participants from ten rural villages, reported a total unweighted prevalence of scabies at 19.2% and active impetigo at 32.7%. The prevalence of scabies was highest in infants under one year of age, at 34.1%, and in children aged 1-4 years, at 25.7%. Impetigo prevalence was also highest in children aged 1-4 years, at 42.6%. The study found a strong association between scabies infestation and active impetigo infection, with 41.1% of active impetigo cases also having scabies. Scabies affected two or more body regions in 80.9% of participants, and 4.4% of scabies cases were classified as severe. The study suggests that community control strategies for scabies may reduce the burden of both conditions and their downstream complications. The findings are consistent with previous studies in the Pacific region, which have reported high prevalence rates of scabies and impetigo. The study highlights the need for further development of standardized clinical criteria and algorithms for the diagnosis of scabies and impetigo in field settings to facilitate more accurate data collection and comparisons of global epidemiological data.
A recent study investigated the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the adult hippocampus of mice. The research found a significant correlation between the proportions of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus. This correlation was driven by shared genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2Ea locus, which had a dominant influence on T cell subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. The study used a large stock of outbred mice to analyze the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus. The results showed that higher levels of hippocampal proliferation were associated with a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells and lower proportions of CD4+ T cells, resulting in a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio. This correlation accounted for about 6% of the phenotypic variance. The study's findings suggest that CD4+ T cells or subpopulations thereof mediate the effect of T cells on adult neurogenesis. The research extends previous observations that T cells contribute to variation in adult neurogenesis and reveals a broader role for T cell function on adult neurogenesis than previously suspected. The study's use of naturally occurring genetic variation in outbred mice provides a more physiologically relevant setting than the use of knockout mice.
Researchers have developed a vaccine called TcVac2 to combat Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in the US. The vaccine is a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine that targets specific antigens identified through computational analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi sequence database. In a murine model, mice were immunized with TcVac2 and then challenged with T. cruzi trypomastigotes. The results showed that TcVac2 induced a strong antigen-specific antibody response and a moderate level of lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon challenge infection, TcVac2-vaccinated mice expanded the IgG2b/IgG1 antibodies and elicited a substantial CD8+ T cell response associated with type 1 cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) that resulted in control of acute parasite burden. During the chronic phase, the antibody response persisted, and the tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in the heart and skeletal muscle of TcVac2-vaccinated mice were undetectable by histological techniques. In contrast, mice injected with vector or cytokines only responded to T. cruzi by eliciting a mixed (type 1/type 2) antibody, T cell, and cytokine response, and exhibited persistent parasite burden and immunopathology in the myocardium. The study demonstrates that TcVac2-induced activation of type 1 antibody and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute T. cruzi infection and prevented the evolution of chronic immunopathology associated with parasite persistence in chagasic hearts.
Researchers have used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic loci associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but a remaining challenge is to quantify individual disease risk based on genotype data. A team of scientists applied a machine-learning approach called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to a GWAS dataset for T1D and optimized a risk assessment model using hundreds of markers. They tested this model on two independent datasets, one genotyped on the Illumina platform and the other on the Affymetrix platform, and achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of approximately 0.84 in both datasets. In contrast, using only a limited number of known susceptibility loci resulted in poor performance. The study suggests that using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers can improve disease risk assessment. The researchers are optimistic that genotype-based disease risk assessment may be feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of the risk has already been captured by SNP arrays. The SVM algorithm achieved satisfactory performance when hundreds of SNPs were included in prediction models, with AUC scores of approximately 0.84 for predicting disease risk for T1D in several GWAS datasets.
Research has shown that memory CD8+ T cells in the circulation can rapidly infiltrate non-lymphoid tissues, such as the skin, to provide protective immunity against viral infections. However, the fate of these memory CD8+ T cells after entering non-lymphoid tissues during a secondary infection was not well understood. A recent study investigated the role of CD62L-mediated lymph node homing in the trafficking of memory CD8+ T cells into the skin during a viral infection. The study found that memory CD8+ T cells can traffic into the skin independently of CD62L-mediated lymph node re-activation and provide robust protective immunity against Vaccinia virus (VacV) infection. Central memory (TCM) CD8+ T cells, but not effector memory (TEM) CD8+ T cells, differentiated into functional CD69+/CD103- tissue residents following viral clearance, which was dependent on local recognition of antigen in the skin microenvironment. The study also found that memory CD8+ T cells expressed granzyme B after trafficking into the skin and utilized cytolysis to provide protective immunity against VacV infection. These findings demonstrate that TCM CD8+ T cells become cytolytic following rapid infiltration of the skin to protect against viral infection and subsequently differentiate into functional CD69+ tissue-residents. This research provides new insights into the protective mechanisms used by circulating memory CD8+ T cells during a secondary viral infection in peripheral tissues.
Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor protein, plays a crucial role in the localization of proteins on the surface of axons in neurons. Unlike Myosin Va, which targets proteins to dendrites, Myosin VI is involved in the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface. Researchers engineered a non-neuronal protein, CD8, to interact with Myosin VI and found that it became highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated rat cortical neurons. Conversely, disrupting Myosin VI function or expression led to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. The study suggests that Myosin VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis, a mechanism that underlies the localization of many axonal proteins. Additionally, a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myosin VI was concentrated at the surface of the axon of cortical neurons in mice in vivo, indicating its potential as a tool for probing circuit structure and function. The findings indicate that myosins contribute to the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins, playing a role in specifying the polarized structure of neurons necessary for proper electrical signaling.
Researchers have identified two Doublesex (Dsx) genes, DapmaDsx1 and DapmaDsx2, in the freshwater branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna, which exhibits environmental sex determination (ESD). DapmaDsx1 is responsible for male trait development when expressed during ESD, and its domain organization is similar to that of Dsx from insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. However, the molecular basis for the sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaDsx1 differs from that of insects, as it exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in transcript abundance rather than sex-specific pre-mRNA splicing. During embryogenesis, DapmaDsx1 expression is increased only in males, and its transcripts are primarily detected in male-specific structures. Knockdown of DapmaDsx1 in male embryos resulted in the production of female traits, including ovarian maturation, while ectopic expression of DapmaDsx1 in female embryos resulted in the development of male-like phenotypes. The expression patterns of DapmaDsx2 were similar to those of DapmaDsx1, but silencing and overexpression of this gene did not induce any clear phenotypic changes. These findings establish DapmaDsx1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype and reveal how ESD is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component that is functionally conserved in animals using genetic sex determination (GSD).
Researchers have developed a genital herpes vaccine that has shown promising results in preventing the disease in animal models. The vaccine, which targets the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), is a trivalent subunit antigen vaccine that contains glycoproteins C, D, and E (gC2, gD2, gE2). These glycoproteins play a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect cells and evade the immune system. The vaccine was tested in rhesus macaques and guinea pigs to evaluate its immunogenicity and efficacy.

In rhesus macaques, the trivalent vaccine induced the production of neutralizing antibodies, antibodies that block the immune evasion activities of gC2 and gE2, and stimulated CD4 T cell responses. When challenged with HSV-2, the immunized macaques showed a self-limited vaginal infection of brief duration, whereas naïve macaques developed a more severe infection.

In guinea pigs, the trivalent vaccine was highly efficacious in preventing genital lesions, with 97% efficacy in the trivalent vaccine group and 99% efficacy in the group that received a booster dose of gD2 in addition to the trivalent vaccine. The vaccine also reduced the shedding of HSV-2 DNA and replication-competent virus in the vaginal swabs of immunized animals. Overall, the results suggest that the trivalent vaccine has outstanding potential for preventing genital herpes in humans.
Researchers have developed a new method called Perm-seq to map protein-DNA interactions in regions of the genome that are difficult to study due to their repetitive nature. These regions, known as segmental duplications, play a significant role in cells' regulatory programs. Traditional methods for analyzing protein-DNA interactions, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), struggle to accurately map interactions in these regions because short reads from these areas can map to multiple locations in the reference genome.

The Perm-seq method uses additional data types, including DNase-seq and histone ChIP-seq, to improve the accuracy of read mapping in repetitive regions. By incorporating these data sources, Perm-seq can allocate multi-mapping reads with high accuracy, reducing false positive and negative rates. The method was comprehensively evaluated and found to significantly improve multi-read allocation accuracy compared to approaches that do not utilize additional data types.

Perm-seq was applied to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from two cell types, GM12878 and K562, and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Analysis of these interactions revealed that, despite being less conserved evolutionarily, they share similar sequence characteristics with protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions. The Perm-seq framework is highly versatile and can incorporate multiple sources of data, including histone ChIP-seq, for read allocation.
A nested case-control study was conducted to investigate the effects of schistosomiasis on susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and HIV-1 viral load at HIV-1 seroconversion. The study took place in Tanzania, where approximately 40% of the population has Schistosoma mansoni infection and 2% has S. haematobium infection. The researchers analyzed dried blood spots from 73 HIV-1 seroconverters and 265 matched controls who did not acquire HIV-1. The study found that women with schistosome infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than those without, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.8 (1.2-6.6, p=0.019). In contrast, schistosome-infected men did not have an increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition. Additionally, the study found that HIV-1 seroconverters with schistosomiasis had higher HIV-1 viral loads at the time of seroconversion, with a median whole blood HIV-1 RNA level of 4.4 log10 copies/mL compared to 3.7 log10 copies/mL in those without schistosomiasis (p=0.017). The study suggests that pre-existing schistosome infection increases the susceptibility of women to HIV-1 acquisition and raises HIV-1 viral load at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of schistosome infection on HIV-1 susceptibility and viral control, and to differentiate effects by gender.
Researchers investigated the copy number and sequence of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in human and mouse genomes, particularly in cancer states. They used computational and droplet digital PCR approaches to measure rDNA copy number in normal and cancerous tissues. The study found that rDNA copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Contrary to expectations, human cancer genomes showed a loss of rDNA copies, accompanied by global copy number co-variation. This loss was also observed in hematopoietic cancer stem cells from a Pten-/- mouse model for leukemia, despite increased proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis.

The researchers discovered that cancer genomes with lower rDNA copies had mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity. The PTEN phosphatase, a tumor suppressor, is critical for genome stability and negatively regulates the mTOR kinase pathway. Loss of rDNA copies occurred early in cancer development and was associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage. The study suggests that rDNA copy number may be a simple and useful indicator of whether a cancer will be sensitive to DNA-damaging treatments.

In a mouse model for Pten-/- leukemia, rDNA copy number was reduced in cancer stem cells with mTOR activation, providing evidence that copy number can be altered in a natural system. The study also found co-occurring increased copy number of additional genes and evidence for single nucleotide variation in the repeats. These findings suggest that targeting rDNA loci may be a potential therapeutic strategy, particularly in cancer stem cells with low rDNA copy number.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to study the dynamics of bacterial growth and spread within a mammalian host during an infection. By using genetically identical but distinguishable bacterial strains, known as wild-type isogenic tagged strains (WITS), they were able to track the movement and behavior of individual bacterial populations within the host. This method allowed the researchers to estimate the rate of bacterial death and replication, as well as the timing and relative occurrence of key infection parameters, such as the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs.

The study, which focused on Salmonella enterica infections in mice, revealed that shortly after infection, bacterial death and rapid replication occur simultaneously, leading to the establishment of separate bacterial populations in different organs. As the infection progresses, the rate of bacterial mortality decreases, resulting in an exponential increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally and mix between organs through the bloodstream. This process is influenced by the host's antimicrobial mechanisms and leads to further stochastic selection of bacterial subpopulations.

The researchers' approach provides new insights into the complex spatial and stochastic effects that drive an infectious disease. By applying this method to various host-pathogen combinations and modeling the resulting data, it is possible to gain a comprehensive understanding of the within-host dynamics of bacterial infections. This knowledge can be used to develop more accurate mathematical models, generate new research hypotheses, and make quantitative predictions about the behavior of bacterial populations during an infection.
Existing models of 3D motion perception, such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity, are insufficient to solve the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion. This is due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem and the under-determined characteristics of local binocular motion constraints. A more flexible framework for solving the inverse problem is proposed, which combines local velocity constraints with binocular disparity and other depth cues. In the context of the aperture problem, two plausible default strategies are derived: the vector normal prefers slow motion in 3D, while the cyclopean average is based on slow motion in 2D. Predicting perceived motion directions for ambiguous line motion allows for the distinction between these strategies of 3D motion processing. Theoretical results suggest that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are necessary to solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. Parallel processing and late integration of motion and disparity, as well as other cues, appear to be a convincing solution to the inverse problem. This approach allows the visual system to remain flexible when binding and segmenting local inputs from different processing stages into a global 3D motion percept. The intersection of two constraint planes in a given binocular viewing geometry defines a constraint line oriented in 3D velocity space, providing a flexible strategy to disambiguate 3D motion direction and solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception.
Researchers have investigated the roles of AlgJ and AlgX, two proteins involved in the O-acetylation of alginate, a polysaccharide secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. The O-acetylation of alginate is a common modification used by pathogenic organisms to protect against external forces. The study aimed to determine the structure and function of AlgJ, a SGNH hydrolase-like protein, to understand its role in alginate acetylation.

The researchers determined the structure of AlgJ to 1.83 Å resolution and identified a conserved catalytic triad composed of D190, H192, and S288, which is consistent with other SGNH hydrolases. They demonstrated that AlgJ exhibits acetylesterase activity in vitro and identified residues in the AlgJ signature motifs that form an extensive network of interactions critical for O-acetylation of alginate in vivo. In contrast, AlgX, a two-domain protein with an N-terminal SGNH hydrolase-like domain and a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module, was found to bind polymannuronic acid specifically in a length-dependent manner and utilize the surrogate acetyl-donor 4-nitrophenyl acetate to catalyze the O-acetylation of polymannuronic acid.

The results suggest that AlgJ and AlgX have separate and distinct roles in O-acetylation, with AlgX acting as the terminal acetyltransferase. The study provides a refined model for alginate acetylation and sheds light on the variability in the number of proteins required for polysaccharide O-acetylation.
Candida albicans, a common cause of human fungal infections, can evade detection by the immune system by masking its cell wall component β(1,3)-glucan with an outer layer of glycosylated mannoproteins. However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of β(1,3)-glucan, enhancing its detection by innate immune cells. Research has shown that the phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) plays a role in β(1,3)-glucan masking, and a mutant lacking the PS synthase enzyme (Cho1) exhibits increased exposure of β(1,3)-glucan. The study found that the Cek1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is activated in the Cho1 mutant and is responsible for β(1,3)-glucan unmasking. The Cek1 pathway is activated downstream of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rho1, which are involved in cell wall biogenesis and remodeling. Hyperactivation of Rho1 in wild-type cells increases β(1,3)-glucan exposure and activation of both Cek1 and Mkc1 MAPKs. Additionally, independent hyperactivation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Ste11 leads to Cek1 activation and increased β(1,3)-glucan exposure. These findings suggest that upregulation of the Cek1 MAPK pathway is responsible for β(1,3)-glucan unmasking in the Cho1 mutant and may be a key factor in the detection of Candida albicans by the immune system.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies to investigate the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The study aimed to identify genetic risk loci associated with clinico-pathologic AD dementia, core neuropathologic features of AD, and co-morbid neuropathologic changes. Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuritic plaques (NPs), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and Lewy body disease (LBD). Variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) were strongly associated with these features.

Twelve of the 21 non-APOE genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in the study, including CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4. Nine of these 12 loci showed larger odds ratios in the clinico-pathologic sample. The study also discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features, including GALNT7, ABCG1, and KCNMB2, which were associated with NPs, CAA, and hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), respectively.

The study found a positive correlation between the effect sizes for risk of AD dementia and NFTs or NPs, and a moderate negative correlation with vascular brain injury (VBI). The results suggest that genetic risk loci for AD dementia are associated with specific neuropathologic features, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these characteristic lesions.
Researchers have long used urea as a denaturant to study protein folding and unfolding, but the exact role of urea in this process has remained unclear. A recent study used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effects of urea on 30 proteins with different native folds, secondary structures, and disulfide bridges. The results show that urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of proteins, but with a lower density than in the fully unfolded state. Contrary to previous assumptions, urea does not alter the spontaneous vibration patterns of proteins, but rather reduces their magnitude, slowing down atomic motions that oppose unfolding. The study found that urea's "stickiness" and slow diffusion are crucial for unfolding, as it stabilizes partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Urea molecules placed near the hydrophobic core of the protein are particularly important in this process. The simulations indicate that urea does not simply displace the folded-unfolded equilibrium, but rather actively favors unfolding by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded microstates, driving the protein conformational ensemble away from the native state. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of urea's role in destabilizing folded states of proteins and accelerating protein unfolding. The findings suggest that urea's denaturing properties are not solely due to its interactions with exposed protein residues, but rather involve a complex interplay of van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions.
A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia from 2000 to 2011. The review included 30 studies that met the inclusion criteria and analyzed data on incidence, seroprevalence, and serotype distribution. The results showed a stable "baseline" annual number of dengue fever cases, punctuated by major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The geographical spread of dengue disease cases increased over the review period, with most of the country affected by the 2010 outbreak. The majority of dengue cases were among individuals under 15 years of age.

The review highlighted gaps in epidemiological knowledge regarding dengue disease in Colombia, including the rates of asymptomatic dengue virus infection, primary and secondary dengue virus infections, and under-reporting of the disease. Improved surveillance methods for dengue disease are needed to address these gaps. The incidence of dengue disease was generally low in south and south-east Colombia, likely due to the region's low population density.

Dengue disease is a significant public health concern in Colombia, and control of the disease has been challenging. The review found a general increase in the annual number of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases between 2000 and 2010, followed by a significant decrease in 2011. Overall, the review provides an overview of the epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia and highlights the need for further research to improve understanding and control of the disease.
Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL), a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, often co-occurs with other pathogens in human populations. This review examines the frequency of TL coinfections, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and the implications for clinical practice. A comprehensive search of medical literature identified 73 records, including 21 experimental studies in animals and 52 studies on human subjects. The review found that coinfections with Trypanosoma cruzi (41% in Argentina) and helminthiasis (15-88% in Brazil) are common in TL patients. However, the mechanisms of interaction between different microorganisms are not well understood and may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting the quality and quantity of acquired immune responses. Coinfections can lead to diagnostic errors and delays, and may reduce the effectiveness of antileishmanial treatment. Some coinfections, such as helminthiasis, can also cause cumulative adverse effects when combined with antileishmanial drugs. The review highlights the need for further research to understand how coinfections influence the pathogenesis of TL.
Researchers investigated the impact of genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment and MHC expression in rats. They used two genetic models, the NIH-Heterogenous Stock (HS) and a panel of MHC-recombinant congenic strains, to map Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein expression and the CD4∶CD8 T cell ratio. The study identified 10 QTLs across the genome, with QTLs for individual traits colocalizing within a region spanning the MHC. The researchers refined the QTLs to two adjacent intervals of approximately 0.25 Mb in the MHC-I and II regions. An interaction between these intervals affected MHC class I expression, as well as negative selection and lineage commitment of CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes. The effect was mapped to the transporter associated with antigen processing 2 (Tap2) in the MHC-II region and the classical MHC class I gene (s) (RT1-A) in the MHC-I region. A recombination between RT1-A and Tap2, which occurred in 0.2% of the rats, revealed an interaction between these genes. Variants of Tap2 have previously been shown to influence the antigenicity of MHC class I molecules by altering the MHC class I ligandome. The study found that a restricted peptide repertoire on MHC class I molecules leads to reduced negative selection of CD8SP cells. This is the first study to show how a recombination between natural alleles of genes in the MHC influences lineage commitment of T cells.
Researchers analyzed hospital discharge records in Spain from 1997 to 2011 to study the evolution of Chagas disease, a tropical illness prevalent in Latin America. Spain is the European country with the highest expected number of infected patients due to its large number of migrants from Latin America. The study found that hospitalization rates for Chagas disease increased from 18 per 100,000 population in 1997-2004 to 242.8 per 100,000 in 2005-2011. The majority of hospitalizations (75.3%) were related to Chagas disease without organ complications, while 23.4% involved organ complications, with heart complications being the most common (81.7%). The study also found that being male, aged 45-64 years, and having a higher hospitalization cost were associated with a higher risk of organ complications. The majority of patients (74%) were female, and the 16-45 age group was most represented. The study highlights the need for increased efforts towards early detection of Chagas disease, particularly among asymptomatic women of childbearing age. The findings suggest that the number of detected infections increased in Spain since 2005, indicating a growing public health concern. The study emphasizes the importance of a systematic approach towards disease detection and control to mitigate the impact of Chagas disease in Spain.
Researchers have developed a novel systems-level approach called BlocBuster to identify combinatorial interactions of genetic factors that contribute to complex diseases. This method efficiently constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks that accurately segregate homogeneous combinations of genetic factors and tests their associations with a given phenotype. BlocBuster was applied to analyze psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune skin disease, and discovered a combinatorial pattern of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that is significantly associated with the disease. This pattern, known as ps_1, has an odds ratio of 3.64 and a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5.01×10−16, indicating a strong association with psoriasis. The pattern was replicated in independent data, demonstrating the robustness of the method. The BlocBuster approach improves upon previous results by providing a precise allelic pattern within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, which is a diverse genomic region. In contrast, individual SNPs examined in isolation have odds ratios of up to 2.41, highlighting the limitations of conventional genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The discovery of this combinatorial pattern not only improves the prediction of disease susceptibility but also broadens our understanding of the pathogenesis underlying psoriasis. BlocBuster's ability to identify combinatorial genetic associations within heterogeneous genome-wide data has the potential to transcend the limitations of "small effects" produced by individual markers examined in isolation.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study to investigate the genetic causes of three severe congenital brain malformations: agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH), and polymicrogyria (PMG). They analyzed chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) in 255 ACC, 220 CBLH, and 147 PMG patients, as well as 2,349 control individuals. The study found that patients with ACC had a significantly higher prevalence of rare genic CNVs, which are CNVs that impact at least one gene in less than 1% of the population, compared to controls. Specifically, 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which are CNVs that occur for the first time in a family. These de novo CNVs were more likely to overlap with those previously observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders. In contrast, the burden of rare CNVs was not significantly different in patients with CBLH or PMG compared to controls. The study also identified six novel CNVs, each in a single patient, that are likely to be deleterious. Furthermore, the researchers confirmed and refined previously known CNVs, including the 8p23.1-p11.1 duplication present in 2% of the ACC cohort. This study provides new insights into the genetic causes of ACC and highlights the importance of investigating CNVs in patients with brain malformations.
Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling cascade, plays a crucial role in regulating the injury response in planarians. Researchers studied the effects of Yorkie (Yki) RNA interference (RNAi) in Schmidtea mediterranea, a freshwater planarian species known for its high regenerative capacity. They found that Yki RNAi animals exhibited hyper-activated and prolonged wound responses, characterized by increased stem cell proliferation and transcriptional wound response. Despite increased proliferation, stem cells in Yki RNAi animals showed no block in differentiation and produced more epidermal and muscle cells.

The study suggests that Yki functions as a key molecule that integrates multiple aspects of the injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning. The researchers propose that Yki RNAi causes the de-repression of the wound program, leading to increased stem cell response through extrinsic signals. They also identified novel wound-induced genes that were de-repressed in Yki RNAi animals compared to controls.

Furthermore, the study found that Yki RNAi animals had expanded epidermal and muscle cell populations, which are thought to be the increased sources of wound-induced genes. The researchers also observed that Yki RNAi animals failed to remodel or scale correctly to the size of the regenerating fragment, suggesting that Yki plays a critical role in sensing the size of an injury and patterning the regenerating tissue. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Yki in regulating the injury response and tissue patterning in planarians.
Researchers have found that exosomes, small vesicles released by cells, play a significant role in the transmission of the EV71 virus, a common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children. When EV71 infects a cell, it triggers the release of exosomes that contain viral RNA and a specific microRNA called miR-146a. This microRNA is known to suppress the type I interferon response, a key part of the immune system's defense against viral infections.

The study found that the exosomes released by EV71-infected cells selectively package high levels of miR-146a, which is then transferred to and facilitates the replication of the viral RNA in new target cells. This occurs because the miR-146a suppresses the type I interferon response in the target cell, allowing the virus to replicate more easily.

The researchers also discovered that the IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGs), including BST-2/tetherin, are involved in regulating the upregulation of exosome secretion in response to EV71 infection. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that exosomal viral RNA accumulates differentially in various tissues compared to free virus particles.

Overall, the study provides evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package miR-146a, which can be functionally transferred to and facilitate the replication of exosomal EV71 RNA in recipient cells by suppressing the type I interferon response.
Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin, two proteins implicated in early-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). PINK1 is a serine/threonine kinase with a predicted mitochondrial target sequence, while Parkin is a RING-finger protein with ubiquitin-ligase (E3) activity. Studies in Drosophila have suggested that Parkin functions downstream of the PINK1 signaling pathway. To explore the interaction between PINK1 and Parkin, the researchers biochemically purified PINK1-binding proteins from human cultured cells and screened the genes encoding these binding proteins using Drosophila PINK1 (dPINK1) models. They identified a PINK1-binding mitochondrial protein, PGAM5, which modulates the PINK1 pathway. Loss of Drosophila PGAM5 (dPGAM5) suppressed the muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan caused by dPINK1 inactivation, which is attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. However, dPGAM5 inactivation failed to modulate the phenotypes of parkin mutant flies. Conversely, ectopic expression of dPGAM5 exacerbated the dPINK1 and Drosophila parkin (dParkin) phenotypes. These results suggest that PGAM5 negatively regulates the PINK1 pathway related to the maintenance of mitochondria and that PGAM5 acts between PINK1 and Parkin or functions independently of Parkin downstream of PINK1. Further research is needed to determine how PGAM5 regulates the PINK1 pathway at the molecular level and whether manipulation of PGAM5 activity might provide a therapeutic advantage in treating PINK1-associated PD.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-γ (IFNγ) in the immune response against Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), a chronic skin disease. They used an experimental mouse model to study the progression of the infection in wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking IFNγ (IFNγ-/-). The results showed that IFNγ plays a crucial role in early host immune defense against M. ulcerans infection. Mice lacking IFNγ had a faster progression of the infection, characterized by faster and more extensive tissue necrosis and oedema formation, as well as a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This suggests that IFNγ is essential for killing intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. The study supports the idea that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for BU. The findings are consistent with previous reports of spontaneous healing of BU and a partial protective effect of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination in humans and experimentally infected mice. The results indicate that cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and IFNγ-dependent activation of macrophages help to contain the infection during its early stages. Overall, the study highlights the importance of IFNγ in early immune defense against M. ulcerans infection.
Researchers have investigated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, which is linked to various systemic diseases. However, the mechanism of ROS generation under hypoxic conditions is not fully understood. To analyze this complex process, a new methodology was developed to construct large sets of differential equations that model electron transport in mitochondria. This approach allowed for the identification of two steady-state modes of operation (bistability) of respiratory complex III at the same environmental conditions. Normally, complex III operates in a low ROS-producing mode, but temporary anoxia can switch it to a high ROS-producing state, which persists even after oxygen supply is restored. This bistability explains the mechanism of anoxia-induced cell damage. Experiments confirmed the existence of two different ROS-producing steady states in isolated mitochondria and the ability to switch between them using ADP and/or episodes of anoxia. The study found that reoxygenation after anoxia resulted in significantly higher ROS levels than at the initial normoxic stage. The developed methodology enables the construction of differential equations for each redox state of complex III, allowing for a detailed mathematical analysis of complex bioenergetic systems. This approach can be expanded to include other parts of the electron transport chain and central metabolism, providing a new direction for studying complex biological systems. The findings have implications for understanding oxidative stress and may lead to novel therapeutic strategies.
Researchers studied the role of the terminal gap gene huckebein (hkb) in the development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. They used a systems-level approach to investigate the regulatory effect of hkb on gap gene expression, which is crucial for specifying the position of body segments. The team presented quantitative expression data for the Hkb protein, enabling them to include hkb in gap gene circuit models. These models are mathematical representations of gene networks used to extract regulatory information from spatial expression data.

The researchers showed that considering variability in the data combined with analysis of parameter determinability significantly improves the biological relevance and consistency of the approach. Their models are in agreement with earlier results and extend them in two important respects. Firstly, they demonstrate that hkb is involved in the regulation of the posterior hunchback (hb) domain, specifically required for the anterior shift in the posterior border of this domain. Secondly, the gap gene circuits presented can reproduce mutants of terminal gap genes, whereas previous models were unable to reproduce any null mutants correctly.

The models now capture the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system correctly. This is an important step towards a better, quantitative understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap gene network.
Researchers have developed a novel immunotherapy for Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease causing significant economic losses worldwide. Currently, there is no effective treatment or biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy, and infected animals remain carriers for life. Two live attenuated vaccine strains, S19 and RB51, were used to create phage lysates, which retain maximum immunogenicity. The phage lysates of S19 (SL) and RB51 (RL) were tested for their immunotherapeutic potential in 21 naturally Brucellosis-affected adult cows. The results showed that SL induced a strong antibody response, while RL stimulated cell-mediated immunity (CMI). In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from RL-immunized cattle induced interferon-gamma production. A single subcutaneous dose of a cocktail lysate (both RL and SL) eliminated live virulent Brucella from infected cattle within 3 months, with undetectable plasma levels of Brucella-specific 223 bp amplicon by RT-PCR and negative blood cultures. This is the first report on the use of RB51 phage lysate for successful immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle and the minimally invasive monitoring of therapy efficacy using plasma RNA specific for live bacteria as a biomarker. The study demonstrates the potential of phage lysates as a safe and effective treatment for Brucellosis in cattle, offering a new approach to controlling this zoonotic disease.
Researchers investigated the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) in the DNA damage response in human cells. They used a mutant version of Cdk2 that is sensitive to inhibition by bulky adenine analogs to uncover a specific requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage. The study found that transient inhibition of Cdk2 after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) enhanced cell-killing, indicating that Cdk2 plays a non-redundant role in the DNA damage response. The researchers also identified Nbs1, a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, as a specific target of Cdk2. Cdk2 phosphorylates Nbs1 at a consensus CDK recognition site, Ser432, which is essential for normal DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling. Inhibition of Cdk2 delayed and diminished Nbs1-Ser432 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased IR-sensitivity. These findings suggest that Cdk2 activity is required for an effective DNA damage response and that Nbs1 is a key substrate of Cdk2 in this process. The study demonstrates the use of chemical genetics to uncover specific functions and targets of Cdk2 in DNA damage response pathways, and highlights the importance of Cdk2 in maintaining genomic integrity.
Researchers used a technique called formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to create maps of open chromatin in two types of cells: megakaryocytes and erythroblastoid cells. These cells are involved in the production of platelets and red blood cells, respectively. The researchers applied this technique to 62 genetic loci associated with various hematological and cardiovascular traits, such as platelet count, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction.

The results showed that the two cell types have distinct patterns of open chromatin, and that cell-specific open chromatin can help identify functional variants associated with these traits. The researchers identified an open chromatin region at chromosome 7q22.3 in megakaryocytes but not erythroblasts, which harbors a common non-coding sequence variant (rs342293) known to be associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing of this region in 643 individuals provided strong evidence that rs342293 is the only putative causative variant in this region.

Further analysis revealed that the C- and G-alleles of rs342293 differentially bind the transcription factor EVI1, affecting the expression of the PIK3CG gene in platelets and macrophages. A protein-protein interaction network showed that PIK3CG is associated with gene pathways involved in platelet membrane biogenesis and thrombus formation. This study provides a molecular mechanism by which a non-coding genome-wide association index SNP modulates platelet phenotype, and is the first such variant to be elucidated among known platelet quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
Researchers used computer simulations to investigate the effects of blocking a persistent sodium current (INaP) in respiratory circuits, which is thought to play a crucial role in rhythm generation in the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC). They simulated the blockade of INaP using two distinct pharmacological mechanisms: tetrodotoxin (TTX) and riluzole (RZ). TTX directly blocks the Na+ pore, while RZ shifts INaP inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction.

The simulations showed that the effects of INaP blockade depend on the pharmacological mechanism of action and network dynamics. In vitro studies using TTX or RZ have suggested that INaP is critical for intrinsic bursting in pacemaker neurons and network rhythm generation in the isolated pre-BötC. However, the simulations predicted that RZ may fail to effectively block INaP in the intact network due to its specific pharmacological mechanism of action and transient inhibitory network interactions.

The results also showed that pre-I bursting in the intact network is likely dependent on both inhibitory network interactions and INaP, and that experimental TTX application in the intact network is predicted to terminate respiratory rhythmicity. The simulations support a critical role for INaP in respiratory rhythmogenesis in vivo and highlight the importance of considering the mechanism of action when interpreting and simulating data relating to pharmacological blockade.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNA-218 (miR-218) in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. They found that miR-218 expression is decreased in metastatic GC, along with its host gene Slit3. However, miR-218 negatively regulates the Robo1 receptor, which is involved in the Slit-Robo1 pathway that promotes tumor metastasis. When miR-218 levels are low, Robo1 is not repressed, allowing the Slit-Robo1 pathway to be activated, leading to tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Restoring miR-218 expression suppressed Robo1 expression and inhibited tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. The study identified a regulatory circuit involving Slit, miR-218, and Robo1 that is disrupted in GC metastasis. Targeting miR-218 may provide a strategy for blocking tumor metastasis. The researchers also found that Robo1 is overexpressed in cancer cells and promotes tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by interacting with Slit. They demonstrated that miR-218 directly regulates Robo1 expression and that Robo1 is a critical downstream target of miR-218. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of GC metastasis and reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of receptor signaling.
Researchers investigated the effects of plasma cholesterol-lowering on atherosclerosis development in mice with human-like hypercholesterolemia. They used a mouse model with a genetic switch to lower plasma lipoproteins and performed transcriptional profiling at 10-week intervals. The study found that atherosclerotic lesions progressed slowly at first, then rapidly expanded, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of lesion expression profiles revealed that the accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages led to the rapid expansion phase with accelerated foam-cell formation and inflammation.

Genetic lowering of plasma cholesterol prevented the formation of advanced plaques, and transcriptional profiling identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA-inhibition in macrophages incubated with acetylated-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-ester accumulation. These genes were found to regulate foam-cell formation and inflammation in the atherosclerotic arterial wall.

The study identified a network of atherosclerosis genes that respond to plasma cholesterol-lowering and prevent the formation of advanced plaques. This network may be of interest for the development of novel atherosclerosis therapies. The researchers also found that the cholesterol-lowering effect was mediated by 37 cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes, and some of these genes, such as PVRL2 and HSDL2, may be considered for therapies to prevent the formation of advanced plaques.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screening method to identify genes involved in the assembly of the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria. The cell envelope is a critical barrier that is difficult for antimicrobial drugs to penetrate, making it challenging to treat infections caused by these bacteria. The screening method, called the CPRG screen, was used to analyze an ordered single-gene deletion library of Escherichia coli and identified 102 genes of unknown function that likely impact envelope biogenesis. One of these genes, ElyC (YcbC), was further characterized and found to play a crucial role in the metabolism of the essential lipid carrier used for the biogenesis of cell wall and other bacterial surface polysaccharides. This discovery highlights the potential of the CPRG screen to uncover new information about the biogenesis of the Gram-negative envelope and identify vulnerabilities in the system that can be targeted by drugs. The screening method is also adaptable to other organisms, allowing researchers to study the biogenesis of different envelope architectures. Further analysis of ElyC and other genes identified in the screen is expected to reveal new mechanisms underlying the envelope assembly process, which could lead to the development of new treatments for Gram-negative bacterial infections. The discovery of ElyC as a new envelope biogenesis factor validates the utility of the CPRG screening approach and has important implications for our understanding of envelope biogenesis and the development of new antimicrobial therapies.
Researchers have been using various techniques to study dynamical processes in biology, each revealing unique aspects of the system. However, integrating heterogeneous datasets into a comprehensive view of multivariable dynamics remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, a semi-supervised learning framework was developed to fuse disparate datasets. This approach leverages the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets, allowing for the creation of a continuous trajectory that captures the joint dynamics of multiple biological processes.

A dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. By combining labeled and unlabeled datasets, a multivariable trajectory was generated, revealing the joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis. This approach can be adapted to other imaging modalities and serves as a starting point for further data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.

The semi-supervised learning framework was applied to a dataset of approximately 1000 images, each showing the spatial position of nuclei and either a timestamp or the distribution of one or several components of the DV patterning network. Pairwise similarities between images were computed using the common channel, and a closed-form expression was obtained for the estimated values of all variables using harmonic extension. The reconstructed trajectories provide a basis for advanced mechanistic studies of multivariable processes responsible for the highly reproducible dynamics of developmental pattern formation.
Researchers compared the effects of three classes of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) - PI, PII, and PIII - on tissue localization and extracellular matrix degradation. The study aimed to understand the mechanisms behind venom-induced hemorrhage. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PII and PIII SVMPs co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules to a greater extent than PI SVMP, which showed a more widespread distribution in the tissue. This suggests that PII and PIII SVMPs are preferentially located in the microvasculature, which may contribute to their high hemorrhagic activity.

The study also found that the three SVMPs had different patterns of hydrolysis of extracellular matrix components, such as laminin, type VI collagen, and nidogen, in vivo. However, they showed a similar pattern of degradation of type IV collagen, which is critical for the destabilization of microvessel structure leading to hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of wound exudate revealed similarities and differences between the action of the three SVMPs, with PI enzyme showing a higher extent of proteolysis of several extracellular matrix components and fibrinogen, while PII and PIII SVMPs had higher amounts of intracellular proteins in the exudate.

These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which SVMPs induce damage to the microvasculature and generate hemorrhage. The study suggests that the selective localization of PII and PIII SVMPs in the microvasculature is a key factor in their high hemorrhagic activity.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the expression of the homeotic gene abd-A is regulated by the noncoding RNA iab-8. The iab-8 RNA produces a microRNA that represses abd-A expression in the epidermis of the eighth abdominal segment, but not in the central nervous system. However, in the absence of Abdominal-B (Abd-B), abd-A is ectopically expressed in the epidermis of the eighth abdominal segment, indicating that Abd-B normally represses abd-A. The iab-8 RNA also has a second, redundant repression mechanism that acts only in cis, or on the same chromosome. This cis-repression is thought to occur through transcriptional interference, where the iab-8 RNA interferes with the abd-A promoter, preventing its expression.

    Studies have shown that the iab-8 RNA interferes with an abd-A enhancer that lies downstream of the iab-4186 breakpoint. The major poly(A) site of the iab-8 RNA is located 1.1 kilobases upstream of the abd-A initiation site, suggesting that the iab-8 RNA primary transcript continues past its poly(A) addition site. The iab-8 RNA can only repress the copy of abd-A on the same chromosome from which it is transcribed, as shown by the lack of abd-A misexpression in embryos with a deletion of the iab-8 RNA and a deletion that removes the entire bithorax complex.

    Rearrangement breaks that truncate the iab-8 RNA near its start site cause a dramatic derepression of abd-A in the central nervous system of the eighth abdominal segment, indicating that the iab-8 RNA plays a crucial role in regulating abd-A expression.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms underlying different onset patterns of focal seizures, which are episodes of abnormal brain activity originating from a localized area of the brain. Two distinct patterns have been identified: low amplitude fast (LAF) oscillations and high amplitude spikes (HAS). Using a computational model of neocortical tissue, the study aimed to determine whether these patterns arise from fundamentally different mechanisms. The model was validated using clinical recordings of focal seizures and was able to reproduce the two onset patterns in their defining properties.

The results showed that LAF onset is initiated by localized patches of activity that slowly invade surrounding tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. This transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of surrounding tissue, which does not generate seizures on its own but can support seizure activity when triggered.

The study found that the difference in surrounding tissue excitability explains the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes between the two patterns. Additionally, the model suggests that changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated using active stimulation. The findings indicate that the excitability of surrounding tissue may play a crucial role in determining the seizure onset pattern and surgical outcome.
In flowering plants, sperm cells are non-motile and are transported to the female gametes via the pollen tube, a structure formed by the male gametophyte. Upon arrival at the female gametophyte, two sperm cells are discharged into the receptive synergid cell to execute double fertilization. Recent studies have identified the first players involved in inter-gametophyte signaling to attract pollen tubes and arrest their growth, but the physiological mechanisms leading to pollen tube burst and sperm discharge remained unclear. This study investigates the role of defensin-like cysteine-rich proteins ZmES1-4 from maize, which are exclusively expressed in the cells of the female gametophyte. The researchers found that ZmES4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner and is released from the synergid cells upon male-female gametophyte signaling. ZmES4 interacts with the intrinsic rectifying K+ channel KZM1, causing it to open and allowing K+ influx. This influx leads to water uptake and culminates in osmotic tube burst. The study suggests that the mechanism described represents a pre-zygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants. The researchers used RNAi knock-down and synthetic ZmES4 proteins to demonstrate the role of ZmES4 in pollen tube growth arrest, burst, and explosive sperm release. The study provides new insights into the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in pollen tube growth and fertilization in flowering plants.
Researchers have developed a targeted oncolytic herpesvirus, R-LM249, that specifically infects and kills cancer cells expressing high levels of the HER-2 protein, which is overexpressed in certain types of ovarian and breast cancers. This virus, retargeted to HER-2, was tested in mouse models that mimic the spread of cancer to the peritoneum, a common outcome in advanced ovarian and breast cancer patients. The results showed that intraperitoneal administration of R-LM249 significantly inhibited the growth of disseminated tumors in the peritoneal cavity, with 60% of mice remaining free from peritoneal diffusion and a 95% reduction in the total weight of neoplastic nodules. The virus also effectively reduced the growth of ovarian and breast carcinoma metastases in the brain. Notably, R-LM249 was effective against HER-2-positive cancer cells that were resistant to the growth inhibition by trastuzumab, a commonly used cancer treatment. The study demonstrates the potential of R-LM249 as a therapeutic agent against disseminated HER-2-positive ovarian and breast cancers, offering a promising approach for the treatment of these aggressive and often fatal diseases.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism that regulates the duplication of centrosomes in yeast cells. Centrosomes, which serve as the poles of the mitotic spindle, must duplicate only once per cell cycle to ensure proper chromosome segregation and bipolar spindle formation. A protein called Sfi1, a conserved component of centrosomes, has been found to be the first substrate of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1) that restricts centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. Phosphorylation of Sfi1 by Cdk1 promotes the separation of duplicated spindle pole bodies (SPBs) and prevents premature reduplication of SPBs during mitosis. Conversely, the protein phosphatase Cdc14 dephosphorylates Sfi1, allowing for the licensing of SPBs for the next cycle of duplication. The study found that mutations in Sfi1 that prevent phosphorylation by Cdk1 lead to defects in SPB separation, bipolar spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. These findings suggest that phosphoregulation of Sfi1 by Cdk1 has a dual function: promoting SPB separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SPB duplication. The research provides new insights into the mechanisms that regulate centrosome duplication and highlights the importance of this process in maintaining genome stability.
Researchers have investigated the role of viral protein R (Vpr) in HIV-1 infection and its contribution to the development of AIDS. Using a humanized mouse model, they found that Vpr causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CD4+ T cells, particularly regulatory T cells (Tregs), leading to Treg depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. This effect was observed in mice infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1, but not in those infected with CXCR4-tropic HIV-1. The study suggests that Vpr takes advantage of proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells, including Tregs, to enhance viremia of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Tregs are more vulnerable to exploitation by Vpr due to their higher cycling state compared to other T cell subsets. The researchers also found that immune activation was observed in CCR5-tropic wild-type HIV-1-infected mice, but not in vpr-deficient HIV-1-infected mice. Depletion of Tregs using denileukin diftitox enhanced the activation and proliferation of memory T cells, making them more susceptible to CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. These findings indicate that Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating CCR5-tropic HIV-1 propagation during acute infection by exploiting proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells, including Tregs.
Researchers analyzed microsatellite DNA markers from 163 Plasmodium vivax isolates collected in South Korea between 1994 and 2008 to understand the genetic structure and temporal dynamics of the parasite population. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of malaria control measures and identify potential sources of re-emergence. The analysis revealed a drastic genetic change in the South Korean P. vivax population between 2002 and 2003, which was not observed in previous years. This change was detected through a decrease in linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels and an increase in genetic differentiation between successive years. The study suggests that the genetic change was not solely due to relapse or asymptomatic parasite carriage, but rather the introduction of new P. vivax strains from other parasite populations. One possible source of these new strains is North Korea, particularly during 2002 and 2003. The study highlights the importance of molecular epidemiology using microsatellite DNA markers in understanding the population structure and transmission dynamics of P. vivax, which is essential for the elimination of vivax malaria in endemic areas. The findings of this study provide valuable information for malaria control efforts in South Korea and other regions where P. vivax is endemic.
Researchers investigated the role of splicing-competent introns in regulating transcription directionality in eukaryotic cells. They found that the presence of an intron enhances transcription by favoring the production of mRNA over upstream antisense transcripts (uaRNA) initiating from the promoter. This effect is dependent on the intron's ability to regulate promoter directionality. The study used strand-specific transcription run-on analysis to show that the intron promotes the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region. Mutation of the 5' or 3' splice site resulted in a reversal of promoter directionality, suggesting that the entire splicing-competent intron, not just the 5' splice site, regulates transcription directionality. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that termination factors are recruited to the promoter region in the presence of an intron, but not in its absence or when the splice sites are mutated. The study also found that gene looping, a process previously shown to be dependent on the intron, is crucial for the recruitment of termination factors to the promoter-proximal region of an intron-containing gene. In a looping-defective mutant, the promoter occupancy of termination factors was compromised, leading to a loss of transcription directionality. The results suggest that the intron-dependent gene looping places termination factors in the vicinity of the promoter region, terminating upstream antisense transcription and conferring promoter directionality.
Researchers have identified a novel transcription factor, ZBED6, derived from a domesticated DNA transposon, which plays a crucial role in regulating IGF2 expression and muscle growth in placental mammals. A single nucleotide substitution in the IGF2 gene in pigs leads to a 3-fold up-regulation of IGF2 in skeletal muscle, resulting in increased muscle growth, heart size, and fat deposition. The researchers found that ZBED6 binds to the IGF2 gene and represses its expression, and silencing ZBED6 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts affects Igf2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed over 2,500 ZBED6 binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif that matches the established binding site in IGF2. Genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites are enriched for certain Gene Ontology classifications, including development and transcriptional regulation. ZBED6 is highly conserved across placental mammals and is localized to the nucleolus, suggesting it may mediate transcriptional silencing by relocating the IGF2 locus and other targets to the nucleolus.

Phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED6-silenced C2C12 myoblasts indicate that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth. The researchers propose that ZBED6's ability to interact with chromatin and affect transcriptional regulation is a function derived from its ancestral transposase.
Researchers have used next-generation sequencing technology to study the RNA editome in rhesus macaques, a close relative of humans. The RNA editome refers to the collection of RNA editing sites in an organism's genome. The study identified 31,250 editing sites in rhesus macaques, with 99.8% being A-to-G transitions. The researchers verified 96.6% of editing sites in coding regions and 97.5% of randomly selected sites in non-coding regions using multiple independent methods.

The study found that adenosine deamination, a type of RNA editing, is associated with the macaque editome. The researchers observed that A-to-G editing sites were flanked by sequences with characteristics of ADAR substrates, and the sequence context and expression profile of ADARs influenced the quantitative variance of RNA editing across different sites and tissue types.

The study also found evidence of evolutionary constraint in maintaining some editing substrates with their double-stranded structure. This suggests that some RNA editing sites have functional relevance and are subject to purifying selection. The findings support the "continuous probing" model, which proposes that a small proportion of functional editing sites originate through tinkering.

The study provides an informative framework for understanding RNA editing in humans and highlights RNA editing as a widespread functional regulation in primate evolution. The macaque editome catalog represents a representative account of RNA-editing sites across the rhesus macaque genome, allowing for further interrogation of the global attributes of the RNA editome.
Researchers have discovered a new perceptual bias that affects how people perceive sensory responses in two-alternative visual discrimination tasks. In these tasks, participants are asked to distinguish between two stimuli, such as different spatial frequencies of gratings. The study found that observers tend to evaluate the likelihood of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of the stimulus alternatives, leading to a bias in perceived spatial frequency. This bias was observed when participants were presented with spectrally filtered noise, which altered the likelihood function of spatial frequency. The results showed that low-pass filtered noise shifted perceived spatial frequency to lower frequencies, while high-pass filtered noise shifted it to higher frequencies.

The study used a two-alternative spatial frequency discrimination task, where participants were asked to identify the spatial frequency of a grating. The gratings were presented at high contrasts, corresponding to the 84%-correct detection thresholds measured in broadband noise. The results showed that filtered noise backgrounds dramatically altered the perception of grating spatial frequency, with low-pass filtered noise decreasing perceived spatial frequency and high-pass filtered noise increasing it. The study's findings suggest that observers consider the log likelihood values of spatial frequencies that are a-priori unlikely to occur during the task, which lowers grating detectability and leads to a bias in perceived spatial frequency.
Researchers have discovered that piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) are expressed independently as tiny, autonomous transcriptional units. These piRNAs play a crucial role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements and are derived from the processing of a long, polycistronic RNA precursor. The researchers found that a conserved upstream motif, approximately 50 nucleotides long, is necessary for the independent expression of a germline-enriched, Piwi-dependent piRNA. This motif specifies which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in which germline they are expressed.

The study revealed that over 70% of C. elegans piRNAs are selectively expressed in the male or female germline, and comparison of the genes they target suggests that these two populations have evolved independently. The researchers also found that a single nucleotide position within the upstream motif directs differential germline enrichment. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the clustered organization of endogenous piRNA loci is entirely dispensable for robust piRNA expression, suggesting that each 21U RNA locus encodes all the information necessary for driving independent, autonomous transcription from more than 15,000 unique piRNA loci in C. elegans. The study provides new insights into the regulation of primary piRNA expression and how specific sequences are designated as piRNAs.
Researchers have identified a novel host factor, Yip1A, that plays a crucial role in the activation of the IRE1 pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) during Brucella infection. Brucella species replicate within host cells by sequestering themselves in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles. The study found that the IRE1 pathway, but not the PERK and ATF6 pathways, of the UPR was activated in a time-dependent manner during Brucella infection. This activation led to the upregulation of COPII vesicle components Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24D, which are involved in the formation of ER-derived vacuoles.

The researchers observed a marked accretion of ER-derived vacuoles around replicating bacteria using fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopy. They also identified Yip1A as a novel host factor responsible for the phosphorylation of IRE1 through high-order assembly of Ire1 molecules at ER exit sites (ERES) under UPR conditions. In Yip1A-knockdown cells, Brucella failed to generate ER-derived vacuoles and remained in endosomal/lysosomal compartments.

The study suggests that the activation of the IRE1 pathway and the subsequent formation of ER-derived vacuoles are critical for Brucella to establish a safe replication niche. The autophagy-related proteins Atg9 and WIPI1, but not DFCP1, were also found to be required for the biogenesis of ER-derived membrane compartments. The researchers propose a model for intracellular Brucella replication that exploits the host UPR and ER-derived vacuole formation machineries, both of which depend on Yip1A-mediated IRE1 activation.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the large viral replication compartment. This recruitment is crucial for the replication of these positive-strand RNA viruses. The kinase function of Vps34 is essential for TBSV replication, suggesting that PI(3)P phosphoinositide is used by the virus to build the replication compartment. The expression of Vps34 and PI(3)P is increased in the presence of the tombusviral replication proteins, leading to more efficient virus replication. Overexpression of PI(3)P phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibits TBSV replication on peroxisomal membranes and CIRV replication on mitochondrial membranes. The purified PI(3)P phosphatase also reduces TBSV replicase assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI(3)P reveals its enrichment in the replication compartment. Vps34 is directly recruited into the replication compartment through interaction with the p33 replication protein. Gene deletion analysis in yeast shows that TBSV replication requires the vesicle transport function of Vps34. In the absence of Vps34, TBSV cannot efficiently recruit early endosomes, which provide PE-rich membranes for membrane biogenesis of the TBSV replication compartment. Vps34 and PI(3)P are necessary for the stability of the p33 replication protein, which is degraded by the 26S proteasome when PI(3)P abundance is decreased.
Researchers conducted a study in Iquitos, Peru to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypti mosquitoes on dengue virus-infected human volunteers for vector competence studies. The study aimed to compare artificial and natural blood feeding methods for use in a field-based epidemiological cohort study. Participants aged 5 years and older with fewer than 5 days of fever were enrolled from ongoing studies on dengue in Iquitos. A total of 58 participants with viremias ranging from 1.3 × 10^2 to 2.9 × 10^6 focus-forming units per mL of serum participated in one or more feeding methods.

Mosquitoes were fed directly on febrile individuals or on blood collected from participants that was either untreated or treated with EDTA. The results showed that DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different following direct and indirect-EDTA feeding, but were significantly lower for mosquitoes that fed indirectly on blood with no additive. Dissemination rates were similar across all feeding methods. No differences were detected in DENV infection or dissemination rates in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different dengue illness severity.

The study demonstrates the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence. Direct mosquito feeding is preferable in terms of logistical ease, biosecurity, and reliability. The study provides preliminary data on the ability of DENV from people with mild or inapparent disease to infect and disseminate within mosquitoes.
Researchers investigated why some people respond differently to chemotherapy drugs that target topoisomerase II, an enzyme involved in DNA replication. They used the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study the genetic basis of this variability. The study found that natural variation in a single amino acid substitution in the topoisomerase II enzyme, specifically a methionine-to-glutamine substitution, underlies differences in sensitivity to topoisomerase II poisons. This substitution affects the interaction between the enzyme and the poison etoposide, leading to increased genomic instability in worms with the methionine residue. The researchers also found that this residue is conserved from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between the two human topoisomerase II isoforms, hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ. They demonstrated that this amino acid difference influences the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II poisons in human cell lines, explaining why hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ are differentially affected by various poisons. This study highlights the utility of C. elegans in understanding the genetics of drug responses and has implications for the development of personalized treatments and improvements to existing medications. The findings also suggest that genetic information could inform human health decisions regarding the use of topoisomerase II poisons in cancer treatment.
Researchers studied the genetics of lifespan in long-lived rodents, specifically African mole-rats, to gain insights into the genetic mechanisms that determine mammalian lifespans. They analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and identified 250 genes associated with enhanced longevity. These genes, known as positively selected genes (PSGs), showed an expression pattern in the liver of long-lived naked mole-rats and short-lived rats that fits the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. This theory proposes that genes with beneficial effects in youth have detrimental effects in old age.

The PSGs were found to be enriched for genes related to aging, including cellular respiration, metal ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway, such as translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Notably, the PSGs included RHEB and IGF1, central components of aging-relevant pathways, as well as genes previously unknown to be associated with aging, such as RHEBL1, AMHR2, PSMG1, and AGER. Protein homology modeling suggested functional consequences for amino acid changes under positive selection.

The researchers also found that lower expression of genes related to these processes, as well as pharmacological inhibition of the respective gene products, was associated with longer lifespan in other organisms, including worms, killifishes, and mice. This suggests that the identified PSGs are associated with expression changes during aging in long- and short-lived rodents, consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. Overall, the study provides a meaningful resource for follow-up studies to mechanistically link identified genes and amino acids under positive selection to aging and lifespan determination.
Researchers have developed a new Aedes albopictus mosquito line, ARwP-M, by introducing the wMel Wolbachia strain into the ARwP line, which had previously been established by replacing the wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia strains with the wPip strain. The new line, ARwP-M, showed a 100% rate of maternal inheritance of the wMel and wPip Wolbachia strains. The study compared the infection and fitness parameters of ARwP-M, ARwP, and wild-type Aedes albopictus mosquitoes sharing the same genetic background. The results showed that the survival, female fecundity, and egg fertility of the three mosquito lines did not differ significantly. However, the vector competence of ARwP-M for chikungunya, dengue, and Zika viruses was evaluated, and it was found that ARwP-M showed a strongly reduced vector competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses, with transmission rates of 5% and 0% at 14 and 21 days post-infection, respectively. In contrast, the vector competence for Zika virus did not show significant differences between ARwP-M and ARwP, but none of the tested ARwP-M females was capable of transmitting the virus. The study suggests that the introduction of wMel Wolbachia in ARwP Ae. albopictus had a profound impact on the vector competence of this line, making it a promising strategy for suppressing wild-type Aedes albopictus populations.
Researchers have identified a novel approach to discovering peptide-mediated interactions between proteins, which play a crucial role in various biological responses to internal and external stimuli. These interactions involve a globular domain in one protein recognizing a linear peptide from another protein, forming a small contact interface. Current methods for discovering these motifs often rely on their tendency to occur in disordered regions of proteins. However, this study focuses on the observation that peptides adopt a well-defined structure upon binding to their partner domain. By analyzing high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) structures of known peptide-mediated interactions, the researchers found that the structure of the peptide can be as characteristic as the consensus motif, enabling the identification of target peptides even if they do not match established patterns. The study reveals that motifs tend to have a stretched and elongated structure, unlike most other peptides of the same length. A support vector machine (SVM) was implemented to search the set of protein interactions of known 3D structure and identify unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions. The researchers also derived consensus patterns for these interactions and compared them with established linear motif patterns and their binding domains. The study cross-validated the identification strategy by scanning interactome networks from four model organisms and found significant over-representations for 64 domain-motif interactions, 46 of which had not been described before, involving over 6,000 interactions.
Researchers studied 49 adults with environmental enteropathy (EE) in Lusaka, Zambia, to understand the cellular mechanisms behind impaired barrier function and malabsorption. They used confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing to analyze small intestinal biopsies and correlated the results with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and zinc uptake. The study found that CLE images showed widespread small intestinal damage, with epithelial defects predominantly occurring at the tips of villi. These defects were associated with leakage imaged in vivo by CLE and correlated with circulating LPS and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2).

The researchers also found that zinc uptake from a test dose was attenuated in 64% of individuals, and in multivariate analysis, was reduced by HIV but positively correlated with GLP-2. A U-shaped relationship was observed between circulating LPS and villus surface area. Transcriptomic analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in severe enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins.

The study suggests that epithelial defects are probably sites of bacterial translocation, and increased epithelial surface area increases the burden of translocation. GLP-2 and other protective peptides may play an important role in mucosal protection in EE. Biomarkers of microbial translocation and inflammation were compared with confocal images and zinc uptake to explore barrier defects and identify potential biomarkers for further research.
Researchers have investigated the phenomenon of superinfection exclusion (SIE), where viruses block re-infection by the same or similar viruses, in turnip crinkle virus (TCV). They found that SIE in TCV is solely determined by the protein p28, one of the two replication proteins encoded by the virus. When p28 is expressed from a TCV replicon, it exhibits strong SIE activity against a different TCV replicon. Furthermore, transiently expressed p28, delivered simultaneously with or ahead of a TCV replicon, largely recapitulates this repressive activity. The researchers discovered that p28-mediated SIE is enhanced by C-terminal modifications, such as epitope tags or fluorescent proteins, but weakened by N-terminal modifications. They also found that p28 forms large, mobile punctate inclusions in SIE-positive cells that trans-aggregate a non-coalescing, SIE-defective, yet replication-competent p28 mutant. These results support a model where TCV SIE is caused by the formation of multimeric p28 complexes that intercept fresh p28 monomers translated from superinfectors, thereby abolishing superinfectors' replication. This model could be applicable to other RNA viruses and offer novel targets for antiviral therapy. The study reveals that p28 acts both as a replication facilitator and a repressor, depending on its cellular concentration, and provides insights into the molecular mechanism of SIE in TCV.
Researchers investigated whether co-administering a plasmid DNA encoding IL-15 (pIL-15) with a plasmid DNA encoding the Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase (pTS) gene could improve long-term protection against T. cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease. Mice were immunized with pTS alone or in combination with pIL-15, and their immune responses and protection against lethal T. cruzi challenge were studied. The results showed that mice immunized with pTS alone developed strong TS-specific IFN-γ responses and survived a lethal challenge within the first 3 months following immunization. However, the addition of pIL-15 to pTS vaccination did not significantly alter T cell responses or protection during this early post-vaccination period. Notably, mice vaccinated with both pTS and pIL-15 challenged 6 months post-vaccination were significantly more protected against lethal T. cruzi challenges than mice vaccinated with pTS alone. Improved protection correlated with significantly higher numbers of TS-specific IFN-γ producing total and CD8+ T cells detected more than 6 months post-immunization. These TS-specific T cells were also better able to expand after in vitro re-stimulation. The addition of pIL-15 during genetic vaccination greatly improved long-term T cell survival, memory T cell expansion, and long-term protection against T. cruzi.
A Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, CRL4WDR1, plays a crucial role in controlling the abundance of the Polo-like kinase protein, TbPLK, in the basal body and bilobe of Trypanosoma brucei. TbPLK is essential for basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis. The CRL4WDR1 complex is composed of Cullin4, the DNA damage-binding protein 1 homolog TbDDB1, and the WD40-repeat protein WDR1. WDR1 interacts with TbPLK through its C-terminal domain and with TbDDB1 through its N-terminal WD40 motif. Depletion of WDR1 inhibits bilobe duplication and basal body segregation, disrupts flagellum attachment, and causes excessive accumulation of TbPLK in the basal body and bilobe. This leads to continuous phosphorylation of the bilobe protein TbCentrin2, resulting in defective bilobe duplication, flagellum attachment, and flagellum-cell body adhesion. The results suggest that CRL4WDR1 is responsible for degrading TbPLK in the basal body and bilobe after the G1/S cell cycle transition, promoting bilobe duplication, basal body separation, and flagellum-cell body adhesion. The study identifies WDR1 as a TbPLK receptor in the Cullin4-DDB1 ubiquitin ligase complex and highlights the importance of CRL-type ubiquitin ligases in regulating protein degradation in eukaryotes.
A recent study has identified the RNA helicase DDX3X as a crucial mediator of innate antimicrobial immunity. Researchers found that mice lacking DDX3X in their hematopoietic system showed altered leukocyte composition in the bone marrow and spleen, and were highly susceptible to infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The study suggests that DDX3X plays a vital role in innate immunity, particularly in the regulation of the innate response to Listeria infections. The findings indicate that DDX3X impacts the innate immune system through its role in hematopoiesis, the process by which blood cells are produced, and its regulation of the innate response to infections.

The study also found that DDX3X deficiency affects the expression of genes involved in the innate antimicrobial response of macrophages, with the extent of the impact depending on the sex chromosomes of the cells. The researchers identified DDX3X as a regulator of interferon-I (IFN-I) transcription in cells infected with viruses or the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. DDX3X is a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase superfamily 2, which has widespread functions in RNA metabolism, including transcription, RNA processing, splicing, decay, and translation. The study's findings provide further evidence for the essential contribution of a non-RIG-I-like DExD/H RNA helicase to innate immunity and suggest that DDX3X may contribute to sex-related differences in resistance to microbes and resilience to inflammatory disease.
A computational model of the insect pheromone transduction cascade in male moth olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) has been developed. The model accounts for all pre-effector processes, including pheromone molecule translocation, deactivation, and interaction with receptors, as well as G-protein and effector enzyme activation. It focuses on the main post-effector processes, including the production and degradation of second messengers (IP3 and DAG), the opening and closing of ionic channels, and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. The model is regulated by modulators, such as protein kinase C and Ca2+-calmodulin, which exert feedback inhibition on the effector and channels.

The model was fitted to experimentally measured receptor potential data at various pheromone doses, capturing the main features of the dose-response curves, including the wide dynamic range, short rising time, and long falling time. It also reproduces the second messenger kinetics. The model suggests that the two main types of depolarizing ionic channels play different roles at low and high pheromone concentrations. The DAG-gated cationic channel plays a major role in depolarization at low concentrations, while the Ca2+-gated Cl− channel plays a major role at middle and high concentrations.

The model provides new insights into the mechanisms of pheromone transduction in insects and makes several testable predictions. It builds on previous modeling studies of olfactory transduction in vertebrates and takes into account recent findings on the structural distinction between insect and mammalian ORs, as well as the ionotropic pathway in insects.
Researchers investigated how the tumor suppressor protein p53 interacts with DNA sequences and chromatin context to regulate gene expression in response to cellular stress. They analyzed genome-wide binding locations of p53 and a specific histone modification, H3K4me3, in human lymphoblastoid cells treated with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. The study found that the expression of p53-regulated genes is associated with the steady-state chromatin status of the cell, with most highly inducible genes being suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or CTCF binding.

The researchers discovered that p53 binding is strongly correlated with the similarity of target DNA sequences to the p53 consensus sequence, but inversely correlated with pre-existing nucleosome accessibility and evolutionary conservation at the binding site. Notably, p53 occupancy is higher at transposable element (TE) repeats, particularly those from primate-specific elements, and is associated with stronger p53 response elements (REs). However, binding at these elements is not typically associated with transactivation of adjacent genes.

The study suggests that the interaction between chromatin status and p53RE context is crucial for the induced transactivation response, and that this response has been shaped by evolutionary selective pressure, likely driven by transposable elements. The findings highlight the importance of considering the interactions of sequence content and epigenetic factors in interpreting p53-mediated stress responses.
Researchers have explored a specific motif in bacterial two-component signaling systems, where a single histidine kinase (HK) phosphotransfers reversibly to two separate output response regulator (RR) proteins. This motif allows for rapid signal termination, where one RR acts as a phosphate sink towards the other RR, and implements a sigmoidal signal-response relationship. The researchers identified two mathematical conditions on system parameters necessary for sigmoidal signal-response relationships and defined key parameters that control threshold levels and sensitivity of the signal-response curve. They confirmed these findings experimentally by in vitro reconstitution of the one HK-two RR motif found in the Sinorhizobium meliloti chemotaxis pathway and measuring the resulting signal-response curve. The results show that the level of sigmoidality in this system can be controlled by the presence of the sink RR and an auxiliary protein that binds to the HK. This motif allows bacteria and yeast to implement tunable switch-like signal processing and provides an ideal basis for developing threshold devices for synthetic biology applications. The findings have implications for understanding bacterial physiology and designing synthetic signaling circuits, and can be applied to any two-component signaling circuit where multiple response regulators compete for phosphorylation by a single phosphodonor.
Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to study how individual yeast cells respond to stress. They found that cells within the same population can have different levels of stress tolerance, and that this variation is not fully understood. The study focused on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of yeast, and used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression in individual cells with and without salt stress. The results showed significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. A subset of cells was found to decouple the expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response, and this decoupling was partly correlated with the cell cycle but not with the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors, including Msn2, Sfp1, and Hog1. The study suggests that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells. The findings provide new insights into heterogeneity in the yeast stress response, but many questions remain unanswered. The study highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory networks that control heterogeneity in transcription and stress tolerance, which could lead to new avenues for controlling population behavior.
Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for African trypanosomiasis, accumulates in the male reproductive organs of mice, particularly in the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis. Fine needle aspiration cytology and histopathological analysis revealed that the parasite triggers a marked immune response in these organs, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, parasite degeneration, and tissue damage. The epididymis and epididymal adipose tissue are the primary sites of parasite accumulation, with up to 105 parasites per milligram of organ detected at late stages of the disease. In contrast, no parasites were found in the lumen of intact epididymal ducts or seminiferous tubules of the testis, indicating that the majority of parasites are not located in immune-privileged sites. The detection of a high number of parasites in the male reproductive organs suggests that fine needle aspiration cytology may be a useful diagnostic tool for Animal African Trypanosomiasis. The study also found that T. brucei infection is associated with disruption of the blood-testis and blood-epididymis barriers, leading to inflammation and tissue damage in the reproductive organs. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of T. brucei infection and highlight the importance of the male reproductive system as a site of parasite accumulation and immune response.
Researchers studied the expression of chemoreceptor genes in Drosophila melanogaster to understand how these genes respond to changes in the chemical environment. They found that chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the genome are independently regulated at different developmental stages and between sexes. The expression of certain subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions. For example, exposure to the odor of the opposite sex alters the expression of specific chemoreceptor genes, which is distinct from the changes observed when flies have physical contact with members of the same or opposite sex.

The researchers used customized cDNA microarrays to analyze the expression of chemoreceptor genes under various conditions, including sex, development, reproductive state, and social environment. They found that the expression of chemosensory genes is highly plastic and can be finely tuned in response to ecologically relevant environmental and physiological conditions. The chemosensory transcriptome is organized into 20 small, biologically relevant modules of highly correlated transcripts, allowing for precise regulation of the chemoreceptor repertoire.

This study provides a systematic description of the plasticity of the chemosensory window in Drosophila melanogaster and highlights the complexity of chemoreceptor gene expression in response to environmental and physiological changes. The findings suggest that the chemosensory system in Drosophila is highly adaptable and capable of responding to a wide range of external conditions.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between meiotic recombination and nondisjunction in human oocytes. Studies have shown that abnormal meiotic recombination is linked to the origin of human trisomies, particularly when recombination events occur too close to or too far from the centromere. To better understand this process, scientists analyzed the distribution and number of crossover-associated proteins, such as MLH1, in human fetal oocytes. The results indicate that the number of MLH1 foci is lower than expected, but their localization pattern is consistent with a crossover-associated protein. The study also found evidence of "vulnerable" crossover configurations in individual chromosomes, which are thought to contribute to nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte. These findings suggest that direct analysis of crossover events in human fetal oocytes can reveal specific patterns of recombination that are associated with trisomies. The study used immunofluorescence methodology to examine the meiotic recombination process in 1035 prophase oocytes from 31 fetal ovarian samples. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying meiotic errors in humans, which are a major cause of chromosome abnormalities. The study's findings have implications for understanding the origins of human trisomies and may lead to the development of new strategies for preventing these conditions.
Researchers investigated the impact of pre-exposure to vector saliva on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, leishmaniasis, and arboviral infections, are transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods like mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks. When an arthropod bites a mammal, it injects saliva containing immunogenic compounds that facilitate feeding and can alter the host's immune response. Studies have shown that pre-exposure to arthropod saliva can either exacerbate or limit disease symptoms, depending on the system in question.

A mathematical model was developed to explore how pre-exposure to vector saliva affects the dynamics of vector-borne diseases and the consequences of interventions targeting vectors. The model suggests that pre-exposure to vector saliva can increase the abundance of infected hosts when vector control efforts moderately increase vector mortality rates. However, if pre-exposure leads to more rapid clearance of infection, vector control may achieve greater than expected disease control. Conversely, if pre-exposure prolongs the duration of infection, vector control can increase the total number of infected hosts, potentially leading to unnoticed sub-clinical infections that can provide long-lasting reservoirs for transmission.

The study highlights the need to quantify how immune pre-sensitization modulates recovery and transmission rates in vector-borne diseases, as the effect of saliva pre-exposure on acute symptoms is well-studied for leishmaniasis, but largely uncharted for other vector-parasite-host combinations. Sensitivity analysis suggests that integrated vector management can mitigate the negative consequences of pre-exposure to vector saliva.
Researchers investigated how the host immune system affects the expression of proteins in Leishmania amazonensis, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease affecting 12 million people worldwide. They compared the proteomes of amastigotes (a stage of the parasite's life cycle) isolated from BALB/c mice, which have a normal immune system, and BALB/c nude mice, which have a weakened immune system due to a lack of T cells. The study aimed to understand how the host immune response influences the parasite's phenotype and virulence.

The researchers used a technique called two-dimensional electrophoresis to separate and identify proteins in the amastigotes. They found 44 differentially expressed proteins, including some known virulence factors such as oligopeptidase B and tryparedoxin peroxidase. Interestingly, specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells may play a role in regulating their expression. In contrast, an isoform of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was increased in amastigotes from BALB/c mice.

These findings suggest that the host immune response can modulate the expression of proteins in Leishmania amazonensis, which may contribute to the parasite's virulence. The study provides new insights into the immunopathology of leishmaniasis and may help identify potential virulence factors and ways to regulate their expression.
Activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) plays a crucial role in initiating immunoglobulin gene diversification in activated B cells by deaminating cytosines in DNA. However, AID's high mutagenic potential can lead to genomic instability and chromosomal translocations associated with B cell malignancies. Research has shown that AID's nuclear stability and abundance are regulated by the cell cycle, with degradation occurring more slowly in the G1 phase than in the S or G2-M phase. Mutations affecting regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter AID stability and abundance, highlighting the importance of cell cycle regulation in controlling AID's activity.

By fusing AID to tags derived from cell cycle regulators, researchers demonstrated that enforced nuclear localization of AID in the G1 phase accelerates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, while compromising viability in S-G2/M phase cells. This suggests that cell cycle regulation determines the ability of cells to respond to AID-initiated DNA damage. The study also identified AID derivatives that accelerate somatic hypermutation with minimal impact on viability, which could be useful tools for engineering genes and proteins through iterative mutagenesis and selection. Furthermore, the use of cell cycle tags to regulate nuclear stability may be applicable to studying DNA repair and engineering the genome.
Researchers have developed a method to analyze how microbes break down plant polysaccharides, which is crucial for understanding environmental carbon cycling, human nutrition, and industrial processes. They applied this method to the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans to study its ability to ferment various plant biomass components, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans. The results showed that the bacterium ferments these polysaccharides with varying efficiencies and prioritizes the metabolism of preferred substrates.

The researchers used a combination of carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing, and anaerobic growth screening to understand how the bacterium responds to different polysaccharides. They found that the bacterium up-regulates specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars. A total of 56 up-regulated CAZymes were purified and tested for their ability to bind and cleave plant polysaccharides. The results showed that most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with different rates, specificities, and cellular localizations.

The researchers also identified synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. This study provides new insights into how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass, which is essential for understanding the function of plant-degrading microbial communities and developing improved enzyme mixtures and recombinant microbes for industrial processing of plant biomass.
In Sierra Leone, a study was conducted to assess the impact of three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) on lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas previously treated for onchocerciasis. From 1974 to 2005, onchocerciasis was found to be endemic in 12 out of 14 health districts. Baseline studies from 2005 to 2008 showed that LF was endemic in all 14 districts. Three annual MDAs were conducted in the 12 co-endemic districts from 2008 to 2010, with good geographic, programmatic, and drug coverage. A midterm assessment was conducted in 2011 to evaluate the impact of these MDAs on LF.

The results showed a significant decrease in microfilaria (mf) prevalence and intensity in the 12 districts. Overall, mf prevalence fell from 2.6% to 0.3%, a decrease of 88.5%. Four districts (Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, and Kono) achieved a 100% reduction in mf prevalence, while seven districts experienced reductions ranging from 70.0% to 95.0%. Only one district, Bombali, still had an mf prevalence of 1.58%. The overall arithmetic mean mf density decreased by 65.4% among mf-positive individuals and 96.2% for the entire population examined. The results indicate that mf prevalence decreased to less than 1.0% in all but one of the 12 districts after three MDAs.
High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have made it possible to study complex microbial communities in various environments, including the human body. However, analyzing these data poses a significant challenge due to the compositional nature of the data, where observed values represent relative fractions of genes or species rather than their absolute abundances. This can lead to unreliable results, including artifactual correlations among taxa and the appearance of true correlations with opposite signs.

Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, researchers demonstrated that compositional effects can be widespread and severe, affecting many correlations among taxa. They found that community diversity is a key factor that modulates the severity of these effects. To address this issue, the researchers developed a new approach called SparCC, which can estimate correlation values from compositional data.

SparCC was applied to 16S rRNA gene survey data from the Human Microbiome Project to infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. The results showed that the standard approach yields spurious species-species interactions and misses true interactions, with most errors occurring in samples with low diversity. The SparCC network was used as a reference to estimate that the standard approach yields 3 spurious interactions for each true interaction and misses 60% of true interactions in the human microbiome data.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae resists the antimicrobial effects of lysozyme, an enzyme found on mucosal surfaces that breaks down bacterial peptidoglycan. Two enzymes, PgdA and Adr, modify the peptidoglycan of S. pneumoniae, making it resistant to lysozyme. The study found that the muramidase activity of lysozyme, which breaks down peptidoglycan, is responsible for its antimicrobial effect, and that both PgdA and Adr modifications are necessary for full resistance to lysozyme. Experiments in mice showed that wild-type S. pneumoniae outcompeted a mutant strain lacking both PgdA and Adr in mice with normal lysozyme levels, but not in mice lacking lysozyme. This suggests that resistance to lysozyme's muramidase activity is crucial for colonization of the upper respiratory tract. In contrast, strains with single mutations in either PgdA or Adr were able to outcompete the wild-type strain in both normal and lysozyme-deficient mice. This indicates that individual peptidoglycan modifications reduce bacterial fitness, but the benefits of resistance to lysozyme's peptidoglycan-degrading activity outweigh this cost. The study highlights the complex effects of peptidoglycan modification on bacterial growth and survival, and suggests that lysozyme plays a critical role in dictating the composition of the microflora on mucosal surfaces.
A new approach to diagnosing dengue fatal cases has been investigated using NS1 antigen capture tests in tissue specimens. Dengue virus (DENV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Brazil accounting for approximately 80% of cases in the Americas. The study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as an alternative tool for detecting DENV in tissue specimens from 23 previously confirmed dengue fatal cases that occurred in Brazil in 2002. A total of 74 tissue specimens were analyzed, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, heart, skin, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. Three tests for NS1 antigen capture were evaluated: Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and the NS1 Ag Strip. The results showed that the NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive, detecting NS1 in 78.3% (58/74) of the specimens, followed by Platelia NS1 (45.9%) and Dengue Early ELISA (22.9%). The NS1 Ag Strip was particularly effective in detecting NS1 in liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, and thymus tissues. The study demonstrates that DENV NS1 capture assays are a valuable approach to postmortem dengue confirmation and may be used as a clinical/pathological diagnostic tool.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis of 718 multiple myeloma (MM) cases from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's CoMMpass study. The study aimed to identify differences in genetic mutations between MM patients of African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) descent. The analysis revealed significant differences in mutation frequencies between the two groups. Three genes, BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2, were found to have higher mutation frequencies in AA cases, which are involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. In contrast, TP53 and IRF4 mutations were more common in CA cases. The study also found a higher frequency of FAM46C mutations in AA cases compared to CA cases, suggesting a potential enrichment of its role in MM biology among tumors derived from patients of African ancestry. These findings highlight the importance of studying diverse tumor cohorts to understand tumor genomics across populations. The study's results provide a rationale for further investigation into the potential role of these genes in myelomagenesis, particularly in patients of African descent. This study represents one of the most comprehensive genomic analyses of MM in patients of African descent, shedding light on potential ancestry-related differences in biological mechanisms of myelomagenesis.
Researchers have investigated the role of passenger mutations in cancer evolution, which are mutations that do not affect the reproductive rate of cancer cells. These mutations can provide valuable information about the evolutionary history of an individual cancer and serve as a molecular clock. The study analyzed the stochastic expansion of a population of cancer cells, describing the growth of primary tumors or metastatic lesions. By looking forward in time, the researchers calculated the fixation probabilities and frequencies of successive passenger mutations ordered by their time of appearance. This allowed them to compute the likelihood of specific evolutionary trees, informing the phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer evolution in individual patients.

The researchers also derived results looking backward in time, estimating the number of cancer cells present at the time when a given subclonal mutation arose. They derived exact formulas for the expected numbers of subclonal mutations of any frequency, which can be fitted to cancer sequencing data to estimate the ratio of birth and death rates of cancer cells during the early stages of clonal expansion. This ratio, δ, determines the shape of the cancer's phylogenetic tree, which is star-shaped for fast growth and linear for slow growth.

The study found that the frequencies of the first and most abundant passenger mutations are influenced not only by the mutation rate but also by the death-birth ratio, δ. If δ is close to 1, several clonal passengers may not have been present in the first tumor cell but were collected during clonal expansion. In contrast, if δ = 0.99, there will be about 150 passenger mutations present in more than 1% of cancer cells.
Researchers investigated the misfolding of the huntingtin protein's exon1 (XN1) in relation to Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion. They used molecular dynamics simulations to study the structure and dynamics of monomeric XN1 with full flanking regions, a variant missing the polyproline regions, and an isolated polyQ peptide. The simulations revealed that the probability of XN1 to form a β-rich misfolded state increases with the length of the polyQ expansion. The flanking regions, particularly the polyproline regions, play a crucial role in modulating the misfolding of XN1. The polyproline regions form polyproline type II helices, which decrease the probability of the polyQ region to form a β-rich state. Additionally, the first 17 N-terminal residues of XN1 are more likely to adopt a β-sheet conformation rather than an α-helix conformation as the polyQ length increases. These findings provide a structural insight into the misfolding of XN1 and highlight the importance of the flanking sequences in XN1 aggregation. The study suggests that the polyQ and flanking regions are strongly coupled in XN1 folding and misfolding, and that the flanking regions may play a critical role in the initial oligomerization and later formation of β-rich amyloid aggregates.
Researchers have explored the distribution and diversity of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) loci in human microbiomes using shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). CRISPR is a defense system used by eubacteria and archaea to protect against foreign nucleic acids, such as phages and conjugative plasmids. A targeted assembly strategy was developed to reconstruct CRISPR arrays that whole-metagenome assemblies failed to identify. This approach involved recruiting reads from each HMP dataset using the direct repeat consensus sequence of known CRISPR types and assembling the recruited reads into CRISPR loci. The unique spacer sequences were then extracted for analysis.

The study identified 64 known and 86 novel CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities. The distributions of CRISPRs were found to be largely body-site specific. For example, known streptococcal CRISPRs were identified in most oral microbiomes, with samples from the same individual and oral site sharing the most spacers. The study also demonstrated the potential applications of CRISPRs in tracing rare species and virus exposure in individuals. The results highlight the importance of effective identification and characterization of CRISPR loci in understanding the dynamic ecology of microbiomes. The targeted assembly strategy improved the detection of CRISPR elements in metagenomic datasets, identifying known CRISPRs in more human microbiome datasets compared to whole-metagenome assemblies.
Researchers have identified circadian-regulated transcripts in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans using genome-wide expression profiling experiments. These transcripts exhibit rhythmic expression with 24-hour periods that are temperature-compensated, suggesting they are under circadian regulation. The expression of these transcripts is sustained under constant conditions, indicating that they are regulated by an internal biological clock. Light and temperature cycles drive gene expression and appear to entrain largely non-overlapping gene sets. Mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolish both light- and temperature-entrained gene expression, implying that environmental cues act cell non-autonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. The study demonstrates that Caenorhabditis elegans has a circadian clock that is entrained by light and temperature, and that this model organism can be used to further explore the evolution and function of this critical timekeeping mechanism. The findings suggest that Caenorhabditis elegans may utilize a timekeeping mechanism that is distinct from that described in other animals. The study also highlights the importance of sensory neurons in regulating genome-wide circadian expression and implies that light and temperature information may act cell-nonautonomously to entrain the clock in Caenorhabditis elegans.
Researchers studied the effects of mutations in the RAD3 gene in yeast, which is a homolog of the human XPD gene involved in DNA repair and transcription. The mutations, rad3-101 and rad3-102, resulted in a hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype, characterized by an increased frequency of mitotic recombination events. Previous studies suggested that this phenotype was due to persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that were converted to double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. To further investigate this, the researchers used a system to recover the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. They found that both rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevated the frequency of reciprocal crossovers by about 100-fold. Mapping of these events revealed that three-quarters of the crossovers resulted from DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids (double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs), while the remainder resulted from DSBs formed in single chromatids (single chromatid breaks, SCBs). The researchers also mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications, and found a significant association between the location of these events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX. A hotspot for deletions and duplications was identified at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV. The study suggests that a subset of spontaneous mitotic recombination events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete nucleotide excision repair reactions, and that DSCBs are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, requires optimal expression of bacterial factors to adapt to the changing host environment during persistent infection. The bacterium has a large set of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) that generate heterogeneous populations through slipped strand mispairing, facilitating adaptation. Researchers investigated the role of an intergenically located T-tract in regulating the expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin (SabA) in H. pylori. They found that the length of the T-tract affects the activity of the sabA promoter, resulting in multiphasic output and altering the bacterium's binding to sialyl-Lewis x receptors on gastric mucosa. Analysis of post-infection isolated clones revealed that the T-tract length is a highly variable feature in H. pylori, mirroring the host-pathogen interplay where the bacterium generates a set of clones from which the best-fit phenotypes are selected in the host. In silico and functional in vitro analyzes showed that the length of the T-tract affects the local DNA structure and binding of the RNA polymerase, shifting the axial alignment between the core promoter and UP-like elements. The researchers identified additional genes in H. pylori with T- or A-tracts positioned similarly to sabA, and variations in the tract length acted as rheostats to modulate cognate promoter output. This mechanism, mediated by promoter-proximal SSRs, provides an alternative mechanism for transcriptional regulation in bacteria, such as H. pylori, which possesses a limited repertoire of classical trans-acting regulatory factors.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade the innate immune system to establish persistent infections and amplify its genome upon cell differentiation. The JAK-STAT transcriptional regulator, STAT-5, plays a crucial role in modulating the inflammatory response and controlling cell cycle progression in response to cytokines and growth factors. Research has shown that HPV protein E7 activates STAT-5 phosphorylation without altering total protein levels. Inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation by the drug pimozide abolishes viral genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating keratinocytes. In contrast, treatment of undifferentiated cells that stably maintain episomes has no effect on viral replication. Knockdown studies revealed that the STAT-5β isoform is mainly responsible for this activity and that it is mediated through the ATM DNA damage response. A downstream target of STAT-5, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), contributes to the effects on members of the ATM pathway. These findings identify an important new regulatory mechanism by which the innate immune regulator, STAT-5, promotes HPV viral replication through activation of the ATM DNA damage response. Suppression of PPARγ by HX531 negatively interferes with DNA damage signaling in HPV-positive keratinocytes. The study suggests that STAT-5 activation is necessary for HPV genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiated cells, but not in undifferentiated cells that stably maintain episomes.
Researchers conducted a study to identify antigens expressed by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) in the biliary tract of chronic carriers in Kathmandu, Nepal. Chronic carriers of S. Typhi can act as reservoirs of infection, introducing the disease to susceptible individuals and new communities. The study used an immunoscreening technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) to identify potential biomarkers unique to S. Typhi carriers. Thirteen S. Typhi antigens were found to be immunoreactive in carriers but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid-endemic area. These antigens included putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. One antigen, YncE (STY1479), an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif, gave prominent responses in the screen. The study found that 70% of chronic carriers had detectable anti-YncE IgG in their blood, compared to 0% of bile culture-negative controls, 0% of healthy Bangladeshis, and 12.5% of Bangladeshis with acute typhoid fever. IgA responses were also present. The identified antigens, including YncE, may lead to the development of improved diagnostic assays to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers. Further evaluation of these antigens could facilitate the understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the biliary tract of chronic carriers and aid in the development of therapeutic approaches for S. Typhi carriage.
Researchers have discovered a new epigenetic phenomenon called trans-reactivation, where non-functional alleles of a gene can reactivate the expression of a silenced, functional copy of the same gene. This occurs in the presence of heterochromatin, a type of chromatin structure that typically suppresses gene expression. The study used the white gene in fruit flies as a model system to investigate the role of cellular RNA pools in changing the transcriptional state of a silenced gene.

The researchers found that non-functional alleles of the white gene, which are unable to produce a coding transcript, can still reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of the white gene that is silenced by heterochromatin. This phenomenon, called trans-reactivation, is heritable and relies on the presence of homologous RNA molecules. The study suggests that trans-reactivation is a new level of gene expression control that is mediated by homologous RNA molecules in the context of heterochromatic genes.

Trans-reactivation is distinct from other epigenetic reprogramming events, such as paramutation, transinduction, and transvection, and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. The study also found that the presence of non-functional white alleles can increase the expression of the wm4h gene and open up the chromatin structure at the wm4h locus. Overall, the discovery of trans-reactivation provides new insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and the role of RNA molecules in epigenetic control.
Boophilin, a multifunctional Kunitz protease inhibitor from the midgut of the tick Rhipicephalus microplus, has been studied for its in vitro mode of action and anti-thrombotic activity. The study found that Boophilin behaves as a classical, non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to small chromogenic substrates, using a mechanism dependent on both exosite-1 and catalytic site. This inhibition is accompanied by blockade of platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot-bound thrombin in vitro. Additionally, Boophilin was found to be a non-competitive inhibitor of FXIa, preventing FIX activation, and also inhibits kallikrein activity and the reciprocal activation, indicating that it targets the contact pathway. Furthermore, Boophilin abrogates cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). The study also demonstrated that Boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion in vivo triggered by FeCl3, and promotes bleeding according to the mice tail transection method. The results suggest that Boophilin plays a major role in keeping the midgut microenvironment at low hemostatic and inflammatory tonus, allowing ticks to successfully digest a blood meal, which is critical for metabolism and egg development.
Researchers have developed a computational model called Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEGMEnT) to investigate the relationship between inflammation and tissue patterning in the gut. The model aims to understand how the mucosal architecture of the intestinal tract is influenced by and influences its function as an absorptive surface and defensive barrier. SEGMEnT integrates multiple functional modules, including morphogenic signaling pathways, inflammatory signaling pathways, and cell state transitions, to simulate the cellular and molecular interactions that maintain and modify the enteric mucosal architecture.

The model simulates the spatial dynamics of the crypt-villus tissue architecture as generated by the behavior of gut epithelial cells undergoing replication, migration, and differentiation. SEGMEnT also incorporates the effect of inflammation on these morphogenic processes. The model is designed to represent arbitrarily large and customizable epithelial surfaces and is a work in progress, representing a minimally sufficient set of components and interactions to achieve a face-valid representation of the mechanisms involved in maintaining the enteric mucosal architecture and its response to inflammation.

SEGMEnT has been used to reproduce healthy ileal mucosal dynamics and a series of morphogen knock-out/inhibition experiments. The model provides insight into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, such as the role of Phosphotase and tensin homolog/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PTEN/PI3K) as a key point of crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis, and the protective role of enterocyte sloughing in enteric ischemia-reperfusion. The results suggest that SEGMEnT can serve as an integrating platform for the study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of releasing Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to control arbovirus transmission in a community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The wMelBr strain of Wolbachia was released for 20 consecutive weeks, but its frequency plateaued at around 40% and then declined after releases stopped. Despite a high maternal transmission rate of 97.56%, the invasion of Wolbachia into the local population was hindered by the presence of pyrethroid-resistant genotypes in the released mosquitoes, which decreased from 68% to 3.5% after 17 generations in the lab. This resistance was likely due to the overuse of insecticides by householders in the community. A new strain, wMelRio, was developed by backcrossing wMelBr females with males from the field to introduce pyrethroid resistance alleles. Although wMelRio had negative effects on Ae. aegypti fecundity traits, it successfully established in the population where wMelBr failed. The study highlights the importance of matching the local population genetics, including insecticide resistance background, to achieve Wolbachia invasion. The results suggest that Wolbachia deployment should be tailored to the specific insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to be effective. The study's findings have implications for the use of Wolbachia as a disease transmission control strategy, particularly in areas with high levels of pyrethroid resistance.
Researchers investigated the role of the vaccinia B1 protein kinase in poxvirus replication and its interaction with the B12 pseudokinase. They created a virus with a deletion of the B1 gene and subjected it to experimental evolution to identify mutations that could compensate for the loss of B1. After several passages, they found that mutations in the B12 pseudokinase resulted in a significant increase in viral titer, suggesting that B12's loss of function is beneficial for the virus. However, when they expressed full-length B12 in viruses with a B1 defect, it led to a reduction in fitness, indicating that B12 has an inhibitory activity that can be masked by the presence of B1. Further investigation revealed that B12 primarily localizes to the nucleus and reduces BAF phosphorylation in the absence of B1, suggesting that B12 may enhance antiviral activity of BAF. The study provides evidence that a paralogous kinase-pseudokinase pair can exhibit a unique epistatic relationship, potentially serving to enhance B1 conservation during poxvirus evolution and orchestrate nuclear events during infection. The findings suggest that the B12 pseudokinase acts as a repressor of vaccinia replication in a B1-dependent manner and raise questions about the underlying mechanism of action for this pseudokinase. The study's results have implications for understanding poxvirus adaptation pathways and signal transduction circuitry, and may have broader biological interest given the prevalence of pseudokinase domains in eukaryotic organisms.
Researchers investigated the conformational behavior of two synthetic peptides, LK and EALA, with built-in secondary amphiphilicity, using molecular dynamics simulations. These peptides are too short to form multiple structural elements and are often found to be structurally ambiguous in solution. The study aimed to analyze the influence of macroscopic and molecular interfaces on their conformational preferences. The peptides were designed to display secondary amphiphilicity in an alpha-helix conformation, with hydrophobic/hydrophilic partitioning playing a major role in determining their conformational behavior. In bulk water, the peptides were found to adopt multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes, rather than being random coils or fully formed alpha helices. The presence of an interface, such as a macroscopic vacuum/water interface, led to a strong partitioning of hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues, stabilizing the alpha-helical form for both peptides. The LK peptide was found to be dominated by conformations with a large fraction of residues in an alpha-helical state in the presence of the interface. The study also found that the peptides' aggregation behavior was affected by the presence or absence of an interface, as well as their surface charge and hydrophobicity.
Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and 6B (HHV-6B) are two ubiquitous betaherpesviruses that infect humans in early childhood and establish latency in various cell types. Research has shown that both viruses can integrate their genomes into the telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells. However, the molecular mechanism of viral integration has remained elusive. Studies have identified arrays of telomeric repeats (TMR) in the genomes of HHV-6A and HHV-6B, which are identical to human telomere sequences. To investigate the role of TMR in virus integration, researchers deleted both perfect and imperfect TMR arrays in the HHV-6A genome. The results showed that the TMR are not essential for virus replication, but are crucial for integration and maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells. The perfect TMR array was found to play a major role in HHV-6A integration, while the imperfect TMR array made a minor contribution. The study suggests that the TMR facilitate integration into host telomeres through homologous recombination. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of HHV-6A integration and highlight the importance of TMR in maintaining the virus genome in latently infected cells.
Researchers have made a significant discovery in understanding how poxviruses, a type of enveloped virus, assemble their internal lipid membrane. Unlike most enveloped viruses, poxviruses do not acquire their membrane by budding through cellular compartments. Instead, they form immature particles from atypical crescent-shaped precursors. The study focused on the D13 protein, a key structural component of the outer scaffold of viral crescents. The researchers determined the 2.6 Å crystal structure of D13, revealing a double-barrel organization with two jellyrolls and a head domain of a novel fold. D13 assembles into trimers, similar to the double-barrel capsid proteins of adenovirus and lipid-containing icosahedral viruses. When tethered to artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb lattice that resembles the viral crescents and immature particles. This finding supports a model of assembly that shares similarities with the giant mimivirus. The study suggests that the first committed step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral DNA viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. Furthermore, the D13 protein is a target for the antibiotic rifampicin, and its structure will aid in the development of poxvirus assembly inhibitors. The discovery of D13's lipid-remodeling abilities and its role in viral assembly provides new insights into the morphogenesis of poxviruses and has implications for the development of antiviral therapies.
Researchers studied the role of auxin and ethylene in root development in Brachypodium distachyon, a monocotyledonous plant. They found that a mutant with reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity, encoded by the TAR2-LIKE (BdTAR2L) gene, displayed elongated seminal roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This phenotype was unexpected, as reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity in Arabidopsis thaliana, a dicotyledonous plant, leads to reduced root growth. The Brachypodium mutant had elevated free auxin levels, particularly in the elongating and mature parts of the root, despite reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity. This contrasts with Arabidopsis, where reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity leads to decreased free auxin levels. The elevated auxin levels in Brachypodium were not due to compensation by alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways, but rather due to increased expression of YUCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for auxin biosynthesis. The expression of YUCCA genes was also down-regulated by the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid (ACC). The results suggest that ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an IPA-dependent manner to confer auxin levels that are sub-optimal for root cell elongation in Brachypodium. The study reveals a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots and suggests alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk compared to Arabidopsis.
Researchers have found a link between the organization of promoter nucleosomes and the rate at which genes evolve in species of the budding yeast. They discovered that genes without a nucleosome-free region (OPN) vary widely in expression between species, while genes with a nucleosome-free region (DPN) have largely conserved expression levels. To investigate this difference, the researchers artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins and found that selection was successful for both OPN and DPN genes, with approximately 80% of genes in each group increasing in expression by a similar amount. However, the two groups adapted to selection through distinct mechanisms: DPN genes duplicated large genomic regions, while OPN genes favored trans mutations not involving duplications. When selection was removed, DPN genes rapidly reverted to their original expression levels, consistent with their lower diversity between species. This suggests that promoter organization constrains early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution. The study's findings indicate that the organization of promoter nucleosomes plays a crucial role in shaping the evolution of gene expression.
The human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) trans-activator/oncoprotein, Tax, activates I-κB kinases (IKKs) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), promoting cell proliferation and transformation. However, in most cells, Tax expression leads to the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1, resulting in p53-/pRb-independent cellular senescence. This study demonstrates that p21CIP1/WAF1-/p27KIP1-mediated senescence acts as a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations in Tax that reduce IKK/NF-κB activation and prevented by blocking NF-κB using a degradation-resistant mutant of I-κBα. The study also shows that RelA induces this senescence program by acting upstream of the anaphase promoting complex and RelB to stabilize p27KIP1 protein and p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA, respectively. Furthermore, down-regulation of NF-κB by the HTLV-1 anti-sense protein, HBZ, delays or prevents the onset of Tax-induced senescence. The balance between Tax and HBZ expression determines the outcome of HTLV-1 infection, with robust HTLV-1 replication and elevated Tax expression driving IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation and triggering senescence, while HBZ modulates Tax-mediated viral replication and NF-κB activation, allowing HTLV-1-infected cells to proliferate, persist, and evolve.
A computational model of human executive function has been proposed to explain decision-making in everyday environments with uncertain, changing, and open-ended situations. Current models of frontal executive function do not adequately account for human decision-making in such situations. The proposed model, called the PROBE model, suggests that the human executive function monitors up to three or four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict action outcomes. When one strategy appears more reliable than others, it guides the selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. Otherwise, a new behavioral strategy is tentatively formed from stored strategies in long-term memory, probed, and if confirmed, drives action.

The model reveals that the human executive function has a limited monitoring capacity, which is compensated by a binary structure of executive control that promotes exploration and creation of new behavioral strategies in ambiguous and unknown situations. The PROBE model integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior. It suggests how the frontal lobes create and manage an expanding repertoire of flexible behavioral strategies for driving action in uncertain, changing, and open-ended environments. The model also explains how the frontal executive function continuously arbitrates between adjusting and staying with the current behavioral strategy, switching to other learned strategies, and creating new ones for driving action. The results support a model of frontal lobe function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of executive control and decision-making.
Researchers have developed a new modeling approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to analyze the long-term effects of pharmacological interventions. This approach uses mathematical modeling to predict the dynamics of molecular adaptations in response to treatment, making use of experimental data obtained during different stages of the intervention. ADAPT introduces a concept of time-dependent descriptions of model parameters to study the evolution of molecular adaptations over time.

The approach aims to dynamically link different experimentally observed phenotypes as a function of time, providing an integrated understanding of the outcome of a pharmacological intervention or disease progression. ADAPT was applied to a model of hepatic lipid and plasma lipoprotein metabolism to predict the metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological treatment of mice with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317.

The analysis revealed a counter-intuitive insight concerning the function of scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a receptor that facilitates the hepatic uptake of cholesterol. Although activation of LXR promotes cholesterol efflux and excretion, the computational analysis showed that the hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol was reduced upon prolonged treatment. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by immunoblotting measurements of SR-B1 in hepatic membranes. The study demonstrates the potential of ADAPT to identify potential unwanted side effects of pharmacological interventions and to design new target interventions to prevent these effects.
Researchers have proposed a new hypothesis to explain how the spinal and cerebellar neuronal circuitry enables the coordination of multi-segmented limbs and bodies. The hypothesis suggests that the combination of sensory and motor signals in the neurons of the spinocerebellar pathways allows for the recombination of signals to approximate various functions, including spatial and temporal dependencies between limb segments. However, the number of granule cells in the cerebellum severely limits the number of recombinations that can be represented, making random recombination an ineffective strategy.

The researchers propose that the spinal circuitry provides useful recombinations through linear projections of multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. The granule cells, potentially aided by differentiated thresholding from Golgi cells, enhance the utility of these projections by allowing Purkinje cells to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. This hypothesis provides a novel view on the function of the spinal circuitry and cerebellar granule layer, highlighting the crucial role of the cerebellum in coordinating functions.

The researchers argue that the close correspondence between sensor signals and motor command signals in individual neurons allows the spinocerebellar system to avoid superfluous recombinations and form "good enough" recombinations with high probability. The hypothesis focuses on how the spinal circuitry makes sensorimotor functions available to the cerebellar cortex through its MF projections via the SCT/SRCT systems, and how this information is received by the cerebellar granule layer.
Researchers used next-generation sequencing to study the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes during Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and are involved in various cellular processes, including development, proliferation, and defense against pathogens. The study identified 88 and 79 known miRNAs in uninfected and CHIKV-infected Aedes albopictus cells, respectively, as well as nine novel miRNAs. Comparison of the two groups revealed that 77 miRNAs were differentially expressed, with eight miRNAs specifically altered by CHIKV infection. The study also identified putative targets of these regulated miRNAs and classified them into their respective pathways.

The researchers used computational biology to predict the targets of the modulated miRNAs and analyzed their pathways, providing insights into the possible role of these miRNAs in CHIKV infection. The study found that four miRNAs (miR-100, miR-283, miR-305-3p, and miR-927) were over-expressed, while four others (miR-1000, miR-2b, miR-2c-3p, and miR-190-5p) were under-expressed in response to CHIKV infection. These findings suggest that miRNAs play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression during CHIKV infection in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The results of this study provide leads for identifying potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies against CHIKV.
A study was conducted to estimate the monetary burden of cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic infection affecting humans and livestock, in Iran. The study used epidemiological data from regional hospitals, scientific literature, and government reports to determine the prevalence and incidence of CE in humans and animals. Economic data, including treatment costs, productivity losses, and livestock production losses, were obtained from national and international datasets. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to account for uncertainty in input parameters.

The study estimated that the mean number of surgical CE cases per year from 2000 to 2009 was 1,295, and the number of asymptomatic individuals living in the country was approximately 635,232. The overall annual cost of CE in Iran was estimated at $232.3 million, including both direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was estimated at $93.39 million, while the annual cost associated with CE in livestock was estimated at $132 million. The cost per surgical human case was estimated at $1,539.

The study found that CE has a significant economic impact on Iran, accounting for approximately 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. The results suggest that establishing a CE surveillance system and implementing a control program are necessary to reduce the economic burden of CE on the country. A cost-benefit analysis of different control programs is recommended to prioritize resource allocation for disease control and prevention.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) infection in mouse NIH3T6 cells using deep sequencing technology. The study aimed to understand the dynamic regulation of viral and host gene expression during the infection process. The results showed that both early-strand and late-strand RNAs were transcribed at all time points, revealing a transcriptional profile of the early-to-late switch in viral gene expression. Additionally, widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts was observed at late times in infection.

The analysis of host gene expression revealed significant changes in the transcriptome, with 359 genes upregulated and 857 genes downregulated by 36 hours after infection. Gene ontology analysis indicated that transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated, while transcripts involved in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc finger binding, SH3 domain, and GTPase activation were downregulated. The study also found alterations in the levels of long noncoding RNAs, including the downregulation of the MALAT1 long noncoding RNA, which is involved in splicing speckles and is often used as a marker in late-stage cancers.

These findings provide new insights into the MPyV life cycle and its effects on host cell growth and metabolism. The study highlights the dynamic regulation of viral and host gene expression during MPyV infection, shedding light on the complex interactions between the virus and the host cell.
Hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon each year, but more than two-fifths experience severe performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, known as "hitting the wall." Previous analyses have suggested that human glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, implying that "hitting the wall" is inevitable or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon. However, a new computational study demonstrates that the energetic constraints on endurance runners are more subtle and depend on several physiologic variables, including muscle mass distribution, liver and muscle glycogen densities, and running speed.

The study estimates the distance at which runners will exhaust their glycogen stores as a function of running intensity, providing a basis for guidelines to ensure the safety and optimize the performance of endurance runners. The analysis shows that carbohydrate loading prior to marathon running influences performance by allowing runners to run at greater speeds without exhausting glycogen reserves. Typical levels of glycogen loading permit runners to complete a marathon safely in between four and five hours. The study also reveals the functional dependencies of the distance required to run glycogen stores to depletion and the fastest pace at which a given distance, such as the marathon, can be run without exhausting glycogen stores.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate how different strains of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii interact with host cells, specifically murine macrophages. Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that infects a wide range of hosts, including humans, and can cause toxoplasmosis, a disease with variable outcomes. The study focused on 29 different Toxoplasma strains, representing global diversity, and used RNA-sequencing to analyze the host and parasite transcriptomes. The results showed large differences in gene expression between strains, including the expression of host effectors and transcriptional regulators.

The study identified novel strain-specifically regulated host pathways, including the regulation of the type I interferon response by some atypical strains. This response was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma activation, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors in macrophages and the cytoplasmic receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) in fibroblasts. The study also found large differences between strains in the modulation of host genes, particularly in the activation of an inflammatory response.

The findings suggest that specific Toxoplasma strains may have adapted to certain hosts, and that the genotype of the parasite strain plays a major role in the outcome of toxoplasmosis. The study provides a global insight into host cells and parasite transcriptional responses upon infection with both canonical and exotic Toxoplasma strains, and identifies novel strain-specific host cell responses and parasite effectors.
Researchers investigated the process of recombination in enteroviruses, a mechanism that allows these viruses to acquire new genetic material and adapt to their environment. They used a novel reverse genetic approach to study heterologous recombination in polioviruses, resulting in the isolation of intermediate chimeric viruses with extensive duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. Serial passage of these viruses led to the emergence of progeny with increased fitness, which had lost the duplicated sequences. The study found that mutations or inhibitors affecting polymerase fidelity or replication complex coalescence altered the yield of recombinants, indicating that recombination is a replicative process. The researchers propose a biphasic model of recombination, where an initial recombination event is followed by a process of resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing viral fitness. This process has implications for our understanding of "evolution by duplication" in positive-strand RNA viruses. The study analyzed a panel of intertypic poliovirus recombinants and found that the majority contained additional sequences within the recombination region, suggesting that these imprecise recombinants may have a growth disadvantage. However, serial passage of these viruses led to the emergence of precise recombinants with enhanced fitness, supporting the biphasic model of recombination.
Organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) plays a crucial role in the clearance of norepinephrine (NE) in white adipose tissue (WAT), a process known as beiging. Beiging is a potential therapeutic target for treating metabolic diseases. Previous studies have identified NE clearance mechanisms in sympathetic neurons and proinflammatory macrophages in adipose tissues, but these routes have limited capacity. Researchers found that Oct3, a non-neural route of NE clearance, is highly expressed in WAT and has the highest uptake rate of NE compared to other known routes. Adipocytes in WAT express high levels of NE degradation enzymes, Maoa, Maob, and Comt, providing the molecular basis for NE clearance by adipocytes and its reuptake transporter Oct3. Ablation of Oct3 in mice resulted in increased body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared to controls. After prolonged cold challenge, WAT in Oct3-deficient mice showed stronger browning characteristics and elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes. The response involved enhanced β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (CREB) pathway activation. Inhibition of β-AR largely abolished the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct3-deficient WAT, indicating NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes. Reduced functional alleles in human OCT3 were associated with increased basal metabolic rate. These findings demonstrate that Oct3 governs β-AR activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders.
HP1 proteins play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to heterochromatin and repressing transcription. These proteins contain two domains: the chromo-domain (CD) and the chromoshadow-domain (CSD). The CD binds to histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9, a mark associated with transcriptional repression. However, the affinity of HP1 proteins to native methylated chromatin is relatively poor, and their binding is facilitated by the opening of chromatin during DNA replication.

Research has shown that the CSD of HP1 proteins interacts with histone H3 at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome barrel, a region also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex, Brg1 and Brm. This interaction is essential for efficient SWI/SNF remodeling and is inhibited in the presence of HP1 proteins. In fact, SWI/SNF activity favors the loading of HP1 proteins onto chromatin both in vivo and in vitro.

The study suggests that HP1 proteins can benefit from the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling. On promoters where SWI/SNF functions as a repressor, the opening of chromatin may initiate HP1 stable recruitment. Conversely, where SWI/SNF functions as an activator, HP1 proteins may function as sensors of unwanted SWI/SNF activity, binding to nucleosome domains uncovered by remodeling and blocking the reaction.
Researchers have identified a property of modular RNA structures called self-containment, which refers to the tendency of an RNA sequence to maintain its optimal secondary structure regardless of its surrounding nucleotide context. To measure this property, a scoring method called the self-containment index was developed. The study found that microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit high self-containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance imposed by the miRNA biogenesis pathway. In contrast, most other structured RNAs do not display high self-containment. Further analysis revealed a trend toward higher self-containment among clustered and conserved miRNAs, suggesting that high self-containment may be a characteristic of novel miRNAs acquiring new genomic contexts. The study also found that miRNAs display significantly enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, and a trend toward natural selection for self-containment in most functional RNA classes. The researchers suggest that self-containment arises from selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of structural function. The study's findings have implications for the annotation and design of functional RNAs, and a Python implementation and Web interface to calculate the self-containment index are available online.
Researchers have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that play a crucial role in limiting the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens. These TFs, named ZFP2, BHLH99, PAP2, and AT1G66810, were found to be essential for plant resistance to the fungal pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. Mutants defective in any of these TFs displayed increased disease susceptibility and a general activation of non-immune host processes that contribute to plant disease susceptibility. Transcriptome analyses revealed that these mutants share a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes, which encode peptides with a secretion signal. These peptides were named PROVIR (provirulence) factors and were found to be important for disease susceptibility of the host to fungal necrotrophs. Over-expression of many of the PROVIR factors in Arabidopsis conferred increased susceptibility to the necrotroph P. cucumerina, while loss-of-function mutants conferred increased resistance. The identification of these TFs and PROVIR factors provides new insights into the genetic determinants of plant disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens.
FOXO1, a transcription factor, plays a crucial role in regulating uterine epithelial integrity and progesterone receptor expression, which are essential for successful embryo implantation. In a study using a mouse model, researchers found that ablation of Foxo1 in the uterus led to infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing the embryo from penetrating the luminal epithelium. Analysis of the uterine transcriptome revealed changes in gene expression related to cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, and the β-catenin signaling pathway, as well as an increase in progesterone receptor (PGR) signaling.

The increase in PGR signaling was attributed to the retention of PGR expression in the uterine epithelium during the window of receptivity, which inhibited FOXO1 expression in the nucleus of the uterine epithelium. This reciprocal expression of PGR and FOXO1 was also observed in human endometrial samples during the proliferative and secretory phases. The study suggests that the expression of FOXO1 and the loss of PGR during the window of receptivity are interrelated and critical for embryo implantation.

Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Foxo1 ablation affects multiple signaling pathways, including PGR signaling and inflammatory and growth factor pathways, which are essential for proper uterine function during implantation. The study proposes that FOXO1 and PGR may be involved in a mutually regulatory relationship in the endometrial epithelium, with FOXO1 regulating the expression of multiple components of signaling pathways that establish the receptive phase.
Researchers developed a statistical model to map the seasonal spread of under-reported dengue cases in Bangladesh. The model accounted for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal random effects, and was applied to district-level data from 2000 to 2009. The study found that mean monthly temperature and its interaction with mean monthly diurnal temperature range, lagged by two months, were significantly associated with dengue incidence. Additionally, mean monthly rainfall at two months lag was positively associated with dengue incidence. Densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence rates than others. The model estimated that 92% of annual dengue cases occurred between August and September, with 94% of cases reported in the capital city of Dhaka. However, less than half of the affected districts reported cases, and the proportion reported varied by month, with a higher proportion reported in high-incidence districts. The study provides model-based estimates of the monthly geographical distribution of dengue cases in Bangladesh, accounting for under-reporting. The findings can inform the prioritization and targeting of dengue control and elimination interventions across the country.
Researchers have identified a new type of preferred place in mice that exhibit exploratory behavior in an open field arena. These places, termed "knots," are characterized by high path tortuosity, with mice tracing tortuous paths full of twists and turns within them. Knots are distinct from "home bases," which are typically marked by high visit frequency and cumulative time spent, and are often located near the point of introduction into the arena. In contrast, knots are usually situated away from the walls and are marked by a high speed during inbound paths and low speed during outbound paths.

The establishment of knots is enhanced by injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed portion of the arena, suggesting that stress and arousal play a role in consolidating a long-term contingency between a particular locale and knot-scribbling behavior. Mice tend to perform knot-scribbling at the point of introduction into the arena, and this behavior is characterized by a high path density, frequent visits without scribbling, and a higher speed on the way into the knot than on the way out.

Knot-scribbling appears to serve as a way for mice to obtain an overview of their environment, allowing them to re-calibrate their locale map and compass directions. The rich vestibular input generated by scribbling may also improve the interpretation of the visual scene. Overall, the discovery of knots and knot-scribbling behavior provides new insights into the complex exploratory behavior of mice in novel environments.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for antifungal treatments: the lipid transfer protein Sec14p. This protein is essential for the growth and virulence of certain fungal pathogens, including Cryptococcus neoformans, which causes more deaths worldwide than malaria. A compound called NGx04 was found to selectively inhibit the growth of fungal cells while sparing mammalian cells. High-resolution chemogenomics analysis revealed that NGx04 binds to Sec14p, a protein involved in lipid transfer and secretion of virulence factors. Mutations in Sec14p that confer resistance to NGx04 were identified, providing insight into the compound's mechanism of action. The researchers found that NGx04 inhibits the growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoformans and that related compounds have equal or even higher potency against this pathogen. Additionally, NGx04 analogues showed fungicidal activity against a fluconazole-resistant strain of C. neoformans. The study provides genetic evidence that NGx04 inhibits fungal Sec14p and initial data supporting its potential as a novel antifungal starting point. The findings suggest that targeting Sec14p could be an effective strategy for treating fungal infections, particularly those caused by C. neoformans. Further research is needed to explore the potential of NGx04 and related compounds as antifungal treatments.
Researchers investigated the antischistosomal properties of mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonicum. A single oral dose of mefloquine (200 or 400 mg/kg) resulted in significant reductions in total and female worm burdens, ranging from 72.3% to 100%. High worm burden reductions were also observed for young developing stages of the schistosomes. The study found that both mefloquine enantiomers were effective against sub-patent and patent S. mansoni infections. In comparison to praziquantel, the current standard treatment for schistosomiasis, mefloquine showed high activity against all development stages of the schistosome worms, whereas praziquantel only displayed high activity against very young stages and adult schistosomes. The study suggests that mefloquine may be a promising candidate for the development of a novel antischistosomal drug. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of action and to study the effect of mefloquine on S. haematobium and other trematodes. The findings also raise the possibility of repurposing mefloquine for the treatment of schistosomiasis in areas where both malaria and schistosomiasis co-exist.
Researchers conducted a study to map the geographical distribution of podoconiosis, a non-filarial elephantiasis causing massive swelling of the lower legs, in Cameroon. Podoconiosis was identified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization in 2011. The study aimed to generate data on the disease's distribution in Cameroon and contribute to the global atlas of podoconiosis. A multi-stage sampling design was used, with stratification of the country by environmental risk of podoconiosis. A total of 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households were surveyed, and 83 individuals with lymphedema were identified. After applying a clinical algorithm to exclude filarial-associated lymphedema, 52 people were diagnosed with podoconiosis. The overall prevalence of podoconiosis was found to be 0.5% (95% CI; 0.4-0.7). The disease was found to be widespread in Cameroon, with at least one case identified in every region except the two surveyed villages in Adamawa. The prevalence ranged from 0.2% to 2.7% across the 40 health districts surveyed. The study demonstrated low prevalence but almost nationwide distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon, highlighting the need for a health system response to the burden of the disease through case surveillance and morbidity management services.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the aging process of Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs). They found that Notch signaling increases with age in GSCs, leading to their removal from the stem cell niche. Clonal analysis revealed that GSCs with low levels of Notch signaling exhibit increased adhesiveness to the niche, outcompeting their neighbors with higher levels of Notch. This increased adhesiveness is mediated by the regulation of E-cadherin expression. Experimental enhancement of Notch signaling in GSCs accelerates their age-dependent loss from the niche, while disruption of Notch signaling in GSCs does not delay GSC loss during aging. Notably, Notch activation in the niche, which maintains niche integrity and mediates GSC retention, is reduced with age. This suggests that Notch signaling regulates GSC-niche adhesion both intrinsically and extrinsically. The study reveals a novel role of Notch signaling in controlling GSC-niche adhesion in response to aging and has implications for understanding metastatic cancer cells, where Notch signaling suppresses cell adhesion. The findings indicate that Notch signaling promotes GSC aging and needs to be maintained at a relatively low level in young GSCs for their anchorage to the niche.
Researchers studied the conserved herpesvirus protein kinases (CHPKs) encoded by eight human herpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). They found that the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs share a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-like function, which involves phosphorylating the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein and lamin A, disrupting the nuclear lamina, and displaying authentic Cdk activity in yeast. In contrast, the alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs did not exhibit these activities. The researchers also found that the non-Cdk-like functions reported for the HCMV UL97 protein, such as disrupting promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) and aggresomes, were poorly conserved among the other family members. The study suggests that the genomic and evolutionary conservation of the CHPKs has not been fully maintained at the functional level. The researchers identified novel virally-encoded Cdk-like kinases, which they termed v-Cdks, and found that some of these kinases are targets of approved or developmental antiviral drugs. The study's findings indicate that these related kinases may serve both overlapping and non-overlapping functions during viral infections. The beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs are capable of inducing Rb phosphorylation, lamin A phosphorylation, and disrupting the nuclear lamina, while the alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs do not exhibit these activities.
A systematic review and consensus guidelines for environmental sampling of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, were developed by an international working party. The review aimed to define the global distribution of B. pseudomallei in the environment, update the risk map for melioidosis, and propose guidelines for soil sampling. A comprehensive search of the literature from 1912 to 2011 was conducted using PubMed and hand-searching of bibliographies. The reported geographical distribution of B. pseudomallei in the environment was mapped and categorized as definite, probable, or possible.

The review found that global coverage was patchy, with a lack of studies in many areas where melioidosis is suspected to occur. The sampling strategies and bacterial identification methods used were highly variable and not all were robust. To address these issues, consensus guidelines were developed to reduce the probability of false-negative results and provide affordable and "low-tech" methodology applicable in both developed and developing countries. The guidelines aim to facilitate the development of an accurate and comprehensive global map of environmental B. pseudomallei.

The review highlights the importance of environmental sampling in identifying areas where people are at risk of melioidosis, even before cases are recognized. It also emphasizes the need for standardized and robust sampling methods to ensure accurate detection of B. pseudomallei in the environment. The proposed guidelines provide a framework for future research and surveillance efforts to better understand the global distribution of B. pseudomallei and inform prevention and control measures for melioidosis.
Researchers have identified peptides that can inhibit the entry of dengue virus into cells by targeting a specific stage of the virus's membrane fusion process. The fusion process involves large-scale rearrangements of the virus's envelope glycoprotein (E) and a transition from dimers to trimers. The researchers found that peptides derived from the stem region of the E protein bind to a conformational intermediate of the E protein, which is a model for a fusion intermediate. These peptides specifically block viral fusion and inhibit infectivity, even when free peptide is removed from a preincubated inoculum before infecting cells.

The peptides bind to the virions before attachment and are carried with the virions into endosomes, where acidification initiates fusion. The binding of the peptides depends on particle dynamics, as there is no inhibition of infectivity if preincubation and separation are at 4°C rather than 37°C. The researchers propose a two-step model for the mechanism of fusion inhibition, where the peptides bind to the conformational intermediate and prevent the transition to the postfusion conformation.

This study provides new insights into the mechanism of dengue virus entry and suggests strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry. The findings support and extend proposed mechanisms for how the E conformational change promotes membrane fusion. Targeting a viral entry pathway can be an effective way to block infection, and the identified peptides may have potential as therapeutic agents against dengue virus and other flaviviruses.
Researchers have developed a method to sequence the entire genome of Vibrio cholerae, the bacteria responsible for cholera, directly from dried spotted filter paper. This technique has the potential to aid in the control and elimination of cholera, a disease that causes approximately 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths worldwide each year. The method involves enriching stool specimens in alkaline peptone water and spotting them on filter paper, which can then be used for whole genome sequencing (WGS). The study found that a minimum concentration of 0.02 ng/μL of V. cholerae DNA was sufficient to produce high-quality genomic information. WGS confirmed the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci, and identified the strains as the 7th pandemic El Tor. The technique also allowed for the identification of co-infecting pathogens and provided rare insight into the specific V. cholerae strains causing outbreaks in cholera-endemic areas. The study demonstrated that WGS can be used to map short reads from APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers, providing valuable molecular epidemiological sequence information on V. cholerae strains from remote, low-resource settings. The results have the potential to inform public policy responses to cholera outbreaks and contribute to the development of effective control and elimination strategies.
A recent study has identified the cytoplasmic Dynein motor protein as a crucial regulator of epithelial polarity in Drosophila follicle cells. Through a genetic screen, researchers found that Dynein is essential for the proper localization of apical and basolateral determinants, which are necessary for epithelial architecture. The study suggests that Dynein acts through the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Stardust (Sdt) to target the transmembrane protein Crumbs to the apical surface. The researchers discovered that Dynein is required for the apical localization of specific Sdt mRNA isoforms, which is mediated by an alternatively spliced coding exon. This exon is only present in early stages of epithelial development, and its absence leads to unlocalized transcripts in mature epithelia.

The study also found that Dynein is required for the proper targeting of a subset of apical proteins in follicle cells and is particularly important for the localization of Sdt. The researchers used molecular epistasis experiments to demonstrate a clear relationship between Dynein and Sdt in apico-basal polarity regulation. Furthermore, they showed that loss of Dynein in the Drosophila follicle cell epithelium leads to defects in apico-basal polarity and that Dynein is required to enrich Sdt transcripts in the apical cytoplasm during early stages of epithelial development. Overall, this study highlights the importance of Dynein in regulating epithelial polarity and suggests that mRNA localization may play a functional role in the regulation of apico-basal organization.
Researchers have found evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, within its natural vector, the sand fly Phlebotomus perniciosus. The study used transgenic L. infantum lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters to investigate whether cells with identical genotypes can recognize and mate with each other. The results showed that genetic exchange occurred within the sand fly midgut, resulting in the production of hybrid progeny with a triploid DNA content. The hybrid clone was stable throughout the parasite's life cycle and exhibited reduced virulence in BALB/c mice, with lower parasite loads in the spleen and liver compared to the parental strains. The hybrid clone also showed reduced arginase activity, an enzyme involved in the parasite's virulence. This study provides the first evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in L. infantum and suggests that the parasite can recognize and mate with cells of the same genotype within its natural vector. The findings have implications for our understanding of the parasite's life cycle and the development of new treatments for leishmaniasis.
Researchers studied 63 Leishmania donovani strains isolated from patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or HIV-VL co-infections in Ethiopia. The strains were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), cysteine protease B (cpb), and HASPB (k26). The results showed that the k26-PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin. Strains from northwestern Ethiopia produced a 290 bp product, while strains from southwestern Ethiopia produced a 450 bp product. Strains from Sudan produced amplicons identical to those found in northwestern Ethiopia, and Kenyan strains produced larger PCR products. High-resolution melt (HRM) analysis distinguished the different PCR products. Sequence analysis revealed that the k26 repeat region in L. donovani is comprised of polymorphic 13 and 14 amino acid motifs. The number and order of the repeats in L. donovani varies between geographic regions. The HASPB repeat region (k26) shows considerable polymorphism among L. donovani strains from different regions in East Africa. This polymorphism should be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays and vaccines based on this antigen.
Researchers have developed a probabilistic model to predict the distribution of HIV-1 recombination breakpoints, which are the boundaries that define the mosaic structure of recombinant HIV-1 genomes. The model, based on local sequence identity, accurately predicts the observed frequencies of inter-subtype recombination across much of the HIV-1 genome. This suggests that a probabilistic model is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations in these regions. However, in certain regions, such as the env gene, the observed frequencies of breakpoints deviate from the predicted distribution, indicating that natural selection is influencing the recombination pattern. The paucity of recombination breakpoints within most of the envelope gene suggests that recombinants generated in this region are less likely to be successful. In contrast, breakpoints at a higher frequency than predicted by the model are found at either side of the env gene, indicating increased selection for these recombinants. These findings provide the first clear indication of a specific portion of the genome that deviates from a probabilistic null model for recombination, suggesting that only a minority of recombination events appear to be significant to the evolution of HIV-1. The study provides a detailed understanding of the influence of sequence identity on template switching and identifies specific genomic regions where recombination events have a higher probability of being important to viral evolution.
Researchers have traditionally used separate statistical methods to address two interconnected problems in computational modeling for neuroscience research: estimating individual variation in model parameters across a population of subjects and comparing candidate models. However, these methods are interdependent, as the relevant population for estimating model parameters depends on which subjects express the model. To address this challenge, a hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework is proposed for concurrent model comparison, parameter estimation, and inference at the population level. This framework combines previous approaches and has several advantages, including smaller errors in parameter estimation and robust model comparison that is not biased towards overly simplistic models. The HBI framework is hierarchical, regularizing individual-level parameters with statistics across all individuals in the group, and Bayesian, representing uncertainties at both individual and group levels with probability distributions. This approach enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters and quantify corresponding statistical errors. The HBI framework addresses issues of statistical inference over both parameters and models, which have remained elusive with previous hierarchical methods. Empirical results show that the HBI framework outperforms other methods in terms of parameter estimation and model comparison, making it a valuable tool for neuroscience research.
Researchers have investigated the development of the auditory circuitry in the mouse brainstem, focusing on the role of rhombomeres (r) and Hox genes. Rhombomeres contribute to the formation of brainstem auditory nuclei, and Hox genes determine the fate and connectivity of rhombomere-derived neurons. The study found that r4 contributes to both sensory and motor components of the auditory system, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, posterior ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN), and motor olivocochlear neurons. The assembly of r4-derived auditory components is essential for sound perception and relies on regulatory interactions between Hoxb1 and Hoxb2. In mice lacking Hoxb1 and Hoxb2, transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is disrupted, leading to hearing impairments. Hoxa2, on the other hand, regulates the Rig1 axon guidance receptor and controls contralateral projections from the anterior VCN to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a circuit involved in sound localization. The study demonstrates that individual rhombomeres and their associated Hox codes control the assembly of distinct, functionally segregated sub-circuits in the developing auditory brainstem. The findings suggest that Hox genes play a crucial role in the development of the auditory system, and their dysregulation can lead to hearing impairments.
The marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 (Sde 2-40) has been found to possess an extraordinary ability to degrade complex polysaccharides. The complete genome sequence of Sde 2-40 reveals an unusually large number of enzymes that can break down over 10 different complex polysaccharides. These enzymes exhibit unique architectures, including novel combinations of catalytic and substrate-binding modules, which are thought to facilitate the breakdown of complex polysaccharides in the marine environment. Notably, Sde 2-40 is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium capable of degrading plant cell walls, an important component of the carbon cycle that is not well-characterized in the marine environment.

The study found that the carbohydrases in Sde 2-40 are regulated by multiple mechanisms, including glucose repression, and that the more complex the polysaccharide, the more enzyme systems are induced. The carbohydrases were shown to be functional in microcosms, where Sde 2-40 grew on plants as the sole carbon source while fully degrading them. This is the first time a marine prokaryote has been shown to degrade cellulosic algae and higher plant material.

The discovery of Sde 2-40's enzymatic capabilities suggests that it plays a significant role in the marine carbon cycle, functioning as a "super-degrader" and mediating the breakdown of complex polysaccharides from plants, algae, and invertebrates. The Sde 2-40 genome has been sequenced to completion and is available for further study.
Researchers investigated the infectivity of Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) and genotype III (GIII) in Culex pipiens mosquitoes from China. The study aimed to determine if mosquitoes played a role in the shift from GIII to GI dominance over the past 20 years. Culex pipiens mosquitoes were orally infected with either GI or GIII JEV strains and monitored for infection rate, replication kinetics, dissemination rate, and transmission potential. The results showed that Culex pipiens mosquitoes were competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates, growth kinetics, and dissemination rates. Both genotypes were detectable in the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes at similar transmission rates. The study found no significant difference in the transmission rate between GI- and GIII-infected mosquitoes. The data suggest that Culex pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift, as both genotypes have similar infectivity in these mosquitoes. This conclusion is based on the use of a single representative JEV strain from each genotype, and further studies with multiple strains are recommended to confirm this finding. The results of this study provide insight into the role of mosquitoes in JEV genotype shift and highlight the need for further research in this area.
A two-year review of dengue deaths in Malaysia from 2013 to 2014 was conducted to investigate the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of fatal cases. The study analyzed 322 dengue deaths, with a mean age of 40.7 years and a majority of cases (72.5%) occurring in adults aged 15-59 years. The median duration of first medical contact and hospitalization was 1 and 3 days, respectively. Common co-morbidities among adults and the elderly included diabetes and hypertension. Warning signs such as lethargy and vomiting were reported, with lethargy being more common in children and abdominal pain in adults. However, 22.4% of cases did not exhibit any warning signs. Only 34% of patients were suspected of having dengue at initial presentation. Severe plasma leakage was more common in adults, and multi-organ involvement was observed in 54% of cases. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) was the leading cause of death, accounting for over 70% of cases, followed by severe organ involvement and severe bleeding. The study highlights the need for early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent dengue-related deaths. The findings suggest that DSS is the primary cause of death across all age groups, emphasizing the importance of prompt medical attention. This study provides valuable insights into the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of dengue deaths in Malaysia, contributing to a better understanding of the disease and its management.
Researchers investigated how insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, affects female attractiveness in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). They found that insulin signaling in specific tissues, such as the fat body and ovarian follicle cells, influences female attractiveness. The signals from these tissues are integrated by pheromone-producing cells called oenocytes, which produce cuticular hydrocarbons that serve as attractiveness cues. The study showed that insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells has opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship between the two tissues. Manipulations of insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness compared to those caused by global and late follicle cell manipulations. The study also found that modulation of insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship with the ovary. Furthermore, all tissue-specific insulin signaling manipulations that changed attractiveness also changed fecundity in the corresponding direction, indicating that insulin pathway activity is a reliable link between fecundity and attractiveness cues. The study suggests that female attractiveness results from an apparent connection between attractiveness cues and an organismal state of high fecundity, both of which are created by lowered insulin signaling in the fat body and increased insulin signaling in late follicle cells.
Researchers analyzed the 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to understand how the disease spread at the district level. They used statistical modeling to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0), which measures the average number of people an infected person can infect, for each district and country. The study found that R0 varied significantly across districts, ranging from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone. At the national level, the estimated R0 was 0.97 for Guinea, 1.26 for Liberia, and 1.66 for Sierra Leone.

The researchers also explored the relationship between R0 and socio-demographic variables, such as population density and wealth index. They found that districts with higher population density and wealth index had higher R0 values, suggesting that rapid urbanization in West Africa may have contributed to the spread of EVD. The study used a mixed effects model to account for the heterogeneity in disease transmission between and within countries. The findings support the idea that geographical heterogeneity played a significant role in the transmission of EVD in West Africa.
Researchers investigated the factors that influence the rate of protein evolution, focusing on the interplay between a protein's age and its structural properties. They analyzed a large dataset of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins with mapped PDB structures. The study found that previously observed correlations between structural properties and evolutionary rates also hold within each age group, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and evolutionary rates. However, age was found to play a crucial role in modulating the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, tend to evolve faster than older proteins.

The researchers also introduced a knowledge-based potential function to study the stability of proteins through large-scale computation. They found that older proteins are more stable for their native structure and more robust to mutations than younger ones. The study suggests that several determinants, both intrinsic and historical, can interact to determine rates of protein evolution. The findings support the important role of protein age in shaping evolutionary rates, above and beyond the influence of solvent accessibility and secondary structure. Additionally, the study ruled out the possibility that structural biases among age groups could explain the reported differences in evolutionary rates with age. Overall, the study highlights the complex interplay between protein age and structural properties in determining evolutionary rates.
Polycomb-Like 3 (Pcl3) is a component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that plays a crucial role in regulating embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal. PRC2 is a multiprotein complex that trimethylates lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), which is essential for gene expression during development, ESC differentiation, and cancer. Research has shown that Pcl3 interacts with Suz12, a core component of PRC2, and promotes ESC self-renewal. Knockdown of Pcl3 in ESCs increases spontaneous differentiation, indicating that Pcl3 has a specific role in regulating ESC self-renewal. Pcl3 also promotes H3K27me3 formation, which is essential for gene silencing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that Pcl3 co-localizes with Suz12 and depletion of Pcl3 decreases Suz12 binding at over 60% of PRC2 targets. The Tudor domain of Pcl3 is essential for its function, as mutation of conserved residues within this domain compromises H3K27me3 formation. Pcl3 and its paralog, Pcl2, exist in different PRC2 complexes but bind many of the same PRC2 targets, particularly CpG islands regulated by Pcl3. Overall, Pcl3 is a critical component of PRC2 that promotes ESC self-renewal, histone methylation, and recruitment of PRC2 to a subset of its genomic sites.
Researchers studied how the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans adjusts its chemosensory behavior in response to changes in its feeding state. They focused on a specific chemoreceptor gene, srh-234, which is expressed in the ADL sensory neuron of C. elegans. The study found that the expression of srh-234 is regulated by two types of transcription factors: MEF-2 and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors. MEF-2 acts together with bHLH factors to control the expression of srh-234 as a function of feeding state. The researchers identified a specific binding site for MEF-2 that is necessary and sufficient for the starvation-induced downregulation of srh-234 expression. They also found that an E-box site, which binds bHLH factors, is required to drive srh-234 expression in ADL neurons. Furthermore, the study showed that HLH-2, HLH-3, and HLH-4, which are bHLH transcription factors, act in ADL neurons to regulate srh-234 expression. Additionally, the researchers found that the expression levels of srh-234 in ADL neurons are regulated remotely by MXL-3 and HLH-30, which act in the intestine and are dependent on insulin signaling in ADL neurons. The study suggests that chemoreceptor gene expression is regulated by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous transcriptional mechanisms mediated by MEF-2 and bHLH factors, allowing C. elegans to fine-tune its chemosensory responses in response to changes in its feeding state.
A study investigated the relationship between the presence of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer (BU) disease in humans in southeastern Australia. Mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria, Australia, from 2004 to 2009, and tested for M. ulcerans using real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed BU cases in permanent residents of these towns during the same period was recorded to determine the average cumulative incidence of BU in each location. A strong dose-response relationship was found between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of human disease, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.92-0.99; p < 0.001). This suggests that mosquitoes play a role in the transmission of M. ulcerans in southeastern Australia. The study's findings have implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent BU. The results also support the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in the spread of M. ulcerans to humans in endemic areas, and that public health measures to minimize mosquito bites in residents and visitors should be encouraged. The study's findings may also be relevant to other BU endemic areas, such as Queensland and Africa, where other biting insects may also be involved in the transmission of M. ulcerans.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in rats that leads to demyelination, a condition characterized by the breakdown of the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers in the central nervous system (CNS). The mutation, known as dmy, occurs in the Mrs2 gene, which encodes a protein essential for maintaining magnesium (Mg2+) homeostasis in mitochondria. Mitochondria are the energy-producing structures within cells, and Mg2+ is crucial for their proper functioning.

The study used positional cloning to identify the molecular defect responsible for the demyelinating phenotype in adult dmy/dmy rats. The researchers found that a G-to-A transition in the Mrs2 gene resulted in a novel splice acceptor site, leading to the functional inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2-cDNA validated the findings.

The study revealed that dmy/dmy rats have significant mitochondrial deficits, including elevated lactic acid levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, reduced ATP production, and increased numbers of swollen mitochondria in oligodendrocytes. The researchers also found that MRS2, the protein encoded by the Mrs2 gene, is dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes and is localized to the inner membrane of mitochondria.

The study suggests that the demyelination observed in dmy/dmy rats is likely caused by a mitochondrial disease, and that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin. The findings have implications for understanding the pathophysiology of demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and may provide a useful model system for investigating the mechanisms underlying these conditions.
Researchers analyzed eight publicly available clinical microarray studies to evaluate the consistency of study-internal and study-external diagnoses based on gene expression signatures. They found that discrepancies between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as high as 30% in the worst-case scenario and 18% on average. These discrepancies occur because current documentation standards for gene expression signatures do not allow for unambiguous application to study-external patients. The researchers propose a new documentation strategy, called "documentation by value," which involves documenting quantitative preprocessing information. By using this approach, the median discrepancy between study-internal and study-external diagnoses was reduced to 1%. This suggests that better documentation of gene expression signatures can improve the reliability and consistency of diagnoses. The study highlights the importance of accurate documentation in the development and application of gene expression signatures in clinical practice. Gene expression signatures hold promise for improving diagnosis and prognosis of disease, but their evaluation and use in clinical practice are hindered by the lack of standardization in documentation. The proposed documentation strategy aims to address this issue and facilitate the translation of gene expression signatures into clinical practice.
Researchers have gained new insights into the structure of curli amyloid fibrils, which are secreted by certain bacteria and contribute to biofilm formation and bacterial resistance to environmental stressors. The major curli subunit, CsgA, was found to form steric zipper fibrils composed of tightly mated beta-sheets, revealing a structural link between curli and human pathological amyloids. Two D-enantiomeric peptides, originally designed to interfere with Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta, were shown to inhibit CsgA fibrillation and reduce biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. Furthermore, CsgA fibrils were found to cross-seed fibrillation of amyloid-beta, supporting the proposed structural resemblance and potential for cross-species amyloid interactions. The study provides structural insights into amyloidogenic regions important for curli formation and suggests a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms. The findings also raise the possibility of self-propagating prion-like species originating from a microbial source influencing neurodegenerative diseases.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a significant cause of encephalitis in most of Asia, with high case fatality rates and long-term neurologic sequelae among survivors. In the Philippines, the epidemiology of JE has not been well defined. A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 was conducted to support consideration of JE vaccine introduction into the national schedule. The review identified 29 published reports and presentations on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic surveys, 18 clinical cases, and 8 animal studies. Clinical studies reported 257 cases of laboratory-confirmed JE from 1972 to 2013, with JEV being the causative agent in 7-18% of cases of clinical meningitis and encephalitis combined, and 16-40% of clinical encephalitis cases. JE predominantly affected children under 15 years of age, with 6-7% of cases resulting in death. Surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 identified 73 (15%) laboratory-confirmed JE cases out of 497 cases tested. The review demonstrates the endemicity and extensive geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting the use of JE vaccine in the country. Continued and improved surveillance is needed to quantify the burden of JE, guide prioritization of high-risk areas, and measure the impact of preventive measures, including immunization. The evidence suggests that JE constitutes a significant public health burden in all regions of the Philippines, supporting consideration of inclusion of JE vaccine in the national immunization program.
Researchers conducted a large-scale computational study to investigate the evolutionary origins of genetic robustness in bacterial species. They analyzed the metabolic networks of hundreds of bacterial species across various simulated growth environments and found that variations in genetic robustness among species reflect ecological adaptations. The study decoupled metabolic robustness into two components: environmental-dependent and environmental-independent robustness.

Environmental-dependent robustness accounts for at least 20% of non-essential reactions and is associated with a species' lifestyle, with specialized species exhibiting higher robustness. In contrast, environmental-independent robustness is associated with a species' intrinsic metabolic capacities, such as fast growth rates or extensive production of secondary metabolites. The study found a correlation between environmental-independent robustness and metabolic capacities, suggesting that the need to increase metabolic capacities may have driven the evolution of genetic robustness in bacterial metabolic networks.

The researchers also identified reactions that are uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug targets. The study provides evidence that environmental robustness contributes to genetic robustness in bacterial metabolic networks and highlights the importance of considering both environmental and intrinsic factors in understanding the evolution of genetic robustness.
Researchers conducted a randomised trial to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection and its treatment on antibody responses to measles catch-up immunisation in pre-school children. The study was conducted in Entebbe, Uganda, and involved 193 Schistosoma mansoni-infected children and 61 uninfected children aged 3-5 years. The infected children were randomly assigned to receive praziquantel treatment 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles catch-up immunisation. Plasma anti-measles IgG levels were measured at enrolment, 1 week, and 24 weeks after immunisation.

The results showed that Schistosoma mansoni-infected children had lower anti-measles IgG levels and a lower percentage of protective antibody levels compared to uninfected children 1 week after immunisation. However, among infected children, those who received praziquantel treatment before or at the time of immunisation had higher anti-measles IgG levels compared to those who did not receive treatment. At 24 weeks post-immunisation, IgG levels did not differ between the trial groups, but tended to be lower among previously-infected children who were still Schistosoma mansoni stool-positive compared to those who became stool-negative.

The study suggests that Schistosoma mansoni infection is associated with a reduced antibody response to catch-up measles immunisation, and that praziquantel treatment improves the response. The findings imply that effective schistosomiasis control may be beneficial for vaccine efficacy in endemic populations.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the evolution of bacterial populations through large-scale sequencing of population samples. However, traditional statistical methods for evolutionary inference, such as phylogenetic analysis, have limitations when dealing with extensive sampling and high recombination rates. To address this, new statistical tools have been developed to detect and represent recombination between populations, as well as a model-based description of population shape in sequence space. These tools are integrated into the BAPS 5.2 software, which is freely available for download.

A population sample of 5086 strains of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria lactamica species was used to demonstrate the potential of this approach. The data was generated based on a simplified evolutionary model, assuming a common local ancestor and a global ancestor. Traditional population genetic tools are not suitable for bacterial molecular data due to the lack of relevant populations, while standard phylogenetic analyses may provide a distorted view of ancestral relationships when recombination events are common.

The new statistical tools enable analyses of bacterial population structures on an unprecedented scale, overcoming the computational complexity of earlier standard Bayesian methods. The tools were validated using the Neisseria species, which exhibit frequent homologous recombination and occasional horizontal gene flow. The results demonstrate the potential of combining population genetic tools with phylogenetic analysis for a more comprehensive understanding of bacterial evolution.
Researchers investigated the role of top-down beta rhythms in supporting selective attention through a computational model of sensory cortical areas. Beta rhythms, which occur at a frequency of around 20 Hz, have been linked to attentional gain modulation in previous studies. The model simulated the interaction between different layers of the cortex and found that top-down beta rhythms can activate ascending synaptic projections from layer 5 to layers 4 and 2/3, which are responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow-inhibitory interneurons in layer 5 were shown to resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner.

The simulation results suggested that top-down beta rhythms can enhance gamma rhythms in layer 2/3, reduce beta rhythms in layer 2/3, and increase spiking activity of layer 2/3 regular spiking cells when attention is focused on a specific region of the visual field. This is consistent with neurophysiological findings that show attention enhances neural responses to stimuli. The model proposes that interlaminar interaction, regulated by top-down beta rhythms, supports selective attention by biasing competition between neurons in superficial layers. The study provides a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention, and highlights the critical role of slow-inhibitory interneurons in this process.
Researchers have developed a new method called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS) to improve the calibration and prediction of stochastic compartmental epidemic models. These models are useful for studying the early emergence of novel pathogens, but current methods for parameter estimation and prediction are limited. MSS uses a linear noise approximation to describe the size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the true epidemic state with each new surveillance observation. The method was evaluated using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen, assuming weekly counts of new diagnosed cases as an imperfect proxy for incidence. Results showed that MSS produced accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters, such as the mean duration of infectiousness, R0, and Reff, and provided an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also accurately predicted the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. In comparison to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods, MSS significantly outperformed them in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. The study suggests that MSS is a promising method for improving current approaches for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics. The method addresses several major challenges inherent in parameter estimation and model-based prediction during outbreaks, where the true epidemic state can be only partially observed and the behavior of disease spread is most stochastic.
Human visual perception is shaped by two contrasting forces: sensory adaptation and past decisions. A study using multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches investigated the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during adjustment and forced-choice tasks. The results revealed that each perceptual report is influenced by opposite biases from a hierarchy of serially dependent processes. Low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, while decisional traces attract perceptual reports toward the recent past.

The study found that "continuity fields" arise from the inertia of decisional templates, not from low-level sensory processes. This is consistent with a Two-process model of serial dependence, where the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. A unified account of serial dependence proposes that functionally distinct mechanisms, operating at different stages, promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time.

The research suggests that there are two contrasting forces that interact in shaping perception, biasing the appearance of visual stimuli toward or away from the past. Repulsive forces, resembling low-level adaptation, dominate after stimuli that require no perceptual decision. However, decisional traces affect current perceptual decisions even when interleaved with new stimuli, indicating that the history of decisions may represent a source of perceptual bias that combines with or outweighs the impact of previous stimuli. A hierarchical model of serial dependence proposes that two separate and contrasting forces, exerted by adaptation and decisional inertia, interact in shaping visual experience and reactions to environmental stimuli.
Researchers have investigated the role of circadian transcription in determining the core period of the circadian clock in Drosophila. The Clock-Cycle (CLK-CYC) heterodimer is a key component of the circadian transcription complex in Drosophila, and previous studies have shown that most of its transcriptional activity comes from the glutamine-rich region of its partner CLK. To explore the contribution of transcription to core circadian timekeeping, the researchers created a fusion protein by combining CYC with the viral protein 16 (VP16), a potent transcriptional activator. This fusion protein, CYC-VP16, was expressed in Drosophila and S2 cells, and its effects on circadian transcription were analyzed.

The results showed that the addition of VP16 to CYC significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of the CLK-CYC-VP16 complex compared to the wild-type CLK-CYC complex. Flies expressing CYC-VP16 had increased levels of CLK-CYC direct target gene mRNAs, including those from the period (per) and timeless (tim) genes, and exhibited a short period. This suggests that circadian transcription plays a role in determining the core period of the circadian clock in Drosophila. The researchers also found that the behavioral effects of CYC-VP16 expression required a per promoter, indicating that increased per transcription is responsible for the short period observed in these flies. Overall, the study suggests that the timing of transcriptional activation, rather than the activation itself, is the key event responsible for the behavioral effects observed in CYC-VP16-expressing flies.
Researchers have found that the ability of a horizontally acquired gene to confer new traits in an organism can be influenced by the presence of ancestral genes. Specifically, they studied the horizontally acquired pmrD gene in Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli, two closely related bacteria. The pmrD gene product activates the PmrA/PmrB two-component system, which leads to the transcription of genes that confer polymyxin B resistance. However, the E. coli PmrD protein cannot activate the PmrA/PmrB system in E. coli, whereas the Salmonella PmrD protein can do so in Salmonella. The researchers discovered that the E. coli PmrB protein has higher phosphatase activity towards the phosphorylated PmrA protein (PmrA-P) than the Salmonella PmrB protein. This difference in phosphatase activity is responsible for the inability of the E. coli PmrD protein to activate the PmrA/PmrB system. By replacing the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog, the researchers were able to render E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions. This finding suggests that horizontally acquired genes can potentiate selection at ancestral loci and that quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of ancestral proteins can dictate the ability of a horizontally acquired gene product to confer species-specific traits.
Researchers have developed a new method, called the Differentiation-Test, to identify genes that are differentially expressed during the early stages of cell differentiation. This method allows for the analysis of gene expression data from a mixture of differentiating embryonic stem cells without the need for prior separation of cell types. By applying this method to mouse embryonic stem cells, the researchers identified a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal called Smarcad1. The Differentiation-Test assumes that the differentiation process starts from a relatively homogeneous initial cell mixture and progresses into a more heterogeneous cell mixture with identifiable events of divergence of expression levels of certain genes.

The researchers used this approach to study the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies. They found that very early in this process, different subsets of cells start to show different expression changes that bias the development towards different lineages. The Differentiation-Test identified Smarcad1 as a critical regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal, which is downregulated during differentiation. The researchers further validated this finding by using short hairpin RNA to knockdown Smarcad1 and Pias2, two transcription regulators detected by the Differentiation-Test. The results suggest that the Differentiation-Test is a useful tool for identifying novel regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal, and can be applied to other differentiation processes.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify functional associations between genes that are mutated in the same disease. This method, called phenotypic-linkage network, takes into account various types of data, including protein-protein interactions and gene co-expression networks, to examine the relationships between genes. However, previous studies have been limited by a bias in coding-sequence length, which can lead to false positive findings. To address this issue, the researchers controlled for this bias and found that genes mutated in the same disease cluster more significantly in the phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. This method was tested using over 100,000 mammalian genotype-phenotype relations and bio-ontologies, which enhanced the accuracy of the phenotypic-linkage network. The results show that the phenotypic-linkage network is a powerful tool for identifying functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease, even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias. This method has the potential to improve the interpretation of variants in next-generation sequencing studies and provide new insights into the molecular pathways underlying complex diseases. The phenotypic-linkage network can also be used to functionally subcluster gene variants underlying polygenic disorders, making it a valuable tool for researchers studying the genetic basis of disease.
In an effort to combat rising obesity and diabetes rates, Mexico implemented an 8% tax on nonessential energy-dense foods and a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in January 2014. This study evaluated the impact of these taxes on packaged food purchases in Mexico's urban population. Using data from The Nielsen Company's Mexico Consumer Panel Services, researchers analyzed the volume of purchases of taxed and untaxed foods from January 2012 to December 2014. The study found that the mean volume of purchases of taxed foods decreased by 25 grams per capita per month, or 5.1%, in 2014 compared to what was expected based on pre-tax trends. This decline was not observed in purchases of untaxed foods. Low socioeconomic status (SES) households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods than expected, while medium SES households purchased 5.8% less taxed foods than expected. High SES households showed no significant change in purchases. The study's limitations include the inability to infer causality due to the lack of a control group and the sample's representativeness of only urban areas. The findings suggest that household purchases of nonessential energy-dense foods declined in the first year after the implementation of the taxes. Future studies should evaluate the impact of the taxes on overall energy intake, dietary quality, and food purchase patterns. The results of this study can inform policymakers in Mexico and other countries considering the implementation of food taxes.
A biophysically plausible model of collision-sensitive neurons, specifically the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) neuron of the locust, has been developed to explain its response properties. The model, called "n-ψ," assumes that each information channel is noisy and has a response threshold. By pooling these channels, an approximative power law is obtained, which is a common characteristic of such neurons. The model successfully predicts many response characteristics of the LGMD neuron, including its response to objects approaching on a direct collision course.

The n-ψ model is based on its predecessor model Ψ, which used an exact power law for re-scaling the inhibitory input. However, the n-ψ model is more biophysically plausible and assumes that the synaptic input is re-scaled according to an approximate power law. Noise in the inhibitory pathway plays a critical role in the model, as it approximates a power law through threshold smoothing. The model is robust against noise in the excitatory pathway.

The LGMD neuron is a well-studied visual neuron that responds best to objects approaching on a direct collision course. The n-ψ model provides a new understanding of the biophysical principles underlying the computations carried out by the LGMD neuron. The model suggests that the integration process, or pooling, could be carried out by the dendritic tree of the LGMD neuron. The preconditions for each channel are the presence of noise, uncorrelated across channels, and a response threshold.
The national Buruli ulcer control programme (NBUCP) in Cameroon was established in 2002, 33 years after the first cases were reported in 1969. The programme aimed to detect cases early, confirm 70% of clinical cases by PCR, treat all active cases according to standard guidelines, and heal at least 95% of patients without limitation of joint movement. Between 2001 and 2014, 3,700 cases of Buruli ulcer were notified, with a significant drop in detection rate from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of endemic health districts increased from two to 64, and five diagnostic and treatment centers are now functional, with two more planned for 2015. The health system has been strengthened, and research and education on Buruli ulcer have gained more interest in Cameroon. However, the reduction in programme resources and activities by major support partners has led to a steady drop in performance indicators since 2010. Despite these challenges, the programme has made significant progress in case detection and management, health system reinforcement, capacity building, and research. The current goal of the NBUCP is to reduce the suffering of the population due to Buruli ulcer, ensuring accessibility to quality health services in endemic areas to reduce morbidity and disability linked to the disease.
Researchers investigated the effect of outcome valence (gains or losses) on confidence judgments in human reinforcement learning. In two experiments, participants were more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses, despite equal difficulty and performance between the two contexts. Computational modeling revealed that this bias is driven by the context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the average expected-value of choice options, necessary to explain equal performance in the gain and loss domain. This biasing effect of context-value on confidence is domain-general, with likely important functional consequences. One such consequence emerges in volatile environments, where the flexibility of individuals' learning strategies differs when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. The study suggests that profound asymmetries might exist between learning to avoid losses and learning to seek gains, despite apparent similar behavior. The findings have implications for understanding the flexibility of learning and decision-making processes in different contexts. Confidence judgments and their biases in reinforcement learning are crucial for mediating learning strategies in changing environments. The study highlights the importance of considering the valence of decision outcomes in understanding human decision-making and learning processes.
A recent study has shed light on the function of the non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) of alphaviruses, a group of viruses that include Semliki Forest, Sindbis, and Chikungunya viruses. NsP3 is a crucial component of the viral replication complex, but its role has been poorly understood until now. Researchers have identified a conserved proline-rich sequence motif in the carboxyterminal region of nsP3 that serves as a binding site for the Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains of host cell proteins amphiphysin-1 and -2. This interaction is essential for alphavirus replication, as mutations in the nsP3 SH3 binding motif or silencing of amphiphysin-2 expression impaired viral RNA replication in infected cells. Furthermore, infection of mice with a virus carrying an SH3 binding-defective nsP3 resulted in significantly decreased mortality. The study demonstrates that the SH3 domain-mediated binding of nsP3 with amphiphysin is a critical host cell interaction that promotes alphavirus replication. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying alphavirus infection and suggest potential targets for the development of antiviral therapies.
A study was conducted to investigate the molecular epidemiology of chromoblastomycosis, a human disease caused by melanized fungi of the order Chaetothyriales, in Brazil. A total of 123 clinical strains from different endemic areas were analyzed using DNA sequencing. The results showed that the strains were divided into three clusters within the family Herpotrichiellaceae, which is known to comprise agents of the disease. The most prevalent agent was Fonsecaea pedrosoi, accounting for 80% of the strains, followed by Fonsecaea monophora (13%), Fonsecaea nubica (3%), and a single isolate of Fonsecaea pugnacius. Additionally, two novel species were identified among members of the genera Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora, with frequencies of 3% and 1%, respectively.

The study also found that the agents of chromoblastomycosis were polyphyletic within the order Chaetothyriales, being dispersed in three different clades: jeanselmei-, bantiana-, and europaea-clades. Fonsecaea was nested in the bantiana-clade and contains the prevalent agents of the disease. The study suggests that Fonsecaea pedrosoi and Fonsecaea nubica are strictly associated with chromoblastomycosis, while Fonsecaea monophora and Fonsecaea pugnacius may also be involved in the disease. The study provides new insights into the molecular epidemiology of chromoblastomycosis in Brazil and identifies two novel species of black fungi causing the disease.
Researchers have discovered that the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes dampens the host's DNA damage response (DDR) during infection. The DDR is a critical signaling pathway that detects and repairs DNA damage caused by various assaults, including infections. When L. monocytogenes infects a host cell, it induces DNA breaks, but surprisingly, the host's DDR response is only moderately activated. The researchers found that the listerial toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) plays a key role in blocking the DDR response by degrading the sensor protein Mre11. This degradation prevents the host cell from effectively responding to the DNA damage caused by the infection.

The study showed that knocking out or inactivating proteins involved in the DDR leads to increased bacterial replication, highlighting the importance of this mechanism in controlling infection. Furthermore, the researchers found that deleting or inhibiting proteins involved in the DDR results in higher levels of infection, demonstrating for the first time that the DDR can be a negative regulator of bacterial infection. This subversion of the DDR by L. monocytogenes is critical for a successful infection, as it allows the bacterium to evade the host's immune response and proliferate within the host cell. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms by which L. monocytogenes infects host cells and highlight the importance of the DDR in controlling bacterial infection.
Researchers have identified a protein called BRD4 as a key player in the replication of human herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). These viruses are common pathogens that cause a range of human diseases. By screening a library of compounds that regulate epigenetic processes, the researchers found that inhibiting the activity of BRD4 enhanced the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2. They used a compound called JQ1, which specifically targets the BD1 domain of BRD4, and found that it increased the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 by promoting the association of transcription factors with viral gene promoters.

The researchers showed that BRD4 regulates HSV replication by forming a complex with CDK9 and RNA polymerase II, and that JQ1 promotes HSV infection by allocating this complex to viral gene promoters. They also found that suppressing BRD4 expression or inhibiting CDK9 activity impeded HSV infection. Furthermore, they demonstrated that transient expression of the BD1 or BD1/2 domain of BRD4 had a similar effect to JQ1 treatment, suggesting that JQ1 enhances HSV infection by switching BRD4's function from chromatin targeting to transcription regulation of viral gene expression.

These findings suggest that BRD4 plays a crucial role in HSV infection and that targeting BRD4 with compounds like JQ1 could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating HSV infections. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of HSV replication and highlights the importance of BRD4 in this process.
Researchers conducted a study to understand the microbial ecology of noma, a devastating illness that causes severe facial disfigurement in over 140,000 malnourished children annually. The cause of noma is still unknown, but a combination of microbial infection, poor oral hygiene, and a weakened immune system is thought to contribute to its development. The study used high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments to analyze the bacterial communities in the mouths of 12 healthy children, 12 children with noma, and 12 children with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG), a related periodontal disease.

The results showed that the bacterial communities in noma lesions were distinct from those in healthy individuals, with an enrichment of Spirochaetes and a depletion of Proteobacteria. In contrast, the bacterial communities in healthy sites of diseased mouths were similar to those in healthy control individuals. The study also found that the microbial communities in noma and ANG lesions were dominated by the same Prevotella intermedia OTU, which was less abundant in healthy sites. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites were significantly different.

The study identified several bacterial orders, including Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales, as potential indicators of noma. The findings suggest that one or more microbes within these orders may be associated with the development of noma lesions. Future studies should investigate the viral and microbial components of the community before and early in noma lesion development to better understand the etiology of this devastating disease.
Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium that infects insects, uses a complex communication system called quorum sensing to adapt to its environment. Quorum sensing allows the bacteria to coordinate their behavior, including the decision to form spores, which is essential for their survival. Researchers have identified a key player in this process, a protein called NprR, which is regulated by a signaling peptide called NprX. In the presence of NprX, NprR acts as a transcriptional activator, regulating genes involved in the necrotrophic lifestyle of the bacteria, allowing them to survive in the insect cadaver. However, in the absence of NprX, NprR inhibits sporulation by preventing the phosphorylation of the phosphotransferase Spo0F, thus delaying the initiation of the sporulation process. This dual function of NprR is similar to that of Rap proteins, which also belong to the RNPP family and control gene expression through protein-protein interactions. The crystal structure of NprR reveals a flexible structure similar to that of Rap proteins, suggesting a common mechanism of inhibition of the sporulation phosphorelay. The researchers propose that NprX binding to NprR switches its function from a dimeric inhibitor of sporulation to a tetrameric transcriptional activator, coordinating sporulation and necrotrophism to ensure the survival and dissemination of the bacteria during host infection.
Researchers have developed a new computational model to predict the effectiveness of HIV treatment for individual patients. The model, called proteochemometric modeling, combines information about the chemical properties of antiretroviral drugs and the genetic mutations of the HIV virus. This approach is more accurate than previous models, which only considered the genetic mutations of the virus. The new model was trained on a large dataset of over 300,000 drug-mutant bioactivity data points and was able to predict the effectiveness of treatment with an error rate below 0.5 Log Fold Change. When compared to previous models, the new model performed better in resistance classification and prediction of Log Fold Change. The researchers were also able to identify previously unknown resistance-conferring mutations of HIV Reverse Transcriptase and HIV Protease. The model was applied to a public HIV resistance database and achieved a correct resistance prediction rate of 84%. The researchers conclude that proteochemometric models can accurately predict the phenotypic resistance of HIV based on genotypic data, even for novel mutants and mixtures. The model also includes an applicability domain, which informs the user about the reliability of predictions. This new approach has the potential to improve HIV treatment by providing a more accurate prediction of the effectiveness of treatment for individual patients.
A computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis, based on pseudopod autocatalysis, has been developed to explain the complex behavior of eukaryotic cells during chemotaxis. The model proposes that pseudopods are formed through a self-generated cycle, and chemoattractants modulate this cycle rather than directly causing actin polymerization. The model successfully reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemotaxis, including cell polarization and persistence without stimuli, selection of accurate pseudopods in the presence of chemoattractant gradients, and bias of pseudopod position in low chemoattractant gradients. The model also predicts lateral pseudopod initiation in high gradients, which was experimentally confirmed in Dictyostelium cells. Furthermore, the model predicts that the angle between successive pseudopods at the front of the cell will increase in proportion to the difference between the cell's direction and the direction of the gradient, which was also experimentally verified. The results suggest that the mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod behavior rather than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by chemoattractants. The model's simplicity and robustness to parameter changes emphasize that much of the complex behavior of cells may be an emergent property derived from relatively simple pathways, implying a need for a change in experimental approach to understand chemotaxis.
Researchers investigated how different types of rodent blood affect the transmission of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, by fleas. They found that fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood were more likely to regurgitate a portion of the infected blood back into their esophagus within 24 hours of feeding, a phenomenon they called post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). This regurgitation obstructed the passage of blood during the flea's next meal and increased the transmission of Y. pestis. In contrast, fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood rarely exhibited PIER. The researchers also found that fleas infected with rat or guinea pig blood were more likely to be partially blocked, with fresh blood retained in their esophagus, than those infected with mouse or gerbil blood. Three days after feeding on bacteremic rat blood, fleas transmitted significantly more Y. pestis than those infected with mouse blood, and this enhanced transmission was dependent on the formation of biofilms. The study suggests that the relative insolubility of the hemoglobin in rat and guinea pig blood, as well as the slower digestion of their blood, may contribute to the increased regurgitative transmission of Y. pestis. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of early-phase transmission of Y. pestis by fleas and highlight the importance of considering the source of rodent blood used in infectious blood meals when studying vector competence.
Researchers have found that positive correlations between the activity of neurons in the brain can significantly enhance the fidelity of population codes, contrary to previous studies that suggested these correlations were detrimental. In fact, the probability of discrimination error can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude, and the number of stimuli encoded can be increased more than tenfold. This effect does not require unrealistic correlation values and can occur in populations with just a few tens of neurons. The researchers also found that heterogeneity in population activity, which is commonly observed in the brain, can further enhance these effects. The key to this improved coding performance lies in a specific pattern of correlation, which can lead to a "lock-in" of response probabilities that eliminates variability in the subspace relevant for stimulus discrimination. This pattern can be achieved by tuning one or several effective parameters, resulting in a limit of perfect coding. The researchers suggest that this phenomenon, which they term "high-fidelity coding," is a general feature of population coding and can be observed in various approaches. They propose experimental tests to identify the specific pattern of correlation responsible for this effect, which could have significant implications for our understanding of neural coding and information processing in the brain.
Researchers have developed a new conjugate vaccine against cholera, a severe diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae. The vaccine combines the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of the V. cholerae O1 Inaba strain with a recombinant fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain (OSP:rTTHc). This conjugate vaccine was tested in mice to assess its ability to induce immune responses and provide protection against cholera.

The study found that mice immunized with the vaccine developed strong anti-OSP and anti-tetanus toxin serum IgG responses, as well as vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses. The vaccine also induced intestinal lamina proprial IgA responses targeting OSP when administered intradermally. Importantly, the vaccine provided 55% protective efficacy in a mouse survival cholera challenge model.

The researchers tested various vaccine formulations, including different doses, molar ratios of OSP to rTTHc, and the presence or absence of an adjuvant. They found that the vaccine induced comparable immune responses across these variations, although memory B cell and vibriocidal responses were reduced in mice receiving the highest dose of vaccine. The study also found that the vaccine was effective in the presence or absence of an adjuvant, and that intradermal administration of the vaccine induced OSP-specific responses in intestinal tissue.

Overall, the results suggest that the OSP:rTTHc conjugate vaccine is a promising candidate for the prevention of cholera, particularly in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Cameroon to investigate the cross-reactivity of immunochromatographic card tests (ICT) for lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas with contrasting endemicity levels of Loa loa and Mansonella perstans. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti, L. loa, and M. perstans in 42 villages across three regions of the Cameroon rainforest domain. A total of 2190 individuals participated in the study, with 24 individuals testing positive for ICT, with prevalence rates ranging from 0% in the South-west to 2.1% in the North-west.

The study found a strong association between ICT positivity and high L. loa microfilaria (Mf) intensity, with 21 subjects having more than 8,000 L. loa Mf/ml of blood. Additionally, a strong positive association was observed between the prevalence of L. loa and ICT positivity by area, with a rate of 1% or more of positive ICT results found only in areas with an L. loa Mf prevalence above 15%. In contrast, there was no association between ICT positivity and M. perstans prevalence or Mf density.

The study confirmed the strong association between ICT positivity and L. loa intensity at the individual level and demonstrated that ICT positivity is strongly associated with high L. loa prevalence. The findings suggest that the main confounding factor for positive ICT test card results is high levels of L. loa, indicating that W. bancrofti may be less prevalent in the Central African region than previously assumed.
Researchers have investigated the replication process of SARS-CoV, a positive-strand RNA virus, in host cells. They used electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells to visualize the three-dimensional structure of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. The analysis revealed a unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that integrates convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), and "vesicle packets" formed by DMV merger. The convoluted membranes were primarily immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits, while double-stranded RNA, indicative of viral RNA synthesis, was mainly localized to the DMV interior. However, no connection was observed between the DMV interior and the cytosol, raising questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. The study documents the extensive reorganization of host cell membranes into a network used for viral replication and possibly hiding replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms. This ultrastructural description, combined with biochemical studies of the viral enzyme complex, will aid in understanding the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and its interactions with the host.
A recent study in Arabidopsis thaliana has provided direct genetic evidence that suberin, a chemical compound found in plant roots, plays a crucial role in controlling water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves. The study used a newly characterized mutant, esb1, which has increased root suberin levels, to investigate the effects of suberin on plant water relations and ion transport. The results showed that esb1 mutants had reduced daytime transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during their vegetative growth period. Additionally, the mutants had altered elemental accumulation in the shoot, with decreases in calcium, manganese, and zinc, and increases in sodium, sulfur, potassium, arsenic, selenium, and molybdenum. These findings suggest that suberin acts as a barrier to the extracellular transport of both water and mineral ions in the root. The study also found that elevated suberin levels in the root reduced water movement to the shoot and water loss from the root back to the soil, resulting in delayed wilting during water stress. The results provide strong experimental support for the standard model that suberin acts as an extracellular transport barrier limiting apoplastic radial transport of water and solutes. The study's findings have implications for the development of drought-resistant crops with improved water-use efficiency.
Researchers investigated the kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating the recovery and reproducibility of rod photoresponse in vertebrate phototransduction. They developed a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model based on the biochemistry of rhodopsin activation and deactivation, which was interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model parameters were extracted from photoresponse data of wild-type and mutant mice with varying numbers of phosphorylation sites. The results showed that the model could reproduce both wild-type and mutant responses with the same set of parameters.

The study found that the randomness of the sojourn times in each phosphorylated state contributed to the coefficient of variation (CV) of the response, while the randomness of the number of rhodopsin (R*) turnoff steps had a negligible effect. This contradicts the prevailing view that the larger the number of decay steps of R*, the more stable the photoresponse is. Instead, the study suggests that R* shutoff is responsible for the variability of the photoresponse, while the diffusion of second messengers acts as a variability suppressor.

The researchers also simulated deactivation of rhodopsin with one or several mutant phosphorylation sites and found that mutant mouse rhodopsins bearing fewer than 6 phosphorylation sites generated photoresponses of significantly extended durations. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of rod photoresponse and the role of rhodopsin deactivation in its recovery and reproducibility.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical framework to analyze the dynamics of stochastic reaction networks within cells, which are influenced by external factors such as fluctuations in ribosome copy numbers. The framework allows for the decoupling of the network from its dynamic environment by incorporating the environment's effect into a new model. This is achieved by marginalizing the system dynamics with respect to the extrinsic fluctuations, resulting in a "self-contained" stochastic model that summarizes all system behaviors attainable under all possible realizations of the extrinsic noise.

The new framework provides a novel analytical tool to study how environmental stochasticity is propagated along coupled reaction networks. It shows that the total environmental noise can be split into two terms: one corresponding to the noise that is suppressed and a second term that quantifies the effective noise sensed by the target network. Additionally, the decoupled process can yield a significant reduction in computational effort in Monte Carlo simulations, especially when the environmental network is costly to simulate.

The framework is based on a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) that describes the time-evolution of a stochastic reaction network with chemical species and reaction channels. The researchers demonstrate the significance of the approach through several case studies, highlighting its potential as a general tool to split stochastic biochemical networks into individual parts that are easier to simulate.
Researchers have developed a novel closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMI) training architecture that enables robust control and adaptation using spike events. This architecture, called adaptive optimal feedback-controlled (OFC) point process filter (PPF), incorporates an infinite-horizon optimal feedback-control model of the brain's behavior in closed-loop BMI control and a point process model of spikes. The OFC model infers the user's motor intention during closed-loop decoder adaptation (CLDA) and is used to design an autonomous and dynamic assisted training technique. The point process model allows for neural processing, control, and decoder adaptation with every spike event and at a faster time-scale than current decoders.

The researchers conducted closed-loop experiments in a non-human primate over tens of days to test the novel CLDA components. The results showed that the OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared to current intention estimation techniques. OFC-assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control. Spike-event-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared to batch-based methods and was robust to parameter initialization. The architecture also extended control to tasks beyond those used for CLDA training.

The proposed CLDA architecture consists of two main components: a unified control-theoretic OFC framework for intention estimation and assisted training, and dynamic spike-event-based adaptation. The OFC model infers velocity intention during adaptation, and the point process model allows for neural processing, control, and decoder adaptation with every spike event. This novel architecture has significant implications for the development of clinically-viable neuroprosthetics.
Researchers investigated the effect of stimulus structure on redundancy in the retina by measuring simultaneous responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells presented with natural and artificial stimuli that varied greatly in correlation structure. The study found that responding to spatio-temporally structured stimuli, such as natural movies, pairs of ganglion cells were modestly more correlated than in response to white noise checkerboards. However, they were much less correlated than predicted by a non-adapting functional model of retinal response. In contrast, responding to stimuli with purely spatial correlations, pairs of ganglion cells showed increased correlations consistent with a static, non-adapting receptive field and nonlinearity. The study also found that ganglion cells had faster temporal kernels and tended to have stronger surrounds in response to spatio-temporally correlated stimuli. These properties of individual cells, along with gain changes that opposed changes in effective contrast at the ganglion cell input, largely explained the pattern of pairwise correlations across stimuli. The results suggest that the mammalian retina maintains a moderate level of output correlation across a wide range of spatio-temporally correlated stimuli, ranging from white noise checkerboards to natural movies. The amount of output correlation varies between stimuli, but the changes are much less than predicted by a non-adapting linear-nonlinear functional model.
Researchers have developed a new approach to predict genetic interactions, specifically synthetic lethal (SL) interactions, which occur when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype. This approach, called the Multi-Network and Multi-Classifier (MNMC) framework, improves upon existing methods by using a large number of features from various data sources to characterize the relationships between pairs of genes. These features are independent of known SL interactions, unlike some previous approaches. The MNMC framework uses a non-parametric multi-classifier system to predict SL interactions, enabling the simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that the new approach outperformed the current state-of-the-art method, particularly for gene pairs not well-connected to known SL interactions. The MNMC framework was used to predict SL interactions between all non-essential gene pairs in yeast, resulting in the first yeast transcription factor genetic interaction network, which was partially supported by literature. This approach is expected to be effective in uncovering new genetic interactions in yeast and higher organisms, such as mouse and human, where few genetic interactions have been identified. The MNMC framework has the potential to significantly expand the set of known SL interactions, which are crucial for understanding functional redundancy, dissecting protein complexes, and exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of common human diseases.
The BRCA Challenge is a global data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate and interpret variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with an increased risk of cancer. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk. The BRCA Exchange, a newly created website (www.brcaexchange.org), serves as a centralized platform for sharing and annotating BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. The database currently contains over 20,000 variants, three times the number found in the next-largest public database, with approximately 7,250 expert classifications.

The BRCA Challenge has brought together experts from various fields, including clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, to advance our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. The project has also established partnerships with national centers to encourage data sharing and has developed methods for extracting genetic variation from individual laboratory reports. The BRCA Exchange provides a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype, enabling clinicians and patients to make informed decisions together.

The BRCA Challenge represents an important step in sharing and collaborative annotation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants to advance human health globally. The project has developed an open-access web portal, the BRCA Exchange, which serves as a demonstration project to bring together clinicians, researchers, data scientists, patients, and advocates to work toward a new model of data sharing. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant data set comprises data from participating groups and major academic data sources, including ClinVar, BIC, Exome Aggregation Consortium, and the 1000 Genomes Project.
Malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in approximately one million deaths annually. To maintain its pathogenicity and adapt to various environments, Plasmodium relies on a delicate balance of redox metabolism. Researchers have mapped the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox regulatory proteins in Plasmodium falciparum, providing the first comprehensive picture of redox compartmentation in the parasite.

The study found that two peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxalase system are targeted to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid in Plasmodium. Additionally, the compartmentation of thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin-like proteins was elucidated. Notably, Plasmodium uses alternative translation initiation (ATI) to achieve differential targeting of two major antioxidant redox-enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase. This dual localization of proteins affected by ATI may also occur in other Apicomplexa and could provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention.

The apicoplast, a plant-like organelle in Plasmodium, harbors essential metabolic pathways, including fatty-acid and hem biosynthesis. However, the antioxidative capacity of the apicoplast was previously unknown. The absence of major antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase, in the parasite offers potential for the development of chemotherapeutic agents that disrupt the redox equilibrium of Plasmodium. The study provides a tool to better understand the cellular functions and interactions of the redox system in malaria parasites.
Researchers have investigated the role of electrostatic interactions in the binding process between PUMA, an intrinsically disordered protein, and its cellular partner Mcl-1. Using a structure-based coarse-grained model, they found that non-native electrostatic interactions play a significant role in the formation of the initial encounter complex between PUMA and Mcl-1. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and affinity, and was shown to be consistent with previously published data on binding rate changes with respect to ionic strength.

The study suggests that intramolecular electrostatic interactions have a minimal effect on the unbound states of PUMA, but intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native ones, are crucial for the binding process. The researchers used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to describe the mechanism of interactions between PUMA and Mcl-1, and found that the binding process is accelerated by electrostatic interactions. The association rates decreased at higher ionic strengths, where charges are more efficiently screened from each other and electrostatic interactions are weakened.

The study highlights the importance of non-native electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding process of PUMA and Mcl-1. The findings suggest that these interactions are involved in the formation of the initial encounter complex, and that they play a crucial role in the binding mechanism. This research provides new insights into the binding behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins, and has implications for understanding the role of electrostatic interactions in protein-protein interactions.
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play a crucial role in maintaining the silencing of key developmental genes outside of their expression domains. Recent studies have shown that PcG proteins localize in structures called Polycomb (PC) bodies, which contain PcG-silenced genes, and form local and long-range spatial networks. This study investigated the nuclear distribution of two PcG proteins, PC and Polyhomeotic (PH), during fly embryogenesis using immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins.

The results show that PC bodies correspond to 3D structural counterparts of linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During early embryogenesis, PC and PH progressively accumulate within PC bodies, which form nuclear structures localized on distinct euchromatin domains containing histone H3 tri-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis revealed two types of motion influencing the displacement of PC bodies and chromatin domains: long-range motions that may correspond to the movement of whole chromosome territories, and fast and highly constrained motion within volumes slightly larger than those of condensed chromatin domains.

The fast motion of PC bodies and chromatin domains observed during early embryogenesis decreases in late developmental stages, indicating a possible contribution of chromatin dynamics in the maintenance of stable gene silencing. The study also found that the motion of PC bodies is less sensitive to temperature than chromatin domains in late embryos, suggesting that Polycomb proteins may specifically buffer environmental effects such as temperature change, which may be an important determinant of the stability of Polycomb-dependent gene silencing during development.
Researchers used ultra-deep sequencing to study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the livers of normally- and prematurely-aging mice. They found that mice with a proof-reading-deficient mtDNA polymerase (mtDNA mutator mice) had 10-times-higher point mutation loads than their wildtype siblings. These mice also had increased levels of a truncated linear mtDNA molecule, resulting in decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region. In contrast, circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions occurred at extremely low frequencies in mtDNA mutator mice and did not drive the premature aging phenotype. Sequence analysis showed that the main proportion of the mutation load in heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice and their wildtype siblings was inherited from their heterozygous mothers, consistent with germline transmission. The study found no increase in levels of point mutations or deletions in wildtype C57Bl/6N mice with increasing age, questioning the causative role of these changes in aging. Additionally, there was no increased frequency of transversion mutations with time in any of the studied genotypes, arguing against oxidative damage as a major cause of mtDNA mutations. The results suggest that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development and do not result from damage accumulation in adult life.
Researchers have discovered a new type of Na+-driven ATP synthase membrane rotor in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. This enzyme uses glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of Na+, which is directly coupled to ATP synthesis. The F1Fo-ATP synthase in F. nucleatum has a novel Na+ recognition motif, shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free-energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Activity measurements showed Na+ stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to the Na+ ionophore monensin. The researchers also found that Na+ has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites, both in the complete ATP synthase and the isolated c-ring. Two identical crystal structures of the c11 ring were solved by X-ray crystallography, revealing that Na+ ions occupy all binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water molecule. The structure shows a new mode of ion coupling in ATP synthases and provides a basis for drug-design efforts against this opportunistic pathogen.
Researchers investigated the relationship between T cell receptor (TCR) interactions with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and T cell responses in the body. They studied how T cells recognize and respond to peptides bound to MHC molecules on antigen-presenting cells, which is crucial for initiating adaptive immunity against pathogens. In laboratory experiments, high-affinity binding and long-lived interactions between TCRs and MHC molecules typically lead to strong T cell activation. However, the researchers found that in the body, optimal T cell responses occur to peptides with intermediate TCR/MHC half-lives, rather than those with the longest half-lives. They observed that T cells responded poorly to a strong TCR ligand in the body, despite its high potency in laboratory experiments. This was associated with reduced intracellular signaling, expansion, and function of the T cells. The study highlights the importance of considering the effectiveness of TCR ligands in the body, rather than just their potency in laboratory experiments, when designing vaccines. The findings suggest that strategies aiming to elicit maximum-avidity TCR recognition with engineered peptide ligands may need to be reevaluated. Overall, the study reveals a level of control over T cell activation in the body that is not seen in laboratory experiments.
The genome of Nectria haematococca, a member of the Fusarium solani species complex, has been extensively studied. This fungus has diverse biological properties, including the ability to cause disease in over 100 plant genera and opportunistic infections in humans. The current research analyzed the most studied member of this complex, N. haematococca mating population VI (MPVI). Optical mapping revealed that the sequenced isolate has 17 chromosomes, ranging from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb, and a physical genome size of 54.43 Mb, making it one of the largest reported for ascomycetes. The number of predicted genes, 15,707, is also among the highest.

Two classes of genes have contributed to gene expansion in N. haematococca MPVI: specific genes not found in other fungi, including its closest sequenced relative, Fusarium graminearum, and genes present in multiple copies in N. haematococca MPVI but as single copies in other fungi. Some of these additional genes appear to have resulted from gene duplication events, while others may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Supernumerary chromosomes 14, 15, and 17 contain more repeat sequences, are enriched in unique and duplicated genes, and have a lower G+C content compared to other chromosomes.

The origin of the extra genes and supernumerary chromosomes is unknown, but the gene expansion and large genome size are consistent with the species' diverse range of habitats. The presence of unique genes on supernumerary chromosomes may account for individual isolates having different environmental niches. Further research is needed to determine the sequence of field isolates and compare the sizes and organization of their genomes to F. graminearum and other fusaria in the Gibberella clade.
Researchers have developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to study the egress of pseudorabies virus (PRV) particles from infected cells. The study aimed to elucidate the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, the researchers visualized the final transport and exocytosis of PRV particles in non-polarized epithelial cells. They used a virus-encoded pH-sensitive probe to track the precise moment and location of particle exocytosis.

The study found that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles. Rab GTPases, key regulators of the plasma membrane-directed secretory pathway, are present on the virus secretory vesicle. The vesicles undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis, which is often near patches of LL5β, a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. The vesicles are tightly docked at the site of exocytosis for several seconds, and membrane fusion occurs, displacing the virion a small distance across the plasma membrane.

After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. The study proposes an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress. The findings contradict an earlier study that suggested a different mechanism of viral egress and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on the intestinal microbiota and host immune response in 109 primary school children. The study found that pinworm infection was associated with increased intestinal bacterial diversity, which peaked after administration of mebendazole. At the phylum level, pinworm infection and mebendazole treatment were linked to a decrease in Fusobacteria and an increase in Actinobacteria. Specifically, the relative abundance of the probiotic Bifidobacterium increased after enterobiasis and mebendazole treatment.

The study also found that the intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) level was lower in the pinworm-infected group, but was elevated in half of the individuals after mebendazole deworming treatment. However, a higher proportion of pre-treatment Salmonella spp. was associated with a non-increase in SIgA after mebendazole deworming treatment. The results suggest that childhood exposure to pinworm and mebendazole is associated with increased bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of Actinobacteria, and a decreased proportion of Fusobacteria.

The study highlights the complex interaction between pinworm infection, intestinal microbiota, and host immune responses. Further research, including animal studies, is needed to better understand the causal relationships between pinworm infection and mebendazole treatment on gut microbial composition and host immune responses.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association analysis to study the genetics of root length in Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that the genomic narrow-sense heritability for root length in the examined population was statistically zero, indicating that most genetic variance was not additive. Standard genome-wide association (GWA) approaches, which assume additive genetic variance, failed to identify any loci associated with root length. However, the broad-sense heritability for root length was significantly larger, primarily due to epistasis, or interactions between genetic loci. The researchers performed an epistatic GWA analysis to map loci contributing to epistatic genetic variance and identified four interacting pairs of loci involving seven chromosomal loci. These loci were not detected in the additive GWA analysis due to epistasis that cancelled out the additive genetic variance. The researchers estimated that half of the associated pairs were true positive associations using a new statistical approach. Experimental evaluation of candidate genes within the associated loci suggested that this estimate was conservative, and functional candidate genes affecting root development were identified in four loci. The study highlights the importance of accounting for epistatic interactions in identifying genetic loci contributing to complex traits, such as root length in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Researchers analyzed 30,506 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from around the world to investigate the relationship between mtDNA background and disease-causing mutations. They found that the likelihood of acquiring or retaining a disease-causing mutation is influenced by the mtDNA sequence background. Specifically, certain mtDNA macro-haplogroups were associated with a higher or lower frequency of disease-causing mutations. For example, the number of mtDNA sequences harboring two or more disease-causing mutations was significantly lower in macro-haplogroup N than expected by chance. This suggests that the mtDNA background plays a role in the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mtDNA mutations. The study also found that some disease-causing mutations were observed across multiple haplogroup backgrounds, while others were specific to certain clades. This indicates that the relationship between mtDNA background and disease-causing mutations is not limited to a few examples, but is a more general phenomenon. Furthermore, the study found that disease-causing mutations were more frequent on young sequences, and genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected by chance. These findings provide an explanation for the low frequency of mtDNA disease reported in specific ethnic groups and suggest that the mtDNA background is an important factor in the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mtDNA mutations.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the interactions between cells migrating on a micropatterned substrate. This model takes into account the mechanics of cell shape and a minimal chemical model for contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), a phenomenon where cells slow down or stop moving when they come into contact with each other. The model was used to simulate collisions between two cells and was able to reproduce all possible outcomes, including cells reversing direction, sticking to each other, or walking past each other. The study found that a delicate balance between cell polarization, CIL, and cell-cell adhesion determines the outcome of these collisions. The researchers identified key parameters that control the transitions between these outcomes, including cell-cell adhesion, propulsion strength, and the rates of CIL. These findings suggest hypotheses for why different cell types exhibit different collision behaviors and the effects of interventions that modulate collision outcomes. The study also highlights the importance of incorporating biochemical interactions, such as CIL and cell contact dynamics, into models of cell-cell interactions, as simplified models may not accurately capture the complexity of these interactions. The model was able to reproduce the heterogeneity in cell-cell collision outcomes observed in neural crest cells, suggesting that cell-to-cell variation in key parameters, such as cell-cell adhesion, may be a contributing factor.
The dissociation mechanism of thioredoxin (Trx) mixed disulfide complexes has been a topic of debate for over twenty years. Researchers used the complex between Trx and arsenate reductase (ArsC) as a model to study this process. They found that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx into contact with Cys29Trx, activating it for nucleophilic attack. Cys32Trx is more reactive than Cys82ArsC and directs its nucleophilic attack on Cys29Trx, not on Cys89ArsC. This process results in the reduced substrate and oxidized Trx. The study used a multidisciplinary approach, combining theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants. The results provide new insights into the universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism. In this mechanism, Cys29Trx nucleophilically attacks Cys89ArsC of the Cys82ArsC-Cys89ArsC disulfide, forming a Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide intermediate complex. Cys32Trx then performs a nucleophilic attack on Cys29Trx of the Cys29Trx-Cys89ArsC disulfide, leading to the dissociation of the mixed disulfide and the release of Cys82ArsC. The deprotonation mechanism of the Cys32Trx thiol has been debated, but the study suggests that the nucleophilic attack of Cys32Trx on Cys29Trx is the favored reaction.
Researchers investigated how people use social information to determine their preferences, specifically in the context of inter-temporal preferences, which involve weighing the value of immediate versus delayed rewards. They proposed that personal preferences, or "tastes," are not fixed personality traits, but rather uncertain beliefs that can be updated based on evidence, such as the preferences of others. The researchers developed a model, called the taste-uncertainty (KU) model, which assumes that individuals maintain and update a distribution of their own taste and sample from it to make choices. They tested this model in a large study of 14-24 year olds, assessing their discounting preferences, including decision variability, before and after observing another person's choices. The results showed that participants displayed decision variability that was better accounted for by a random-taste model than by a response-noise model, indicating that their choices reflected uncertainty about their own preferences. The study also found that apparent taste shifts were well described by a Bayesian model that took into account taste uncertainty and the relevance of social information. These findings suggest that people can learn about their own preferences by considering the preferences of others and that uncertainty about one's own preferences is an important basis for subsequent preference shifts. The study's results have implications for understanding neuroscientific, clinical, and developmental aspects of human decision-making.
Researchers investigated how different signaling pathways converge to regulate a complex differentiation response called filamentous growth in budding yeast. They used a novel screening approach called secretion profiling to measure the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2p, a signaling mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth MAPK pathway. The study found that multiple pathways, including RAS, RIM101, OPI1, and RTG, are required for filamentous growth and converge on the FG pathway. This convergence sensitizes the FG pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronizes it with the global signaling network.

The researchers identified several regulators of the FG pathway, including components of the RAS pathway and the inositol regulatory transcription factor Opi1p. They also found that the histone deacetylase Rpd3p positively regulates FG pathway activity and filamentous growth by controlling accessibility to the MSB2 promoter, a target "hub" where multiple signals converge. The study provides the first glimpse of a global regulatory hierarchy among the pathways that control filamentous growth and suggests that systems-level integration of signaling circuitry coordinates other regulatory networks that control complex behaviors. The findings indicate that the pathways that control filamentous growth are connected in co-regulatory circuits, revealing a systems-level coordination of this differentiation response.
Researchers investigated the role of gene expression changes in the evolution of diverse morphologies in filamentous fungi, specifically in the Sordariomycetes group. They cultured five species in a common environment and analyzed genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages. By reconstructing ancestral gene expression phenotypes, the team identified genes with the largest increases in expression across development. Knockout experiments in two divergent species showed altered fruiting body development in the species with increased expression. This approach proved more efficient than targeting whole genomes or gene families. The study combined gene expression measurements with knockout phenotypes to refine Bayesian networks of genes underlying fruiting body development. This process is one of the least understood in multicellular development. The researchers found that few developmental genes retain common phenotypes or stages of development, yet numerous genes contribute to the larger fruiting body developmental process. The study aimed to understand the common and divergent developmental sources of homologous phenotypes and how novelty arises despite the constraints of existing gene interaction networks. By mapping differential variational properties associated with developmental processes, the team gained insights into how and why developmental evolution occurs. Estimation of gene expression phenotypes in ancestral lineages helped identify putative changes in gene expression that may be key to morphological and adaptive innovation. Changes in morphology were found to map to changes in gene regulation and expression, suggesting that complex phenotypes depend on changes in key genes controlling developmental processes.
Researchers investigated the use of square wave electroporation to introduce transgenes and other macromolecules into the eggs of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. The study aimed to target the schistosome egg as a developmental stage for transgenesis due to its high ratio of germ to somatic cells, allowing for potential propagation and amplification of the transgene. The researchers found that electroporation facilitated the introduction of reporter transgenes and virions into the eggs, resulting in successful transduction of the miracidia hatched from treated eggs.

The study demonstrated that electroporation was more efficient than soaking alone in delivering exogenous nucleic acids into the eggs, including messenger RNA encoding luciferase and pseudotyped retrovirus virions. Specifically, electroporation resulted in 2-3 times as many copies of provirus in the miracidia compared to soaking alone. Additionally, the study showed that electroporation facilitated the introduction of reporter transgenes into the germinal cells of the miracidia, as indicated by the presence of strong foci of fluorescence at the posterior of the larva.

The findings of this study underscore the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis. The results suggest that square wave electroporation is a valuable tool for introducing transgenes and other macromolecules into the eggs of S. mansoni, and may have implications for the development of new strategies for controlling schistosomiasis, a significant public health problem in many parts of the world.
Researchers have developed a new approach called the Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model to study the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies. This model involves probing the assembly with an initial perturbation and monitoring the time-dependent responses of all residues simultaneously from the moment of perturbation until equilibrium is reached. The PMT model assumes that perturbations are transmitted through a Markovian process through the connected network defined by the contacts between atoms and residues.

The PMT model can identify pivot residues important for macromolecular movement, messenger residues key to signal mediation, and anchor residues crucial for binding interactions. By analyzing the GroEL-GroES chaperone system, the researchers found that their predictions had an accuracy of 71-84% when compared to independent experimental studies. This approach is general and can be applied to other large macromolecular machineries, such as the virus capsid and ribosomal complex.

The PMT model is effective for very large macromolecular assemblies, requiring relatively small amounts of computational time. It can also be modified to study signal transmission pathways by applying initial perturbation to restricted local regions, such as binding surfaces. The model provides rich information on the dynamic behavior of large macromolecular assemblies, including the characterization of functionally important residues and the mechanism of signal transduction.
Researchers investigated the role of fungal galectins, a type of carbohydrate-binding protein, in the defense of fungi against predators. They used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to test the nematotoxic activity of a mushroom galectin, Coprinopsis cinerea CGL2. The study found that feeding CGL2 to C. elegans inhibited its development and reproduction, ultimately leading to the nematode's death. The researchers discovered that the toxicity of CGL2 depends on its interaction with a specific fucose-containing glycoconjugate on the nematode's N-glycan cores.

A screen for CGL2-resistant worm mutants identified the glycoconjugate as a Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 modification of C. elegans N-glycan cores. Analysis of N-glycan structures in wild-type and CGL2-resistant nematodes confirmed this finding and led to the identification of a novel putative glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of this glycoepitope. The X-ray crystal structure of a complex between CGL2 and the Galβ1,4Fucα1,6GlcNAc trisaccharide revealed the biophysical basis for this interaction.

The study suggests that fungal galectins, such as CGL2, play a role in the defense of fungi against predators by binding to specific glycoconjugates of these organisms. This is supported by the fact that another mushroom galectin, Agrocybe aegerita AAL, has been shown to be toxic to HeLa cells and mice. The identification of a novel glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of the Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 modification may shed light on the physiological significance of this N-glycan modification in C. elegans.
Researchers have investigated how the presence of a latent reservoir of HIV-infected cells affects the evolution of the virus within an individual and at the population level. They developed a mathematical model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4+ T cells and found that it can significantly delay the within-host evolutionary process. This delay can lead to the evolution of intermediate levels of virulence that optimize transmission at the population level. The study suggests that the latent reservoir plays a crucial role in determining the within-host evolutionary rate and the outcome of population-level evolution of virulence. The researchers also found that the transmission of ancestral strains could explain the lower rates of HIV evolution observed at the epidemiological scale compared to within individuals, and the unexpectedly high heritability of HIV set-point viral load despite considerable within-host evolution between transmission events. The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of HIV evolution and transmission, and highlight the need to consider the role of the latent reservoir in the development of effective treatment strategies.
Researchers have investigated how the virus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) evades the host's immune response. They used transgenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as sensors to evaluate antigen presentation by CVB3 in vitro and in vivo. The study found that CVB3 almost completely inhibits the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway, which is responsible for presenting antigens to CD8+ T cells, thereby evading CD8+ T cell immunity. In contrast, the presentation of CVB3-encoded MHC class II epitopes is relatively unencumbered, and CVB3 induces in vivo CD4+ T cell responses that are phenotypically normal. These CD4+ T cells display an effector phenotype, mature into multi-functional CVB3-specific memory T cells, and expand dramatically following challenge infection. The study used recombinant CVB3 encoding well-characterized CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cell epitopes from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to evaluate antigen presentation by CVB3. The results suggest that CVB3's ability to inhibit the MHC class I pathway is a key factor in its ability to evade CD8+ T cell immunity. The study's findings have implications for understanding the efficiency of antigen cross-presentation during coxsackievirus infection.
A randomized controlled double-blind trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) in combination with oral prednisolone compared to oral prednisolone alone in treating leprosy Type 1 reactions (T1Rs) and nerve function impairment (NFI). Forty-two individuals with T1Rs and/or NFI were randomly assigned to receive either three days of high-dose intravenous MP followed by oral prednisolone or oral prednisolone alone. The results showed no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement between the two groups. However, individuals treated with MP were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study compared to those treated with prednisolone alone.

The study also found that 50% of participants required additional prednisolone despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids, suggesting that prolonged courses of corticosteroids may be necessary to treat T1Rs and NFI. The trial did not demonstrate a significant therapeutic effect of MP on the symptoms and signs of leprosy T1Rs and NFI compared to prednisolone alone. The study's findings support the use of prolonged corticosteroid treatment for T1Rs and NFI and highlight the need to investigate risk factors for recurrence during and after corticosteroid treatment.
Researchers investigated the effects of regulatory T cells (Treg) on CD8+ T cell responses in chronic HIV infection. They found that Treg from HIV-infected patients (Treg/HIV+) did not significantly inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell function, suggesting a defect in the suppressive capacity of Treg/HIV+ or a lack of sensitivity of effector T cells in HIV infection. However, Treg/HIV+ did inhibit the expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by autologous CD8+ T cells stimulated with recall antigens, but not HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ T cells. In contrast, Treg from HIV-negative controls (Treg/HIV-) inhibited the differentiation of both recall antigen-specific and HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ T cells. The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was higher on HIV-Gag-specific CD8+ T cells compared to recall antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and did not change significantly after Treg depletion or co-culture with Treg/HIV-. The results suggest that Treg/HIV+ have a defect in modulating both the differentiation and expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules on HIV-specific CD8 T cells, which may contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cell responses. The study also found that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were less sensitive to the suppressive effects of Treg compared to other recall antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.
Researchers evaluated the potential of Wuchereria bancrofti glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as a vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. They cloned the GST gene from the third-stage larval cDNA library of W. bancrofti and expressed and purified the recombinant GST (rWbGST) protein. Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area were analyzed for their reactivity with rWbGST, revealing significant levels of anti-WbGST IgG antibodies in individuals without microfilariae or clinical symptoms. The antibodies were predominantly of the IgG1 and IgG3 isotypes. Functional analysis showed that the rWbGST protein retained its enzymatic activity, and the antibodies in the serum could inhibit this activity. Similar results were obtained with antibodies raised in mice. The researchers then evaluated the vaccine potential of rWbGST using a Brugia malayi challenge in a jird model, achieving approximately 61% protection. The study suggests that rWbGST is a potential vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. The WbGST protein's enzymatic activity appears to be critical for the survival of the parasite in the host, and neutralization of this activity may be a key mechanism of vaccine-induced protection. These findings are consistent with previous studies on other helminth parasites, including schistosomes and fasciola, which have shown that GSTs can be effective vaccine candidates.
CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have revolutionized genome editing in experimental organisms and hold great promise for therapeutic applications. However, concerns remain about the potential for off-target effects, which could lead to unintended changes in the genome. To address these concerns, researchers have used whole-genome sequencing to search for de novo mutations (DNMs) in gene-edited embryos or animals. However, previous studies have used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls, making it difficult to distinguish between generational or colony-related differences and true DNMs.

In this study, researchers used a trio design and whole-genome sequenced 8 parents and 19 embryos, where 10 of the embryos were mutagenized with well-characterized guide RNAs targeting the coat color Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. The detailed analysis of the whole-genome data revealed that if CRISPR mutagenesis were causing single nucleotide variant (SNV) or insertion/deletion (indel) off-target mutations in treated embryos, the number of these mutations is not statistically distinguishable from the background rate of DNMs occurring due to other processes. This suggests that CRISPR mutagenesis performed under the conditions used in this study is unlikely to cause significant off-target effects.

The findings of this study support the development of CRISPR-Cas9 as a therapeutic tool. The researchers also compared their data to MiSeq data from 324 mice mutagenized using the Tyr2R gRNA, revealing good concordance of targeting efficiency and mosaicism. This suggests that the results of this study are representative of the many thousands of CRISPR experiments performed worldwide, including those of the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium.
Researchers have identified two new players, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7), in the control of stomatal aperture in Arabidopsis plants. Stomatal pores on the plant leaf epidermis regulate CO2 uptake and water loss, affecting photosynthesis, water use efficiency, and crop yields. Blue light, perceived by cryptochromes and phototropins, triggers stomatal opening, but the underlying signal transduction cascades are not fully understood. Mutations in HRB1 or PP7 lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. Both proteins are expressed in guard cells in response to light-to-dark or dark-to-light transitions. HRB1 interacts with PP7 through its N-terminal ZZ-type zinc finger motif and requires PP7 for its stomatal opening response. PP7 can dephosphorylate HRB1, which is mostly dephosphorylated in a 193 kDa protein complex in the dark, and blue light increases the complex size to 285 kDa. In the pp7 mutant, this size shift is impaired, and HRB1 is predominantly phosphorylated. The researchers propose that PP7 modification of HRB1 under blue light is essential for acquiring a proper conformation or assembling a functional HRB1 protein complex. This study may provide strategies for plants to benefit from both constitutive and ABA-induced protection under water-limiting conditions.
The Mediator subunit MDT-15 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to ingested materials in Caenorhabditis elegans. MDT-15 is a component of the Mediator complex, which is essential for RNA polymerase II-dependent gene expression. Research has shown that MDT-15 interacts with various transcriptional regulatory factors, including NHR-49 and SBP-1, to control the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, detoxification, and energy metabolism. Depletion of MDT-15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene impairs the induction of detoxification genes in response to certain xenobiotics and heavy metals, rendering the worms hypersensitive to toxin exposure. Notably, MDT-15 selectively affects stress responses related to ingestion, whereas other stress responses, such as thermotolerance, remain unaffected. The study suggests that MDT-15 integrates multiple transcriptional regulatory pathways to monitor the availability and quality of ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotic compounds. The findings propose a model in which MDT-15 coordinates systemic adaptation to ingestion-related stress, ensuring maintenance of health and longevity. Overall, the research highlights the importance of MDT-15 in regulating metabolic responses to ingested materials and its potential role in maintaining health and longevity in C. elegans.
Researchers have proposed a new understanding of how the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for spatial navigation, forms mental maps of the environment. Traditionally, it was thought that the hippocampus encodes geometric information such as distances and angles. However, this study suggests that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information. The researchers hypothesized that a map encoded by co-firing would be based on connectivity and adjacency, making it a topological map. To test this hypothesis, they created a simple model of hippocampal activity and simulated rat trajectories in three distinct environments. Using a computational algorithm based on algebraic topology, they found that patterns of neuronal co-firing can convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic length of time. The simulations revealed a "learning region" where the interplay between firing rate, place field size, and number of neurons determines the ability to form a map. The researchers propose that this learning region provides a theoretical framework for understanding conditions that impair spatial learning by altering place cell firing rates or spatial specificity. The study suggests that the hippocampus creates a connectivity map derived from place cell co-firing patterns, which can be used to reconstruct the topology of the environment.
This study aimed to elucidate the molecular determinants and dynamics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) secretion. The current understanding of HCV production involves assembly on lipid droplets, envelopment at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements and mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion were incomplete. The researchers combined RNA interference (RNAi) analysis of host factors for infectious HCV secretion with live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking to gain a detailed understanding of HCV egress. The RNAi studies identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP1 vesicles, and adaptor proteins, and the recycling endosome. The results support a model where HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. Live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking using an infectious HCV with a tetracysteine (TC) tag insertion in the core protein (TC-core) revealed that TC-core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and localizes to the Golgi and recycling endosome. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and VAMP1 vesicles. This study identifies new host cofactors of HCV egress and presents dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells.
A study investigated the role of the imprinted gene Grb10 in tumorigenesis, particularly in the context of the Neurofibromatosis I (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. NF1 heterozygous mice were mutagenized to model radiotherapy-associated second malignant neoplasms, and expression analysis of tumor cell lines identified Grb10 as widely absent. Polymorphism analysis revealed that the expressed allele of Grb10 was commonly lost in diverse Nf1 mutant tumors. Functional studies showed that restoring Grb10 in Nf1 mutant tumors decreased proliferation, colony formation, and downregulated Ras signaling. Conversely, Grb10 silencing in untransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts increased cell proliferation and Ras-GTP levels. Expression of a constitutively activated MEK rescued tumor cells from Grb10-mediated reduction in colony formation. In tumors, Grb10 loss independently promoted Ras pathway hyperactivation, leading to hyperproliferation, an early feature of tumor development. These findings demonstrate a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis and suggest that mutations in imprinted genes should be considered with regard to parental origin. The study also identified Grb10 as a negative regulator of Ras signaling, contributing to Ras dysregulation in Nf1-mediated tumorigenesis. The results have implications for understanding the types of tumors that can arise after Grb10 loss and suggest that Grb10 loss may have tumor-promoting consequences in other oncogenic contexts.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to predict threats from environmental cues through Pavlovian fear conditioning, a process where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an aversive event. They used a statistical framework to model autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses, such as skin conductance and pupil size, to understand the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning. The study compared different computational models, including non-probabilistic and probabilistic models, to determine which best explained ANS responses.

The results showed that a probabilistic learning model, which assumes a Bayesian agent that represents threat predictions probabilistically, best explained the data. This model suggests that humans use probabilistic inference to form and maintain Pavlovian threat predictions, including estimation of uncertainty. The study found that skin conductance and pupil size responses reflect different quantities of the same model, with skin conductance tracking a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, and pupil size tracking expected outcome alone.

The findings provide systematic evidence that Pavlovian threat learning in humans relies on probabilistic inference and includes estimation of uncertainty. This could inform theories of neural implementation of aversive learning. The study's use of a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling allowed for precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses, providing a more detailed understanding of the learning process. The results have implications for understanding how humans learn to predict threats and how this process is implemented in the brain.
Researchers have identified a new suppressor of the Cdc7p/SepH kinase, called PomA, in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. PomA plays a crucial role in regulating asexual reproduction by affecting the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-HogA. The septation initiation network (SIN), which includes the SepH kinase cascade, is essential for fungal cytokinesis and conidiation. The study found that PomA acts as a negative regulator of septation and conidiation, and its overexpression suppresses septation. Under normal conditions, SepH positively regulates the phosphorylation of HogA, while PomA reverses this process. However, in the absence of PbsB, a putative upstream member of HogA, PomA and SepH are unable to affect HogA phosphorylation. The study also showed that osmotic stress-induced phosphorylation of HogA can bypass the requirement of SepH for septation and conidiation. The findings demonstrate that there is crosstalk between the SIN and MAPK pathways, with PomA and SepH indirectly regulating HogA phosphorylation through upstream kinases. The study suggests that SepH and PomA coordinately regulate the phosphorylation of HogA, which plays a key role in septation and conidiation.
A study investigated the association between the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) and the clinical manifestations of Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) in 156 patients from Brazil. The study found that LRV1 was detected in 71.1% of patients with mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) and 36.7% of patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The presence of LRV1 was significantly associated with the occurrence of ML, with a ratio of 2.93 (95% CI 1.57-5.46, p < 0.001). The study also identified five different Leishmania species, with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis being the most common, accounting for 77.6% of the cases. LRV1 was detected in various Leishmania species, including L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. amazonensis, and L. lainsoni. The study suggests that LRV1 is an important factor associated with the severity of ML, but not the only factor contributing to the disease outcome. The findings provide new evidence on the relationship between LRV1 and the different species of Leishmania with the clinical manifestations of TL. The study highlights the complexity of TL pathogenesis, which is influenced by various factors, including the species of the parasites, vectors, genetic characteristics, immune status of the host, and the presence of LRV1.
Type I interferon (IFN-I) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumococcal invasive disease by inhibiting the transmigration of bacteria from the lung to the blood. Research has shown that mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar1−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against the type I interferon receptor exhibit enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection. In contrast, treatment of mice with IFNβ or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C)) significantly reduced the development of bacteremia. The study found that IFNβ upregulates tight junction proteins and downregulates the pneumococcal uptake receptor, platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF receptor), which reduces pneumococcal cell invasion and transmigration across epithelial and endothelial layers. The results suggest that IFN-I regulates two mechanisms involved in pneumococcal invasion: PAF receptor-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent pericellular migration. These findings indicate that IFN-I is an important component of the host immune defense against pneumococcal infection, limiting the progression from a site-restricted lung infection to invasive, lethal disease. Overall, the study highlights the protective role of IFN-I in preventing the spread of pneumococci from the lung to the bloodstream.
Researchers have developed a neural network model that utilizes multiple layers of plastic connections to learn a complex foraging task. The model incorporates both rewarded and non-rewarded spike time-dependent plasticity (STDP), which allows the network to adapt and learn from its environment. The network consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The hidden layer employs non-rewarded STDP, enabling neurons to respond to specific combinations of inputs and perform basic pattern classification. The output layer, on the other hand, uses rewarded STDP, allowing the network to learn and discriminate between rewarding and punishing patterns without labeled training data.

The addition of a hidden layer with non-rewarded STDP significantly improved the network's ability to solve the foraging task, which involves pattern classification and decision-making. Synaptic noise, or random fluctuations in synaptic strength, also played a crucial role in the network's ability to learn and adapt through trial-and-error. The researchers found that the combination of rewarded and non-rewarded STDP, along with homeostatic regulation mechanisms, enabled the network to solve the complex foraging task more effectively than a single-layer network with only rewarded STDP. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-layered neural networks with STDP to solve complex tasks, and highlights the importance of combining different plasticity mechanisms to achieve high learning performance.
A study investigated the role of the ETS transcription factor ELF5 in driving lung metastasis in luminal breast cancer. In the mouse mammary tumor virus-Polyoma Middle T (MMTV-PyMT) model of luminal breast cancer, induction of ELF5 levels increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood vessel permeability in primary tumors, leading to a significant increase in the size and number of lung metastases. The study found that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a group of immature neutrophils, were recruited to the tumor in response to ELF5 and played a crucial role in vasculogenesis and metastasis. Depletion of MDSCs using specific antibodies prevented ELF5 from driving vasculogenesis and metastasis.

The study also found that increased ELF5 expression in luminal A breast cancers was correlated with increased myeloid cell invasion and inflammation, and predicted shorter metastasis-free and overall survival in patients. In the MMTV-PyMT mouse model, increased ELF5 levels drove metastasis by co-opting the innate immune system. The study suggests that ELF5 is a defining factor in the acquisition of the lethal phenotype in luminal A breast cancer, particularly in the development of antiestrogen resistance. The findings indicate that ELF5 expression produces a similar response in human luminal A breast cancer to that observed in the ELF5-driven mouse PyMT model, and that this effect is coupled with the immune system.
Recent experimental evidence suggests that the interaction between chromatin loops plays a crucial role in determining cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. Chromatin loops can be characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication form. To understand how these factors affect variability in gene expression, a mechanical model was developed to map three fundamental patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of stochastic transcription. The study found that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise, while alternating loops have the opposite effect compared to side-by-side loops. Additionally, the study compared the effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression, finding that facilitated tracking performs better in controlling mean expression and tuning expression noise, but this control is distance-dependent and limited to moderate loop lengths. The study's analysis and results support the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis.
Researchers have developed a new approach to design and engineer riboregulators, which are RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression without the need for a coexpressed protein. These riboregulators, also known as translation inhibiting RNAs (tiRNAs), can repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. To develop a predictive framework for designing effective tiRNAs, the researchers analyzed the influence of various features previously attributed to post-transcriptional gene modulation. They used a design of experiments (DOE) approach to explore the feature space of de novo developed tiRNAs and identified 12 structural and thermodynamic features that are important for efficient gene repression.

A library of 18 tiRNAs was constructed and co-expressed with two target untranslated regions to link the tiRNA features to functionality. The results showed that the tiRNAs were able to repress gene expression down to 6% of the original protein expression levels. A partial least squares regression model was constructed to link the properties of tiRNAs to gene repression, and both structural and thermodynamic features were found to be important for efficient gene repression. This approach enables a more reliable de novo forward engineering of effective tiRNAs, which can be used to expand the RNA toolbox for gene expression modulation. The development of tiRNAs offers a promising alternative to traditional gene expression modulation systems that rely on coexpressed proteins, which can cause increased metabolic burden and genetic instability.
Researchers have identified a new phenomenon in the brain called coherence potentials, which are large-amplitude local field potentials (LFPs) that occur when the activity of a group of neurons exceeds a certain threshold. These LFPs can spread to other areas of the cortex without distortion, allowing for the loss-less transfer of temporal and amplitude information. This process is similar to the spread of action potentials at the single-cell level, but with an additional degree of freedom in the diversity of their waveforms, enabling the encoding of more information.

Studies have shown that coherence potentials can be used to identify functionally associated neuronal groups at different cortical sites during discrete responses to stimuli. The propagation of coherence potentials across cortical regions raises questions about how they occur and interact with each other. Researchers have found that the temporal properties of the LFP waveform often serve as better predictors of behaviors than spikes, suggesting that coherence potential propagation represents the transfer of meaningful information in the cortical network.

The study used LFP recordings from awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex to investigate coherence potentials. The results show that the aggregate activity of several hundred neurons in the local field of the electrode is reflected in the LFP, and that only a small number of units close to the electrode can be resolved, representing a small sampling of the neurons contributing to the aggregate activity. The study suggests that coherence potential propagation preserves the temporal characteristics of the underlying neuronal activity, allowing for the transfer of meaningful information in the cortical network.
Researchers conducted a systematic genetic screen in fission yeast to identify essential factors involved in controlling nuclear size. They found 25 essential factors that affect nuclear size, and their analysis suggests that RNA processing and LINC complexes play a crucial role in this process. The study revealed a wide range of nuclear size phenotypes, from lower to more extreme higher nuclear size, and highlighted the importance of global cellular processes and specific structural nuclear components in controlling nuclear size.

The researchers used fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which is genetically tractable and undergoes a closed mitosis, making it an ideal system to study nuclear size control. They found that the nuclear volume to cell volume ratio remains constant across a 35-fold range of cell volumes, and that nuclear volume increases steadily with cell volume during the cell cycle, maintaining a constant ratio throughout interphase. This suggests that the regulation of global cellular processes, such as nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis, is important for nuclear size control.

In multicellular organisms, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio is generally restricted to a narrow range for cells of each type, and there is evidence that nuclear volume is determined by cell volume or a related factor, rather than directly by DNA content. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of nuclear size control and highlight the importance of RNA processing and LINC complexes in this process.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on patients with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor (ET). The model uses a reduced form of the Kuramoto model, which represents neurons as coupled oscillators, to analyze how brain oscillations change in response to stimulation. The study found that the optimal stimulation strategy depends on the phase and amplitude of the brain oscillations. Specifically, the model predicts that stimulation should be phase-specific and more effective when applied during periods of lower amplitude oscillations. These predictions were compared to data from ET patients and found to be consistent. The researchers also proposed a new hybrid strategy that combines two existing closed-loop DBS approaches: phase-locked and adaptive DBS. This new strategy aims to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and reduction of side effects of DBS. The study's findings support the use of coupled oscillator models to understand the effects of DBS and inform the development of more effective treatment strategies. The predictions made by the model have been shown to generalize to other models and have been observed in a biologically realistic model of a neural circuit generating oscillations related to Parkinson's disease.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool, called Biompha-LAMP, to detect Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite that causes intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis, in Biomphalaria glabrata snails. Schistosomiasis affects over 230 million people worldwide and is a significant public health concern. The Biompha-LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, and specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification test that can detect as little as 0.1 femtograms of S. mansoni DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes. The assay uses a simple DNA extraction method and can be used to detect infected snails in both individual and pooled samples.

The Biompha-LAMP assay was evaluated in experimentally infected snails at different stages of infection, including the early prepatent period, light infections, and detection of infected snails in pooled samples. The results showed that the assay was able to detect S. mansoni DNA in all groups of snails without the need for complicated DNA extraction procedures.

The Biompha-LAMP assay has the potential to be a cost-effective method for screening intermediate hosts infected with S. mansoni in both individual snails and pooled samples. It could be suitable for large-scale field surveys for schistosomes control campaigns in endemic areas. Further validation of the assay using DNA samples from other Biomphalaria species and Schistosoma species is recommended to confirm its effectiveness.
A study was conducted to estimate the costs of dengue control activities and hospitalizations in the public health sector during an epidemic year in Colombo, the most heavily urbanized district in Sri Lanka. The study aimed to assess the economic burden of dengue response in the public health sector from the Ministry of Health's perspective. The total cost of dengue control activities and hospitalizations in Colombo district in 2012 was estimated at US$3.45 million, with a per capita cost of US$1.50. Personnel costs accounted for the largest share of the total costs, at 79% for dengue control activities and 46% for hospitalizations. The average costs per hospitalization ranged from US$216 to US$609 for pediatric cases and US$196 to US$866 for adult cases, depending on disease severity and treatment setting. The study found that dengue poses a significant economic burden on the public health sector in Sri Lanka, with a per capita cost of US$0.42 for dengue control activities, equivalent to a monthly cost of US$0.03 per capita. The study highlights the substantial resources used for dengue prevention and hospital care services, which could be reallocated to other health services. The findings suggest that dengue is a major economic burden on the public health sector in Sri Lanka, emphasizing the need for country-specific evidence to inform public health priorities and resource allocation.
A recent study has reevaluated the origins of European paternal lineages, specifically the haplogroup R1b1b2 (R-M269), which is the most common Y-chromosomal lineage among European men. Previous research suggested a Paleolithic origin for this lineage, but the new study found that its geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity is best explained by its spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic period. This indicates that the majority of European Y chromosomes originated in the Neolithic expansion. The study also found that other haplogroups, such as E1b1b1 (E-M35) and J, show evidence of European Neolithic expansion, further supporting this conclusion. The findings suggest that technological and cultural change is linked to the expansion of Y-chromosomal lineages, and that Europe is a prime example of this pattern. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA diversity presents a different picture, with no east-west cline and most lineages having a Paleolithic time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). The study's results imply that males played a unique role in the transition to the Neolithic period in Europe. The frequency of haplogroup R1b1b2 increases from 12% in Eastern Turkey to 85% in Ireland, and it is carried by approximately 110 million European men. Overall, the study provides new insights into the origins of European paternal lineages and their relationship to technological and cultural change.
A recent study investigated the relationship between movement variability and the speed of motor learning. Contrary to previous suggestions, the research found that movement variability does not consistently increase the speed of motor learning. In fact, the study's computational modeling and experimental data suggest that increased variability can sometimes slow down learning. A meta-analysis of published papers also revealed no statistical relationship between movement variability and learning rate across a wide range of experiments. The study's findings do not rule out the possibility of a positive correlation between motor variability and learning rate, but rather suggest that this relationship may be task-specific and dependent on the factors affecting task performance. The research highlights the complexity of motor learning and the need for further investigation into the relative importance of various factors involved. The study's results also suggest that motor variability can have both positive and negative effects on learning, and that the relationship between variability and learning rate can vary widely depending on the specific task and computational factors at play. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between movement variability and motor learning, and underscores the need for further research in this area.
Researchers have investigated the interaction between RelA, a key component of the NF-κB transcription factor, and its co-activators CBP and p300. This interaction is crucial for the transcription of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, cell survival, and proliferation. The RelA:CBP/p300 complex consists of two components: the DNA-binding domain of RelA interacting with the KIX domain of CBP/p300, and the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of RelA binding to the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300. A phosphorylation event at a specific site on RelA is necessary for the first interaction to occur. The researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure of the RelA:CBP complex, revealing the folding of RelA's TAD upon binding to TAZ1. Mutational and isothermal calorimetric analyses allowed the design of RelA mutants that selectively disrupted the two distinct components of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. Studies using cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis showed that a larger set of RelA-activated genes is affected by this interaction than previously believed. The researchers also found that the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction controls the nuclear response of NF-κB through a negative feedback loop, and that CBP/p300 is constitutively recruited to the promoters of RelA target genes.
Researchers have developed a new method called Time-Course Gene Set Analysis (TcGSA) to analyze gene expression data collected over time. This method is an extension of traditional gene set analysis, which considers predefined groups of genes, to longitudinal data. TcGSA uses random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates to account for repeated measurements and missing data. The method is designed to identify gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity within gene sets.

TcGSA was applied to two real-life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial (DALIA-1 trial) and a study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the DALIA-1 trial, TcGSA revealed significant changes in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets, whereas standard univariate analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for time series failed to detect any significant patterns. In the second dataset, TcGSA identified 4 gene sets linked to the influenza vaccine, which were previously associated with the pneumococcal vaccine.

A simulation study demonstrated the good statistical properties and increased power of TcGSA compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. The method is available as an R package for the research community. The authors conclude that TcGSA provides a solution for the full exploitation of repeated measurements of gene expression data based on gene set analysis, with high sensitivity to detect subtle changes while controlling false discovery.
Researchers have created the first comprehensive map of the global endemicity of Plasmodium vivax, a malaria parasite that has been understudied compared to Plasmodium falciparum. The map was generated using a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach, incorporating 9,970 geopositioned parasite rate surveys from 1985 to 2010. The model took into account the frequency of the Duffy negative phenotype, which is known to be refractory to P. vivax infection, particularly in Africa.

The map reveals that the Americas contribute 22% of the global area at risk of P. vivax transmission, but high endemic areas are generally sparsely populated and account for only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk globally. In Africa, stable transmission is constrained to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, contributing 3.5% of global populations at risk. Central Asia is home to 82% of global populations at risk, with high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations in India and Myanmar. South East Asia contains areas of high endemicity in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, contributing 9% of global populations at risk.

The map provides a detailed depiction of spatially varying endemicity and is intended to contribute to a paradigm shift towards geographically stratified and evidence-based planning for P. vivax control and elimination. The model-based geostatistical approach used to generate the map is robust and flexible, allowing for the creation of continuous surfaces of malaria endemicity based on retrospectively assembled parasite rate survey data.
Clumping factor B (ClfB) is a cell wall-anchored protein expressed by Staphylococcus aureus that plays a significant role in the bacterium's ability to cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Previous studies have shown that ClfB facilitates S. aureus nasal colonization by binding to host ligands such as loricrin and cytokeratin 10 in the anterior nares. However, the role of ClfB in SSTIs had not been investigated until now. This study reveals that ClfB is crucial in determining the structure and bacterial burden of skin abscesses early in infection, and this is dependent on its interaction with loricrin, a protein expressed within the abscess tissue. Targeting ClfB with a model vaccine that induces both humoral and cellular responses leads to protection against S. aureus skin infection. The study identifies ClfB as an important antigen for future SSTI vaccines. ClfB's role in SSTIs is distinct from its role in nasal colonization, and its interaction with loricrin appears to be specific to the skin. The study provides proof-of-concept that ClfB is a promising candidate antigen for inclusion in next-generation vaccines targeting S. aureus SSTIs. Overall, this research highlights the importance of ClfB in the pathogenesis of S. aureus SSTIs and its potential as a vaccine target.
Researchers have developed a hybrid stochastic framework to predict the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV, using dolutegravir (DTG) as an example. The framework integrates pharmacological, viral, and host factors to simulate the effectiveness of different PrEP and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens. By combining population pharmacokinetics of DTG with a stochastic simulation approach, the researchers predicted that plasma concentrations of 145.18 nM and 722.23 nM would prevent 50% and 90% of sexual transmissions, respectively. They also predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP "on demand," and PEP before/after virus exposure. The results showed that once-daily PrEP with 50mg oral DTG prevented 99-100% of infections, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. PrEP "on demand" prevented 79-84% of infections, and PEP prevented more than 80% of infections when initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. The simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada, and the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide the release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations. This framework can be adapted to other PrEP candidates, providing a tool for prioritizing and designing effective PrEP regimens.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been shown to induce autophagy, a cellular process that enhances its replication. However, the mechanisms by which HCV regulates autophagy are not fully understood. Researchers have found that HCV infection induces the expression of two proteins, Rubicon and UVRAG, which play opposing roles in the maturation of autophagosomes. Rubicon inhibits the maturation of autophagosomes, leading to their accumulation in the early stages of infection, while UVRAG stimulates their maturation. The induction of Rubicon is rapid, whereas the induction of UVRAG is delayed, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes in the early stages of infection. The researchers used siRNA knockdown and over-expression experiments to confirm the role of Rubicon in inhibiting the maturation of autophagosomes and enhancing HCV replication. In contrast, the over-expression of UVRAG facilitated the maturation of autophagosomes and suppressed HCV replication. The study also found that the HCV NS4B protein is sufficient to induce Rubicon and autophagosomes. The results suggest that HCV differentially regulates the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG to temporally regulate the autophagic flux and enhance its replication. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which HCV exploits autophagy to facilitate its replication.
Cyclin Y-like 1 (CCNYL1), a newly identified member of the cyclin family, plays a crucial role in regulating spermatogenesis in mice. Unlike its homologue, Cyclin Y (CCNY), CCNYL1 is specifically expressed at high levels in the testis and is essential for male fertility. Mice lacking CCNYL1 (Ccnyl1-/-) are infertile, while mice lacking CCNY (Ccny-/-) display normal fertility. Spermatozoa from Ccnyl1-/- mice exhibit impaired motility and structural defects, suggesting that CCNYL1 is indispensable for male fertility.

The interaction between CCNYL1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16) is critical for spermatogenesis. CCNYL1 and CDK16 form a protein complex that increases the stability and kinase activity of CDK16. Phosphorylation of CDK16 by CCNYL1 is essential for their interaction and modulation of CDK16 kinase activity. The CCNYL1:CDK16 complex is localized to the plasma membrane of spermatogenic cells, where it maintains enzymatic activity.

Mice lacking CDK16 (Cdk16-/-) display a similar phenotype to Ccnyl1-/- mice, suggesting that CCNYL1 and CDK16 cooperate to regulate spermatogenesis. The CCNYL1:CDK16 complex is a potential target for the development of male contraceptives or drugs that specifically inhibit CCNYL1 expression or CCNYL1/CDK16 activity. Overall, this study reveals a previously unrecognized role of CCNYL1 in regulating spermatogenesis and highlights the importance of the CCNYL1:CDK16 complex in male fertility.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) strains cause diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome due to toxin-mediated microvascular endothelial injury. EHEC hemolysin (EHEC-Hly) is a virulence factor that exists in two forms: free and associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). While the free toxin is lytic towards human endothelium, the biological effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, the primary targets during EHEC infection, are unknown. This study investigated the effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and Caco-2 cells. The results show that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly does not lyse these cells but triggers their apoptosis. The toxin is internalized by the cells via dynamin-dependent endocytosis of OMVs and trafficked to endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon endosome acidification, EHEC-Hly separates from OMVs, escapes from lysosomes, and targets mitochondria, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, resulting in apoptotic cell death. This study reveals a novel mechanism of EHEC-Hly involvement in the pathogenesis of EHEC diseases, where OMV-mediated intracellular delivery allows the toxin to target mitochondria and induce apoptosis in human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells.
Research in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has revealed a complex interplay between histone modifications and the regulation of transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The study found that histone H2B ubiquitylation (H2Bub1) and the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), also known as Cdk9, interact in a bidirectional manner to regulate elongation. Lowering Cdk9 activity or preventing its phosphorylation of the transcription processivity factor Spt5 reduces H2Bub1 levels, while mutations in the H2Bub1 pathway impair Cdk9 recruitment to chromatin and decrease Spt5 phosphorylation. Furthermore, an Spt5 phosphorylation-site mutation combined with deletion of the histone H3 Lys4 methyltransferase Set1 phenocopies morphologic and growth defects due to H2Bub1 loss, suggesting independent, partially redundant roles for Cdk9 and Set1 downstream of H2Bub1. Genome-wide analyses by chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrate opposing effects of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 on the distribution of transcribing RNAPII. The study reveals a positive feedback loop between H2Bub1 and Spt5 phosphorylation, as well as antagonistic functions of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 that must be kept in balance to regulate elongation. Loss of H2Bub1 disrupts this balance, leading to deranged gene expression and aberrant cell morphologies. These findings suggest that other pathways can modulate the functions of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 in transcript elongation, and that P-TEFb activity is required to overcome repressive effects of histone modifications.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South America and Africa. A phylogenetic analysis of 133 viral isolates from 22 countries over 76 years revealed that the currently circulating strains of YFV originated in Africa within the last 1,500 years. The virus emerged in the Americas approximately 300-400 years ago, following the slave trade, and spread westwards across the continent, persisting in the jungles of South America. The study used gene sequence data to test hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, documenting the role of human migration in the spread of infectious disease.

The analysis showed that YFV can be divided into two geographic groups, with distinct viral lineages observed in Africa and the Americas. The virus has established a sylvatic enzootic cycle in the Amazon, Araguaia, and Orinoco river basins, vectored by Haemagogus and Sabethes mosquitoes. The study found no major difference in evolutionary dynamics among viruses circulating in South America or Africa, and neither population exhibited the increases in virus diversity expected of epidemic expansion.

Previous studies suggest that YFV originated in Africa, with the deepest phylogenetic split among viral genotypes between those isolates sampled from East and West Africa. The findings of this study provide a molecular perspective on the introduction of YFV into the Americas, highlighting the importance of human migration in the spread of infectious disease.
Researchers investigated the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, in an infant mouse model of colonization, disease, and transmission, both with and without influenza A (IAV) co-infection. The study aimed to identify vulnerable points in the multiple steps involved in pneumococcal pathogenesis by analyzing population bottlenecks. The findings revealed that in the presence of IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single-cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. These bottlenecks were not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, highlighting the importance of the number of shed organisms in secretions in overcoming it. The study demonstrates how viral infection and the innate immune responses it stimulates drive bacterial contagion.

The researchers used an infant mouse model to study the effects of IAV co-infection on pneumococcal colonization, disease, and transmission. They found that IAV increased the burden of colonizing pneumococci, consistent with previous observations in infant mice. The study suggests that the tight population bottleneck in the setting of IAV co-infection may be due to the selection of a subpopulation of pneumococci or the requirement for de novo genetic adaptation. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of pneumococcal pathogenesis and the role of viral co-infections in driving bacterial contagion.
Researchers investigated the immune response of humans to bites from Phlebotomus orientalis, a sand fly species that transmits Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Africa. The study aimed to develop a method to detect exposure to P. orientalis bites in human populations from disease-endemic areas. To achieve this, the researchers produced recombinant proteins from P. orientalis salivary proteins using bacterial and mammalian expression systems. These recombinant proteins were then tested as antigens to detect anti-P. orientalis IgG antibodies in human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia.

The study identified two recombinant proteins, mYEL1 and mAG5, as the most promising antigens for detecting exposure to P. orientalis bites. The combination of these two proteins showed a high correlation coefficient and good specificity compared to the whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. The researchers found that 52% of sera samples from Sudan and 34.5% from Ethiopia tested positive for anti-P. orientalis antibodies, indicating a high level of exposure to sand fly bites. The study suggests that the combination of mYEL1 and mAG5 recombinant proteins can be used as a valid tool to screen for exposure to P. orientalis bites in human populations from disease-endemic areas. This method has the potential to simplify studies aimed at detecting antibodies in bitten individuals in areas where visceral leishmaniasis is prevalent.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) is a mobile genetic element associated with multidrug resistance in pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. SGI1 is mobilized by IncA and IncC plasmids (A/C plasmids) through a process triggered by the transcriptional activator complex AcaCD. Although SGI1 is not self-transmissible, it carries genes traNS, traHS, and traGS, which are homologs of the mating pore subunits TraNC, TraHC, and TraGC encoded by A/C plasmids. Researchers investigated the regulation of traNS and traHGS and their role in SGI1 transmissibility. They found that expression of these genes is inducible by AcaCD and that TraNS, TraHS, and TraGS are functional proteins that can replace TraNC, TraHC, and TraGC in the mating pore encoded by IncC plasmids. Complementation assays showed that TraGS and TraHS are required for optimal SGI1 transfer, and that SGI1 remodels the IncC-encoded mating pore to enhance its transfer rate over the helper plasmid. This remodeling also disables an IncC-encoded entry exclusion mechanism, allowing SGI1 to invade cell populations bearing IncC plasmids. The study suggests that SGI1 primes the bacterial cell to accumulate TraGS and TraHS subunits, and that the traS genes facilitate the invasion of SGI1 into cell populations bearing IncC plasmids.
Researchers investigated the role of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 in the DNA damage checkpoint, a process that allows cells to adapt to persistent or irreparable DNA damage. The study found that Cdc5 promotes adaptation to DNA damage by inhibiting the hyperphosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53. Hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 is a key step in the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, which leads to cell cycle arrest. However, when Cdc5 is overproduced, Rad53 hyperphosphorylation is significantly reduced, allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage and re-enter the cell division cycle. The study suggests that Cdc5 acts by attenuating the DNA damage checkpoint through the loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation. This mechanism is likely conserved in other organisms, including vertebrates, as polo-like kinase homologs have been shown to inhibit the ability of Claspin to facilitate the activation of downstream checkpoint kinases. The study's findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of adaptation to DNA damage and suggest that Cdc5 plays a critical role in this process.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework, known as the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, to study the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. This framework is designed to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales, which is crucial for understanding pathological conditions such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression. The KNP framework assumes electroneutrality, allowing it to circumvent charge-relaxation processes and run simulations on millimeter and second scales on a standard desktop computer.

The framework was used to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework and its ability to elucidate the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS. In contrast to previous 1-D models, the 3-D KNP framework predicts how ion concentrations vary in all spatial directions surrounding the neuronal sources, making it applicable to a broader range of biological problems.

The KNP framework is the first simulation framework that can handle 3-D electrodiffusion in neuronal tissue at relatively large spatiotemporal scales without requiring excessive computer power. The framework was developed for use in a hybrid simulation setup, where the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the ECS were computed with KNP, while the neurodynamics was computed with the NEURON simulator tool. This framework has the potential to be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.
A proposed budget cut to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vector-borne diseases program could leave the country unprepared to handle emerging and existing mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus. A mathematical model was used to simulate the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. The results showed that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude compared to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The study found that the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the costs needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without considering the cost in human lives and well-being. The analysis suggests that the proposed budget cut could virtually paralyze surveillance and research activities for diseases already circulating in the US, such as dengue and West Nile virus, and jeopardize the capability of the existing health infrastructure for early detection of other exotic mosquito-transmitted pathogens. The study emphasizes the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance and recommends retaining investments in this cost-effective preventive public health strategy. The findings provide a science-based justification for re-assessing the proposed budget cut and highlight the importance of adequate funding for vector-borne disease research and surveillance for early detection and rapid interruption of transmission.
Researchers conducted a study in western Nicaragua to investigate the prevalence of dengue fever among children and adults presenting with acute febrile illness. A total of 740 patients aged 1 year and above were enrolled in the study, and paired sera were collected from each participant. The sera were tested for dengue IgG and IgM, and serotyped using reverse transcriptase-PCR. The results showed that 63.5% of the patients were seropositive for dengue at enrollment, with the seroprevalence increasing with age, reaching over 90% in individuals above 20 years. Acute dengue was identified in 5.1% of the patients, with serotypes 1 and 2 being the most common. Notably, only 8.1% of the confirmed cases were suspected clinically, indicating that dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in the region. The study also found that the population is at risk of being devastated by the Zika epidemic, which is transmitted by the same vector and has been associated with severe congenital infections. The study's findings highlight the need for increased awareness and surveillance of dengue fever in the region.
Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase NILR1 plays a crucial role in the induction of innate immunity to parasitic nematodes. Nematodes are destructive pests that cause significant economic losses in agriculture. Effective plant defense against pathogens relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized receptors, leading to the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). However, the role of PTI in roots and plant-nematode interactions is not well understood. This study shows that nematode-derived proteinaceous elicitors can induce PTI in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the common immune co-receptor BAK1. A leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, NILR1, is specifically regulated upon nematode infection and is essential for PTI responses initiated by nematodes. Loss-of-function mutants of NILR1 are hypersusceptible to a broad category of nematodes. NILR1 is the first example of an immune receptor involved in the induction of basal immunity (PTI) in plants or animals in response to nematodes. The identification of NILR1 provides new options for nematode control in crop plants. The study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-nematode interactions and the role of PTI in plant defense against nematodes.
Researchers investigated the effects of the anti-cancer drug miltefosine on Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis. They treated adult worms with miltefosine in a laboratory setting and found that it enhanced the exposure of worm surface antigens, making them more recognizable to the immune system. Using an indirect immunofluorescence assay, the researchers detected strong immunofluorescence of the S. mansoni adult worm surface after treatment with miltefosine. They also identified four specific proteins on the worm surface that reacted with the antibodies: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. These proteins were found to be exposed on the surface of 3-hour schistosomula, the larval stage of the parasite, and induced immune agglutination, suggesting they may play a role in immune protection. The study reveals a novel mode of action of miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent, where treatment unmasks parasite surface antigens not normally exposed to the host during infection. The findings suggest that antigens involved in this molecular mechanism could have potential as intervention targets and antibodies against these antigens may increase the drug's anti-parasite efficacy and be involved in the development of resistance to re-infection.
Bacillus cereus, a human opportunistic pathogen, has evolved multiple systems to acquire iron from various sources, including heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin. Ferritin, a 24-mer nanocage protein, stores thousands of iron atoms within its cavity, making it an important source of iron for microbes. The surface protein IlsA in B. cereus binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. This study demonstrates that IlsA acts as a ferritin receptor, causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface. Isothermal titration calorimetry data show that IlsA binds several types of ferritins through direct interaction with the shell subunits. UV-vis kinetic data reveal a significant enhancement of iron release from ferritin in the presence of IlsA, indicating that a bacterial protein can alter the stability of the ferritin iron core. Disruption of the siderophore bacillibactin production drastically reduces the ability of B. cereus to utilize ferritin for growth and results in attenuated bacterial virulence in insects. A new model of iron acquisition in B. cereus is proposed, involving the binding of IlsA to host ferritin followed by siderophore-assisted iron uptake. This study highlights a possible interplay between a surface protein and a siderophore and provides new insights into host adaptation of B. cereus and general bacterial pathogenesis.
A thermodynamically consistent model of the post-translational Kai circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has been developed. The clock is driven by a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer with two domains, CI and CII, which can bind and hydrolyze ATP. The model proposes that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active and inactive conformational state. Phosphorylation of the CII domain serves as a timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also explains how KaiA acts as a nucleotide exchange factor, stimulating phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA for different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation. The model predicts that as the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises, the release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state of KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, stabilizing this state and leading to the sequestration of KaiA and KaiC dephosphorylation. A dedicated kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm was used to simulate the system, demonstrating that the model can describe a wealth of experimental data.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppresses the innate immune response to establish persistent infection. Despite the activation of the RIG-I-MAVS axis by HBV's pre-genomic RNA, the mechanism behind the failure to induce interferon-αβ (IFN-β) synthesis remained unclear. Researchers found that HBV induces the recruitment of the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) to mitochondria through parkin, leading to the attenuation of IFN-β synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAVS and accumulates unanchored linear polyubiquitin chains on MAVS via LUBAC, disrupting the MAVS signalosome and inhibiting IRF3 activation. This study highlights the novel role of parkin in antiviral signaling, which involves the recruitment of LUBAC to mitochondria. The findings suggest that parkin silencing restores IFN-β synthesis in HBV-expressing cells upon stimulation with RIG-I agonist pI:C. These results provide a molecular mechanism for HBV-induced suppression of innate immunity and offer avenues for investigation into the role of mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity.
Researchers have identified a novel superantigen, pfiT, associated with Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. PfiT is encoded by the pfiT gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, a type of bacteria found in the gut. The researchers determined the three-dimensional structure of pfiT at a resolution of 1.7 angstroms and found that it belongs to a new family of DNA-binding transcription regulators. They also discovered that pfiT binds to human class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, specifically HLA-DR, and stimulates the proliferation of human lymphocytes. This binding was inhibited by antibodies against HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP, indicating that pfiT specifically interacts with class II MHC molecules. The researchers also found that pfiT competes with another superantigen, Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen (MAM), for binding to HLA-DR, suggesting that their binding sites overlap. Furthermore, pfiT and its homolog, PA2885, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were found to bind to mammalian cells and stimulate the proliferation of human lymphocytes. These findings suggest that pfiT plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and may serve as a serological marker for the disease.
A recent study investigated the role of allelic regulation in the heterogeneity of embryonic stem cell (ESC) populations, specifically focusing on the expression of the pluripotency regulator Nanog. The researchers used a multiscale stochastic population balance equation framework to model the dynamics of Nanog expression in ESCs, taking into account allelic control, gene expression noise, and random partitioning at cell division. The results showed that allelic regulation of Nanog expression leads to three distinct states of Nanog distribution, which becomes bimodal when combined with transcriptional noise. The study found that initially uniform populations of ESCs gave rise to the same Nanog heterogeneity within ten cell cycles, regardless of their allelic expression pattern. The researchers also observed that the depletion of Nanog content in cells switching off both gene alleles was slower than the accumulation of intracellular Nanog after cells turned on at least one of their Nanog gene copies, indicating Nanog state-dependent dynamics. Furthermore, the study highlighted the importance of allelic regulation in maintaining fractions of self-renewing cells with sufficient Nanog content to prevent aberrant loss of pluripotency in stem cell populations with restricted Nanog expression. The findings suggest that allelic control of Nanog expression is a prime determinant of stem cell population heterogeneity and warrant further investigation in the contexts of stem cell specification and cell reprogramming.
Researchers used a combination of absolute and global proteomics data and a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli to study the costs and benefits of protein expression in different environments. They found that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments, and accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains more than 95% of the variance in growth rates of Escherichia coli across 16 distinct environments. The study also showed that reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. Classification of the unused protein revealed that it encodes several nutrient- and stress-preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. This suggests that unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change. The researchers used a genome-scale model of proteome allocation in Escherichia coli, termed a ME-Model, to quantify un- and under-utilized protein. The ME-Model formalizes the function and synthesis of all proteins that carry out metabolism and protein expression necessary for growth, which they refer to as the ME proteome. This approach allowed them to enumerate the unused proteome and quantify the cost of unused protein expression, as well as characterize the processes and regulators underlying the change in unused protein expression across environments.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the genetic factors contributing to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in three major ethnic populations of Asia: Chinese, Malays, and Asian Indians. The study included 3,955 individuals with T2D and 3,114 controls from these populations. The researchers aimed to assess the transferability and relevance of previously identified genetic variants associated with T2D in European populations to these Asian populations.

The study found that variants at the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci showed the strongest association with T2D in a meta-analysis of all three ethnic groups. However, many other previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with T2D in European populations also showed consistent direction of effect in this study. The researchers observed evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity at the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci, as well as variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations.

The study highlights the importance of surveying diverse racial and ethnic groups to fine-map causal variants and identify population-specific variants associated with T2D. The findings suggest that the genetic architecture of T2D may differ between populations, and that GWAS conducted in non-European populations can provide valuable insights into the genetic etiology of the disease. The study's results also emphasize the need for further research to understand the genetic factors contributing to T2D in diverse populations.
Researchers investigated the role of Aurora B kinase Ipl1 in nuclear division during mitosis in the budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. They found that Ipl1 localizes to the nucleus upon breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis and is essential for timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope. Ipl1 also regulates structural integrity of microtubules and is required for viability. Depletion of Ipl1 results in delayed kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration due to compromised stability of cytoplasmic microtubules. An in silico model predicted that Ipl1 influences the dynamics of kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration by regulating the activity of cytosolic Bim1 and dynein. Live cell imaging confirmed that Ipl1 spatio-temporally regulates Bim1 and/or dynein activity along with microtubule stability to ensure timely onset of nuclear division. The researchers propose that the timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope by Ipl1 allows its own nuclear entry, which is necessary for spatio-temporal regulation of nuclear division during semi-open mitosis in C. neoformans. The study suggests that Ipl1 plays a critical role in orchestrating pre-anaphase nuclear movement from the mother cell to the daughter and maintaining microtubule stability to facilitate timely kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration.
A study investigated the role of a synonymous mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in an aggressive case of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The mutation, p.Cys630=, was initially considered clinically irrelevant due to its synonymous nature. However, next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that the mutation was in cis with a somatic RET p.Cys634Arg driver mutation. Expression analysis showed an increase in RET transcript levels in the patient compared to seven other MTCs harboring the p.Cys634Arg mutation.

Minigene expression assays demonstrated that the synonymous mutation was sufficient to explain the increased RET mRNA level. In silico analyses and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the p.Cys630= variant created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs that enhanced SRp55 recruitment to the mutant allele, leading to more efficient maturation of its pre-mRNA and an increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET receptor.

This study documents a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression. The findings suggest that the p.Cys630= mutation enhanced the oncogenic effect of the p.Cys634Arg driver mutation by increasing constitutive splicing efficiency. The study highlights the importance of considering synonymous mutations in cancer genome studies, as they may play a significant role in neoplastic disease.
Researchers have developed a bioinformatics system to remove contaminants and low-complexity genomic sequences from draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. This system was applied to a comprehensive database of sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes, removing human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences, as well as low-complexity genomic sequences that can lead to false positives. The resulting database of "clean" eukaryotic pathogen genomes was found to provide better sensitivity and a significant reduction in false positives when used for metagenomic sample analysis compared to using the original genomes. The system was tested on 245 eukaryotic pathogen draft genomes and was able to identify and remove contamination from human, vertebrate, bacterial, viral, archaeal, and vector sources. The development of this system addresses a significant challenge in the use of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis, which relies on the availability and quality of reference genomes for comparison. Current reference databases are incomplete and often contain contamination, leading to inaccurate diagnoses. The new database is intended for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including those for next-generation sequencing diagnostics, and has the potential to improve the accuracy of pathogen identification in metagenomic samples.
Researchers investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Nagana, in Uganda. They analyzed 269 isolates collected from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the presence of the SRA gene, which confers human infectivity to T. b. rhodesiense. The results showed that the isolates were divided into three distinct genetic clusters, with clusters 1 and 3 containing isolates from central and southern Uganda, and cluster 2 containing mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These clusters were not sorted by subspecies designation, host, or date of collection. The analysis also revealed genetic admixture among the clusters and long-range dispersal, indicating recent and possibly ongoing gene flow between them. The study found that the expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhodesiense. Additionally, the results confirmed the emergence of human-infective strains from non-infective T. b. brucei strains of different genetic backgrounds and highlighted the importance of cattle as a reservoir for T. b. rhodesiense, which shapes the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) plays a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response, particularly in the context of endotoxic shock. Research has shown that mice lacking TXNIP (Txnip−/−) are highly susceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock. This increased susceptibility is attributed to excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in Txnip−/− macrophages. An inhibitor of iNOS rescued Txnip−/− mice from endotoxic shock-induced death, indicating that NO is a major factor in TXNIP-mediated endotoxic shock.

The study also found that Txnip−/− mice had reduced IL-1β secretion due to increased S-nitrosylation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This suggests that TXNIP regulates NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock. The NF-κB/iNOS pathway was found to be involved in the regulation of NO production in the absence of TXNIP. Furthermore, excessive NO production in Txnip−/− mice inhibited NLRP3-dependent IL-1 secretion via direct S-nitrosylation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

These findings indicate that TXNIP is a novel molecule that links NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock. The study suggests that TXNIP plays a critical role as a negative modulator of NO and iNOS expression during LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Overall, the research highlights the importance of TXNIP in regulating the inflammatory response and its potential role in disease states associated with sepsis.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZTF-8, conserved from worms to humans, that plays a crucial role in DNA damage response and double-strand break repair in the C. elegans germline. ZTF-8 is involved in the repair of both mitotic and meiotic double-strand breaks, as well as the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in the germline. Mutants lacking ZTF-8 exhibit sensitivity to radiation and hydroxyurea, nuclear arrest at the S-phase, and accumulation of recombination intermediates, indicating impaired double-strand break repair. Additionally, ZTF-8 partially co-localizes with the 9-1-1 DNA damage response complex and interacts with MRT-2/Rad1, a component of this complex. The human homolog of ZTF-8, RHINO, rescues the phenotypes observed in ztf-8 mutants, suggesting functional conservation across species. The study suggests that ZTF-8 promotes repair at stalled replication forks and meiotic double-strand breaks by transducing DNA damage checkpoint signaling via the 9-1-1 pathway. The findings define a conserved function for ZTF-8/RHINO in promoting genomic stability in the germline. Impaired meiotic double-strand break repair in ztf-8 mutants also fails to trigger the CEP-1/p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint in late pachytene, further supporting a role for ZTF-8 in DNA damage response.
Researchers used single cell transcriptomics to study the differentiation of motor neuron (MN) progenitors in the neural tube. They found that the transcription factor Olig2 plays a crucial role in the transition of neural progenitors into MNs. Olig2 represses the expression of the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5, which are involved in controlling the rate of neurogenesis. The repression of Hes5 appears to be direct, through a conserved regulatory element within the Hes5 locus that restricts its expression in MN progenitors.

The study revealed a tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control patterning and neuronal differentiation. Olig2 acts as a developmental pacemaker, coordinating the spatial and temporal pattern of MN generation. The findings suggest that the Shh and retinoid-dependent induction of Olig2 not only specifies MN identity but also determines the rate at which these progenitors differentiate.

Notch signaling was found to control the transition between the distinct phases of Olig2 expression by restraining Olig2 expression in MN progenitors. Inhibiting Notch signaling up-regulated Olig2 expression, indicating that Notch signaling is involved in controlling the rate of neurogenesis. The study suggests that Olig2 inserts itself into the Notch-regulated neural differentiation program, shutting down Notch activity and ensuring MN development proceeds in a spatially and temporally controlled manner.
Researchers used a nonhuman primate model to investigate the role of T cells in protecting against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1pdm). They first infected rhesus macaques with a seasonal human H1N1 isolate to "prime" their cellular immunity. Four months later, the animals were challenged with H1N1pdm. The results showed that the "primed" animals had a stronger and earlier cellular immune response compared to naive animals. This response involved both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which peaked earlier and reached a higher magnitude in the "primed" animals. Notably, the "primed" animals cleared the H1N1pdm infection significantly earlier from the upper and lower respiratory tract than the naive animals, and before the appearance of H1N1pdm-specific neutralizing antibodies. The study suggests that cross-reactive T cell responses can mediate early clearance of an antigenically novel influenza virus in primates. The findings have implications for the development of vaccines that can induce cross-reactive T cells to protect humans against severe disease caused by newly emerging pandemic influenza viruses.
Researchers have developed a rapid, simple, and sensitive method to detect Q fever, a widespread zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii. The method, called Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), targets the htpAB gene of C. burnetii. A universal LAMP primer set was designed to detect the repeated sequence IS1111a of the htpAB gene using PrimerExplorer V4 software. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was evaluated using known quantities of recombined reference plasmids containing the targeted genes, and the specificity was determined using 26 members of the order Rickettsiae and 18 other common pathogens. The results showed that the LAMP assay was 100% specific and had a detection limit of 1 copy per reaction. The positive rate of unknown febrile patients was 33.3% for the LAMP assay and 8.3% for real-time PCR (P<0.05). Similarly, the total positive rate of animals was 7.9% for the LAMP assay and 0.8% for real-time PCR (P<0.01). The LAMP assay was compared with real-time PCR using 24 blood samples, including 6 confirmed and 18 probable Q fever cases diagnosed by IFA serological assessment and real-time PCR. The results showed that the LAMP assay is a potential tool to support the diagnosis of Q fever in humans and domestic animals in the field, especially in rural areas of China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without the aid of sophisticated equipment or complicated protocols.
Researchers have discovered a novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations, known as ES-specific enhancers (ESSEs), which are particularly enriched in a group of enhancers of the hematopoietic cell lineage. These ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes, which are indicative of their chromatin activity states. The study found that hematopoietic ESSEs are hypermethylated in cancer relative to normal somatic cells and co-localized with silenced genes, whereas unmethylated ESSEs tend to be hypomethylated in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. Constitutive or hematopoietic stem cell-specific enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ESSEs in cancer.

The researchers used DNA methylation data to investigate the fate of ES enhancers during normal hematopoietic development and in cancer. They discovered that enhancers present in ES cells and absent from differentiated hematopoietic cells are especially prone to DNA methylation alterations in cancer. The study found a strong correlation between methylation of the ESSE site and VEGFA expression in examined cancers. Additionally, genes proximal to cancer-hypomethylated ESSEs that were expressed in ES cells but down-regulated in the hematopoietic lineage significantly tended to be expressed in cancer.

The results suggest an association between hypomethylation of ESSEs that are normally methylated in differentiated cells and up-regulation of ES genes in cancer cells. Many of these genes participate in developmental signaling pathways. The study provides experimental evidence that the DNA methylation state of the ESSE site strongly affects its activity level as a transcriptional enhancer in leukemia cells, supporting the suggestion that the predicted sites are cis-acting regulators that support the reactivation of ES genes in cancer.
Researchers investigated the effect of population subdivision on the time it takes for a population to cross fitness valleys or plateaus in a rugged fitness landscape. They developed a generic and minimal model that includes population subdivision into equivalent demes connected by global migration, without requiring significant size changes of the demes, environmental heterogeneity, or specific geographic structure. The study focused on determining the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing that can be gained by subdivision, assuming the process is driven by the deme that crosses fastest.

The researchers found that isolated demes must be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. Using Markov chain theory, they obtained analytical expressions for the conditions under which optimal speedup is achieved, showing that valley or plateau crossing by the subdivided population is as fast as that of its fastest deme. Stochastic simulations verified these analytical predictions.

The study demonstrated that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters, extending beyond the optimal window. The researchers also investigated the effect of varying the degree of subdivision of a population and the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs. The results, obtained for fitness valleys and plateaus, also held for weakly beneficial intermediate mutations. The study was extended to the case of a population connected by migration to one or several smaller islands, showing that subdivision with migration alone can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses. They used high-resolution mass spectrometry to examine the metabolic changes that occur in the midgut tissue following dengue virus infection. The midgut is the primary site of infection and replication, preceding systemic viral dissemination and transmission.

The study revealed a dynamic remodeling of lipids in the midgut, coinciding with dengue virus replication. The researchers observed a marked increase in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and fatty acyls, suggesting a diversion of resources from energy storage to synthetic pathways. Elevated levels of acyl-carnitines indicated disruptions in mitochondrial function and possible diversion of energy production. A central hub in the sphingolipid pathway was identified as critical for the virus life cycle.

The study also resulted in the first reconstruction of the sphingolipid pathway in Aedes aegypti. Given the conservation of replication mechanisms among several flaviviruses transmitted by this vector, the findings highlight biochemical choke points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by these mosquitoes. This research provides new insights into the metabolic environment induced during arbovirus replication in Aedes aegypti and identifies potential targets for disrupting transmission of these viruses.
Researchers have developed a simplified model of the rabbit action potential (AP) to better understand the underlying mechanisms of fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Existing AP models are complex and varied, leading to dissimilar predictions, and are often based on data from non-physiological conditions. The new model, called a "parsimonious" model, combines a novel formulation of the rapid sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological model of repolarization, similar to the voltage-dependent, time-independent rectifying outward potassium current (IK). The model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit ventricular myocytes under physiological conditions, including dynamic current-voltage relationships, rapid recovery of AP excitability, and steady-state INa inactivation. Simulations of the model reproduced several important phenomena, including cellular alternans at rates greater than 250 beats per minute, reentrant spiral waves, and spiral wave breakup. The study found that the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral wave breakup are the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of IK. The simplicity and physiological meaning of the model's parameters make it ideal for generating generalizable mechanistic insight and can serve as a building block for more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology.
In the ciliate Paramecium, the assembly of the somatic genome involves the precise excision of tens of thousands of short, non-coding germline sequences called Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs). This process requires the introduction of developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are initiated by the domesticated transposase PiggyMac. The DSBs are characterized by 4-base 5' overhangs centered on conserved TA dinucleotides and can readily align and undergo ligation with minimal processing. However, the molecular steps and actors involved in the final and precise assembly of somatic genes have remained unknown. This study demonstrates that Ligase IV and Xrcc4p, core components of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, are required for the repair of IES excision sites and the circularization of excised IESs. The transcription of LIG4 and XRCC4 is induced early during the sexual cycle, and RNAi-mediated silencing of either gene results in the persistence of free broken DNA ends. The study shows that IES excision is a "cut-and-close" mechanism involving the introduction of initiating double-strand cleavages at both ends of each IES, followed by DSB repair via highly precise end joining. This work highlights the essential role of the NHEJ pathway in the precise repair of developmentally programmed DSBs at a genome-wide scale in Paramecium.
A subanalysis of the REMADHE prospective trial was conducted to investigate the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease, comparing it with non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. The study analyzed 342 patients and found that 185 (54.1%) died, with 56.4% of deaths occurring in Chagas patients and 53.7% in non-Chagas patients. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas patients. However, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups.

The Cox regression model identified Chagas etiology, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, creatinine clearance, and the use of amiodarone as independent predictors of heart failure mortality. In contrast, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and the use of beta-blockers were independently associated with sudden death mortality. The study found that in severe Chagas heart disease, progressive heart failure is the most important mode of death. These findings challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications for the selection of treatment choices, considering the mode of death.
Researchers have identified a novel defense mechanism in plant cells against geminivirus infection, a type of virus that affects plants. The mechanism involves a protein called NIK1, which interacts with a ribosomal protein called rpL10A. When NIK1 is activated, it phosphorylates rpL10A, causing it to move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. This movement is crucial for the plant's defense against the virus. The virus, however, has a countermeasure to prevent this defense mechanism. The virus's nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) binds to NIK1, inhibiting its kinase activity and preventing it from phosphorylating rpL10A. As a result, rpL10A remains in the cytoplasm, where it cannot perform its defensive function. This interaction between NIK1 and NSP is a conserved mechanism among different geminiviruses and their hosts. The researchers also found that a mutation in the rpL10A gene makes plants more susceptible to geminivirus infection, suggesting that rpL10A plays a crucial role in the plant's defense against the virus. Furthermore, the researchers demonstrated that the virus interferes with the nuclear relocalization of rpL10A as a counterdefensive measure. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between plants and geminiviruses and highlights the importance of NIK1 and rpL10A in plant defense against viral infections.
A recent study investigated the role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in the pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which causes paracoccidioidomycosis in humans. The researchers found that AOX plays a crucial role in the fungus's ability to resist oxidative stress imposed by the host's immune cells, specifically alveolar macrophages. They generated a strain of P. brasiliensis with reduced AOX expression and observed that this strain had decreased viability when interacting with activated alveolar macrophages. In a mouse model of infection, the strain with reduced AOX expression had a lower fungal burden in the lungs and increased survival rate compared to the wild-type strain. The study also showed that P. brasiliensis yeast cells with reduced AOX expression were more susceptible to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide. These findings suggest that AOX is essential for the fungus's virulence and ability to adapt to the host environment. The researchers propose that AOX helps the fungus to maintain its intracellular redox balance and resist the oxidative burst generated by alveolar macrophages. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of P. brasiliensis and highlights the potential of AOX as a target for antifungal therapies.
Researchers investigated the role of attractor dynamics in the hippocampus, specifically in the CA3 region, in supporting episodic-like memory. They tested whether memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of place cells by morphing one familiar context into another and observing the responses of CA3 cell ensembles. The results showed that average population activity in CA3 transitioned gradually rather than abruptly from one familiar context to the next, suggesting a lack of attractive forces associated with the two stored representations. However, individual CA3 cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along the morph sequence, and some displayed hysteresis, a signature of attractor dynamics.

A neural network model of the CA3 with attractors for both position and discrete contexts was developed to understand the seemingly conflicting results. The model found that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent context attractors made transitions at different points along the morph sequence. This resulted in smooth transition curves when averaging across the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single unit level. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and single unit levels, similar to what was experimentally observed when remapping between two independent spatial maps. The results suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells.
Entamoeba histolytica, a microaerophilic protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and extra-intestinal abscesses in millions of people living in endemic areas. The parasite is exposed to various reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection, but lacks key components of the canonical eukaryotic anti-oxidative defense system, such as catalase and the glutathione system. Researchers investigated the global metabolic responses of E. histolytica to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and paraquat (PQ)-mediated oxidative stress using capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The study found that oxidative stress caused significant changes in metabolites involved in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Specifically, oxidative stress inhibited glycolysis by inactivating key enzymes, leading to a redirection of metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. As a result, glycolytic intermediates accumulated upstream of pyruvate, and nucleoside triphosphate levels decreased. The study also identified a functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica, demonstrated by increased production of glycerol 3-phosphate and glycerol upon oxidative stress. The findings suggest that the glycerol biosynthetic pathway may serve as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system in E. histolytica.
IKAROS is a crucial regulator of hematopoietic cell fate, and its dynamic expression pattern is essential for proper hematopoiesis. Research has shown that IKAROS collaborates with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex to promote gene repression and activation. However, the mechanism by which IKAROS supports transcription activation while being associated with the HDAC-containing complex NuRD remained unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of IKAROS in the recruitment of the NuRD-Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) complex to specific genes and its impact on transcription elongation.

The study demonstrates that NuRD and P-TEFb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited to specific genes by IKAROS. The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring Protein Phosphatase 1α (PP1α) to CDK9. An IKAROS mutant unable to bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impairs normal differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, the study reveals that the occupancy of the NuRD complex at transcribed regions of genes favors the relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and promotes transcription elongation.

The results suggest that IKAROS is the DNA-binding subunit of the NuRD-P-TEFb multifunctional complex, which contains chromatin remodeling and gene transcription elongation activities. IKAROS is essential for CDK9 and Mi2 interaction and combined recruitment to actively transcribed genes in hematopoietic cells. The study provides mechanistic insights into the central role played by IKAROS as a transcriptional activator during hematopoietic lineage decision, differentiation, and interaction with the niche.
This study investigated the evolutionary history and phylogeography of rabies viruses associated with outbreaks in Trinidad, a Caribbean island. The researchers characterized Trinidadian rabies virus (RABV) sequences and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to determine whether outbreaks were caused by in situ evolution or the importation of virus from the nearby South American mainland. The study found that Trinidadian RABV sequences belonged to the bat-associated Clade 2 and clustered into three largely temporally defined lineages: Trinidad I, IIa, and IIb. These lineages were most closely related to RABV sequences from Ecuador, French Guiana, Venezuela, Brazil, and Uruguay. Phylogeographic analyses suggested that there were three separate RABV introductions from the mainland, from which each of the three Trinidadian lineages arose. The estimated dates for the introductions and subsequent lineage expansions indicate periods of in situ evolution within Trinidad following each introduction. The study also found evidence of co-circulation of Trinidad lineage I and IIa during 2000. The results suggest that further studies should be conducted to investigate the relationship between RABV spatiotemporal dynamics and vampire bat population ecology, particularly any movement between the mainland and Trinidad. The study highlights the importance of monitoring bat species with migratory habits to determine if RABV variants different from those associated with vampire bats are also being introduced into Trinidad.
Researchers developed a computational model to study the gene regulatory network underlying the development of distinct areas in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The model focused on five genes: Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8, which play a crucial role in specifying areal identity along the anterior-posterior axis. The model treated expression levels as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of the available expression data. By simulating all possible networks containing these five genes, the researchers found that only a subset of networks were able to reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns. These networks lacked certain interactions, including auto-regulation and inductive loops. The analysis revealed that repressive interactions are more likely than inductive ones, but mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct network functioning. The model suggests that Fgf8 expression at the anterior pole may be sufficient to drive the correct spatial patterning of the transcription factors Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8, if simple interactions between these transcription factors exist. The study provides insights into the design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development and makes novel predictions that can be tested experimentally.
Researchers used a technique called ChIP-Seq to study the distribution of a specific histone modification called ubiquitylated H2A (uH2A) across the genome in mouse cells. This modification is associated with the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during development. The study focused on Bmi1, a component of the PcG complex, and its role in depositing uH2A at repressed genes. The results showed that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is enriched at gene promoters, particularly those containing the H3K27me3 mark, which is another histone modification associated with gene silencing. However, uH2A is not limited to these regions and is also found at high-density CpG promoters, where it is linked to DNA methylation. The study found that genes with uH2A peaks exhibit lower expression levels compared to those without uH2A peaks, and that Bmi1 knockout leads to increased expression of genes with uH2A peaks. This suggests that Bmi1-dependent uH2A plays a role in repressing gene expression. The study also found that DNA methylation may be upstream of Bmi1-dependent H2A ubiquitylation, and that uH2A targeting in differentiated cells may employ a different mechanism than in embryonic stem cells. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of Bmi1-dependent uH2A in gene regulation and its relationship with other epigenetic modifications.
Researchers investigated the role of pregnancy-induced noncoding RNA (PINC) in regulating mammary epithelial cell differentiation during pregnancy and lactation. They found that PINC is highly expressed in alveolar cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and decreases in early lactation, when alveolar cells undergo terminal differentiation to produce milk proteins. This reduction in PINC levels may be necessary for lactation, as overexpression of PINC in mammary epithelial cells blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of PINC enhances differentiation. PINC interacts with the retinoblastoma-associated protein 46 (RbAp46) and other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which may confer epigenetic modifications that maintain a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alveolar fate in the involuted gland. The study suggests that PINC inhibits terminal differentiation of alveolar cells during pregnancy to prevent abundant milk production and secretion until parturition. Additionally, the PRC2 complex that includes PINC and RbAp46 may play a role in maintaining a population of mammary epithelial cells that are committed to the alveolar fate in the involuted gland. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of mammary epithelial cell differentiation during pregnancy and lactation.
Researchers have investigated the role of PML/TRIM19 in antiviral defense, specifically its effect on HIV-1 infection. They found that HIV-1 and other retroviruses trigger the formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies as early as 30 minutes post-infection. These bodies last approximately 8 hours, with a peak at 2 hours post-infection. PML re-localization is blocked by reverse-transcription inhibitors and is not observed following infection with unrelated viruses, suggesting it is specifically triggered by retroviral reverse-transcription. PML knockdown dramatically increases reverse-transcription efficiency, indicating that PML interferes with an early step of retroviral infection. However, PML does not directly inhibit retroviral infection, but rather acts through the stabilization of its partner protein, Daxx. Daxx is found in the vicinity of incoming HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse-transcription. Daxx not only interferes with exogenous retroviral infections but also inhibits retrotransposition of endogenous retroviruses, identifying Daxx as a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription. This study reveals a novel antiviral function for PML and its associated protein Daxx, highlighting their role in restricting retroviral infections.
Researchers have developed a new program, Matt, to improve protein multiple structure alignment, a crucial step in understanding protein function and evolution. Current methods often rely on aligned fragment pair chaining, where short structural fragments are aligned optimally and then chained together. However, this approach can be computationally prohibitive. Matt introduces local flexibility between fragments, allowing small translations and rotations to bring aligned fragments closer, even if they are physically impossible under rigid body transformations. This flexibility is temporarily allowed in intermediate steps, and geometric consistency is restored in the final step.

Matt was tested against other recent multiple protein structure alignment programs on the Homstrad and SABmark benchmark datasets. On Homstrad, a dataset of highly homologous proteins, Matt's performance was competitive with other programs. However, on SABmark, a dataset of proteins with more distant homology, Matt outperformed other programs, particularly in aligning the ends of alpha-helices and beta-strands. This is an important characteristic for constructing a structural template library for threading approaches to the inverse protein-folding problem.

Matt's ability to model proteins in different conformational states and backbone distortions in more distantly related proteins is thought to contribute to its strong performance. Additionally, a p-value score based on the length of the common core and average root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of Matt alignments was able to distinguish distantly homologous structure pairs from non-homologous pairs in the SABmark dataset.
Researchers investigated the regulation of Greatwall (Gwl) kinase and its substrates, Ensa and ARPP19, during mitotic exit in cells. Gwl inactivates the phosphatase PP2A/B55, which normally counteracts the activity of the kinase Cdk1. However, the dynamic regulation of Gwl activity and the phosphatases that control Gwl kinase and its substrates were poorly understood. The study used a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments to monitor the phosphorylation of Gwl, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrates during mitotic entry and exit. The results showed that PP2A/B55 is required for the dephosphorylation of Gwl at a critical site, and that the RNA Polymerase II carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1 mediates the dephosphorylation of Ensa/ARPP19. Surprisingly, inhibiting or depleting Fcp1 or PP2A did not block the dephosphorylation of most Cdk1 substrates during mitotic exit. The study suggests a hierarchy of phosphatases that coordinate the dephosphorylation of Gwl, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrates during mitotic exit. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of mitotic exit and the role of phosphatases in this process. The study also highlights the complexity of the phosphatase network that counteracts Gwl, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk phosphorylation during mitotic exit.
Researchers investigated the development of neutralizing antibodies (Nab) in two individuals with acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection. Despite the presence of high-titer autologous Nab, the virus was able to escape neutralization through multiple pathways. In one subject, escape was driven primarily by changes in the V3V5 region of the envelope glycoprotein, while in the other subject, escape was driven by changes in the V1V2 region. Notably, the virus in the second subject was able to evade two distinct monoclonal antibodies by introducing a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in V2. Spatial analysis of the sequence changes in gp120 revealed that selective pressure acted on the same regions of Env in both subjects, despite the different escape pathways used. The findings suggest that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and that multiple strategies, including glycan shifts, direct alteration of epitope sequences, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization. These results have implications for the development of an effective HIV vaccine, which aims to elicit Nab that can limit replication of genetically diverse viruses and prevent establishment of a new infection.
Researchers analyzed the genomes of 13 individuals of the plant species Capsella grandiflora to understand the extent of positive and negative selection across different parts of the genome. They found that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). However, when looking at noncoding regions that are conserved across the Brassicaceae family, they detected strong signals of selection. Additionally, the team observed reduced genetic diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. They also found that genes with higher expression levels experience stronger negative selection but similar levels of positive selection compared to genes with lower expression levels. Overall, the study reveals widespread positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions, but suggests that both types of selection are less common in plant noncoding sequences compared to animal genomes. The findings have implications for understanding genome function and the maintenance of genetic variation.
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-encoded transcriptional regulator EBNA2 plays a crucial role in transforming resting B-lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, which can lead to malignancies. Research has shown that EBNA2 drives the cooperative and combinatorial genome-wide binding of two master regulators of B-cell fate, EBF1 and RBP-jκ. Unlike previous studies, which suggested that these B-cell factors are statically bound to target gene promoters, EBNA2 induces the formation of new binding sites for both RBP-jκ and EBF1, many of which are in close physical proximity in the cellular and viral genome. These newly induced binding sites co-occupied by EBNA2-EBF1-RBP-jκ correlate strongly with the transcriptional activation of linked genes important for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional expression or repression of EBNA2 leads to a rapid alteration in RBP-jκ and EBF1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA depletion studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. EBNA2 facilitates combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival. EBV type III latency promotes a B-cell marginal zone developmental program, increasing the number of RBP-jκ binding sites. EBNA2 reprograms the chromosome binding patterns of host master regulatory transcription factors RBP-jκ and EBF1.
Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of dengue virus, exhibits significant genetic structure and variation in vector competence (VC) for dengue serotype 2 virus (DENV2) in Mexico. Population genetic studies have identified the Neovolcanic axis (NVA) as a discrete barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegypti populations north and south of the NVA in the state of Veracruz. Mosquito populations from north and south of the NVA differ in their VC for DENV2, with an average VC rate of 0.55 for mosquitoes from north of the NVA and 0.20 for those from south of the NVA. The variation in VC is primarily due to midgut infection and escape barriers, with 21.5% of mosquitoes from north of the NVA failing to develop midgut infections and 30.3% of those with an infected midgut failing to develop a disseminated infection. In contrast, 45.2% of mosquitoes from south of the NVA failed to develop midgut infections and 62.8% of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection. The NVA may impact the frequency of genes that condition continuous and epidemiologically relevant traits such as VC. Further studies are needed to determine why the NVA acts as a barrier to gene flow and whether the differences in VC between north and south of the NVA are stable and epidemiologically significant.
Researchers investigated the role of the DnaA protein in the initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. The DnaA protein cycles between an active ATP-bound form and an inactive ADP-bound form, and it has been suggested that it is the main controller of initiation frequency. However, the study found that increasing the concentration of ATP-DnaA by more than 50% did not affect the timing of replication initiation in E. coli cells. This suggests that the DnaA protein is not the limiting factor for the precise timing of initiation of replication.

The researchers propose that the DnaA protein is the motor that drives the initiation process, but other factors are required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment. They also investigated the in vivo roles of DDAH (DnaA-dependent DnaA inactivation) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA, and found that loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein.

The study suggests that E. coli has a robust replication cycle driven by the cycling of the levels of ATP-DnaA and ADP-DnaA, and that initiation cannot occur unless sufficient amounts of ATP-DnaA at the origin of replication (oriC) have licensed this event. The researchers propose that signals depending on the cell's environment govern the exact timing of initiation, and that the frequency of replication must match the growth rate to maintain a stable cellular DNA concentration.
Researchers have developed a novel approach called partial Granger causality to uncover interactions in complex biological systems. This method is designed to reveal interaction patterns in multivariate data with exogenous inputs and latent variables in the frequency domain. The approach was tested using toy models and applied to experimental datasets, including gene microarray data from HeLa cells, in vivo local field potentials from the sheep's inferotemporal cortex, and in vivo LFPs from the macaque monkey's right hemisphere.

The study aimed to demonstrate that traditional definitions of causality, such as partial directed coherence (PDC) in the frequency domain, can be misleading and yield contradictory results compared to time-domain Granger causality. The researchers found that partial Granger causality in the frequency domain can provide a more accurate representation of causal relationships in complex systems.

The method was applied to a toy model with exogenous inputs and latent variables, which showed that the definition of partial Granger causality has a transparent statistical meaning based on conditional variance. The approach was also applied to experimental data from a macaque monkey performing a visual pattern discrimination task, where the presence of oscillatory field potential activity in the beta frequency range was reported in the sensorimotor cortex during the prestimulus period. The results showed that partial Granger causality in the frequency domain can reveal the complete causal relationship between variables, including the influence of latent variables and exogenous inputs.
Researchers have developed new methods for determining the ancestry of specific regions of the genome in individuals with mixed ancestry, such as Latino Americans. This information is crucial for medical and population genetic studies, as it can help identify disease-risk loci, infer recombination rates, and map missing contigs in the human genome. However, existing methods for local ancestry inference are often designed for use with genotyping arrays and fail to utilize the full range of data available from sequencing.

The new approach, called Lanc-CSV, leverages continent-specific variants (CSVs) to improve performance in sequenced admixed genomes. This method incorporates both the admixed genomes themselves and public datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes project, to enhance the accuracy of CSV calling. Simulations show that Lanc-CSV achieves accuracy comparable to computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches, but with significantly reduced runtime.

The researchers also extended their approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and demonstrated that accurate local ancestry inference can be achieved at low sequencing coverage. Furthermore, they generalized CSVs to sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs) and showed that it is possible to determine sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments based on sCSVs. This method has the potential to be particularly useful as sequencing costs decrease and genetic studies sequence more samples, making the tradeoff between computational runtime and accuracy a critical consideration for local ancestry inference.
A new approach to analyzing gene expression data has been developed to identify circadian oscillations in mammalian genes. Previous studies have reported that 10-15% of genes exhibit daily rhythms, regulated by an intrinsic molecular clock. However, statistical analyses have been limited by the small size of datasets and high levels of noise. The new method applies digital signal processing algorithms to each group of genes oscillating in the same phase, combined with statistical tests for periodicity. This approach identifies circadian baseline oscillation in almost 100% of all expressed genes.

The method involves converting single gene profiles into a long continuous stream to reduce noise and enhance the signal. This allows for the identification of patterns of circadian oscillation with confidence. The commonality of oscillation suggests that it is a natural and important feature of all or nearly all biological pathways. Genes that display daily variation in expression level may or may not be linked directly to the circadian molecular clock, but their oscillation will affect the system as a whole.

The new approach has been applied to data from murine liver, and the results show that the amplitude of core circadian genes does not stand out from the majority of expressed genes. The effect of perturbations on the oscillating system depends on the circadian time- and wave-guiding properties of the biological pathways. The study suggests that circadian oscillation in gene expression should be evaluated in any study related to biological pathways, and changes in gene expression caused by mutations or environmental factors should be considered in the context of changes in the amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations.
Researchers used whole-genome re-sequencing to study recombination events in a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers. They identified 325 crossover (CO) events at a median resolution of 1.4 kilobases, with 86% of events localized to regions less than 10 kilobases. Crossover rates were higher in males (3.56 centimorgans per megabase) than in females (2.28 centimorgans per megabase) and increased towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossover events were non-randomly distributed in the genome, with distinct hotspots and a concentration in genic regions, particularly in promoters and CpG islands.

The researchers also identified 267 non-crossover (NCO) gene conversion events, which were significantly associated with crossover locations. They found a transmission bias in favor of'strong' (G, C) over 'weak' (A, T) alleles at NCO events, providing evidence for GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system. The study's approach can be applied to other species, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the recombination landscape across different organism groups. The findings suggest that recombination events are often concentrated in specific genomic regions, known as hotspots, and that these hotspots may remain relatively stable over time in the absence of an active Prdm9 gene.
Researchers have studied the energy landscapes of repeat-containing proteins, which are composed of near repetitions of 20-40 amino acid stretches. These proteins typically fold into elongated, non-globular architectures, stabilized by interactions within and between repeats, but lacking contacts between distant residues. The inherent symmetries in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure suggest a folding landscape that can be analyzed as a quasi-one-dimensional problem.

A formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, treated as spin variables, provides a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes. This approach allows derivation of the overall folding properties of a complete "domain," including stability and cooperativity of the repeating array. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies simple relations for experimental observables, such as folding free-energy and cooperativity of denaturation, which do not apply to globular proteins.

The parameters for the "coarse-grained" description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. A case-study of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins illustrates the ideas, and the results are quantitatively related to experimentally observed folding transitions. The study suggests that natural repeat proteins are "poised" at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics, allowing them to undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions.
Researchers investigated the role of the stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer. They found that CHOP expression is up-regulated in human HCC tumors and in two mouse models of the disease. Mice lacking the CHOP gene (Chop-null mice) were resistant to chemical-induced liver cancer and exhibited reduced fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. Global gene expression profiling revealed that deletion of CHOP reduced basal inflammatory signaling in the liver, suggesting that CHOP promotes inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. These findings implicate CHOP as a common contributing factor in the development of HCC in various chronic liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. The researchers also found that CHOP expression is associated with an agent that causes hepatocyte injury and is upstream of fibrosis activation. In Chop-null mice, gene expression differed from wild-type mice in a way that could account for the greater susceptibility of wild-type mice to fibrosis and oncogenesis, even in the absence of an overt hepatotoxic challenge. These results suggest a stepwise progression from CHOP expression to liver tumors, and understanding the mechanisms by which CHOP promotes oncogenesis may have implications for other cancers beyond HCC.
A systematic review of clinical studies on the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethiopica was conducted to identify potentially efficacious medications. The review included 24 records reporting on 506 treatment episodes of CL, primarily from Ethiopia. The most commonly used treatments were antimonials (201 cases), pentamidine (150 cases), and cryotherapy (103 cases). However, the quality of the studies was poor, with only two small and/or poor-quality randomized controlled trials identified.

Cure rates for cryotherapy ranged from 60-80%, and 69-85% for antimonials. Pentamidine appeared effective against complicated CL, including cases non-responsive to antimonials. However, all studies had methodological limitations. Data on miltefosine, paromomycin, and liposomal amphotericin B were scarce, and only a few studies focused on diffuse CL (DCL). The only potentially effective treatment options for DCL were antimonials with paromomycin in combination or pentamidine, but these have not been properly evaluated.

The evidence base for treating complicated CL due to L. aethiopica is extremely limited. Antimonials remain the most available treatment in Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety should be better defined. Alternative first-line treatments, such as miltefosine or paromomycin, should be explored. High-quality trials are urgently needed to evaluate treatment options for CL due to L. aethiopica.
Researchers have successfully reconstituted a biochemical oscillator in a laboratory setting using three purified proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. This in vitro circadian clockwork displays the key characteristics of natural circadian rhythms, including a self-sustained 24-hour periodicity that is resistant to temperature changes. To understand the biochemical basis of this oscillator, the researchers analyzed the interactions between the three proteins using electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis. These studies revealed that the proteins form various complexes at different stages of the circadian cycle, with the composition of these complexes changing over time.

A dynamic model was developed to describe the behavior of the in vitro oscillator, which accurately predicts the rhythms of the KaiABC complexes and the phosphorylation of KaiC. The model suggests that the exchange of monomers among KaiC hexamers plays a crucial role in maintaining synchrony among the hexamers and sustaining a high-amplitude oscillation. This was confirmed using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments, which showed that monomer exchange occurs among KaiC hexamers.

The researchers also used temperature pulses to reset the phase of the KaiABC oscillator, demonstrating that this unique circadian oscillator can be reset by stimuli that are known to entrain natural circadian clocks. Overall, this study provides a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the in vitro circadian clockwork, shedding light on the complex interactions between the Kai proteins and their role in generating circadian rhythms.
Researchers investigated the relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual stimulus detection task using electrocorticography (ECoG) in patients undergoing invasive brain monitoring for neurosurgical treatment. They found an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral output, where hit rate and reaction times were higher and faster when the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity was closer to the across-trial mean. This relationship was observed not only in post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity but also in pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics. The findings are consistent with the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and support attractor network theories, which propose that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task performance, with proximity to the targeted trajectory associated with better performance. The study decouples variability reduction from trial-averaged activity, predicting a U- or inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance. The results provide evidence for the existence of an inverted-U function between trial-to-trial fluctuations of brain activity and behavioral performance, which is seldom tested in previous studies.
Researchers studied the mating-type loci in 24 species of Trichosporonales, a group of fungi closely related to the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. They found that the mating-type loci in these species are fused, similar to those in the pathogenic Cryptococci. However, the specific combinations of genes within the fused loci are different between the two groups. This suggests that the fusion of the mating-type loci occurred independently in the Trichosporonales and the pathogenic Cryptococci, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. Convergent evolution occurs when different species develop similar traits or characteristics in response to similar environmental pressures, despite not being closely related. The researchers also found that the gene content and gene order within the fused mating-type loci are highly conserved in the Trichosporonales, meaning that they have remained relatively unchanged over time. This is in contrast to other fungal groups, where the fused mating-type loci have undergone significant changes. The study provides new insights into the evolution of mating-type loci in fungi and highlights the importance of studying the evolution of genomic regions involved in mating and mating-type determination. The findings also suggest that the mechanisms underlying the evolution of fused mating-type loci may be different between the Trichosporonales and other fungal groups.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to predict the abundance of non-domiciliated Triatoma dimidiata, a vector of Chagas disease, in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The model was based on two years of field data and accurately predicted the abundance of the vector in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different control strategies, including residual insecticide spraying, insect screens, and bednets.

The results showed that pyrethroid spraying was effective in reducing the abundance of non-domiciliated vectors when applied at a dose of 50 mg/m2 over a two-month period matching the immigration season. However, larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve the reduction in bug abundance, and it decreased drastically when the timing or frequency of intervention was altered. In contrast, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate.

The study found that control of non-domiciliated vectors through insecticide spraying is challenging due to the need for yearly application and accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens, on the other hand, appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative for controlling non-domiciliated vectors. The findings suggest that insect screens may be a valuable component of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
Feather patterning in avian skin is a complex process that relies on the interaction of multiple signaling pathways and cell density waves. During development, feathers first appear along the dorsal midline as a row, with new feather buds added sequentially in a spreading wave. Research has shown that this patterning is achieved through a coordinated reaction-diffusion-taxis system involving fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, as well as mesenchymal cell movement. This system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration occurring through a positive feedback loop centered on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation and compresses the epidermis to intensify FGF20 expression.

The traveling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of Ectodysplasin A (EDA), which initiates the expression of FGF20. The EDA wave spreads across a mesenchymal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal cells required to begin forming a feather bud. In flightless birds, such as the emu and ostrich, the feather patterning system is disrupted, resulting in the loss of the characteristic feather array. However, the ostrich retains the tract arrangement characteristic of birds in general, but lays down feather primordia without a wave, similar to the process of hair follicle formation in mammalian embryos. The embryonic emu skin lacks sufficient cells to enact feather formation, causing failure of tract formation, and instead gains feather primordia through a later process.
A rapid systematic review of published evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors was conducted. The review aimed to determine which body fluids are infectious and when they pose a risk to humans. A total of 6831 unique articles were found, and 33 studies were eligible for inclusion. The review found that most body fluid types had insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions, and the prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken more than 16 days after the onset of illness were usually negative. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for filovirus RNA gave positive results about four times more often than tissue culture tests. Filovirus was reported in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every confirmed patient. Apart from semen, most non-blood, RT-PCR-positive samples are likely to be culture-negative and possibly of low infectious risk. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission due to the known high viral loads in blood. The review highlights the need for further research to determine the relative infectiousness of various body fluids during and after illness.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model, called the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model, to describe the complex dynamics of neuronal activity in the brain. This model takes into account the correlations between different membrane conductances, which can lead to power-law behavior in the voltage trace of neurons. The model uses a fractional derivative, which is a non-local process that integrates a weighted voltage trace, or memory trace, to determine the value of the variable. This approach allows the model to capture the non-Markovian process of neuronal activity, which cannot be described by a single time constant.

The fractional model can reproduce the upward and downward spike adaptations found in experimental studies of neocortical pyramidal cells and tectal neurons. By varying the exponent of the fractional derivative, the model can produce spikes with longer first-spike latency and high inter-spike variability, with a power-law distribution. The model also generates reliable spike patterns in response to noisy input, and its spiking activity deviates from the Markovian model, reflecting the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation. The fractional model provides a unified mathematical and computational framework for describing power-law dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity, and can capture relationships between the distribution of conductances that are complicated to model using explicit techniques.
Researchers investigated the role of superoxide dismutases (SODs) in the pathogenesis of Paracoccidioides spp., a fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis. The study identified six SOD isoforms encoded by the Paracoccidioides genome and analyzed their expression levels in different stages of the fungus's life cycle, including yeast and mycelia cells, as well as during interaction with host effector cells. The results showed that two SOD isoforms, PbSOD1 and PbSOD3, were highly expressed during the transition from yeast to mycelia, exposure to oxidative agents, and interaction with phagocytic cells. This suggests that these proteins play a crucial role in combating superoxide radicals generated during the host-pathogen interaction. Using knockdown strains, the researchers demonstrated that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are involved in the fungus's response to oxidative stress and host effector cells. Protein sequence analysis and functional analysis of knockdown strains indicated that PbSOD3 is linked to extracellular activity, while PbSOD1 is related to intracellular requirements of the fungus. The study suggests that Paracoccidioides actively responds to endogenously generated radicals and counteracts the oxidative burst of immune cells by inducing the expression of SOD isoforms. The findings provide new insights into the antioxidant response of Paracoccidioides and highlight the importance of SODs in its pathogenesis.
A recent study investigated the relationship between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and chaperone binding in various species, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa. Contrary to the expectation that IDPs would be preferentially associated with chaperones to protect against proteolysis, the study found that predicted disorder negatively correlates with chaperone binding. This means that IDPs tend to avoid binding to chaperones in vivo. The analysis of high-throughput interaction data revealed that proteins with predicted disorder are less likely to bind chaperones compared to those with ordered structures.

The study also found that the presence of ordered domains, such as Pfam domains, is associated with a preference for chaperone binding, suggesting that chaperones are primarily required for the folding of globular proteins. In contrast, IDPs that bind chaperones tend to bind other proteins as well, indicating that chaperone binding may facilitate the assembly of IDPs with their partners rather than assisting in their folding. This conclusion is supported by the observation that IDPs that bind chaperones are more likely to bind other proteins compared to ordered proteins. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the role of chaperones in the cell and the behavior of IDPs, which are known to be sensitive to proteolysis in vitro but show no enhanced degradation rates in vivo.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Spalt transcription factors, encoded by the Drosophila genes spalt major (salm) and spalt-related (salr), in the development of the wing imaginal disc. These transcription factors are regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway and are essential for cell survival and proliferation in the central region of the wing disc, as well as vein patterning in the lateral regions. To understand the genetic control of wing growth and patterning, the researchers identified direct Salm and Salr target genes by comparing the expression profile of salm/salr knockdown wing discs with control discs using microarray experiments. In situ hybridization revealed a complex transcription landscape regulated by the Spalt proteins, including both activated and repressed genes. Candidate Salm/Salr target genes were identified, and loss-of-function phenotypic analysis showed that some of these genes are required for wing growth and patterning. This study provides new insights into the genetic hierarchy acting downstream of Dpp signaling in the wing disc and sheds light on the mechanisms by which Spalt proteins regulate transcription. The identification of Salm/Salr target genes opens a new avenue to reconstruct the genetic structure of the wing, linking the activity of the Dpp pathway to the development of this epithelial tissue. The study reveals an unsuspected complexity in the transcriptional landscape regulated by Salm/Salr, consisting of batteries of activated and repressed genes.
Researchers have identified a key regulator of centriole duplication in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Centrioles are essential components of centrosomes, which are crucial for cell division. Abnormalities in centriole number have been linked to tumorigenesis and microcephaly in humans. The C. elegans protein ZYG-1, a homolog of the human protein Plk4, is required for centriole duplication. However, the regulation of ZYG-1 levels was not fully understood.

The study found that two protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) orthologs, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators I-2SZY-2 and SDS-22, play a crucial role in regulating ZYG-1 levels. Down-regulation of PP1 activity, either directly or through mutations in szy-2 or sds-22, can rescue the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 hypomorphic allele. This is achieved through an increase in ZYG-1 levels, indicating that PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism.

Moderate inhibition of PP1 activity can restore centriole duplication in a zyg-1 mutant, but strong inhibition of PP1 in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification, resulting in the production of more than one daughter centriole. The study defines a new pathway that limits the number of daughter centrioles produced each cycle. The findings suggest that PP1 is a critical regulator of centriole duplication and that modulating PP1 activity may impact centriole number.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in an environmentally protected area (EPA) in southeastern Brazil to investigate visceral leishmaniasis (VL) transmission. The study focused on the municipality of Campinas, where the first autochthonous case of VL in a dog was reported in 2009. Since then, disease transmission has been restricted to dogs living in two geographically contiguous condominiums within the EPA. The study aimed to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies using molecular tools and serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six insect species, confirmed or suspected vectors or potential transmitters of Leishmania, were identified, including Lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of Leishmania infantum in Brazil. Natural infection by L. (L.) infantum was recorded in one Expapillata firmatoi specimen and two Pintomyia monticola, as well as in two white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventris), a known reservoir of VL. The study found that the EPA, inhabited by humans, has an active VL focus, and the risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios is evident.
The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded microRNA miR-BART9 has been found to play a significant role in promoting tumor metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly metastatic type of cancer frequently reported in South Asia. Research has shown that miR-BART9 is highly expressed in EBV-positive NPC tissues and targets the E-cadherin protein, which is crucial for maintaining cell-cell junctions and the epithelial phenotype. By inhibiting E-cadherin, miR-BART9 induces a mesenchymal-like phenotype in NPC cells, leading to enhanced migration and invasiveness. This prometastatic activity was observed both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that miR-BART9 contributes to the aggressive behavior of NPC tumor cells. Computational analysis revealed that miR-BART9 shares a "seed sequence" with the miR-200 family, which is down-modulated in NPC tumors, suggesting a potential link between miR-BART9 and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. The study's findings suggest that miR-BART9 is a significant viral contributor to the migratory and invasive capability of EBV-infected tumor cells, and high levels of miR-BART9 in EBV-positive NPC cells may contribute to the aggressiveness of tumor cells.
A new command-line tool called ggsashimi has been developed for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples. This tool creates sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments. Unlike existing versions of sashimi plot-generating programs, ggsashimi uses popular bioinformatics file formats, is annotation-independent, and allows for the visualization of splicing events in large genomic regions by scaling down genomic segments between splice sites. The tool is implemented in Python and generates R code for plotting.

The development of ggsashimi aims to address the limitations of current sashimi plot implementations, which are often annotation-dependent and not dynamically integrated in common genome browsers. Visualizing splicing events can be challenging due to the non-contiguous nature of splice sites on the genome sequence, which can be tens or hundreds of kilobases apart.

Ggsashimi has been compared to the sashimi-plot built-in available within the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) browser. The results show that ggsashimi's aggregation of samples and shrinkage of intron lengths enhance the visualization of splicing events. The ggsashimi tool is freely available at https://github.com/guigolab/ggsashimi.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict and align cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across different species. CRMs are non-coding DNA sequences that regulate gene expression by binding to transcription factors. The new model, called EMMA (Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module Analysis), uses a probabilistic approach to account for the evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and background sequences. Unlike existing models, EMMA explicitly treats the evolution of TFBSs, including gains and losses, which is a crucial aspect of regulatory sequence evolution.

The model is based on a statistical alignment method that uses conserved binding sites to improve alignment accuracy. EMMA's CRM prediction method addresses the uncertainties of binding site annotations and sequence alignment by using a probabilistic framework. In simulated and real data, EMMA outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in aligning and predicting CRMs.

The researchers applied EMMA to study the conservation of binding sites in genome-wide binding data of key transcription factors in Drosophila blastoderm. They found that factor-bound sequences are under strong evolutionary constraints, even if their neighboring genes are not expressed in the blastoderm. Additionally, binding sites in distal regions (relative to transcription start sites) tend to be more conserved than those in proximal regions. The EMMA software is available for use in various biological contexts.
Researchers have investigated the role of the piRNA (PIWI-interacting RNA) pathway in genome maintenance and telomere protection in Drosophila. The piRNA pathway is known to silence transposons in the germline, but its functions during development were unclear. Mutations in the piRNA pathway genes armi, aub, ago3, and rhi were found to lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during embryonic divisions. Additionally, mutations in aub and armi resulted in defects in telomere resolution during meiosis and embryonic divisions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that aub and armi mutations disrupted telomere binding of HOAP, a component of the telomere protection complex, and reduced expression of a subpopulation of 19- to 22-nt telomere-specific piRNAs. In contrast, mutations in rhi and ago3 did not block HOAP binding or production of these piRNAs. These findings suggest that the piRNA pathway has distinct functions in genome maintenance and telomere protection. The aub, armi, rhi, and ago3 genes silence transposons and maintain chromosome integrity during embryonic divisions, while aub and armi have an additional function in assembling the telomere protection complex. The study reveals a novel function for a subset of piRNA genes in telomere protection and suggests that this process is directed by a subpopulation of 19-22 nt piRNAs.
A new species of the Ebola virus, known as Bundibugyo ebolavirus, has been identified as the cause of a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in western Uganda. The outbreak, which occurred in November 2007, resulted in 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths, with a case fatality rate of approximately 36%. This new virus is most closely related to the Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus, despite being found in a geographically distant location. The discovery of Bundibugyo ebolavirus has significant implications for the development of diagnostic assays, antivirals, and vaccines against Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The virus is distinct from previously recognized ebolaviruses, such as Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, which have case fatality rates ranging from 53% to 90%. The lower case fatality rate associated with Bundibugyo ebolavirus suggests that it may have different antigenic and pathogenic properties compared to other ebolaviruses. To better understand the characteristics of this new virus, further studies are needed, including pathogenicity studies in non-human primates and cross-protection studies to assess the effectiveness of existing vaccines against Bundibugyo ebolavirus. The rapid identification and isolation of Ebola cases during the outbreak were facilitated by the transfer of diagnostic assays to the Uganda Virus Research Institute, allowing for efficient control of the outbreak.
Researchers analyzed a large dataset of 648 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years to understand the progression of the disease. They used the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Functional Assessment Staging procedure (FAST) to categorize the patients into seven stages of AD, from normal aging to severe dementia. The study found that the durations of GDS/FAST stages 4-6 varied significantly among patients, with standard deviations comparable to their mean values. This indicates a high degree of heterogeneity in the progression of AD, suggesting that patients may belong to different subgroups with distinct patterns of decline.

The study's findings are consistent with previous reports of variability in AD progression rates, which have been attributed to a combination of factors. The researchers used a 23-year longitudinal dataset, providing a comprehensive representation of patients at GDS/FAST stages 4-7 of AD. The FAST procedure, which describes a continuum of 16 stages and substages from normality to severe dementia, was used in conjunction with the GDS. The study's results have implications for evaluating the results of clinical studies and understanding the underlying reasons for the variability in AD progression rates. The findings suggest that AD is a heterogeneous disease, with different subgroups of patients exhibiting distinct patterns of cognitive and functional decline.
Researchers have extended a previous study on adult neurogenesis in a simplified hippocampal memory model to include realistic, spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. The model compared three adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis. The results confirmed that additive neurogenesis is a superior adaptation strategy, allowing the network to respond to changes in input statistics while preserving representations of earlier environments.

The study found that a more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule, incorporating cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells, outperformed the individual strategies. This adaptation rule can be tailored to maximize network performance as a short- or long-term memory store. The researchers also examined the time course of adult neurogenesis over an animal's lifetime under different hypothetical rearing conditions, predicting distinct growth profiles that could be tested experimentally.

The model demonstrated that place cells can emerge and refine in a realistic manner as a result of the sparsification performed by the dentate gyrus layer. The study suggests that additive neurogenesis endows the network with the ability to adapt in a way not possible with conventional plasticity or neuronal turnover, providing a theoretical argument for why additive neurogenesis should be observed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
In bloodstream African trypanosomes, cytosolic peroxidases play a crucial role in protecting the lysosome from iron-mediated membrane damage. The parasites express three virtually identical non-selenium glutathione peroxidase-type enzymes, Px I, Px II, and Px III, which detoxify lipid-derived hydroperoxides. Research has shown that parasites lacking Px I and Px II undergo rapid lipid peroxidation and cell lysis, whereas those lacking Px III display only a weak and transient proliferation defect. Supplementing the medium with the antioxidant Trolox rescues the phenotype of Px I and Px II knockout parasites.

The study found that the lysosome is the primary site of oxidative damage in bloodstream trypanosomes. Feeding Px I and Px II knockout parasites with Alexa Fluor-conjugated dextran or LysoTracker in the presence of Trolox yielded a discrete lysosomal staining, which became progressively spread over the whole cell body and was completely lost upon withdrawal of the antioxidant. Supplementing the medium with iron or transferrin induced lysis of the Px I and Px II knockout cells, while the iron chelator deferoxamine and apo-transferrin attenuated lysis.

Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that disintegration of the lysosome precedes mitochondrial damage. In vivo experiments confirmed the negligible role of the mitochondrial peroxidase, as mice infected with Px III knockout cells displayed only a slightly delayed disease development compared to wild-type parasites. The study demonstrates that cytosolic trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases protect the lysosome from iron-induced membrane peroxidation, which is closely linked to the high endocytic rate and distinct iron acquisition mechanisms of the infective stage of T. brucei.
Researchers have inactivated the Pmel gene in mice to study its role in melanosome shape and pigmentation. Melanosomes are organelles in pigment cells where eumelanin, a type of melanin, is produced. The Pmel gene encodes an amyloidogenic protein that forms intralumenal fibrils within melanosomes. The study found that mice lacking the Pmel gene (Pmel−/−) have spherical melanosomes instead of the typical oblong shape found in wild-type animals. This change in shape was observed in various types of melanocytes, including skin-derived melanocytes, retinal pigment epithelium cells, and uveal melanocytes.

The inactivation of Pmel had a mild effect on the coat color phenotype, with the most noticeable effect observed in mice carrying the brown/Tyrp1 mutation. The study suggests that previously described alleles in vertebrates with more striking effects on pigmentation may be dominant-negative mutations. Despite the mild effect on visible pigmentation, the Pmel knockout mutation led to a substantial reduction in eumelanin content in hair, indicating that PMEL plays a critical role in maintaining efficient epidermal pigmentation. The study demonstrates that PMEL is essential for the normal development of rod-shaped melanosomes in eumelanin-producing melanocytes, but not for the general survival of pigment cells in several tissues.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental methods for dengue vector control. The review included 19 studies that met the eligibility criteria, with 16 contributing data to the meta-analysis. The methods evaluated were container covers with and without insecticides, waste management and clean-up campaigns, and elimination of breeding sites. Study quality was highest for container covers with insecticides, followed by waste management without direct garbage collection and elimination of breeding places.

The meta-analysis showed a weak effect of the interventions on larval populations, with no obvious differences between the results of each individual method. However, container covers without insecticides and waste management with direct garbage collection achieved the strongest reductions in the Breteau index (BI), a measure of mosquito breeding sites. In contrast, container covers with insecticides and elimination of breeding places showed the strongest effects on the pupae per person index (PPI), a measure of mosquito pupae density.

Each of the investigated environmental methods showed some effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, the quality of the studies was a major issue, with most assessed as low or medium quality. The results suggest that environmental interventions can be effective in controlling the immature stages of Aedes sp. mosquitoes, but more comparable high-quality studies are needed to strengthen the evidence.
Researchers have identified small molecules that selectively stall protein synthesis by the ribosome, which could lead to new therapeutic strategies for treating diseases. One such compound, PF-06378503 (PF8503), inhibits the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduces LDL cholesterol in preclinical models. However, the effects of PF8503 on cell physiology and ribosome quality control pathways are not well understood. To investigate this, a genome-wide CRISPRi screen was conducted to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of PF8503. The screen revealed that the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3 bind to the ribosome and protect cells from the toxic effects of PF8503. In contrast, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. Genetic interaction experiments showed that ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2 and functions downstream of HBS1L. These findings provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation and could aid in the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease.
Researchers have discovered a novel mechanism by which the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) promotes widespread destruction of cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) to evade immune detection and block host gene expression. The viral protein SOX is responsible for this phenotype, but its mechanism of action was previously unknown. The study found that SOX stimulates cellular transcriptome turnover through a unique process involving aberrant polyadenylation, where transcripts in SOX-expressing cells exhibit extended poly(A) polymerase II-generated poly(A) tails and polyadenylation-linked mRNA turnover. This process correlates with SOX's RNA turnover function, and inhibiting poly(A) tail formation blocks SOX activity. Nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins are critical cellular cofactors for SOX function, with the latter undergoing striking nuclear relocalization by SOX. The study suggests that SOX-induced mRNA turnover represents a novel mechanism of host shutoff and a new model system to study the regulation of poly(A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells. The findings also reveal a link between polyadenylation and RNA surveillance and turnover, which may have implications for understanding the regulation of gene expression in higher eukaryotes.
Researchers investigated the role of type III interferon (IFNλ) in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They found that these bacteria induce significant production of IFNλ in the lung, which is essential for host defense. Mice lacking the IFNλ receptor (IL-28R) showed improved clearance of bacteria and reduced lung pathology compared to wild-type mice. This was associated with a reduced ratio of pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway. In human epithelial cells, IFNλ inhibited the microRNA miR-21, leading to upregulation of the protein PDCD4, which promotes inflammatory signaling. In vivo, miR-21 was reduced and PDCD4 was increased in the lungs of wild-type mice, but not in IL-28R null mice. Infection of PDCD4 null mice with S. aureus resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production. These findings suggest that IFNλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4 during bacterial pneumonia. The study highlights the conserved role of IFNλ and PDCD4 in the response to airway pathogens, and suggests that inhibiting IL-28R-dependent signaling may reduce lung inflammation and improve bacterial clearance.
A retrospective study was conducted on 781 patients with advanced stage-2 Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) admitted to the National Reference Center for Human African Trypanosomiasis in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1989 and 2012. The study aimed to investigate mortality trends and risk factors associated with the disease. The outcome variable was death, and predictors included age, gender, duration of disease, location of trypanosomes in body fluids, cytorachy, protidorachy, clinical status on admission, and treatment regimen.

The study found that death proportions varied significantly across different treatment regimens: 17.2% in the standard melarsoprol schedule, 12.1% in the short schedule melarsoprol, 5.4% in the first-line eflornithine regimen, 9.1% in the NECT treatment regimen, and 36% in the group treated with eflornithine due to severe clinical status. After adjusting for treatment, the study identified significant predictors of death, including clinical dysfunction on admission, high protidorachy, presence of parasites in the cerebrospinal fluid, and high cytorachy.

A multivariable analysis within treatment groups retained clinical status on admission and high protidorachy as significant predictors of death. The study suggests that the algorithm used for initial clinical status assessment may serve as a basis for developing standardized assessment tools for HAT management and epidemiological reporting. The findings highlight the importance of clinical manifestations in disease severity assessment and the need for an objective test to evaluate HAT clinical severity.
Researchers have developed a new computer vision pipeline to study the effects of isolation on social interaction dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster, a common model organism for studying social behavior. The pipeline uses a novel imaging arena and improved tracking algorithm to follow a large number of flies simultaneously, allowing for the automatic classification of touch and graph-based social network analysis. This enabled the researchers to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation.

The study found that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. The researchers also explored the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and found that while behavior changed throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occurred largely on day one. These changes were mostly in metabolic genes, and the researchers verified the metabolic changes by showing an increase in lipid content in isolated flies.

The results suggest that isolation has a profound impact on social network dynamics, metabolic gene expression, and animal physiology in Drosophila. The study also found that behavioral alterations were long-lasting, while changes in gene expression levels were transient. One of the individual fly parameters that changed early and persistently was walking distance. The findings of this study provide new insights into the effects of isolation on social behavior and highlight the potential of Drosophila as a model organism for studying social behavior and its underlying mechanisms.
A clinical pilot study was conducted in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines. The study aimed to improve adherence to evidence-based guidelines in resource-limited settings. A smartphone-based decision-support tool, including a modality for age-based weight estimation, was developed and evaluated in a district and sub-district hospital during the 2015 cholera season. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period, with a 10-day post-discharge follow-up. A total of 841 patients were enrolled, and the primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for prescriptions of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and zinc.

Results showed that during the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for intravenous fluids decreased at both hospitals, with risk ratios of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. When IV fluids were prescribed, the volume better adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the recommended antibiotic azithromycin increased, while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased. Zinc adherence also increased. These findings demonstrate that a smartphone-based tool can improve guideline adherence. The study identified opportunities to improve clinical care, including better assessment, weight estimation, and fluid/antibiotic selection. The results support the hypothesis that technology-enabled decision-support tools can promote evidence-based practice in resource-limited settings.
Scientists have long struggled to predict how changes in temperature will affect the dynamics of host-parasite interactions, which are crucial for understanding the impact of climate change on disease prevalence and severity. To address this challenge, researchers developed a mathematical model that incorporates the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) to describe the temperature dependencies of host and parasite traits. The model was tested using experimental data from Daphnia magna, a small crustacean, and its natural parasite, Ordospora colligata.

The study found that the MTE-based model effectively predicted host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across a range of temperatures, using fewer parameters than traditional models. The results demonstrate the potential of linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host-parasite framework to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. This approach provides a valuable tool for understanding the impacts of temperature changes on disease, as it allows for the integration of distinct thermal dependencies for various host and parasite traits.

The study's findings suggest that the MTE-based model can be used to estimate the net effect of temperature changes on disease prevalence and severity. The simplicity and generality of this framework make it a promising approach for predicting the outcomes and consequences of infections for hosts and parasites in the face of climate change.
Researchers have investigated the role of GABAergic interneurons in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) in the brain. Specifically, they focused on the interplay between three types of interneurons: parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. These interneurons play a crucial role in controlling the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs, which is essential for neuronal information processing.

The study proposes a functional role for a network motif consisting of PV, SOM, and VIP interneurons, which acts as an amplifier that translates weak inputs onto VIP cells into large changes in the somato-dendritic distribution of inhibition onto PCs. This amplification is achieved through mutual inhibition between SOM and VIP neurons, which allows for switch-like spatial shifts of somato-dendritic inhibition.

The researchers used a computational model to demonstrate that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. They also showed that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled. The study highlights the importance of understanding the functional roles of these interneuron classes and their individual characteristics in controlling different input streams and information processing modes.
Microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS) are used to link specific microbes to host phenotypes, such as disease. However, these studies can produce spurious associations due to indirect effects of microbial interactions. Researchers found that realistic microbial interactions can generate a large number of indirect associations that do not provide mechanistic insight. To address this issue, a method called Direct Association Analysis (DAA) was developed using techniques from statistical physics. This method removes indirect associations and was applied to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The results showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had a higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in IBD. The study suggests that many previously reported associations between microbiota and IBD could be indirect. The researchers estimated the relative contribution of indirect associations to MWAS and showed how to isolate direct from indirect associations. They found that interspecific interactions are strong enough to generate detectable changes in the abundance of many microbes not directly linked to host phenotype. The study highlights the importance of accounting for microbial interactions in MWAS to avoid spurious associations and gain a better understanding of the relationship between microbiota and host phenotypes.
Researchers compared the effectiveness of two Wolbachia infection models, stable and transient, in blocking the replication and transmission of dengue and West Nile viruses in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia is a bacterium that can be introduced into mosquitoes to prevent the spread of diseases such as dengue and Zika. The study found that Wolbachia had a similar blocking effect on both stable and transient models of infection, but the magnitude of the blocking effect was lower in mosquitoes that were transiently infected with Wolbachia. The researchers also found no evidence that Wolbachia enhanced the infection of either dengue or West Nile virus in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This suggests that Wolbachia could be a safe and effective means of restricting the transmission of these viruses. The study used two types of Wolbachia infection models: stable transinfected and transiently infected mosquitoes. Stable transinfected mosquitoes have Wolbachia that is inherited by their offspring, while transiently infected mosquitoes have Wolbachia that is not passed on to their offspring. The researchers found that the density of Wolbachia in transiently infected mosquitoes was lower than in stable infected mosquitoes, which may explain why the blocking effect was less effective in transiently infected mosquitoes. The study provides new insights into the interaction between Wolbachia, its host, and disease-causing pathogens, and has implications for the use of Wolbachia as a tool for controlling the spread of diseases.
Researchers investigated the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the ciliary doublet region and Inversin compartment (InvC) in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that the InvC is conserved and distinct from the doublet region, and that the genes nphp-2, arl-13, klp-11, and unc-119 are redundantly required for ciliogenesis. These genes can be sorted into two modules: nphp-2+klp-11 and arl-13+unc-119, which are antagonized by the hdac-6 deacetylase. The genes in this network modulate the sizes of the NPHP-2 InvC and ARL-13 doublet region. Glutamylation, a tubulin post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting of InvC and doublet region components, but is modulated by nphp-2, arl-13, and unc-119. The ciliary targeting and restricted localization of NPHP-2, ARL-13, and UNC-119 do not require TZ-, doublet region, and InvC-associated genes. NPHP-2 requires its calcium binding EF hand domain for targeting to the InvC. The study concludes that the C. elegans InvC is distinct from the doublet region, and that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization.
Researchers have discovered that the protein Scribble plays a crucial role in the development and regeneration of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). Myelin is a fatty substance that surrounds nerve fibers and facilitates the transmission of electrical signals. Oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for producing myelin in the CNS, undergo significant changes in shape to initiate and form myelin sheaths. The study found that Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes, where it is localized to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths.

Knockdown of Scribble expression in cultured oligodendroglia resulted in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. Similarly, conditional elimination of Scribble in the myelinating glia of transgenic mice disrupted myelin initiation in the CNS, both during development and following focal demyelination. Scribble was also found to negatively regulate myelin thickness and suppress the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase pathway. Furthermore, Scribble localized to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier, where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion.

These findings demonstrate that Scribble is essential for myelination and remyelination in the CNS. The study suggests that Scribble's function is compartmentalized through interactions with different protein complexes at sites of radial or longitudinal growth, and that it plays a critical role in regulating cell signaling and axo-glial adhesion.
A novel peptide haemolysin, Listeriolysin S, has been identified in a subset of Lineage I Listeria monocytogenes strains, which are responsible for the majority of listeriosis outbreaks. Listeriolysin S is a cytotoxic and haemolytic factor that contributes to the virulence of the pathogen, as demonstrated in murine- and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based studies. This discovery expands the family of modified virulence peptides (MVPs) associated with Gram-positive pathogens, which were previously thought to be exclusive to Streptococcus species. The genetic basis for the enhanced virulence of a proportion of Lineage I L. monocytogenes strains may have been revealed through the identification of the Listeriolysin S gene cluster. In silico analysis suggests that similar gene clusters encoding SLS-like factors are present in other notorious Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The biosynthetic enzymes responsible for Listeriolysin S production, SagBCD, function similarly to those involved in the production of microcin B17, a related virulence factor. The identification of Listeriolysin S and its associated gene cluster provides new insights into the pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes and highlights the importance of MVPs in the virulence of Gram-positive pathogens.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the formation of mycetoma granulomas, a type of granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. Mycetoma granulomas are characterized by the presence of macroscopic structures called grains, surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The study aimed to determine the expression levels of IL-17 and MMP-9 in mycetoma lesions and their correlation with the severity of the disease.

The study analyzed surgical biopsies from 100 patients with confirmed mycetoma and found that IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MMP-9 was detected mainly in Zones II and III. MMP-9 expression was higher in biopsies from Actinomadura pelletierii and Streptomyces somaliensis compared to Madurella mycetomatis biopsies. The study also found a direct correlation between IL-17 and MMP-9 expression levels (p = 0.001) and a significant association between MMP-9 levels and disease duration (p < 0.001).

The results suggest that IL-17 and MMP-9 are present in mycetoma granulomas and that their expression levels are correlated with the severity of the disease. However, further studies are needed to determine the roles of IL-17 and MMP-9 in granuloma formation and to provide insights into the immunopathogenesis of mycetoma. The study's findings indicate that IL-17 and MMP-9 may play a role in the formation of mycetoma granulomas, particularly in larger lesions and those with longer disease duration.
Researchers investigated the molecular recognition mechanism of the Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family, specifically the transcriptional activation domain (EAD), which is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). EAD exhibits characteristics of "fuzziness," including polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity, and a dynamic ensemble of disordered bound-state conformations. To understand the physical basis of EAD function, the researchers hypothesized that polycation-π interactions between EAD's aromatic side chains and basic residues on the target play a crucial role in molecular recognition. They evaluated this hypothesis through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, including functional interrogation of EAD variants and coarse-grained modeling. The results support the cation-π model, showing that EAD-target binding is driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts. This mode of molecular recognition is highly versatile and offers a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs. The study provides new insights into the physical basis of EAD function and highlights the importance of cation-π interactions in protein-protein interactions. The findings have implications for understanding the roles of IDPs in various biological processes, including cancer, where ∼70% of proteins implicated are predicted to have significant disordered regions.
Researchers investigated the functions of two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. This study aimed to clarify the roles of these proteases, as previous work had shown that Lon-1 is upregulated in response to blood, while Lon-2 is not. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in their substrate binding domains, suggesting distinct substrate specificities. Recombinant Lon-1 exhibited properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease in vitro, but did not complement an Escherichia coli Lon mutant. In contrast, Lon-2 corrected two characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes. These findings indicate that Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functional roles in B. burgdorferi. Lon-2 appears to function in a manner consistent with the canonical Lon protease, involved in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, on the other hand, may play a role in host adaptation from the arthropod to a warm-blooded host, as it is upregulated in response to blood and is a unique feature of the Borreliae genus. The study suggests that Lon-1 may be important for the remodeling of the spirochete outer surface during the period following a blood meal in the tick.
Researchers investigated the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in preventing human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection. ADP is a mechanism by which antibodies help eliminate pathogens by marking them for destruction by phagocytic cells. The study used a green-fluorescent protein-expressing molecular clone of HIV-1 to measure the ability of HIV-specific antibodies to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes. The results showed that HIV-1 virions were not efficiently phagocytosed by phagocytic cells, even in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. However, HIV-1-decorated cells were targets for phagocytosis or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. The study found that a minimum of a few hundred gp41 molecules on the surface of HIV-1 virions were needed for successful phagocytosis, which is similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses that are readily phagocytosed. The researchers also used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to show a clear association between virus aggregation and ADP. The findings suggest that ADP of virions may not play a significant role in preventing HIV-1 infection, likely due to the paucity of trimers and the inability of virion-bound antibody to cross-link FcγRs on phagocytes. However, ADP or trogocytosis could play a role in clearing HIV-infected cells and cells on the verge of infection.
Hookworm infection, a neglected tropical disease, has a significant global economic and health burden. A computational simulation model estimated that in 2016, hookworm infection resulted in 2,126,280 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) using 2004 disability weight estimates and 4,087,803 DALYs using 2010 disability weight estimates, excluding cognitive impairment outcomes. The total productivity losses ranged from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages and from $2.5 billion to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as a proxy for annual wages.

The economic burden of hookworm infection exceeded published estimates for several diseases that have received more attention, such as rotavirus. The revised Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study for 2010 reported 3,230,800 DALYs annually due to hookworm among all ages in 21 regions, including disability weights for additional hookworm outcomes and stratified by level of anemia.

The study found that certain large countries transitioning to higher income countries, such as Brazil and China, still face considerable hookworm burden. Assuming a median likelihood of anemia, 2004 disability weight estimates, and gross national income per capita, 89,765,729 hookworm infections resulted in productivity losses totaling $11.1 billion using one method, $87.9 billion using another method, and $23.1 billion using a third method.
Researchers investigated the effects of hypoxia on the developing vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) using zebrafish as a model organism. They found that hypoxia disrupts axon pathfinding in the forebrain, leading to errors in commissural axons failing to cross the midline. This disruption is caused by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF1) pathway, which is conserved across species. The researchers identified ephrinB2a as a target of HIF1 pathway activation and showed that knocking down ephrinB2a rescues the guidance errors. EphrinB2a mediates the pathfinding errors through a reverse-signaling mechanism, and the receptor ephA4a is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons. Magnesium sulfate, used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, was found to protect against pathfinding errors by preventing the upregulation of ephrinB2a. These findings demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia and support a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of hypoxic injury to the developing brain and highlights the importance of ephrinB2a in mediating the effects of hypoxia on axon pathfinding.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate pulmonary abnormalities in mice infected with paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a fungal disease of pulmonary origin. The study used high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathological analysis to compare the patterns, topography, and intensity of lung lesions in infected mice. Fifty male BALB/c mice were inoculated with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis conidia, while 50 mice received a placebo. HRCT scans were performed every four weeks to assess pulmonary lesions, lung density, and air structure. Histopathology and histomorphometry were also used to analyze lung tissue.

The study found three distinct patterns of lesions: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tumoral. Lesions were primarily located around the hilus and affected the left lung more frequently. At four weeks post-infection, 80% of infected mice showed peri-bronchial consolidations with increased upper lung density compared to controls. By eight and 12 weeks, consolidation progressed to involve middle lung regions. Histopathology revealed that HRCT-identified consolidations corresponded to confluent granulomatous reactions, while nodules represented individual compact granulomas. By 16 weeks, confluent granulomas formed pseudo-tumoral masses that obstructed large bronchi. Discrete focal fibrosis was visible around granulomas, but only through histopathology.

The study demonstrated that conventional HRCT is a useful tool for evaluating and quantifying pulmonary damage in experimental mouse PCM. This approach reduces the need for sacrificing large numbers of animals and allows for monitoring treatment efficacy through a more rational approach to studying human lung disease.
Researchers investigated the potential of an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γRA) as a marker for latent Leishmania donovani infection. They modified a commercial kit, QuantiFERON, to evaluate five different leishmania-specific antigens: H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12, crude soluble antigen (CSA), and soluble leishmania antigen (SLA). The study included 13 active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients, 15 cured VL patients, 11 non-endemic healthy controls, and 19 healthy endemic controls.

The results showed that the assay based on SLA had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 100% in detecting the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. The study found a positive IFN-γ response to stimulation with leishmania antigen in patients with active VL, which is contradictory to the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The highest positive IFN-γ response was observed with the SLA antigen, with 84.6% of active VL patients showing a positive response.

The study suggests that a whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. Further research is needed to understand the positive IFN-γ response in active VL patients upon stimulation with leishmania antigen. The findings of this study provide a proof of concept for the use of IFN-γRA as a potential marker for latent L. donovani infection.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a bacterium that causes gastrointestinal infections, establishes a persistent infection in the gut. They found that the CNFY toxin, a virulence factor produced by the bacterium, plays a crucial role in inducing inflammation and tissue damage, which ultimately leads to the clearance of the bacteria. However, when the CNFY toxin is suppressed, the bacteria are able to evade the host's immune response and establish a persistent infection. This is achieved through a shift in the balance of immune responses, favoring the induction of immune suppression over inflammation and clearance mechanisms. As a result, the bacteria are able to adopt a commensal lifestyle, where they coexist with the host without causing harm. The study suggests that the CNFY toxin acts as a double-edged sword, promoting inflammation and tissue damage on one hand, but also facilitating the establishment of a persistent infection on the other. The findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and the host immune system, and highlight the importance of the CNFY toxin in determining the outcome of the infection.
Researchers have identified a novel gene, DES1, in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae that plays a crucial role in the fungus's ability to colonize and infect rice plants. The DES1 gene is responsible for suppressing the plant's innate defense responses, allowing the fungus to successfully infect the plant. The gene was identified through the screening of pathogenicity-defective mutants in a T-DNA insertional mutant library. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that DES1 encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties, and its homologs are conserved in filamentous Ascomycetes.

Deletion of the DES1 gene in the fungus resulted in hypersensitivity to oxidative stress and a decrease in the activity and transcription level of extracellular enzymes, including peroxidases and laccases. This led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the plant cells, triggering strong defense responses, including the production of brown granules, autofluorescent materials, and the induction of PR genes in neighboring tissues. The fungus's infectious hyphal extension was significantly reduced, resulting in decreased pathogenicity.

Treatment with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, suppressed the plant's defense responses and allowed the Δdes1 mutant to recover its normal infectious growth. These findings suggest that DES1 functions as a novel pathogenicity gene that regulates the activity of fungal proteins, compromising ROS-mediated plant defense. The discovery of DES1 provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between the rice blast fungus and its host plant.
Researchers evaluated the accuracy of model-based geostatistics (MBG) predictions for Schistosoma haematobium infection in Ghana by comparing them with empiric prevalence values obtained from school surveys at 79 sites. The study found that using the mean predicted values alone, 21 of the 25 empirically determined 'high-risk' schools requiring yearly praziquantel treatment would have been undertreated, and almost 20% of the remaining schools would have been treated despite empirically-determined absence of infection. This would have resulted in 28% of the children in the 79 schools being undertreated and 12% receiving treatment in the absence of any demonstrated need.

The study suggests that using the current predictive map for Ghana as a spatial decision support tool by aggregating prevalence estimates to the district level is not adequate for guiding the national program. However, assessing each school in potentially endemic areas is not feasible. The researchers propose that predictive risk mapping should be an iterative process that incorporates empiric testing and model refining to create updated versions that meet the needs of disease control operational managers.

The study's findings highlight the importance of improving the understanding of the most appropriate way to use predictive risk maps to guide treatment delivery decisions, assessment techniques, and modeling approaches to schistosomiasis. The researchers conclude that model-based stratification of schistosomiasis prevalence according to the continuous spatial predictive risk map for S. haematobium in 2008 had acceptable predictive capacity to distinguish areas of high prevalence, particularly when the mean predictive value for the district was used.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms guiding motile sperm through the female reproductive tract to oocytes in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that oocytes synthesize sperm-guiding F-series prostaglandins from polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) precursors provided in yolk lipoprotein complexes. Using genetics and mass spectrometry, the team partially delineated F-series prostaglandin metabolism pathways. They discovered that omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs, including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, are converted into over 10 structurally related F-series prostaglandins, which function collectively and redundantly to promote sperm guidance. Disruption of omega-3 PUFA synthesis triggers compensatory up-regulation of prostaglandins derived from omega-6 PUFAs. A conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Bietti's Crystalline Dystrophy, negatively regulates prostaglandin synthesis. The results support the model that multiple cyclooxygenase-independent prostaglandins function together to promote sperm motility important for fertilization. This cyclooxygenase-independent pathway for F-series synthesis may be conserved. A heterogeneous mixture of F-series prostaglandins promotes sperm guidance in C. elegans, and prostaglandin synthesis does not involve conventional cyclooxygenase pathways, yet PGF1α and PGF2α stereoisomers are still generated. Conserved enzymes, such as cytochrome P450s, regulate prostaglandin synthesis.
Researchers have developed algorithms to optimize proteins for reduced T cell epitope content and high-level function, aiming to improve deimmunization technologies for biotherapeutics. In silico analysis revealed that there is no single global optimum for protein deimmunization, but rather a spectrum of designs that exhibit tradeoffs between immunogenic potential and molecular function. The leading edge of this design space is the Pareto frontier, which represents the undominated variants that exhibit better performance in both criteria.

Eighteen Pareto optimal variants of a therapeutic enzyme were produced and subjected to experimental analysis of key performance parameters. The combined computational and experimental analysis provided insights into the tradeoffs linking the enzyme's sequence, function, and immunogenic potential. This work outlines a design-based approach to functional deimmunization of biotherapeutic candidates.

The next generation of protein deimmunization tools integrates immunoinformatic epitope prediction with in silico analysis of functional consequences. These technologies enable global protein design and deimmunization on a compressed time scale. The predictions underlying the design process correlated well with experimental analyses of protein function, showing that incremental deletion of T cell epitopes leads to a relative escalation in concomitant loss of function.

The study assessed the practical implications of these predicted tradeoffs by recombinantly producing all 18 designed enzymes and characterizing their stability, activity, and immunoreactivity with human MHC II proteins. The results represent the first systematic and rigorous assessment of the functional penalty for pursuing progressively more deimmunized biotherapeutic candidates. These algorithms may prove useful in augmenting, accelerating, and de-risking experimental deimmunization efforts.
Researchers have discovered that elevated temperatures increase the frequency of meiotic crossovers (COs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of plant. Meiotic COs are essential for proper chromosome segregation during sexual reproduction. The frequency and distribution of COs are influenced by both internal and external factors, with more being known about the internal mechanisms. The study found that increased temperature induces hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis, resulting in more COs than usual. Using genetic analysis with mutants in different recombination pathways, the researchers determined that the extra COs are derived from the Type I interference-sensitive pathway. This pathway is distinct from the Type II pathway, which is insensitive to interference. The study also ruled out the possibility that the increase in COs is due to an increase in DNA double-strand breaks. Instead, the researchers suggest that the hyper-recombinant phenotype is specific to thermal stress rather than a general stress response. The findings provide new insights into how environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination and may have practical applications for plant breeding. The study used a pollen-based visual assay to demonstrate that thermal stress-induced COs are generated by the Type I pathway and act additively with Type II pathway perturbations, resulting in an enhanced hyper-recombination phenotype. The results suggest that temperature-dependent modulation of meiotic CO frequency may be a useful tool for plant breeding without the need for genetic editing or working with mutant backgrounds.
Biomedical researchers face a significant challenge in navigating the vast and rapidly evolving scientific literature, particularly in molecular biomedicine. To address this challenge, a novel computational approach has been developed, which combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. This approach, called the Hanalyzer, extracts information from external resources, tracks knowledge provenance, and enriches the knowledge by noting relationships between genes and calculating a combined reliability score. The Hanalyzer combines the knowledge network with a congruent network constructed from experimental data and visualizes the combined network in a tool that facilitates knowledge-based analysis.

The Hanalyzer was demonstrated on a large-scale gene expression array dataset relevant to craniofacial development, leading to the creation of hypotheses regarding the roles of four genes never previously characterized as involved in craniofacial development. These hypotheses were validated by further experimental work. A Cytoscape plugin, CommonAttributes, was also developed to allow users to trace the provenance of links in the knowledge network and access underlying data sources and publications.

The Hanalyzer can be used to identify functional explanations of a gene list by exploiting inferences not available in individual data sources. It can also be used to create a quantitative network based on experimental data and combine it with the knowledge network in various ways, highlighting linkages in the data that are well supported by existing knowledge or generating novel hypotheses. This approach has the potential to facilitate explanation and hypothesis generation in biomedical research.
Researchers have investigated the surface molecules of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the helminth parasite Fasciola hepatica to understand how they interact with host cells. EVs are small membrane-bound particles released by the parasite that can be internalized by host immune cells, modulating the host's immune response. The study focused on two sub-populations of EVs, termed 15k and 120k EVs, which differ in size and cargo molecules. Using a biotin reagent, the researchers identified 380 surface proteins on these EVs, including virulence factors, membrane transport proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis and trafficking.

Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the 120k EVs originate from the parasite's endosomal system, while the 15k EVs are released from the gastrodermal epithelial cells lining the parasite's gut. A lectin microarray strategy was used to profile the surface oligosaccharides of intact EVs, showing that the 15k and 120k EVs have similar glycoconjugate profiles, distinct from the parasite's surface tegument. The glycoconjugates are predominantly composed of high mannose sugars.

The study found that EVs are resistant to exo- and endo-glycosidases, but treatment with PNGase F, a glyco-amidase, drastically remodeled the surface oligosaccharides and blocked EV uptake by host macrophages. In contrast, pre-treatment with antibodies against specific EV surface proteins significantly enhanced their internalization by host cells. This research highlights the diversity of EV biogenesis and trafficking pathways used by F. hepatica and sheds light on the molecular interaction between parasite EVs and host cells.
Researchers have identified a protein called CDF2 that plays a crucial role in the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plants. miRNAs are small RNA molecules that help control gene expression and are essential for plant development. The study found that CDF2 interacts with an enzyme called Dicer-like 1 (DCL1), which is responsible for processing primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) into mature miRNAs. CDF2 binds to the promoters of certain miRNA genes, acting as a transcription activator or repressor to regulate their expression. Additionally, CDF2 affects the processing of pri-miRNAs by DCL1, further influencing the levels of mature miRNAs. This dual regulation allows CDF2 to precisely control the levels of specific miRNAs, which is essential for proper plant development. The study also found that CDF2 works in the same pathway as two well-studied miRNAs, miR156 and miR172, to control flowering in plants. Furthermore, the research suggests that CDF2 may indirectly regulate miRNA biogenesis by controlling the expression of proteins involved in miRNA processing. The study's findings provide new insights into the complex regulation of miRNAs in plants and highlight the importance of CDF2 in maintaining proper levels of miRNAs to control plant development.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), a metabolic intermediate involved in protein geranylgeranylation, in the establishment of communication between oocytes and granulosa cells in the mouse ovary. This communication is essential for the progression of folliculogenesis, a process that provides ova for reproductive life. The study found that GGPP levels increase in oocytes during early follicular development, and its depletion impairs the proliferation of granulosa cells, primary-secondary follicle transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GGPP depletion inhibits the geranylgeranylation of Rho GTPase and Rab27a, leading to the accumulation of cell junction proteins in the oocyte cytoplasm and the failure to maintain physical connection between oocytes and granulosa cells. Additionally, GGPP depletion blocks the secretion of oocyte materials, such as Gdf9, which is necessary for Smad signaling and granulosa cell proliferation. The study also found that GGPP administration restored the defects in oocyte-granulosa cell contact, granulosa cell proliferation, and primary-secondary follicle transition in mice with Ggpps depletion. These findings suggest that GGPP-mediated protein geranylgeranylation plays a critical role in establishing oocyte-granulosa cell communication and regulating primary-secondary follicle transition, a key phase of folliculogenesis essential for female reproductive function.
Researchers have developed a structural model of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation complex with a complete transcription bubble to better understand how nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates enter the active site of the enzyme. The transcription bubble is a crucial region where DNA is unwound, allowing NTPs to bind and be incorporated into the growing RNA strand. However, the conformation of the unpaired non-template DNA part of the transcription bubble has been unknown, making it difficult to determine the NTP entry routes.

Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and structural analysis, the researchers found that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription. Although both the secondary and main channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Further analysis revealed that the diffusion of NTP through the main channel is disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand.

The researchers built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble by extending the DNA and nascent mRNA strands to 47 and 18 nucleotides in length, respectively. The model was equilibrated after 15 nanoseconds in MD simulations, and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values of Cα atoms reached 3 angstroms. The study provides new insights into the structural basis of Pol II transcription and suggests that the secondary channel is the primary route for NTP entry.
A recent study assessed the degree of underrecognition of dengue disease burden in Thailand and Cambodia using laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases from prospective cohort studies. The study aimed to estimate the magnitude of dengue underrecognition and provide more accurate disease burden estimates for these countries. Cohort studies were conducted among children under 15 years old in two provinces in Thailand and one province in Cambodia over at least two dengue seasons. The results showed that the average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed dengue was 23/1,000 in Thailand and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Age-group specific multiplication factors (MFs) were calculated by comparing cohort study data to national surveillance data and ranged from 0.4 to 29. These MFs were then applied to country-level reporting data, indicating that in Thailand, a median 229,886 dengue cases occurred annually during 2003-2007, and in Cambodia, a median 111,178 cases occurred in children under 15 years old. The study found that average underrecognition of total and inpatient dengue cases was 8.7 and 2.6-fold in Thailand, and 9.1 and 1.4-fold in Cambodia, respectively. The results suggest that national surveillance data significantly underrecognize the true burden of dengue disease. The study highlights the need for more accurate disease burden estimates to guide public health interventions. Calculating MFs by comparing prospective cohort study data to locally-reported national surveillance data is a useful approach to assess disease burden.
This study investigated the role of natural killer ( NK ) cells in promoting early CD8 T cell responses against cytomegalovirus ( MCMV ) infection. Researchers used congenic or mutant mice and wild-type versus genetically engineered viruses to examine the consequences of specific defects in NK cell function on antiviral CD8 T cell responses. The results showed that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against MCMV infection in vivo by limiting interferon-alpha/beta ( IFN-α/β ) production to non-immunosuppressive levels. This is achieved through early control of MCMV replication, which reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) for cytokine production and preserves conventional dendritic cells ( cDCs ). As a result, antiviral CD8 T cell responses are accelerated. Conversely, exogenous IFN-α administration in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation. The study demonstrates that NK cells play a critical role in balancing the intensity of innate immune responses, preventing early immunopathology, and promoting optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. The findings suggest that NK cells serve not only as effector lymphocytes but also as regulators of immune system function in defenses against viral infections. Overall, the study provides new insights into the contributions of NK cells to immunity against infectious disease.
Researchers investigated the role of the nucleolin protein in regulating the expression of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant. They found that the nucleolin protein, encoded by the AtNUC-L1 gene, plays a crucial role in controlling the expression of specific sets of rRNA genes. The researchers identified four major rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis thaliana and found that the nucleolin protein affects the transcription of these genes. In plants with a disrupted AtNUC-L1 gene, the transcription of one rRNA variant is induced, while the others are repressed or remain unaltered. Notably, the most highly represented rRNA gene variant, which is normally inactive in wild-type plants, is reactivated in AtNUC-L1 mutants. The researchers also found that the disruption of the AtNUC-L1 gene leads to a loss of symmetrical DNA methylation at rRNA genes without affecting histone epigenetic marks. This suggests that the nucleolin protein plays a key role in controlling active and repressed rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis thaliana. The study reveals a novel mechanism for rRNA gene transcriptional regulation and highlights the importance of the nucleolin protein in this process.
Researchers have identified a key interaction between the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) proteins UL29/28 and components of the NuRD complex, which plays a crucial role in regulating HCMV gene expression. The NuRD complex, also known as the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase protein complex, is involved in histone deacetylation, a process that affects chromatin structure and gene expression. The study used a method called rapid immunoisolation of an epitope-tagged protein coupled with mass spectrometry to identify proteins that interact with HDAC1, a component of the NuRD complex. The results showed that the HCMV proteins UL29/28 and UL38 interact with HDAC1 and other components of the NuRD complex, including MTA2.

Knockdown of the RBBP4 and CHD4 constituents of the NuRD complex inhibited the accumulation of HCMV immediate-early RNA and viral DNA, suggesting that multiple components of the NuRD complex are necessary for efficient HCMV replication. The study also found that transient expression of UL29/28 enhanced the activity of the HCMV major immediate-early promoter in a reporter assay, and that this effect required functional NuRD components. The researchers propose that UL29/28 modifies the NuRD complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediate-early RNAs, which are essential for HCMV replication.
Researchers studied the immune response to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in young children to better understand how the body develops antibodies to fight the virus. They used a technique called whole-genome-phage-display libraries (GFPDL) to analyze the antibody repertoire in infants before and after primary RSV infection. The study found that the antibody response to the RSV fusion protein (F) showed modest changes after infection, while the response to the attachment protein (G) increased significantly, with a 100-fold increase in bound phages. The G-reactive epitopes were found to span the N- and C-terminus of the G ectodomain, as well as the central conserved domain (CCD).

The researchers also synthesized panels of F and G antigenic sites to evaluate sera from young children, adolescents, and adults. They found a steady increase in RSV-F epitope repertoires from young children to adults, with several novel epitopes identified in pre-fusion F and an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27. The study also showed that antibody binding to pre-fusion F was 2-3 folds higher than to post-fusion form. In contrast, antibody responses to RSV-G were high following early RSV infection in children, but declined significantly in adults.

The findings suggest that the immune response to RSV evolves differently for the F and G proteins, with the G protein showing a significant increase in antibody response after infection. This study provides valuable insights into the immune response to RSV and could inform the development of effective countermeasures, including vaccines.
Researchers investigated the mode of action of emodepside, a veterinary anthelmintic, against adult Brugia malayi, a parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis. They found that emodepside potently inhibits the motility of adult Brugia malayi by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. The study suggests that emodepside targets the SLO-1 K channel, a type of potassium channel found in nematodes. By expressing different isoforms of the slo-1 gene in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the researchers discovered that the slo-1f isoform, found in male muscles, is more sensitive to emodepside than the slo-1a isoform found in female muscles. Selective RNAi knockdown of the slo-1a isoform in female worms increased the potency of emodepside. In silico modeling identified a binding pocket in the RCK1 region of the SLO-1 channel that is affected by alternative splicing, which may explain the sex-dependent effects of emodepside. The study suggests that emodepside has potent macrofilaricidal effects and that alternative splicing in the RCK1 binding pocket affects its potency. The findings have implications for the development of emodepside as a macrofilaricide and highlight the importance of evaluating potential sex-dependent effects of anthelmintic compounds to prevent under-dosing of one or the other gender of nematodes.
The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis relies on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to determine where annual mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis (LF) is required and when it can be stopped. However, cross-reactivity with Loa loa antigens has hindered LF elimination in loiasis-endemic areas. Researchers used the DH6.5 antibody to immunoaffinity purify Loa loa antigens from the sera of individuals with a positive RDT due to loiasis. Immunoblot analysis revealed many circulating AD12/DH6.5-reactive antigens, and proteomic analysis identified multiple L. loa proteins in LF RDT-positive loiasis sera, including secreted and somatic proteins. These proteins may be released by dying L. loa adult worms and/or microfilariae. Unlike the single high molecular weight W. bancrofti circulating filarial antigen present in the blood of persons with bancroftian filariasis, reactive L. loa antigens appeared to be only transiently present in the blood of a subset of persons with loiasis. These differences can be used to differentiate positive results generated by both species and may lead to improved diagnostic tests for LF and loiasis. The study suggests that the most likely mechanism for loiasis cross-reactivity with W. bancrofti RDTs is the death of L. loa Mf and/or adult worms associated with the release of multiple AD12 glycoproteins into circulation.
Researchers have identified a novel ciliary GTPase, RAB-28, associated with the BBSome and intraflagellar transport (IFT) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Primary cilia are specialized sensory and developmental signaling devices found on most eukaryotic cells, and defects in these organelles cause inherited disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, the researchers employed C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs during late embryogenesis. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, they discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161, CCDC-104, and RPI-1. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, they uncovered orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analysis of C. elegans RAB-28 revealed that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons, where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. The researchers found that inactive GDP-bound RAB-28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localization, while GTP-bound RAB-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses revealed that overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB-28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. These findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins and unveil RAB28 as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents the outside world using neural responses from cells with unknown receptive fields. They used hippocampal place cells as a model system and found that simply knowing which groups of cells fire together can reveal a surprising amount of structure in the underlying stimulus space. This information can be used to extract global features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of physical space, allowing the animal's position to be tracked.

The study showed that global topological features of a two-dimensional environment and an accurate geometric reconstruction of physical space can be inferred from spikes alone, without knowing the actual place fields or any other prior independent measurements of position. This is in contrast to previous approaches that required knowing the corresponding place fields to reconstruct position.

The researchers demonstrated that a great deal of information about a physical environment can be obtained using only coarse features of population spiking activity. This suggests that the brain may be able to construct its own internal representations of the world based on neural responses, without needing independent access to external stimuli. The findings have implications for understanding how the brain represents and navigates its environment.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β in the development of viral fulminant hepatitis (FH), a severe liver disease caused by excessive inflammation. They used a mouse model infected with the murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) to study the disease. The study found that mice deficient in the IL-1β receptor (IL-1R1-/-) or treated with an IL-1β antagonist (IL-1Ra) showed reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality compared to wild-type mice. This suggests that IL-1β plays a key role in the pathogenesis of viral FH.

The researchers also found that the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by infected macrophages, is essential for IL-1β production during viral infection. Mice deficient in NLRP3 or caspase-1, a component of the inflammasome complex, showed reduced IL-1β induction and ameliorated hepatitis. Furthermore, the administration of IL-1β in mice deficient in the NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox was able to reinstate disease severity, indicating that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis is critical in the pathogenesis of viral FH.

The study suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production is a primary inflammatory signaling pathway that plays a double-edged role in the host immune system. While it is essential for mounting conventional immunity against pathogens, it can also contribute to excessive inflammation and tissue damage in the liver during viral infection. The findings of this study provide new insights into the pathogenesis of viral FH and may lead to the development of efficient treatments for this severe disease.
Researchers conducted a study in Malawi to investigate the relationship between hookworm infections and severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. Using a new diagnostic tool called multiplex real-time PCR, they analyzed fecal samples from 830 children to determine the prevalence of two types of hookworms, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. The results showed that 34.1% of severely anemic children had hookworm infections, compared to 27.0% of non-severely anemic children. The prevalence of A. duodenale was significantly higher than N. americanus, at 26.1% and 4.9%, respectively.

The study found that moderate and high-load A. duodenale infections were strongly associated with severe anemia, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.49 and 9.04, respectively. Additionally, the intensity of A. duodenale infection was positively associated with iron deficiency, with adjusted odds ratios of 3.63, 16.98, and 44.91 for low, moderate, and high-load infections, respectively. These findings suggest that A. duodenale is a key factor in the etiology of severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children in Malawi.

The study highlights the need for quantitative and species-specific screening of hookworm infections to combat severe anemia and iron deficiency in children living in resource-poor settings. The use of multiplex real-time PCR is a powerful diagnostic tool for public health research in this area.
Researchers have identified COM-1, a crucial regulator of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice during Caenorhabditis elegans gametogenesis. COM-1 promotes homologous recombination (HR) by counteracting the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) complex Ku. In the absence of COM-1, germ cells repair meiotic DSBs via the error-prone NHEJ pathway, resulting in a lack of interhomolog crossovers (COs), extensive chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality. COM-1 is not required for Spo11 removal and initiation of meiotic DSB repair, but rather acts to prevent NHEJ activity in meiotic cells. This is in contrast to its yeast counterparts, which are required for Spo11 removal and initiation of meiotic DSB repair. The study found that animals defective for both COM-1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation, suggesting that COM-1's role is to counteract Ku's activity. COM-1 acts parallel to the nuclease EXO-1 to promote interhomolog HR at the early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, safeguarding timely CO formation. Both COM-1 and EXO-1 are dispensable for RAD-51 recruitment at the late pachytene stage, indicating further redundancy and/or temporal regulation of DNA end resection during meiotic prophase. The study highlights the potentially lethal properties of NHEJ during meiosis and identifies a critical role for COM-1 in NHEJ inhibition and CO assurance in germ cells.
Researchers used a goat model to study the immune response to Burkholderia pseudomallei, the bacterium that causes melioidosis, a disease that can lead to pneumonia and sepsis in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. The study aimed to identify immunogenic proteins that could be used to develop new diagnostic tests and vaccines. Outbred goats were infected with B. pseudomallei through aerosol inhalation, mimicking the natural route of infection in humans. The researchers analyzed the goats' humoral immune response, which involves the production of antibodies, using ELISA and western blot tests.

The results showed that the goats developed a strong humoral response, with a greater number of IgG antibodies compared to IgM antibodies. The researchers identified several immunogenic proteins, including chaperone proteins GroEL, EF-Tu, and DnaK, which were detected in all serum samples after infection. GroEL was found to be the most immunogenic protein, eliciting the strongest antibody response. The study also compared the immune response in goats to human melioidosis patients and found that many antigens elicited a comparable antibody response.

The researchers used 2D electrophoresis and western blot analyses to characterize the IgG and IgM antibody responses in individual goats. They developed ELISA assays to quantify the antibody concentration to the whole cell lysate and individual proteins. The results showed that the goats' immune response was complex and involved multiple antigens, similar to human melioidosis. The study suggests that the goat model can be used to identify immunogenic proteins that could be used to develop new diagnostic tests and vaccines for melioidosis.
Cyclin B1-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) plays a crucial role in initiating mitotic entry by activating a positive feedback loop at the end of the G2 phase. However, the kinetics of Cdk1 activation during mitosis have been poorly understood. Researchers used a novel approach to study the temporal development of cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity in single cells. They found that cyclin B1-Cdk1 continues to be activated after centrosome separation and that cytoplasmic cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity can be maintained even when cyclin B1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase.

The study revealed that cyclin B1-Cdk1 levels required to enter mitosis are lower than the amount needed for mitotic progression. The researchers propose that gradually increasing cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity after centrosome separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression. The findings indicate that distinct thresholds for cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity exist that control successive mitotic events. The study used novel assays to determine how cytoplasmic cyclin B1-Cdk1 activation proceeds in human cells and found that cyclin B1-Cdk1 is activated in late G2 and gradually increases between centrosome separation and prometaphase.

The researchers also investigated the effect of partially reducing Cdk1 levels on mitotic progression and found that a threshold concentration is reached that autocatalyzes rapid further activation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 and triggers entry into mitosis. The study suggests that the gradual activation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 during early mitosis and the passage of distinct thresholds critically assist in coordinating early and late mitotic events.
Researchers investigated the neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses in 21 Kenyan women who were superinfected with HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D after a median time of 1.07 years following initial infection. The study aimed to determine whether superinfection (SI) leads to a dominant Nab response to specific epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope, such as the CD4-binding site, a V1/V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41. These epitopes are known to be targeted by broad and potent Nab responses in singly infected individuals.

Using standard epitope mapping techniques and computational analyses, the researchers found that superinfection did not induce a dominant Nab response to any of these epitopes in the 21 women. In fact, 20 of the 21 superinfected women's Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. This suggests that superinfection with diverse subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response.

The study's findings are consistent with a model in which SI with diverse subtypes drives the development of a diverse repertoire of Nabs. This has implications for the design of HIV-1 vaccines, which may benefit from using multivalent immunogens to elicit a broad and potent Nab response. The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of Nab responses in HIV-1 superinfection and highlight the importance of targeting multiple epitopes to achieve broad protection against diverse HIV-1 subtypes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide. Research has shown that HCMV dysregulates the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are essential for fetal brain development. The transcriptional regulator Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes1) is a critical downstream effector of Notch signaling and plays a key role in governing NPC fate and fetal brain development.

This study found that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels in infected NPCs. The HCMV 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) is involved in Hes1 degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting Hes1 ubiquitination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes1. The study also identified Sp100A, an important component of PML nuclear bodies, as another target of IE1-mediated ubiquitination.

A C-terminal acidic region in IE1, spanning amino acids 451 to 475, is required for IE1/Hes1 physical interaction and IE1-mediated Hes1 ubiquitination, but is dispensable for IE1/Sp100A interaction and ubiquitination. The study suggests a novel mechanism linking downregulation of Hes1 protein to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by HCMV infection and identifies IE1 as the first potential HCMV-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase.
A recent study investigated the relationship between transcription factor binding and gene expression in Drosophila embryos across four species: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. The researchers analyzed genome-wide binding of four transcription factors involved in early anterior-posterior patterning using ChIP-seq and compared it to gene expression levels measured by mRNA-seq. The study found that gene expression levels are more conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and changes in gene expression are not well-explained by changes in adjacent transcription factor binding. However, highly bound sites, sites bound by multiple factors, and sites near genes are more conserved than other binding sites, suggesting that a significant portion of transcription factor binding is weak or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection.

The study also found that transcription factor binding has diverged extensively within the Drosophila genus, with relatively few regions bound by any factor in all four species. The researchers identified two potential genetic sources of binding divergence, including alterations of specific motifs for the transcription factors BCD, HB, GT, and KR. Additionally, the study found that mRNA levels are highly correlated between species, with the correlation decaying with phylogenetic distance. Overall, the study suggests that transcription factor binding has diverged significantly in Drosophila embryos, with little effect on downstream gene expression.
A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centers in Thanjavur district, India, to assess the effectiveness of eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination. The study aimed to evaluate the monitoring and evaluation guidelines of the program, which require impact assessments in sentinel and spot-check sites to determine if MDA can be stopped. The study covered over 70% of the 50,363 population and found a microfilaria (Mf) prevalence of 0.2% and intensity of 0.004 per 60µl blood, and antigenaemia (Ag) prevalence of 2.3% and intensity of 17.3 Ag-units. Although Mf levels were below 1% and Ag levels were below 2% in children, the study identified 7 "residual" and 17 "transmission" hotspots, where Mf prevalence was ≥1% and at least one Ag-positive child was born during the MDA period. The study found that antigenaemic persons were clustered both at household and site levels, indicating the need for developing good surveillance strategies for detecting hotspots and adopting evidence-based sampling strategies. The study suggests that an Ag-prevalence of 1% in children may be a possible threshold value for stopping MDA. The findings highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent the emergence of hotspots and site-specific interventions to effectively eliminate them when they persist or appear.
A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the community-effectiveness of temephos, an organophosphate larvicide, in controlling dengue vectors and dengue transmission when used as a single intervention or in combination with other interventions. The review included 27 studies, 11 of which evaluated temephos as a single intervention and 16 as part of a combination of interventions. The results showed that temephos was effective in reducing entomological indices, such as the number of mosquito larvae and pupae, when used alone. However, when used in combination with other interventions, temephos was not consistently effective in reducing entomological indices, and in some cases, its effectiveness was not sustained over time.

The community-effectiveness of temephos was found to be influenced by various factors, including the quality of delivery, water turnover rate, type of water, and environmental factors such as organic debris, temperature, and exposure to sunlight. Additionally, the timing of temephos deployment, the need for reapplication, and behavioral factors, such as the reluctance to apply temephos to drinking water, were identified as limitations. There was no evidence to suggest that temephos use is associated with reductions in dengue transmission. The review highlights that while temephos is widely used for dengue vector control, its effectiveness can vary greatly, and more research is needed to understand its impact on dengue transmission. The lack of data relating reductions in entomological indices to reductions in dengue transmission remains a significant knowledge gap in the area of dengue epidemiology and vector control efficacy.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex and the replication fork-associated factor, Csm3, in establishing cohesion at the pericentromere in budding yeast. The pericentromere is the region surrounding the centromere, where sister chromatids are held together by the cohesin complex. The study found that the Ctf19 complex and Csm3 are both important for pericentromeric cohesion, but they act through distinct mechanisms. Components of the Ctf19 complex direct the increased association of cohesin with the pericentromere, while Csm3 is essential for ensuring the functionality of cohesin in holding sister centromeres together. Cells lacking Csm3 show additive cohesion defects when combined with mutants in the Ctf19 complex. The study also found that delaying DNA replication rescues the cohesion defect observed in cells lacking Ctf19 complex components, but not Csm3. The researchers propose that the Ctf19 complex ensures additional loading of cohesin at centromeres prior to passage of the replication fork, thereby ensuring its incorporation into functional linkages through a process requiring Csm3. The Ctf19 complex and Csm3 are highly conserved, suggesting that a similar mechanism of kinetochore-driven cohesion establishment may operate in other organisms.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the changes in the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult patients with primary dengue infection. The study analyzed serum samples from 44 patients at three stages of infection: early febrile, defervescence, and convalescence. Using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the researchers identified 60 differential metabolites, including free fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. These metabolites were found to be involved in various metabolic pathways, including fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism, and steroid hormone pathway.

The study revealed that the metabolome and lipidome changes were temporally distinct and coincided with the different stages of infection. The researchers found that certain metabolites, such as phospholipids and sphingolipids, were significantly perturbed during the early stages of infection and normalized to control levels at the convalescent stage. These findings suggest that these metabolites may serve as potential prognostic markers for dengue infection.

The study also showed that dengue infection causes changes in the serum metabolome and lipidome that are involved in acute inflammatory responses. The researchers found that early anti-inflammatory responses work in concert to modulate early pro-inflammatory processes, preventing the host from developing pathologies due to excessive or prolonged inflammation. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the host-pathogen interactions in dengue infection and offers insights into the underlying mechanisms of symptom manifestation. The findings may also have implications for monitoring disease progression and evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
Researchers conducted a study to map and analyze global Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) research with an affiliation to Germany using co-authorship networks. They analyzed bibliometric data from published research between 2002 and 2012, focusing on kinetoplastid and helminth diseases. The study identified 1,187 publications with at least one German author affiliation, representing 4.4% of all NTD publications worldwide. From these, 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions were extracted to construct co-author networks.

The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil, while collaborations with African countries were scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions, with strong performers identified on an individual level using classic and social network analysis parameters. The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases.

The study found that the share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research, highlighting the need to identify barriers and expand Germany's research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, which were less involved in collaborations than high-income countries. The study's findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions.
Haiti's Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) program has made significant progress in controlling lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) since 2000. A strong mass drug administration (MDA) program, led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population and its international partners, achieved 100% geographical coverage in 2012, exceeding the epidemiological targets of 65% for LF and 75% for STH. The program's success can be attributed to several key elements, including community awareness through a multi-channel communication and education campaign, community trust in voluntary drug distributors, directly observed treatment, easy access to treatment posts, and quality data collection. These strategies have resulted in a significant reduction in the burden of infection, with 45 communes reaching the target threshold for stopping treatment for LF. The program has also established a strong foundation for ongoing STH control. By leveraging sustained international support, Haiti's MDA campaign has made steady progress toward LF elimination. The program's success has not only contributed to the global portfolio of best practices for NTD control but also addresses future challenges, such as maintaining control of STH infections after the community-based LF treatment platform ceases and ensuring morbidity management for patients with lymphatic filarial disease. The program's focus is now shifting to morbidity control efforts for LF, including hydrocele surgery and lymphedema patient support groups.
Researchers investigated the role of the master regulator CtrA in controlling the cell cycle of Sinorhizobium meliloti, an alphaproteobacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with specific legume hosts. In this symbiosis, S. meliloti undergoes significant cellular differentiation, resulting in genome amplification, cell branching, and loss of reproductive capacity. The researchers found that depletion of CtrA leads to cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to what is observed in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. They also discovered that the cell cycle-regulated proteolytic degradation of CtrA is essential in S. meliloti, suggesting a possible mechanism for CtrA depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Using a combination of ChIP-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis, the researchers identified that S. meliloti CtrA regulates different target genes compared to C. crescentus CtrA. Specifically, S. meliloti CtrA negatively regulates the septum-inhibiting Min system, unlike C. crescentus CtrA, which controls the expression of the Fts complex to regulate cell division. These findings provide valuable insights into how highly conserved genetic networks can evolve to fit the diverse lifestyles of different bacteria. The study's model of CtrA cell cycle regulation in S. meliloti will be crucial for understanding how the bacterial cell cycle is modulated by plant factors during the symbiosis.
Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, a zoonotic disease. The bacterium's ability to multiply and survive within macrophages is crucial for its virulence. Researchers have identified a gene, FTL_0766, which encodes a putative γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in F. tularensis. A mutant strain with a disrupted GGT gene showed impaired intracellular multiplication and reduced virulence in mice.

Further investigation revealed that the GGT activity of F. tularensis allows the bacterium to utilize glutathione (GSH) and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as sources of cysteine, an essential nutrient for intracellular growth. GSH is the most abundant source of cysteine in the host cytosol, and the bacterium's ability to utilize it as a cysteine source is a key adaptation for intracellular multiplication.

Studies demonstrated that the F. tularensis GGT can cleave the γ-glutamyl-cysteine bond in γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide and GSH, releasing free cysteine. This process is essential for the bacterium's growth, as the ggt mutant, unable to cleave the γ-glutamyl-cysteine bond, requires the addition of free cysteine to compensate for its enzymatic deficiency. The results show that F. tularensis uses GSH and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as primary sources of cysteine, highlighting the importance of this nutrient acquisition system for the bacterium's intracellular multiplication and virulence.
Researchers investigated the fusion of Parasitophorous Vacuoles (PVs) between Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major, two species of protozoan parasites that infect mammalian host cells. They found that PVs containing Leishmania major promastigotes fused with pre-established PVs of Leishmania amazonensis, but PVs containing Leishmania major amastigotes did not fuse with those of Leishmania amazonensis. In the fused PVs, Leishmania major promastigotes remained motile and multiplied, but did not differentiate into amastigotes. In contrast, Leishmania major promastigotes that remained in their own, unfused PVs differentiated into proliferating amastigotes. The study suggests that PVs, which are acidic organelles containing lysosomal enzymes, differ in their ability to fuse with PVs of other Leishmania species. Additionally, the study found that a species-specific PV is required for Leishmania major promastigotes to differentiate into amastigotes. The results have implications for understanding the interactions between PVs of different Leishmania species and the mechanisms involved in the recognition and fusion of PVs.
Researchers have made a significant breakthrough in HIV-1 vaccine development by discovering that native, membrane-expressed HIV-1 Env trimers can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target quaternary epitopes involving glycan-deficient patches proximal to the CD4 binding site. In a study, two out of eight rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing trimers and one out of 20 rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost, developed unusually potent nAb titers. These nAbs neutralized tier 2 HIV-1 isolates by exploiting natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the second conserved region of gp120. Specifically, the trimer VLP sera took advantage of the absence of a glycan at residue 197, while the DNA trimer serum targeted the absence of a glycan at residue 230, both of which are proximal to the CD4 binding site. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that one of the trimer VLP sera shared features with the monoclonal antibody PG9, consistent with its trimer-dependency. These findings provide new insights into the development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine and suggest that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes. The study also shows that cross-neutralization can occur in the absence of protecting glycan, which may inform the future development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine.
Researchers investigated the healing process of Buruli ulcers (BU) in patients treated with a combination of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin. The study aimed to identify markers that could be used to monitor wound healing progression. Tissue samples from eight BU patients with plaque lesions were collected before, during, and after chemotherapy and analyzed using immunohistochemistry for the presence of proteins associated with connective tissue neo-formation, tissue remodeling, and epidermal activation. The results showed that several target proteins were suitable for monitoring wound healing, including α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) positive myofibroblasts, which emerged during the healing process and produced extracellular matrix proteins such as pro-collagen 1 and tenascin. The study also found that many cells, including myofibroblasts, showed ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, a marker for translation initiation, indicating an activated phenotype. Additionally, healing wounds revealed dermal tissue remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 expression in the epidermis. The researchers identified a set of markers, including αSMA, fibronectin, pro-collagen 1, tenascin-C, and CK16, that can be used to monitor wound healing in BU lesions. The study suggests that the mTor pathway may play an important role in wound healing in BU, and further research is needed to investigate its role in discriminating between healing and non-healing wounds.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between impulse conduction and mitochondrial trafficking in adult mammalian peripheral nerves in vivo. Mitochondria play a crucial role in meeting the high energy demands of neurons, particularly in areas far from the cell body. To study this relationship, the researchers used confocal imaging to observe mitochondrial movement and distribution in saphenous nerves of anaesthetized mice. They found that low-frequency electrical stimulation increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic compared to silent axons. However, higher frequency conduction (50 Hz) significantly increased anterograde, but not retrograde, mitochondrial traffic by rapidly increasing the number of mobile mitochondria and gradually increasing their velocity. Topical application of capsaicin to the skin innervated by the saphenous nerve also increased mitochondrial traffic in both myelinated and unmyelinated axons. The researchers observed that stationary mitochondria in axons conducting at higher frequency became shorter, suggesting that they may be broken down to supply additional mitochondria to the trafficking population. Mitochondria recruited to the mobile population did not accumulate near Nodes of Ranvier, but continued to travel anterogradely. These findings suggest that the peripheral terminals of sensory axons represent sites of high metabolic demand during physiological high-frequency conduction, and that increased anterograde mitochondrial traffic may ensure a uniform increase in mitochondrial density along the length of axons during high impulse load.
Researchers investigated the role of Filamin B (FLNB) in the development of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions. They found that mice lacking FLNB exhibit rapid and progressive degeneration of intervertebral discs (IVDs) due to abnormal cell fate changes in the annulus fibrosus (AF). Specifically, AF cells in FLNB-deficient mice lose their fibroblast-like characteristics and acquire the molecular and phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocytes, leading to endochondral-like ossification. This process is marked by changes in collagen matrix, expression of Collagen X, increased apoptosis, and inappropriate ossification of disc tissue.

The researchers discovered that the conversion of AF cells into chondrocytes is associated with upregulated TGFβ signaling via Smad2/3 and BMP-induced p38 signaling, as well as sustained activation of canonical and non-canonical target genes p21 and Ctgf. These findings suggest that FLNB is involved in attenuating TGFβ/BMP signaling and influencing AF cell fate. Furthermore, the IVD disruptions in FLNB-deficient mice resemble those seen in aging degenerative discs, providing new insights into the molecular causes of vertebral fusions and disc degeneration. The study demonstrates that loss of FLNB leads to increased TGFβ and BMP signaling, which initiates a cascade of cell fate changes, including differentiation, IVD degeneration, and bony fusions.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism by which the Thogoto virus (THOV) targets the host's antiviral response. The virus achieves this by interacting with a general transcription factor called TFIIB, which is essential for the recruitment of the polymerase complex to promoter start sites. This interaction leads to the depletion of TFIIB in the nucleus, impairing the de novo recruitment of the polymerase complex to certain genes. As a result, the expression of a limited number of genes is altered, including those involved in the innate immune response.

The study found that TFIIB is critical for the expression of genes that require de novo recruitment of the polymerase complex, such as inflammatory cytokines and antiviral effector molecules. In contrast, genes that already have the polymerase complex loaded onto their promoters can still be transcribed even if TFIIB is depleted or sequestered by the virus. This selective targeting of TFIIB allows the virus to modulate the host's immune response while minimizing its impact on other cellular processes.

The researchers suggest that targeting TFIIB may be a favorable site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation. By inhibiting TFIIB activity, it may be possible to modulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral effector molecules without affecting general gene expression or cellular homeostasis. This could have implications for the development of new treatments for viral infections and inflammatory diseases.
Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection of primary human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) leads to cell cycle arrest at both late S-phase and G2-phase, characterized by 4N DNA content. The virus induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral DNA replication, but this response is not necessary for cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. A putative C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD2) within the NS1 protein is responsible for G2-phase arrest. The NS1 TAD2 domain activates the ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) protein, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25C at serine 216. This phosphorylation inactivates the cyclin B/CDK1 complex, leading to cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. The ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway is activated during B19V infection of EPCs, and ATR activation plays a crucial role in B19V infection-induced G2-phase arrest. The NS1 TAD2 domain is essential for the dysregulation of the cell cycle, and its expression alone is sufficient to induce G2-phase arrest in UT7/Epo-S1 cells. The results suggest that B19V NS1-induced G2-phase arrest is mediated by the TAD2 domain and the ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a range of diseases, from mild to life-threatening, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. Research has shown that the virus's nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) plays a key role in inducing endothelial hyperpermeability. A recent study investigated the mechanisms behind NS1-induced vascular leak and found that it is independent of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8. The study used a mouse model and human pulmonary endothelial cells to demonstrate that NS1 disrupts the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer, leading to vascular leak. The researchers also found that blocking inflammatory cytokines did not affect NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Furthermore, the study showed that NS1-induced vascular leak occurred in mice deficient in TLR4 or TNF-α receptors, suggesting that these pathways are not involved. However, using inhibitors targeting molecules involved in glycocalyx disruption, the researchers were able to block NS1-induced vascular leak in vivo. These findings indicate that DENV NS1-induced endothelial cell-intrinsic vascular leak is dependent on endothelial glycocalyx components. The study's results suggest potential targets for novel therapeutics that inhibit enzymes contributing to glycocalyx degradation, which could be used to treat severe dengue disease. Overall, the study highlights the critical role of NS1 in dengue pathogenesis and the importance of the endothelial glycocalyx in vascular leak.
In budding yeast, the integrity of the septin ring at the bud neck is crucial for cytokinesis, proper spindle positioning, and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC). The SPOC delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis if the anaphase spindle does not properly align with the division axis. The Kin4 protein kinase and the Kin4-regulating Elm1 kinase are essential for SPOC signaling. This study found that the redundant ubiquitin-ligases Dma1 and Dma2 control septin dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck. In cells lacking Dma1 and Dma2 (dma1Δ dma2Δ), Elm1 levels at the bud neck were reduced, and Elm1-dependent activation of Kin4 was impaired. Artificial recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck in these cells restored a normal septin ring, proper spindle positioning, and a proficient SPOC response. This suggests that septin dynamics and SPOC function are intimately linked. The study proposes a model where Dma1 and Dma2 regulate both septin ring dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck. Elm1 activity stabilizes the septin ring and activates Kin4 through phosphorylation, while the PP2ARts1 phosphatase counteracts this process. Disrupted septin ring dynamics and SPOC defects in dma1Δ dma2Δ cells are consistent with the proposal that the septin ring at the bud neck serves as a platform for signaling mechanisms that inhibit mitotic exit in response to spindle mispositioning.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide scan to identify evidence of natural selection in response to climate variation across 61 worldwide populations. They analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the strongest correlations between allele frequencies and climate variables. The study found a significant enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those strongly correlated with climate variables. This suggests that adaptations to climate have shaped the spatial distribution of genetic variation in humans.

The analysis revealed strong signals of selection in gene sets related to UV radiation, infection, immunity, and cancer. Several of these signals coincided with SNPs associated with diseases of the immune response in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The study also identified a subset of SNPs with extremely large Bayes factors for climate variables that were strongly associated with traits based on GWAS results. These SNPs were implicated in pigmentation and autoimmune disease.

The researchers used the same allele frequency data to test for adaptations to continuous climate variables at the genome-wide level and identified genetic loci that underlie these adaptations. The study found a significant enrichment of genic SNPs with strong correlations with climate relative to non-genic SNPs in all population subsets. The results imply that adaptations to climate have played a central role in the capacity of humans to survive and thrive in extreme climates.
A simulation study investigated the arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the rapid-delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr)-linked SQT1 variant of the short QT syndrome (SQTS). The study used Markov chain models, which were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Huxley models in reproducing experimental data regarding the effects of the N588K mutation on KCNH2-encoded hERG. The ionic channel models were incorporated into human ventricular action potential (AP) models and into 1D and 2D idealized and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations, as well as a 3D anatomical model.

The N588K mutation was found to abbreviate ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) and decrease the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity (δV) during APs, resulting in decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD90 and the effective refractory period (ERP). However, when considering transmural heterogeneity of IKr density in the intact tissue model, the N588K mutation led to QT-shortening, increased T-wave amplitude, and augmented δV in some local regions of ventricular tissue, increasing tissue vulnerability to uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to the formation of re-entrant excitation waves.

In 2D and 3D tissue models, the N588K mutation facilitated and maintained re-entrant excitation waves due to the reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue. These findings provide a comprehensive explanation for the increased susceptibility to re-entry and perpetuation of re-entrant arrhythmia in the setting of SQT1.
Researchers have developed a new model using deep attention networks to understand the collective motion of zebrafish, a type of small fish. Traditional models of collective behavior can be insightful but often lack the detail needed to accurately predict individual movements. The new model, called a deep interaction network, is organized in modules and can simultaneously be both predictive and insightful. When tested on simulated trajectories, the model was able to recover the underlying rules of interaction used to generate the data, including the number of interacting neighbors. When applied to experimental data from groups of 60-100 zebrafish, the model found that interactions between pairs of fish can be described as repulsive, attractive, or alignment, but only when moving slowly. At higher velocities, interactions are primarily alignment or a mix of alignment and repulsion at close distances. The model also showed that each zebrafish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average of its neighbors, with weights higher for neighbors that are close, in a collision path, or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations. The number of interacting individuals is dynamic and typically ranges from 8-22, with 1-10 being more important. This suggests that each fish dynamically selects information from the collective to make decisions.
Researchers used a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. The study aimed to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution, which is a significant threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. The researchers employed stochastic birth-death-sampling processes to model the transmission tree of viral lineages, allowing them to quantify the fitness cost of resistance mutations as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug-resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug-sensitive strains.

The study focused on eight resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase and protease genes, including 41L, 67N, 70R, 184V, 210W, 215D, 215S, 219Q, 103N, 108I, 138A, 181C, 190A, and 90M. The results showed that the 90M mutation in the protease gene had a significantly higher fitness than drug-sensitive strains, while the mutations 67N, 70R, 184V, and 219Q associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were less fit than sensitive strains. The remaining resistance mutations did not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort.

The study developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations, which can be useful in assessing the risk of transmitted drug resistance in resource-limited settings where resistance testing is possible but epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data are missing.
Researchers have found that the Elongator complex, which includes the histone acetyl transferase Sin3/Elp3, plays a crucial role in the modification of certain transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in fission yeast. This modification is essential for the efficient translation of stress-induced mRNAs, particularly those containing a high number of lysine-coding codons. The study shows that cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 are sensitive to oxidative stress due to their inability to modify the uridine wobble nucleoside of certain tRNAs, specifically tRNALysUUU, tRNAGlnUUU, and tRNAGluUUU. As a result, the translation of stress-induced mRNAs, including those coding for transcription factors Atf1 and Pcr1, is impaired in these cells.

The researchers found that overexpression of tRNALysUUU complements the stress-related phenotypes of Sin3/Elp3 mutant cells, suggesting that the lack of this tRNA modification is the primary cause of their sensitivity to oxidative stress. Furthermore, the study shows that other tRNA modifying activities, such as Ctu1-Ctu2, are also essential for normal tolerance to H2O2. The results indicate that the transcriptional defects observed in Elongator mutants are a secondary consequence of the deficient expression of a transcription factor, Atf1-Pcr1, and other components of the transcriptional machinery. Overall, the study highlights the importance of tRNA modification in the regulation of translation and stress response in fission yeast.
Researchers have discovered a novel function of the Nef protein in HIV-1, which renders the virus resistant to certain neutralizing antibodies that target the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the TMgp41 protein. These antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10, are among the most broadly-acting neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1. The study found that Nef increases the resistance of HIV-1 to these antibodies by up to 50-fold, while having no effect on other neutralizing antibodies that target different regions of the Env protein. This effect was observed with Nef from various HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as with virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, or primary isolates. The study also found that Nef's ability to confer resistance to 2F5 and 4E10 is genetically separable from its other functions, such as enhancing virus infectivity and downregulating CD4. Furthermore, glycosylated-Gag from the murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) was found to substitute for Nef in conferring resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, indicating that this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef. The study suggests that Nef alters MPER recognition in the context of the virion membrane, making the virus resistant to these neutralizing antibodies. This discovery has important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
Researchers have investigated the molecular interactions between the snail intermediate host, Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos, and the carcinogenic liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, which causes cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the Greater Mekong sub-region of Thailand. Using high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, the team identified 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in infected snails compared to uninfected ones. These DEGs were associated with 43 distinct biological pathways, including immune defense mechanisms against parasites. The study found that genes encoding proteases were down-regulated in infected snails, while genes encoding heat-shock proteins and actins were up-regulated. This suggests that O. viverrini may suppress the snail's immune response, allowing the parasite to successfully colonize its host. The study provides a foundation for further research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the snail-parasite interaction and the development of resistance or susceptibility in B. siamensis goniomphalos to O. viverrini. The annotated dataset generated in this study represents a valuable resource for future investigations into snail-parasite interactions and the discovery of molecular pathways underlying susceptibility and resistance mechanisms.
Researchers investigated the role of complement receptor 1 (CR1) in the susceptibility to leprosy, a public health issue in Brazil. They analyzed CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 levels in a case-control study involving 213 leprosy patients and 297 controls. The study found that individuals with a specific recombinant haplotype, harboring the rs3849266*T and rs3737002*T variants, had twice the susceptibility to leprosy compared to those without these variants. This haplotype was associated with lower soluble CR1 levels in paucibacillary patients, which may reduce the anti-inflammatory response. Additionally, the study found that the most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form of leprosy and was associated with higher gene expression, potentially increasing the internalization of the parasite. Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between soluble CR1 levels and mannose-binding lectin, a molecule that initiates the lectin pathway of complement. The results suggest that CR1 polymorphisms play a regulatory role in mRNA and soluble CR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects that increase susceptibility to leprosy by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation. This study is the first to specifically analyze the influence of CR1 haplotypes, mRNA expression, and soluble CR1 levels in leprosy susceptibility.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive study to investigate sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their underlying genetic determinants. They analyzed data from over 3,300 individuals from the KORA F3 and F4 cohorts, measuring 131 metabolites, including amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, acylcarnitines, and C6-sugars. The study found significant concentration differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites, with p-values below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 3.8×10−4. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed genome-wide significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus for glycine, indicating sex-specific genetic determinants of metabolite profiles.

The researchers also conducted a meta-analysis of the KORA F4 and KORA F3 cohorts, which revealed 113 metabolites with a significant effect of sex. They further investigated how groups of metabolites share pairwise correlations and how sex-specific effects propagate through the metabolic network. To identify differences in genetically determined metabotypes, the researchers used a subpopulation of 1,809 participants from the KORA F4 study and replicated their findings in independent subsamples from the KORA F4 and KORA F3 cohorts.

The study provides new insights into sex-specific differences in cell regulatory processes and underscores the importance of considering sex-specific effects in the design and interpretation of studies. The findings suggest that sex-specific differences in metabolite profiles and genetic determinants may contribute to the observed differences in susceptibility and time course of common diseases in males and females.
Genome-scale metabolic networks are used to model genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations. However, the solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is typically very large, making optimization-based approaches necessary for predicting the active metabolic state under specific environmental conditions. The objective function used in these optimization algorithms is directly linked to the biological hypothesis underlying the model, making it a crucial parameter for successful modeling.

Current methods use a linear combination of selected fluxes to formulate metabolic objective functions, but this approach is sensitive to stoichiometry representation of the metabolic network. This sensitivity leads to different simulation results when using numerically different but biochemically equivalent stoichiometry representations, making biological interpretation subjective and ambiguous.

To address this issue, a new method called Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl) is proposed. MiMBl decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions by casting objective functions using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. By simulating perturbed metabolic networks, it is demonstrated that using stoichiometry representation-independent algorithms is essential for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation.

MiMBl allows for the expansion of the scope of metabolic modeling in elucidating the mechanistic basis of genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method involves formulating the objective function as a linear combination of metabolite turnovers, which accounts for reaction stoichiometry in the objective function by mapping the flux space into the metabolite turnover space.
Researchers investigated the relationship between plague distribution and the population genetic structure of the black rat (Rattus rattus), the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. They conducted a comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure in rat populations from four geographic areas with different topographic relief within the Madagascan plague focus. The results showed that rat populations displayed a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief, as expected. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differed between areas, suggesting that plague distribution is not solely related to the effective dispersal of rats.

The study found that plague seroprevalence levels in rat populations mimicked those previously reported for humans, with significant but weak genotypic differentiation of R. rattus subpopulations observed over a relatively small spatial scale. Genetic diversity estimates suggested that plague epizootics had only a weak impact on rat population sizes. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague dissemination cannot be accounted for solely by the effective dispersal of the reservoir, and human social activities may also be involved in spreading the disease in rat and human populations.

The study aimed to investigate whether the distribution of plague seroprevalence in rat populations differs between plateau and mountain areas, as shown in humans. The results suggest that plague spread in rat and human populations can be partly related to the population genetic structure of the reservoir, but also to human social activities.
Researchers have identified a family of proteins called Ly6 on the surface of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, which is responsible for causing schistosomiasis in humans. These proteins, known as SmLy6A, SmLy6B, and SmLy6D, have been found to be present on the surface of the parasite and have been shown to induce protective immunity in experimental models. However, the immune response to these proteins in humans has not been thoroughly explored until now. A study has reanalyzed the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family and identified 11 members, including three new proteins. The researchers found that all SmLy6 proteins are likely to be bound to the surface of the parasite. To investigate the immune response to these proteins in humans, the researchers measured IgG1, IgG4, and IgE antibodies against two surface-bound representatives, SmLy6A and SmLy6B, in a cohort of Schistosoma mansoni-infected Ugandan males before and after treatment with the antiparasitic drug praziquantel. The results showed that IgG1 antibodies against SmLy6A and SmLy6B were present in 7.4% and 25.3% of the cohort, respectively, before treatment. After treatment, the levels of IgG1 antibodies against SmLy6A and SmLy6B significantly decreased, while the levels of IgG1 antibodies against a sub-surface antigen, SmTAL1, increased. These findings suggest that SmLy6A and SmLy6B are immunogenic in human populations and that treatment with praziquantel leads to a decrease in the immune response to these proteins.
Researchers have developed a computer simulation to study the role of cell-cell adhesion in shaping the morphology of cells in the Drosophila retina. The simulation aims to understand how the adhesion protein N-cadherin influences the geometry of cells during tissue morphogenesis. The model incorporates key features of morphogenesis, including the timing of N-cadherin expression and the remodeling of cell-cell contacts. Experimental data from normal and mutant cells, either lacking or misexpressing N-cadherin, were used to test the model. The simulations successfully reproduced the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells, highlighting the importance of N-cadherin in determining cell shape. The model also demonstrated that N-cadherin protein is recycled from inactive interfaces to active interfaces, modulating adhesion strengths between cells. This recycling process is crucial for the proper formation of cell-cell contacts. The study suggests that N-cadherin plays a more significant role in morphogenesis than previously thought, going beyond cell sorting and influencing the details of cell geometry. The model's ability to distinguish between different mechanisms of cadherin level control and incorporate dynamical features of morphogenesis, such as the temporal sequence of cadherin expression and cell-cell contact remodeling, further supports its validity.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the role of membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions involved in cancer cell invasion. MT1-MMP is a potent invasion-promoting protease that localizes to invadopodia, where it plays a central role in ECM degradation. The study aimed to clarify the turnover rate of MT1-MMP and its contribution to ECM degradation at invadopodia. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, the researchers found that MT1-MMP is rapidly turned over at invadopodia, with a turnover rate approximated by double-exponential plots with time constants of 26 seconds and 259 seconds. The recovery of MT1-MMP at invadopodia depended primarily on vesicle transport, rather than lateral diffusion. A computational model was constructed based on the observed kinetics of the FRAP experiments, which successfully reproduced the experimental results. Inhibiting vesicle transport both experimentally and in simulation blocked ECM degradation, and the degree of reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of reduction in MT1-MMP turnover. The study established the role of rapid MT1-MMP turnover in ECM degradation at invadopodia and suggested a synergetic contribution of proteolytic activity and MT1-MMP turnover to ECM degradation. The computational model provides a new tool to design and evaluate intervention strategies in cancer cell invasion.
Researchers investigated how drug-resistant HIV-1 evolves and spreads within an infected individual by studying four macaques infected with a simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) that contains HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The animals were treated with a single drug to induce the emergence of two common drug-resistant mutations. The researchers collected viral DNA and RNA from the blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at multiple time points and used single-genome sequencing to analyze the data.

The results show that the virus rapidly acquires drug resistance across different compartments of the body, including the blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina, through multiple independent mutations. The blood and lymph nodes were found to be compartmentalized infrequently, while the blood and lymph nodes were more frequently different from the mucosal tissues. The study suggests that even frequently sampled blood may not fully capture the viral dynamics in other parts of the body, particularly the gut, where viral RNA turnover was faster than in the plasma.

The findings of transient compartmentalization across multiple tissues may help explain the varied results of previous compartmentalization studies in HIV-1. The study also highlights the importance of considering the genetic variation of the virus in different parts of the body when reconstructing transmission chains and epidemiological tracking of transmitted drug resistance. Understanding HIV-1 genetic variation across the body may contribute to our understanding of viral reservoirs and the potential for virus eradication.
Researchers have investigated the role of feedback regulation in tissue morphogenesis, which is the process by which tissues develop their shape and structure. They used mathematical modeling to explore how feedback mechanisms, involving both positive and negative signals, affect the growth and development of tissues. The study found that this type of feedback can lead to the emergence of complex behaviors, including bistable or bimodal growth patterns, ultrasensitivity to external growth cues, and the formation of self-organizing structures such as lamellar fingers. These behaviors arise from the control of stem or progenitor cell self-renewal, rather than the regulation of cell cycle speeds.

The researchers identified a necessary condition for these behaviors to occur, which is the simultaneous presence of saturable positive and negative feedback. They also noted that similar phenomena have been observed in vivo, including growth bistability, feedback ultrasensitivity, and feedback-regulated morphogenesis. The study showed that the interaction of diffusible factors with opposing effects can lead to the spontaneous emergence of spatially dynamic behaviors, resulting in sharply localized differences in net growth.

The researchers mathematically defined the conditions required for these phenomena to arise and demonstrated how they can drive the formation of induced or spontaneous bulges, buds, and fingers, which are the basic building blocks of many types of morphogenesis. They also found that the patterns that emerge from these interactions are not Turing patterns, which are a type of pattern formation that arises from the interaction of diffusible factors with opposing effects.
Researchers conducted the largest genome-wide association study to date on myopia, a common eye disorder characterized by nearsightedness due to excessive eye elongation. The study analyzed data from 45,771 European participants and identified 22 significant genetic associations with the age of myopia onset. Ten of these novel associations were replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 individuals who reported developing myopia before the age of 10. These associations explain 2.9% of the variance in myopia age of onset and suggest multiple genetic factors contribute to the development of myopia. The identified genes are involved in various biological processes, including extracellular matrix remodeling, the visual cycle, and neuronal development. Specifically, associations were found in genes related to the extracellular matrix (LAMA2), the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal (RGR and RDH5), and the growth and guidance of retinal ganglion cells (ZIC2 and SFRP1). Additionally, five associations were found in genes involved in neuronal signaling or development. These findings indicate complex interactions between extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina may underlie the development of myopia in humans.
Researchers investigated the role of curvature feedback in the energetics and dynamics of lamprey swimming using a closed-loop model. The model simulated the lamprey's central pattern generator (CPG) circuit, which activates muscles for locomotion and adjusts activity in response to sensory inputs from the environment. The CPG was modeled as chains of coupled oscillators, with pairs of phase oscillators representing the left and right sides of segments along the lamprey body. The emergent curvature of the body served as an input to the CPG oscillators, closing the loop. Two forms of feedback were considered: directional feedback, which excites or inhibits oscillators on the same side depending on the sign of a gain parameter, and magnitude feedback, which provides a symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effect to oscillators on both sides. The results showed that directional feedback does not affect beat frequency but changes the duration of muscle activity, while magnitude feedback tends to increase beat frequency and reduce the energetic cost to the lamprey when the gain is high and positive. The body curvature had a similar magnitude with both types of feedback, indicating that the same magnitude of curvature-based feedback can cause distinct differences in swimming performance. The study provides insights into the functional form of curvature feedback and its effects on steady swimming energetics and kinematics in lampreys.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of HIV competition in populations outside of Africa, where local epidemics are often dominated by a single subtype. They hypothesized that the first strain to colonize a population may have an advantage over subsequent strains, slowing down the invasion of new strains and the diversification of the epidemic. To test this hypothesis, the researchers developed a stochastic modeling framework to simulate HIV epidemics over dynamic contact networks. They simulated the introduction of a second strain into a population where the first strain had established a steady-state epidemic, assessing whether and on what time scale the second strain could spread.

The simulations showed that the spread of the second strain occurred on a much slower time scale compared to the initial expansion of the first strain. Even with strains of equal transmission efficiency, the second strain was unable to invade on a time scale relevant for the history of the HIV pandemic. However, if the second strain had a considerable advantage (over 25%) in transmission efficiency over the resident strain, it could become dominant over a time scale of decades. The researchers also found that the inhibition effect was weaker if the second strain was introduced while the first strain was still in its growth phase.

The study's findings suggest a strong first-comer advantage in the competition dynamics of HIV at the population level, which may explain the global phylogeography of the virus and influence the future evolution of the pandemic. The researchers also explored possible mechanisms of interference, including inhibition of superinfection, depletion of highly connected hubs in the network, and one-time acute peak of infectiousness, which contribute to the inhibition effect.
Researchers investigated the self-organization of muscle cell structure and function, focusing on how muscle cells adapt to their environment. They developed a quantitative model to study how the cytoskeleton of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes organizes in response to geometric cues in the extracellular matrix. The study found that distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from two temporally-ordered organizational processes: the interaction between actin fibers, premyofibrils, and focal adhesions, as well as the cooperative alignment and parallel bundling of nascent myofibrils. The results suggest that a hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton and that a positive feedback loop is responsible for initiating the break in symmetry, which is potentiated by extracellular boundary conditions. The study also found that the contractility of a cell may play an important role in polarizing the myofibrillar network, and that muscle cells depend on extracellular spatial cues to efficiently and functionally organize the myofibrils and contraction. The researchers developed a computational model of myofibrillar patterning to show the sensitivity of the intracellular architecture to the extracellular space, allowing them to understand the critical events in the global assembly and organization of the contractile apparatus in cardiac myocytes.
Researchers investigated the invasive potential of the Wolbachia bacterium in Brazilian Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which is being trialled as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission. The study examined the wMel strain of Wolbachia in laboratory mosquitoes with a Brazilian genetic background and found that it causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission, and no evident detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. To understand the effects of different urban landscapes on mosquito survival, mark-release-recapture experiments were conducted in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future. The study characterized mosquito populations in relation to socio-demographic conditions at these sites and three other future release areas. Mathematical models were constructed using laboratory and field data to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood that the Wolbachia infection frequency could reach 100% following mosquito release. The results predict successful invasion at all five field sites, with the conditions for invasion varying greatly between sites and being strongly influenced by the size of the local mosquito population. The study suggests that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro, including those where mosquito releases from the Eliminate Dengue Program will take place. The findings provide a useful framework for the ongoing field-releases of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti in Brazil and will likely hold similar utility for future releases in other similarly heterogeneous urban landscapes.
Researchers have identified a protein called JMJ703 as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses the three forms of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) in rice. This epigenetic modification plays a crucial role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression, particularly in plant development and stress adaptation. The study found that loss-of-function mutation of the JMJ703 gene affects stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in the mutant.

Analysis of the crystal structure of the catalytic core domain of JMJ703 revealed a general similarity with mammalian and yeast JMJD2 proteins that are H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases. However, several specific features were observed in the structure of JMJ703, including key residues that interact with cofactors and the methylated H3K4 substrate peptide. These residues are essential for the demethylase activity in vivo and are conserved in known H3K4 demethylases, suggesting that they may be involved in the specificity for H3K4 demethylation.

The study also found that JMJ703 is essential for plant cell division and stem elongation, and specifically demethylates mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K4 in vivo and in vitro. The results suggest that JMJ703 is important for rice gene expression and may regulate growth hormone metabolism in rice, which is different from other plant proteins with similar functions. Overall, the study provides new insights into the structural basis of a histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase required for stem elongation in rice.
Researchers have identified a shared binding site in the HIV-1 capsid protein that is targeted by multiple host cell and pharmacologic ligands. These ligands, including the antiviral compounds PF74 and BI-2, as well as the host cell proteins NUP153 and CPSF6, bind to a specific interface within the capsid protein. This interface is formed by the interaction of multiple subunits of the capsid protein, specifically hexamers, and is not present in the monomeric form of the protein.

The binding site is located at the interface between the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the capsid protein, and is stabilized by a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif. The ligands bind to this site through a shared FG motif, with each ligand making unique interactions with the capsid protein. The binding of these ligands to the capsid protein is essential for their ability to influence HIV-1 infection.

The researchers found that the binding of NUP153 and CPSF6 to the capsid protein requires the presence of the NTD-CTD interface, and that dissociation of the hexamer into monomers prevents high-affinity interaction with these ligands. The binding site is conformationally dynamic, but binding of NUP153 or CPSF6 peptides is accommodated by only one conformation. The study reveals that multiple ligands share an overlapping interface in the HIV-1 capsid that is lost upon viral disassembly, providing new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have improved the genome assembly of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a primary vector of human arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. The original genome assembly contained 4,758 scaffolds, many of which had not been assigned to a specific chromosome. By scoring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypti, the researchers generated a genetic map that revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome. These errors included sequences from different chromosomes being placed on the same scaffold. After correcting these errors, the researchers were able to assign 60% of the genome sequence to chromosomes and approximately order the scaffolds along the chromosome.

The new genome assembly revealed large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres, which can extend up to 47% of the chromosome. To demonstrate the utility of the new genome assembly, the researchers mapped a gene that makes Ae. aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi and identified a list of candidate genes that could be affecting the trait. This improved genome assembly will facilitate the mapping of genes affecting disease transmission in Ae. aegypti, a crucial step in understanding and controlling the spread of arboviruses.
Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, is a key target for vector control programs in tropical countries. Traditional household larval surveys are still widely used, despite the availability of new trapping devices. A multicentric entomological survey was conducted in five mid-sized cities to compare the effectiveness of four types of traps (BG-Sentinel, Adultrap, MosquiTRAP, and ovitraps) with larval surveys. The study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of these traps in detecting mosquito density variations.

The results showed that the House Index, a traditional measure of mosquito infestation, was consistently low in most cities. In contrast, the traps rarely produced null indices, indicating their greater sensitivity in detecting the presence of Aedes aegypti. The trap positivity indices tended to plateau at high mosquito densities, but both indices agreed on the seasonality of mosquito abundance in all cities. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature rather than precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variations.

The study found that all investigated traps performed better than the House Index in measuring seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. The choice between traps should consider differences in cost and ease of use. The results support the development of trap-based surveillance programs in dengue-endemic countries and suggest that traps can be used in combination with vector control strategies to improve responses to dengue and other diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti.
APOBEC3G (A3G), a human cytidine deaminase, is a potent inhibitor of retroviruses, including HIV-1. A3G contains two cytidine deaminase domains (CDAs), with only the C-terminal domain known to mediate cytidine deamination. Researchers used the crystal structure of APOBEC2 (A2) to identify residues in A3G that facilitate oligomerization. They found that tyrosine-124 and tryptophan-127 in the N-terminal CDA domain mediate A3G oligomerization, which coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. This oligomerization is also shown to be RNA-dependent. Homology modeling of A3G onto the A2 template structure revealed a positively charged pocket formed by a putative dimer interface. Substitution of arginine residues in this pocket resulted in reduced virus inhibition, virion packaging, and oligomerization. The researchers propose that occupation of the positively charged pocket by RNA promotes A3G oligomerization, packaging into virions, and antiviral function. The study highlights the importance of specific residues in A3G and the role of RNA in mediating oligomerization, packaging, and antiviral activity. The findings provide new insights into the structure-function organization of APOBEC proteins and may have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to manipulate the interaction between A3G and HIV-1.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of a major-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) in Drosophila melanogaster, specifically the bric-a-brac (bab) locus, which affects cuticular pigmentation. They sequenced the 148 kb bab genomic region from 94 inbred lines and found that natural alleles with large effects on pigmentation result from a cumulative impact of polymorphisms in three functional regions: a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and a Polycomb response element. Analysis of allele-specific expression confirmed that these polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level. This study demonstrates that a single QTL can act through multiple molecular mechanisms, and that sequence variation in regions flanking experimentally validated functional elements can have significant quantitative effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype. The findings have important implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and for basic and medical genomics. The results suggest that accumulation of multiple mutations at the same locus may be a common mechanism of micro- and macroevolutionary change. This study provides a detailed analysis of the fine structure of functional variation underlying large-effect QTL alleles segregating in a natural population.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium responsible for invasive and mucosal diseases, has maintained its prevalence despite antibiotic and vaccine use due to its ability to adapt through genetic exchange with the surrounding microbial community. This adaptation is facilitated by a tightly regulated quorum sensing system, triggered by the extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide (CSP), which controls DNA uptake and recombination. Researchers have discovered that CSP also stimulates the production of a diverse array of bacteriocins, known as blp bacteriocins, through the increased production and secretion of the bacteriocin pheromone BlpC. This cross-stimulation requires a functional competence regulatory system and is mediated by a conserved motif in the promoter of the operon encoding BlpC and its transporter. The accumulation of BlpC following CSP stimulation leads to the activation of the entire blp locus. Biofilm-grown organisms, a model for competition and genetic exchange on the mucosal surface, demonstrate that DNA exchange is enhanced by bacteriocin secretion, suggesting that co-stimulation of bacteriocins with competence provides an adaptive advantage. The blp and com regulatory pathways, which have diverged and specialized in a remote ancestor of pneumococcus, have maintained a regulatory connection that promotes competition and adaptation by targeting potential competitors for lysis while providing a means for DNA incorporation.
Researchers investigated the role of cellular proteins PCBP2 and SRp20 in the translation of poliovirus RNA during infection. They found that SRp20 re-localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells, where it partially co-localizes with PCBP2. This interaction between PCBP2 and SRp20 is crucial for the recruitment of ribosomes to the viral RNA for translation initiation. The study demonstrated that SRp20 is associated with PCBP2 bound to poliovirus RNA, indicating that this interaction occurs on the viral RNA. A mutated version of SRp20 lacking the RNA recognition motif (SRp20ΔRRM) was found to be localized similarly to the full-length SRp20 and partially co-localized with PCBP2 during poliovirus infection. However, expression of this mutated version of SRp20 resulted in a significant decrease in virus yield for poliovirus, suggesting a dominant negative effect. The results support a model in which SRp20 interacts with PCBP2 bound to the viral RNA, recruiting ribosomes to the viral RNA for translation initiation. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of ribosome recruitment for poliovirus IRES-mediated translation initiation and highlights the importance of non-canonical factors in bridging the translation machinery to the RNA. The findings have implications for understanding the role of SR proteins in linking nuclear splicing and export with translation in eukaryotic cells.
Researchers conducted an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen to identify genetic pathways regulating neural crest (NC) development in mice. The screen utilized a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, Sox10LacZ/+, and analyzed 71 pedigrees. Four heritable loci, called modifier of Sox10 expression pattern 1-4 (msp1-4), were identified, which showed altered NC patterning. One of these loci, msp1, was found to be a new allele of the receptor tyrosine kinase Erbb3, Erbb3msp1, carrying a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region of the protein. The mutation did not affect protein expression but impaired ERBB3 signaling, resulting in embryonic defects similar to those of Erbb3 null alleles. Biochemical analysis revealed that the mutant protein was expressed on the cell surface but showed reduced ligand-induced phosphorylation. This study highlights the importance of the mutated residue for ERBB3 receptor function and activation. The findings underscore the utility of ENU mutagenesis in identifying genetic pathways regulating NC development and dissecting the roles of discrete protein domains, contributing to a better understanding of gene function in a cellular and developmental setting.
Researchers conducted a study in a rural Ugandan fishing community to investigate the factors influencing susceptibility to Schistosoma mansoni infection, a parasitic disease prevalent in the region. The study aimed to distinguish between exposure-related factors, such as local environment and behavior, and biological factors, such as immunology and genetics, that contribute to infection intensity and prevalence. The researchers used a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating data from a longitudinal reinfection study, to examine the influence of age, sex, and ethnic background on susceptibility to reinfection after anti-helminth drug treatment.

The study found that observed ethnic- and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were attributed to differences in cercarial exposure, rather than biological differences in susceptibility to infection. However, age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure and appeared to be linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 immune responses to the schistosome tegumental antigen SmTAL1. The study highlights the importance of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings to understand the ecology of a population and draw more robust conclusions.

The researchers used individual-level cercarial exposure scores to adjust for variations in exposure, which is a common limitation in small-scale epidemiological studies investigating risk factors for Schistosoma infection. The study's findings suggest that schistosome-specific IgE immune responses may play a role in susceptibility to reinfection, particularly in relation to age-related differences. Overall, the study contributes to the understanding of the complex patterns of human exposure and immunity to Schistosoma mansoni in endemic communities.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the correlation between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPGs) and the actual number of worms in individuals infected with Clonorchis sinensis, a type of liver fluke. The study involved 60 residents from Sancheong-gun, Korea, who were diagnosed with clonorchiasis through egg positivity in their feces using the Kato-Katz method. After treatment with praziquantel, the participants were given a purgation solution to induce the discharge of adult worms, which were then collected and counted.

The results showed a positive correlation between EPGs and the number of worms, with a correlation coefficient of 0.681 (P < 0.001). The study found that worm recovery rates were significantly higher in individuals with EPGs over 1,000 (73.7%) compared to those with EPGs between 1-1,000 (9.7%). No worms were detected in individuals who were egg-negative. The study also estimated that approximately 110 worms are present in an individual with EPGs around 3,000, and that each worm produces around 4,000 eggs per day.

This study provides evidence that the number of eggs per gram of feces is a reliable indicator of the worm burden in clonorchiasis. The findings support the use of EPGs as a diagnostic tool for assessing the intensity of clonorchiasis infection. The study's results also suggest that praziquantel treatment followed by purgation is a safe and effective method for collecting and counting adult worms in infected individuals.
Researchers have developed a new approach to combat the growing problem of anti-fungal drug resistance by identifying genetic interactions that can be targeted to prevent the emergence of resistance. They used an unbiased genome-wide screen in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify genetic mutants that are synthetically lethal with Candida glabrata cells expressing a gain-of-function allele of the PDR1 gene, which is responsible for fluconazole resistance in this human fungal pathogen. Eighteen such mutants were identified, and one of them, lacking the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, was further investigated. Deletion or inhibition of Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles, and also inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments. The researchers confirmed that the synthetic lethal interaction between Gcn5 and PDR1+ is conserved in C. glabrata and demonstrated that targeting Gcn5 renders both S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata mutants inviable. This study provides proof of concept that synthetically lethal genetic screens can identify novel candidate proteins that can be targeted to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant infections. The findings suggest that targeting synthetic lethal interactions offers a new paradigm for the treatment of drug-resistant infections.
Researchers investigated the formation of membranous structures in cells infected with poliovirus (PV). They used two PV mutants, EG and GG, which exhibit delayed genome replication and impaired virus assembly, to study the pathway of formation of PV-induced membranous structures. The study found that changes to the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) pool occurred as early as 30 minutes post-infection, even in the presence of a replication inhibitor. This was accompanied by the formation of membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters appeared in the perinuclear region of the cell at 3 hours post-infection, which is too slow to be responsible for genome replication. The study suggests that PV induces temporally distinct membranous structures for genome replication (tubules) and virus assembly (vesicular clusters). The pace of formation, spatiotemporal dynamics, and efficiency of the replication-to-assembly-organelle conversion may be set by the rate of P3 polyprotein processing and the capacity for P3 processing to yield 3AB and/or 3CD proteins. The study also found that the GG PV mutant was unable to convert virus-induced tubules into vesicular clusters, which may explain the nearly 5-log reduction in infectious virus produced by this mutant.
Researchers have developed a multi-step strategy to identify new compounds with trypanocidal activity against Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The approach involved virtual screening of the ZINC database using ligand- and target-based methods, followed by in vitro assays and X-ray crystallography. This led to the identification of 12 non-peptidic, non-covalent cruzain inhibitors with low micromolar affinity values. One of these compounds, Nequimed176, was found to bind to cruzain through a competitive inhibition mechanism, as confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Cruzain is a validated therapeutic target for Chagas disease and shares similarities with the mammalian enzyme cathepsin L, which is associated with invasive properties and metastatic cancer cells. The cruzain inhibitors were also tested against cathepsin L, showing similar affinity values but poor selectivity towards cruzain. Two of the most potent cruzain inhibitors were found to have trypanocidal activity against T. cruzi-infected cells, with one compound, Nequimed42, exhibiting an IC50 value 10-fold lower than the positive control, benznidazole. A smaller, simplified compound derived from Nequimed42, Nequimed176, was identified as a novel non-peptidic, non-covalent cruzain inhibitor with potential as a trypanocidal agent. The study highlights the discovery of new molecular classes of cruzain inhibitors with manageable structure-activity and structure-toxicity relationships, advancing the lead optimization process for Chagas disease chemotherapy.
Researchers have developed two non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations as potential vaccines against yellow fever (YF) virus. These formulations encode the full-length envelope protein (p/YFE) or the full-length envelope protein fused to the lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal, LAMP-1 (pL/YFE), aimed at enhancing antigen processing and presentation. The immune responses triggered by these formulations were evaluated in mice strains C57Bl/6 and BALB/c, corresponding to the H2b and H2d backgrounds, respectively. Both DNA constructs induced strong T-cell responses against almost all epitopes generated by the YF 17DD vaccine, with the pL/YFE formulation performing best overall. Additionally, pL/YFE stimulated high titers of anti-YF neutralizing antibodies comparable to those elicited by the 17DD vaccine. Importantly, the pL/YFE vaccine provided 100% protection against the YF virus in intracerebrally challenged mice. The results indicate that pL/YFE DNA is a promising vaccine candidate and warrants further development. The study also expanded the epitope mapping for the envelope protein of the YF virus in C57Bl/6 mice, identifying additional epitopes recognized by the immune system. Overall, these findings suggest that the pL/YFE DNA vaccine has the potential to provide effective protection against YF virus infection.
Researchers have identified the nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA as a direct transcriptional activator of the chitobiose utilization genes in the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Chitobiose is a disaccharide component of chitin, a polysaccharide found in the marine environment, and its utilization is essential for the persistence and evolution of V. cholerae. The chitobiose utilization genes are encoded by the chb operon, which is regulated by the orphan sensor kinase ChiS. However, the mechanisms downstream of ChiS activation that result in the expression of the chb operon were not well understood.

Using an unbiased transposon mutant screen, the researchers found that SlmA is a regulator of the chb operon. SlmA is a member of the TetR family of proteins, which are generally transcriptional repressors. However, in this study, SlmA was found to bind directly to the chb operon promoter and activate its transcription. This interaction is required for the transcriptional activation of the chb operon and for chitobiose utilization in V. cholerae. The researchers also found that DNA-binding, but not nucleoid occlusion, is critical for the transcriptional activation of the chb operon by SlmA. This study identifies a novel role for SlmA as a transcriptional regulator in V. cholerae, in addition to its established role as a cell division licensing factor.
Researchers have developed a new nonlinear programming framework for solving complex parameter estimation problems in dynamic biological system models. These problems are computationally challenging due to the involvement of highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations, numerous experimental data sets, and parameters. The proposed framework utilizes cutting-edge modeling and solution tools that are computationally efficient, robust, and easy to use. It employs a time discretization approach that avoids repetitive simulations of the dynamic model, enables fully algebraic model implementations and computation of derivatives, and leverages computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques.

The framework was tested on synthetic human gut microbiome community models, demonstrating its ability to solve estimation problems with up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 differential equations, and 20,352 data points in under 15 minutes. In comparison, an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework required over 7 hours to solve a similar problem. The proposed framework is flexible, easy to use, and can be applied to various dynamic models of biological systems, enabling the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty, diagnose observability/uniqueness issues, perform model selection, and handle outliers. This framework has the potential to enable kinetic modeling of complex biological systems, such as biomolecular networks and high-dimensional microbial communities, and can be used to construct and analyze high-fidelity models of whole-cells or microbiomes.
Researchers used a high-throughput digital gene expression system called nCounter to study the inflammatory response in mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV). The study aimed to understand how WNV spreads and triggers an immune response in the body. The researchers infected outbred Swiss Webster mice with WNV and analyzed gene expression changes in multiple tissues, including the spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and brain, over a nine-day period. The nCounter system allowed for the simultaneous analysis of 179 inflammation-related genes in these tissues.

The results showed that certain genes, such as Cxcl10 and Il12b, were differentially expressed in all tissues except the kidney. By comparing infected and non-infected tissues, the researchers were able to distinguish between a general inflammatory response and tissue-specific responses to WNV infection. The study also found that some genes, like C3ar1, Il23a, and Il10rb, were significantly up- or down-regulated in non-infected tissues, while others, such as Stat1, Tlr2, and Cxcl1, were up-regulated in infected livers.

The researchers used a multiplex protein detection system to validate the gene expression analysis and found similar expression kinetics for certain genes, including Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, and Ccl5, which correlated with the presence of infectious virus. The study demonstrates the utility of the nCounter platform for rapidly identifying gene expression changes associated with WNV infection in mice. The findings provide valuable insights into the inflammatory response to WNV infection and highlight the potential of high-throughput gene expression analysis for understanding viral pathogenesis.
In 2014, an outbreak of human rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities in Mozambique, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors associated with human rabies and animal bites. The study reviewed cases of human rabies and animal bites from April to July 2014 and conducted a community investigation in July and August in the neighborhoods where cases of human rabies resided. Fourteen cases of human rabies were detected, all of whom had a recent history of dog bite, and 819 cases of animal bites were registered, with dogs responsible for 97.8% of all bites. Factors significantly associated with human rabies included age under 15 years, bite by stray dog, deep wound, bite in the head, bite by unimmunized dog, no use of soap and water, and no post-exposure prophylaxis. The study found that implementation of control measures for rabies is poor in Maputo and Matola cities, where cases of human rabies were strongly associated with bites by stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular implementation of post-exposure measures. The findings of this study contribute to formulating appropriate recommendations and strategies to control rabies in Mozambique, a country with a high burden of rabies in sub-Saharan Africa.
Researchers identified a new gene, SCN9A, associated with febrile seizures (FS) in a large Utah family. The gene encodes the Nav1.7 sodium channel, and a mutation in a highly conserved amino acid, p.N641Y, was found in 21 affected family members. The mutation was absent in 586 ethnically matched population control chromosomes. To confirm the role of SCN9A in FS, the researchers introduced the orthologous mutation into mice using targeted homologous recombination. Homozygous Scn9aN641Y/N641Y knockin mice exhibited significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced seizures and increased susceptibility to corneal kindling. These findings support the SCN9A p.N641Y mutation as a disease-causing factor in this family.

The researchers also analyzed a collection of 92 unrelated FS patients and identified additional highly conserved Nav1.7 missense variants in 5% of the patients. One child with FS later developed Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy, and was found to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the SCN1A gene. Subsequent analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients revealed nine Nav1.7 missense variants, all in highly conserved amino acids. This study provides evidence for a role of SCN9A in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations. The findings suggest that SCN9A has a role in central excitability and is associated with a wide clinical spectrum of seizure phenotypes, including simple FS, self-limited afebrile seizures, and temporal lobe epilepsy.
Biologists have long sought to understand how complex tissue shapes arise through growth, a process that often involves preferential growth along specific orientations. Two theories have been proposed to explain how these orientations are specified: the axiality-based system, which relies on stresses within the tissue, and the polarity-based system, which suggests that orientations can be specified independently of stresses through molecular signaling. Researchers have recently explored the axiality-based system using computational modeling. This study develops and applies a polarity-based system, known as the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework, which treats tissue as a continuous material where regionally expressed factors interact and propagate. Polarity is established by signals that propagate through the tissue and is anchored in regions termed tissue polarity organisers. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity are then specified through a regulatory network. The resulting growth depends on how specified growth patterns interact within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue, leading to the emergence of features such as curvature that were not directly specified by the regulatory networks. The study illustrates the value of the GPT framework for understanding morphogenesis by applying it to a growing Snapdragon flower and proposes that combinatorial interactions between orientations and rates of growth have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes.
Researchers investigated the consequences of interference between multiple CD8+ T cell escape mutations in early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. During early HIV infection, multiple CD8+ T cell responses are elicited simultaneously, exerting strong selective pressures on different parts of the virus's genome. This leads to the selection of mutations that escape recognition and are beneficial to the virus. Some studies have shown that the later these escape mutations emerge, the more slowly they go to fixation. This pattern of escape rate decrease (ERD) can arise from distinct mechanisms, including interference among different escape strains.

The researchers developed a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination to investigate how interference between concurrent escape mutations affects their escape rates in systems with multiple epitopes. They also derived an interference-free null model assuming initial neutral evolution before immune response elicitation. The results showed that interference between several equally selectively advantageous mutations can generate the observed ERD pattern. The number of loci and recombination rates were found to substantially affect ERD, which can be explained by the underexponential decline of escape rates over time.

The study also found that the observed ERD pattern in HIV-infected individuals is consistent with both independent, interference-free mutations and interference effects. The results confirm that interference effects should be considered when analyzing HIV escape mutations. However, estimating escape rates and mutation-associated selective coefficients under interference regimes is challenging due to the stochastic nature of competition between mutations, requiring novel estimation methodologies based on the analysis of HIV strains rather than mutation frequencies.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effectiveness of chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The model estimates the cell-killing ability of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens, which combine cisplatin with other chemotherapy drugs such as gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel. The model takes into account various factors that affect treatment outcome, including tumor growth rate, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance.

The model was applied to data from 13 NSCLC patients who received cisplatin-based doublet regimens in the neoadjuvant context. The results showed that the model can accurately estimate the in-vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapies. Sensitivity analysis revealed that tumor volume growth rate and growth fraction at diagnosis are key features for more accurate estimates.

The model estimates the cell-killing efficacy of chemotherapy as the sum of cell kill rates of the two drugs considered. The results suggest that the model can provide a quantitative framework for estimating the in-vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapies. Correlation studies of these estimates with the molecular profile of patients could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.

This study demonstrates the potential of in silico experimentation to suggest optimal treatment protocols for individual patients based on their own multiscale data. The model can help clinicians choose the most effective chemotherapy regimen for each patient, potentially improving treatment outcomes for NSCLC patients.
Researchers have identified a molecular mechanism that contributes to the high tolerance of bacterial biofilms to antibiotics. Biofilms are complex communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and are notoriously difficult to treat with antibiotics. In this study, scientists used a random mutagenesis technique to identify Escherichia coli mutants that formed biofilms with increased tolerance to the antibiotic ofloxacin. They found that starved biofilms, which lack essential nutrients, exhibited significantly greater tolerance to ofloxacin compared to their planktonic counterparts.

The researchers discovered that the biofilm-associated tolerance to ofloxacin was dependent on the SOS response, a stress response mechanism that is activated in response to DNA damage. They also found that the stringent response, a response to amino acid starvation, played a partial role in mediating ofloxacin tolerance. Notably, the biofilm-specific ofloxacin tolerance did not involve any of the SOS-induced toxin-antitoxin systems previously associated with the formation of highly tolerant persisters.

The study also showed that ofloxacin tolerance increased as a function of biofilm age, which was dependent on the SOS response. These findings suggest that the SOS stress response, induced in heterogeneous and nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments, is a key molecular mechanism leading to biofilm-specific high tolerance to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin. This research provides new insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance in biofilms and highlights the importance of the SOS response in mediating this tolerance.
Researchers have identified cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a key regulator in the invasion of human red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites, the parasites responsible for the deadliest form of malaria. The invasion process involves specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands, which are localized in apical organelles called micronemes. The study found that exposure to a low potassium environment, similar to that found in blood plasma, triggers the activation of a bicarbonate-sensitive adenylyl cyclase, leading to an increase in cAMP levels and the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA regulates the secretion of microneme proteins, which are essential for receptor engagement and invasion.

The researchers also discovered that cAMP regulates the levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) in the merozoite cytosol through an Epac pathway, and that both cAMP and Ca2+ increases are necessary to trigger microneme secretion. The study suggests that the soluble adenylyl cyclase, ACβ, plays a significant role in regulating cAMP levels in Plasmodium merozoites. The findings provide new targets for inhibiting blood-stage parasite growth and preventing malaria, a disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Strongyloides stercoralis, a soil-transmitted threadworm, is one of the most neglected of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). A review of studies from the past 20 years found that the parasite is prevalent in many parts of the world, particularly in resource-poor countries in Africa, Asia, and South America. The review included 354 studies from 78 countries, with 62.4% of the studies conducted in community settings, 34.2% in hospitals, and 11.0% in refugee and immigrant populations.

The meta-analysis revealed a strong association between HIV infection and S. stercoralis infection, with a disease odds ratio of 2.17. Similarly, a significant association was found between alcoholism and S. stercoralis infection, with a disease odds ratio of 6.69. The review also found high infection prevalence rates in the general population in selected countries and geographical regions.

The study highlights the need for further assessments in socio-economic and ecological settings, as well as the integration of S. stercoralis into global helminth control programs. In developed countries, strongyloidiasis remains a concern for immigrants, tourists, and military personnel returning from endemic areas. The review emphasizes the importance of systematic screening for S. stercoralis in these populations, particularly before initiation of immunosuppressive treatment.
Researchers have investigated the role of stochastic noise in circadian rhythms, which are internal biological processes that occur in living organisms over a 24-hour cycle. Stochastic noise refers to the random fluctuations that occur at the cellular level, influencing how groups of cells respond to external cues and generating cell-autonomous rhythms. Despite its importance, few studies have examined how clock perturbations, such as genetic or pharmacological interventions, affect stochastic noise. This is due to the difficulty in measuring cell-autonomous stochastic noise directly, which requires collecting and processing single-cell data.

A new study demonstrates that the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can serve as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise. The researchers used cell-autonomous fibroblast data to show that higher noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level. They also found that the damping rate of cultured cells can be changed in a dose-dependent fashion by small molecule modulators, and that this change can be explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model.

The study further demonstrates that applying this method to a genome-wide siRNA screen reveals that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase. The researchers hypothesize that the unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as few gene perturbations are capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering stochastic noise. This study highlights the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise, particularly in the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics.
Researchers investigated the binding pocket of PC190723, an inhibitor of the bacterial division protein FtsZ, across different bacterial species and genotypes. FtsZ is a promising target for new antibiotics due to its essential role in bacterial cell division. PC190723 has shown in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ and in vivo antimicrobial activity, but its mechanism of action and effect on FtsZ in other species are unclear. The researchers used a statistical method called PocketFEATURE to analyze the structural environment of the PC190723 binding pocket in FtsZ from various species, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli. They also performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding of PC190723 to FtsZ in different nucleotide-binding states and polymerization states.

The results showed that the structural properties of the binding site vary significantly across species and nucleotide-binding states. The researchers found that PC190723 strongly prefers to bind Staphylococcus FtsZ in the nucleotide-bound state and that polymerization may enhance PC190723 binding. The study demonstrates that the drug-binding pocket can vary significantly across species, genetic perturbations, and different polymerization states, providing important information for the development of FtsZ inhibitors. The findings suggest that PC190723 may be specifically effective for binding to Staphylococcus FtsZ proteins and their close relatives, and that the PocketFEATURE algorithm can aid in the design of alternative mutants with equivalent structural and chemical features.
Researchers have elucidated the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains of HIV-2 integrase (IN) in complex with the IN binding domain of lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF), a cellular protein essential for efficient lentiviral replication. The structure reveals primarily charge-charge interactions between the N-terminal domain of IN and the IN binding domain of LEDGF. A constellation of acidic residues on the N-terminal domain of IN is characteristic of lentiviral INs, and mutations of positively charged residues on the IN binding domain of LEDGF severely affect interaction with all lentiviral INs tested. The novel N-terminal domain-IN binding domain contacts are critical for stimulation of concerted lentiviral DNA integration by LEDGF in vitro and during the early steps of HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, the new structural details enabled the design of a mutant of HIV-1 IN that primarily functions only when presented with a complementary LEDGF mutant. This finding provides a structural basis for the high-affinity lentiviral IN-LEDGF interaction and paves the way for the development of LEDGF-based targeting technologies for gene therapy. The research highlights the importance of the N-terminal domain of IN and the IN binding domain of LEDGF in the interaction between lentiviral IN and LEDGF, and demonstrates the potential of this interaction as a target for therapeutic intervention.
Researchers investigated the evolution and phenotypic selection of cancer stem cells, which are responsible for initiating and sustaining tumors. They developed a cellular automaton model to track the temporal evolution of cancer stem cells and explored various cell traits, including cell migration, spontaneous cell death, symmetric cancer stem cell division, and telomere length and erosion. The study found that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth, with early increases in proliferation potential leading to larger populations of non-stem cancer cells that compete with cancer stem cells and inhibit their division. Conversely, a reduction in proliferation potential loosens this inhibition and facilitates frequent cancer stem cell division.

The sub-population of cancer stem cells becomes highly heterogeneous, dictating population-level dynamics that vary from long-term dormancy to aggressive progression. The study suggests that the clonal diversity captured in single tumor biopsy samples represents only a small proportion of the total number of phenotypes. The researchers identified a set of orthogonal cell kinetics, including cell migration rate, proliferation potential, spontaneous cell death, and symmetric cancer stem cell division, which influence tumor progression. They found that increased cell migration and symmetric cancer stem cell division always lead to accelerated tumor growth, while increased cell death counteracts cancer stem cell confinement and promotes self-metastatic tumor expansion.
Researchers investigated the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans, focusing on the role of spatial heterogeneity within the human population. They used mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios and calculated the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. The study found that for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has a weak effect on outbreak size distributions and the risk of emergence per introduction. In fact, if a village is connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day, it is effectively part of the city in terms of the chances of emergence and outbreak size distribution. Empirical data on commuting patterns showed that the vast majority of communities are at least this well interconnected. The study suggests that the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. The results imply that only the most remote rural communities would be subject to epidemiological isolation. The study's findings have implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections, highlighting the importance of considering the biology of the novel pathogen in understanding the emergence process.
Researchers analyzed genomic data from 287 avian influenza A virus (AIV) samples collected from North American migratory birds over a 34-year period. The study aimed to understand the patterns of viral spread and persistence in wild bird populations, which is crucial for predicting disease emergence and developing preparedness plans. The analysis revealed that the host population of Charadriiformes in Delaware Bay, a known hotspot for AIV, does not significantly contribute to the diversity of AIV in Anseriformes. In contrast, AIV sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta, Canada, represents the diversity of AIV circulating in North American Anseriformes. The study found that while AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, long-term persistence of the virus is independent of bird flyways, with migration between populations occurring throughout North America. The analysis of long-term surveillance data provides valuable insights for developing predictive models critical for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection. The study also highlights the importance of Anseriformes' social behavior in the persistence of the virus population, as breeding birds converging in Alberta facilitate the spread and generation of influenza virus genetic diversity.
Researchers have developed a novel monoclonal antibody, MAb S139/1, that targets a specific site on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza A viruses. This antibody was found to be broadly cross-reactive, meaning it can neutralize multiple subtypes of the virus, including H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13. In experiments, MAb S139/1 was shown to inhibit hemagglutination and neutralize viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo. The antibody's mechanism of action is thought to involve blocking the virus's ability to bind to host cells.

Sequence analysis of mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb S139/1 revealed amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193 of the HA protein. These substitutions were found to be located on the globular head of the HA protein and formed a novel conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain. Molecular modeling studies confirmed this finding.

Passive immunization of mice with MAb S139/1 provided heterosubtypic protection against influenza A virus infection. This suggests that cross-reactive antibodies like MAb S139/1 may play a role in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection. The study highlights the potential therapeutic utility of cross-reactive antibodies against influenza.
A three-year cohort study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment in controlling Strongyloides stercoralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population. The study involved 259 adult Aboriginals living in a remote community in northern Australia, where the initial prevalence of S. stercoralis infection was 35.3%. Participants were treated with ivermectin and followed up at 6 months and 3 years. The results showed that treatment with ivermectin was highly effective, with a sustained fall in the prevalence of infection from 35.3% to 5.8% over the 3-year period. The use of a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was also found to be valid in this setting. A small group of subjects with persistently positive ELISA serology despite repeated treatment was identified. The study suggests that control of S. stercoralis infection in this cohort is feasible using pharmacological treatment alone. The prevalence of S. stercoralis infection in this cohort fell to 1.4% 3 years after treatment, indicating the success of this treatment strategy. The study provides evidence that control of chronic S. stercoralis infection in an adult Aboriginal population may be achieved through a process of case finding and treatment, using current best practice guidelines for treatment.
Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded protein called PrPSc, which is hypothesized to be encoded by strain-specific conformations. Research has shown that prion strains can interfere with each other when a long-incubation period strain (blocking strain) inhibits the conversion of a short-incubation period strain (non-blocking strain). However, it was unknown whether two long-incubation period strains could interfere with each other. This study investigated the interaction between two long-incubation period strains and found that co-infection of animals with these strains did not result in strain interference. Using a laboratory technique called protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference (PMCAsi), the researchers confirmed that both strains were amplifying independently, suggesting that the lack of strain interference was not due to a failure to target the same cells, but rather an inherent property of the strains involved. The study also found that long-incubation period strains contained relatively higher levels of the normal prion protein (PrPC) compared to short-incubation period strains, which may contribute to their ability to amplify independently. This finding challenges the current understanding of prion strain interactions and has implications for interspecies transmission and the emergence of new prion strains from a mixture. The results suggest that not all prion strain combinations result in interference, and that strain diversity in naturally-infected animals may be greater than previously thought.
Researchers have proposed a comprehensive ensemble model to compare the roles of ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric regulation. Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are prevalent in allosteric regulation, and it was previously thought that intrinsic disorder is favorable for maximizing the allosteric coupling. However, the new model reveals that the MWC pathway (order-order transition) has a higher probability than the EAM pathway (disorder-order transition) in allostery, suggesting a complicated role of IDPs/IDRs in regulatory proteins.

The comprehensive ensemble model considers both order-disorder and order-order transitions, allowing for a full view of the competition between ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric effect. The results show that the order-disorder transition (EAM mechanism) is less competitive than the order-order transition (MWC mechanism) in affording allosteric effects, especially strong allostery. This suggests that the reasons for the prevalence of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation are more complicated than previously thought.

The model also provides an analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response, which shows that too stable or too unstable states are unfavorable for endowing allostery. This finding is helpful for the rational design of allosteric drugs. The study does not provide a complete answer to the question of how IDPs/IDRs implement allosteric effect under the lack of ordered structures, but it provides a new perspective on the role of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation based on the general landscape theory of protein structure.
Researchers have investigated the role of β-Catenin in prostate development and cancer using in vivo genetic studies in mice. They found that β-Catenin is essential for embryonic prostate growth and branching, controlling the number of progenitor cells in the epithelial buds and regulating specific genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3.1. However, in the normal adult prostate, β-Catenin is dispensable. In a model of castration-resistant prostate cancer, deletion of β-Catenin did not affect disease progression. Conversely, overexpression of β-Catenin promoted the formation of squamous epithelia during prostate development, even in the absence of androgens. When combined with Pten loss, β-Catenin overexpression drove the progression to invasive carcinoma and squamous metaplasia. These findings demonstrate that β-Catenin plays a crucial role in prostate development and that high levels of this protein can drive squamous fate differentiation. Furthermore, β-Catenin overexpression can promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of the disease. The study provides new insights into cancer progression pathways that contribute to lethal prostate disease in humans.
Researchers conducted a study in southern Ethiopia to understand the factors influencing informed consent in a low-income setting. The study aimed to design an appropriate consent process for a biomedical study on podoconiosis, a non-filarial elephantiasis. The researchers used a qualitative approach, involving focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews with podoconiosis patients, non-patients, fieldworkers, researchers, and community leaders.

The study found that the use of everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and the presentation of information significantly impacted comprehension of the research. Approaching patients through locally trusted individuals and preceding individual consent with community sensitization were considered the most effective means of communication. However, prevailing poverty, the absence of alternative treatment facilities, and participants' trust in the local non-governmental organization (NGO) working on podoconiosis prevention and treatment posed barriers to obtaining genuine informed consent.

The study highlighted the importance of understanding the social and cultural context of the community before seeking informed consent. Researchers should evaluate the effectiveness of consent processes on a study-by-study basis to ensure that participants receive appropriate information in a comprehensible manner and are able to make voluntary decisions. The study also emphasized the need for researchers to be aware of local beliefs and practices, such as the community's perception of podoconiosis as a genetic disease, and to adapt their approach accordingly.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the dynamics of T cell proliferation in the immune system. T cells are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the body's defense against infection and disease. The model uses data from single-cell experiments to simulate the behavior of T cells as they differentiate and proliferate in the thymus and spleen. The study found that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, meaning that different cells have different rates of growth and division. The model also revealed that the rate of T cell proliferation is influenced by the genetic background of the individual, with certain strains of mice having lower rates of proliferation than others. Additionally, the study found that the rate of T cell proliferation changes with age, with older mice having lower rates of proliferation than younger mice. The model was able to estimate the duration of different stages of the cell cycle, including the time spent in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases. The study provides new insights into the dynamics of T cell proliferation and highlights the importance of considering genetic background and age when studying the immune system. The model can be used to infer proliferation rates and cell cycle phase durations from experimental data, allowing for a better understanding of the complex processes involved in T cell development and function.
Researchers have identified a new mitochondrial tRNA mutation in mouse cells that recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of a disease-causing mutation found in humans. The mutation, an m. 3739G>A transition in the mitochondrial mt-Ti gene, leads to abnormal folding of the tRNAIle, which cannot be charged with isoleucine. This results in exacerbated mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by an increase in mitochondrial ROS production as a compensatory response. The study demonstrates that cells harboring the mutant tRNA have a higher ROS production, leading to a compensatory response that partially compensates for the deficiency.

The researchers propose that the nature of the pathogenic mechanism combined with the existence of a compensatory mechanism can explain the penetrance pattern of this mutation. They suggest that this particular behavior can allow for the evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs in which the fixation of two alleles that are individually deleterious can proceed in two steps, without requiring the simultaneous mutation of both. This is in contrast to protein-coding genes, where enhancing biogenesis of a deleterious mtDNA would be detrimental rather than compensatory.

The study highlights the different nature of mutations affecting protein-coding genes versus tRNA genes, with consequences for our understanding of pathology and evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs. The researchers also demonstrate the positive implication of ROS-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis in the expression of mitochondrial tRNA pathological mutations found in human patients.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the active X chromosome in human triploid cells, which have three sets of chromosomes instead of the usual two. They used expression arrays to compare the expression of X-linked and autosomal genes in triploid cells with one or two active X chromosomes. The results showed that the average expression ratio of X-linked genes to autosomal genes was lower in triploid cells with one active X and higher in triploid cells with two active X's compared to normal diploid cells. This suggests that X-linked gene expression is adjusted in response to the number of active X chromosomes.

In triploid cells with two active X's, the expression of X-linked genes was approximately doubled, similar to diploid cells. However, in triploid cells with one active X, X-linked gene expression was further increased, indicating an epigenetic adjustment in response to the X/autosome ratio. The researchers found that a small subset of X-linked genes had expression levels proportional to the number of autosomal sets, suggesting that these genes may be regulated in a dosage-sensitive manner.

The study found no evidence of a global change in absolute expression level per autosomal gene copy in triploid versus diploid cells, indicating that gene expression is strictly proportional to the number of autosomal sets. The results suggest that adjustments in gene expression in triploid cultures mostly affect X-linked genes, and that an epigenetic mechanism may sense the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets to adjust X-linked gene expression.
Researchers have re-examined the dN/dS ratio, a measure used to quantify evolutionary pressures on proteins, in the context of a single population. The dN/dS ratio compares the rate of substitutions at non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) sites. Traditionally, this measure has been applied to distantly diverged sequences, where differences represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. However, it is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, where differences represent segregating polymorphisms. The study found that in a single population, the dN/dS ratio is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Furthermore, the hallmark signature of positive selection, dN/dS > 1, is not observed within a population. The relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function in a single population, making it challenging to infer selection pressures from dN/dS measurements. This has significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples. The study suggests that standard tests for selection based on dN/dS are sensitive to the assumption of divergent lineages and may not accurately detect positive selection in conspecific samples. The results also indicate that the power of the dN/dS statistic to detect positive selection is low when the majority of sites in the protein evolve under purifying selection.
Researchers investigated the effect of natural selection on neutral genetic divergence between species. They found that neutral divergence between closely related species, such as humans and primates, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with human recombination rate. Similarly, neutral divergence between distantly related species, such as humans and rodents, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist after accounting for potential confounding factors. Coalescent models suggest that background selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome, even when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism is small. The study's findings indicate that natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. The results have implications for understanding the evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.
Researchers investigated the role of the CK2 kinase in the regulation of the Drosophila circadian oscillator. They found that CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes the CLOCK (CLK) protein, while also reducing its activity. This is in contrast to the CK1 kinase, which promotes CLK degradation. The regulatory β subunit of the CK2 holoenzyme is not required for the regulation of CLK stability. Downregulating the activity of the catalytic α subunit of CK2 leads to CLK degradation, even in the absence of the PER and TIM proteins, which normally inhibit CLK transcriptional activity. This suggests that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. The results indicate that CLK stability and transcriptional activity result from counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2. The study provides new insights into the phosphorylation mechanisms underlying the Drosophila circadian clock and identifies CK2 as a key player in regulating CLK stability and activity. The findings have implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing circadian oscillations in Drosophila and potentially other organisms.
Researchers investigated the role of cruzipain, a cysteine peptidase, in the interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas' disease, and its insect vector, Rhodnius prolixus. The study aimed to determine whether cruzipain contributes to the parasite's adhesion to the insect's midgut. To achieve this, the researchers treated T. cruzi epimastigotes with anti-cruzipain antibodies or a panel of cysteine peptidase inhibitors, including cystatin, antipain, E-64, leupeptin, iodocetamide, and CA-074-OMe. The results showed that all treatments, except CA-074-OMe, significantly reduced parasite adhesion to R. prolixus midgut, with cystatin exhibiting a dose-dependent reduction. The study also compared the adhesion rates of different T. cruzi isolates and found that the G isolate, which naturally possesses low levels of active cruzipain, adhered less to the insect gut compared to other isolates. Furthermore, transgenic epimastigotes overexpressing an endogenous cruzipain inhibitor, chagasin, had reduced levels of active cruzipain and adhered to the insect gut 73% less than wild-type parasites. The addition of exogenous cruzipain partially restored the adhesion of these parasites. In vivo colonization experiments revealed that the chagasin-overexpressing parasites had low levels of colonization in the insect, but parasites isolated after passage in the insect showed a drastic enhancement in the expression of surface cruzipain. These findings highlight the role of cruzipain in the interaction between T. cruzi and its insect host.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNA interference screen in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genes that modify the function of cytoplasmic dynein, a microtubule-dependent motor protein essential for various cellular processes, including mitosis. They isolated 20 dynein-specific suppressor genes, which, when reduced in function, suppressed dynein mutants but not other conditionally mutant loci. Twelve of these suppressors did not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function was reduced in wild-type worms. Many of the suppressor proteins, including two dynein light chains, localized to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported for the dynein heavy chain. Knocking down any one of four putative dynein accessory chains also suppressed the conditional heavy chain mutants, suggesting that some accessory chains negatively regulate heavy chain function. In addition, the researchers identified 29 genes that, when reduced in function, suppressed conditional mutations not only in dynein but also in loci required for unrelated essential processes. These findings suggest that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during mitosis. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms that regulate and mediate the various requirements for cytoplasmic dynein during mitosis.
Researchers studied the process of programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, a unicellular eukaryote with a unique nuclear dimorphism. During PGR, the somatic nucleus is destroyed and a new one differentiates from a copy of the germline nucleus, involving the precise elimination of at least 45,000 germline sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES). This process requires the repair of a huge number of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to assemble functional somatic chromosomes.

The researchers focused on Ku, a key component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is essential for DSB repair. They found that two Ku70 and three Ku80 paralogs are encoded in the P. tetraurelia genome, with Ku70a and Ku80c being produced during sexual processes and localizing specifically in the developing new somatic nucleus. Using RNA interference, they showed that the development-specific Ku70/Ku80c heterodimer is essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus.

Furthermore, they discovered that PiggyMac-dependent DNA cleavage is abolished at IES boundaries in cells depleted for Ku80c, resulting in IES retention in the somatic genome. The researchers also found that PiggyMac and Ku70a/Ku80c co-purify as a complex when overproduced in a heterologous system. These findings suggest that Ku has been integrated into the Paramecium DNA cleavage factory, enabling tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair during PGR.
Researchers studied the early stages of prion disease in mice to understand the molecular events leading to neuronal damage and death. They isolated hippocampal CA1 neurons from infected mice using laser capture microdissection and analyzed their gene expression at different stages of the disease. The study found that gene expression in these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases of activity. A cluster of genes involved in synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor signaling and neuroprotective pathways was altered during the pre-clinical phase of the disease. Additionally, genes related to neuronal projection and dendrite development were also affected, leading to a decline in synaptic protein expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) such as miR-132-3p, miR-124a-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-29a-3p, and miR-140-5p showed concomitant patterns of expression. These findings suggest that prion replication triggers a programmed response in hippocampal neurons, mediated by synaptic NMDA receptor activity that initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodeling. However, this response is terminated before the onset of clinical symptoms, indicating a critical juncture in the disease. The study's results provide new insights into the early mechanisms of prion pathobiology and suggest potential therapeutic targets for manipulating early neuroprotective pathways to prevent neuronal degeneration.
Researchers have developed a computer model, known as a Petri net model, to simulate the formation and function of granulomas in the liver of mice infected with the parasite Leishmania donovani. Granulomas are clusters of immune cells that form in response to the infection and play a crucial role in eliminating the parasite. The model was validated by comparing its predictions with data from experimental studies in mice and was found to accurately replicate the progression of the disease and the changes in cellular composition within the granulomas over time.

The model revealed a previously unknown level of diversity in the development of anti-parasite activity among different granulomas. Additionally, the researchers used the model to investigate the role of the cytokine IL-10 in controlling the infection. They found that IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells, a type of immune cell, plays a dominant role in regulating the immune response within the granuloma.

The study suggests that IL-10 helps to control the parasite load by modulating the activity of immune cells within the granuloma. However, the model only simulates events within the granuloma and does not account for the potential effects of IL-10 on the immune response in other parts of the body. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of granuloma formation and function, and highlight the importance of IL-10 in controlling Leishmania donovani infection.
Researchers have explored the idea that the transcriptional regulatory machinery of a gene can be viewed as a computational device, with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression level as the output. By analyzing a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation, the authors demonstrate that different parameterizations of this model can approximate various arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as inequality and equality operations. This is in contrast to previous studies that focused on logical or digital notions of computation in biological networks. The accuracy and precision of these approximations depend on different sets of parameters, which can be independently tuned. The authors also show that networks of these "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complex computations, such as detecting statistically significant elevations in a time-varying signal. Furthermore, they demonstrate that multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter can be used to approximate analytic functions. These findings have implications for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and suggest new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks.
A recent outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Northeast region of Brazil has been found to be caused by multiple genotypes of the virus. Genome sequencing of clinical samples revealed that both the Asian/Caribbean and African ECSA genotypes of CHIKV are cocirculating in the region. Furthermore, the study found evidence of simultaneous infection by both genotypes in at least six clinical samples, suggesting that coinfection may be more common than previously thought in highly endemic areas. This is the first time that simultaneous infection by two different CHIKV genotypes has been reported in the same region. The study used an in-house developed Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol to directly detect multiple known CHIKV genotypes from clinical positive samples. The findings of this study highlight the importance of considering the possibility of coinfection by different genotypes in the human population when understanding CHIKV epidemiology. CHIKV has caused significant health and economic burden worldwide, and its rapid spread in a large naive human population in Brazil has led to several outbreaks. The study's results provide valuable insights into the epidemiology and evolution of CHIKV in Brazil, which is essential for developing effective control and prevention strategies.
The bacterial modulator H-NS plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to external stimuli, such as osmolarity and temperature. Research has shown that H-NS targets both core genome and horizontally acquired (HGT) genes, silencing their expression. However, a new study reveals that H-NS discriminates between core and HGT DNA, differentially modulating their expression. Specifically, plasmid-encoded H-NS proteins selectively silence HGT genes without interfering with core genome regulation. In contrast, chromosomally-encoded H-NS requires a helper protein, Hha, to specifically silence HGT genes, while modulating core genes through H-NS homoligomers. The presence of Hha-like proteins is restricted to the Enterobacteriaceae family, and conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have only been isolated from members of this family. This unique feature of the H-NS system in enteric bacteria allows for the selective discrimination between core and HGT DNA, potentially maintaining horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent state and providing a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
Researchers compared the gene expression profiles of three Leishmania species, L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis, which cause different forms of leishmaniasis in humans. The study aimed to identify genes that are differentially expressed in the disease-promoting intracellular amastigotes of these species. Genome sequencing revealed that the three species have highly conserved gene content and synteny, with only a small number of genes differentially distributed between them. Customized oligonucleotide microarrays were used to confirm that the differentially distributed genes are expressed in intracellular amastigotes, with only a few subject to regulation at the RNA level. The study found that approximately 9% of the genes analyzed are regulated in their RNA expression during the L. braziliensis life cycle, a figure consistent with other Leishmania species. Comparing amastigote gene expression profiles between species revealed that Leishmania transcriptomes undergo little regulation, but also identified conserved genes that are regulated differently between species in the host. The study also investigated whether host immune competence influences parasite gene expression by comparing RNA expression profiles in L. major amastigotes derived from wild-type and immunologically compromised mice. The results suggest that Leishmania amastigotes are pre-adapted for intracellular survival and undergo little dynamic modulation of gene expression at the RNA level. The findings support the hypothesis that species-specific parasite factors contributing to virulence and pathogenicity in the host may be limited to the products of a small number of differentially distributed genes or the differential regulation of conserved genes.
Researchers have developed a novel Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay, named LAMPhimerus, to detect Amphimerus sp. DNA in human stool samples. Amphimeriasis is a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp., which has been reported as endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador. Current diagnosis relies on stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but this method lacks sensitivity and can be confounded by other liver and intestinal flukes. The new LAMP assay targets a specific sequence of the Amphimerus sp. internal transcribed spacer 2 region and has been optimized for sensitivity and specificity. Field testing of 44 human stool samples from endemic areas showed that the LAMPhimerus assay had a sensitivity of 76.67% and a specificity of 80.77%. The detection limit of the assay was 1 pg of genomic DNA. The LAMPhimerus assay has the potential to be adapted for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphimeriasis-endemic areas, particularly in regions with limited resources. The assay has been shown to be highly specific for Amphimerus sp. and can be used to diagnose both infected animals and humans. Future large-scale studies will assess the applicability of this novel LAMP assay for the diagnosis of amphimeriasis.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the SNARE protein Ykt6 in the process of autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion is a critical step in autophagy, a cellular process that breaks down and recycles damaged or dysfunctional cellular components. The study found that Ykt6 forms a complex with other SNARE proteins, including Syx17 and Snap29, and is essential for autophagosome clearance in Drosophila larval fat cells. Loss of Ykt6 leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes that are unable to fuse with lysosomes, resulting in impaired autophagy.

The researchers also found that Ykt6 localizes to lysosomes and autolysosomes, and forms a SNARE complex with Syx17 and Snap29. However, Ykt6 can be outcompeted from this complex by Vamp7, another SNARE protein. Overexpression of Vamp7 rescues the fusion defect in Ykt6 loss-of-function cells, suggesting that Vamp7 plays a direct role in membrane fusion. The study also identified a point mutant form of Ykt6 that retains normal autophagic activity and restores full viability in mutant animals.

These findings suggest that Ykt6 acts as a non-conventional, regulatory SNARE in the process of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, while Vamp7 is directly involved in membrane fusion. The study provides new insights into the complex machinery that mediates autophagosome-lysosome fusion in metazoans, and highlights the importance of Ykt6 in this process.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a crucial role in the host's innate immune defense against bacterial infections. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI), a commensal inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa, can cause opportunistic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. To evade the bactericidal effects of AMPs, NTHI has developed a mechanism to resist these peptides. The Sap ABC transporter, which includes the periplasmic binding protein SapA, is responsible for this resistance.

Research has shown that SapA binds to AMPs and is essential for NTHI virulence in vivo. A recent study demonstrated that SapA directly counteracts AMP lethality during NTHI infection by delivering AMPs to the bacterial cytoplasm, where they are susceptible to degradation by cytoplasmic peptidase activity. In contrast, AMPs accumulate in the periplasm of bacteria lacking a functional Sap permease complex.

This novel mechanism of Sap-mediated import of AMPs reduces their accumulation in the periplasm and inner membrane, allowing NTHI to evade the host's innate immune defense. The study provides the first direct evidence that SapA contributes to bacterial virulence by conferring protection from AMP lethality in vivo. The findings suggest that the Sap ABC transporter plays a critical role in NTHI's ability to colonize the host and cause disease.
Researchers investigated the role of active degradation in the regulation of the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA in Escherichia coli. MarA has a short half-life of 1-3 minutes due to Lon protease activity and regulates over 60 downstream targets involved in antibiotic resistance and stress response. By modifying MarA's half-life using CRISPRi or engineering it to protect it from degradation, the researchers found that active degradation affects both the rate and maximum coordination of downstream genes. The results show that increasing MarA's half-life increases the maximum coordinated diversity between downstream genes, but the rate at which coordination is achieved differs between the wild-type and modified MarA. The study suggests that active degradation may allow for a more responsive and agile signaling network, enabling a few remaining cells to rapidly generate phenotypic diversity following antibiotic challenge. In the context of multi-gene regulation, the study highlights a trade-off between perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination, indicating that these two properties cannot coexist. The findings provide new insights into the utility of active degradation in shaping the regulation of MarA and its downstream targets in E. coli.
Researchers investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MKP-2) in the immune response to Leishmania major infection in mice. In a previous study, MKP-2 deficient mice were found to be more susceptible to Leishmania mexicana infection due to increased Arginase-1 levels and reduced iNOS activity in macrophages, as well as a diminished TH1 response. However, in this study, MKP-2 deficient mice infected with Leishmania major showed a similar healing response to wild-type mice, with no significant difference in lesion size or parasite numbers. Analysis of immune responses revealed a reduced TH1 response in MKP-2 deficient mice, characterized by lower levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as lower antigen-stimulated spleen cell IFN-γ production. Notably, MKP-2 deficient mice also had reduced levels of IL-4 production and parasite-specific IgG1 in the serum, indicating a general T cell hypo-responsiveness. Despite this, the overall TH1/TH2 balance was unaltered in MKP-2 deficient mice compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, MKP-2 deficient macrophages were equally effective as wild-type macrophages in controlling parasite growth when activated with LPS/IFN-γ. These findings suggest that the absence of MKP-2 does not significantly alter the disease phenotype in Leishmania major infection.
Researchers have investigated the formation and development of the ductal network in the pancreas, a branched organ that does not exhibit stereotypic branching patterns. By analyzing the network properties at different developmental stages, the study found that the pancreatic network exhibits stereotypic traits at each stage and changes systematically as the pancreas matures. The researchers used in silico modeling to deconstruct the main steps of network development into a set of simple rules. They found that the early stage of the network can be explained by noisy, redundant duct connection as new microlumens form, while the later transition is attributed to pruning of the network based on the flux of fluid running through the pancreatic network into the duodenum. The study reveals that the pancreatic ductal system has stereotypic traits at each stage and that its remodeling can be quantified by standard network measures. The findings suggest that the organ-forming rules proposed here are likely to be conserved for many other glands that exhibit connecting microlumens, such as the salivary gland. The study provides new insights into the development of the pancreas and has implications for understanding the development of other glands that secrete fluid.
Researchers have mapped the structural and dynamical features of the kinesin motor domain, which drives intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes along microtubules. A comprehensive analysis of 114 experimental structures and molecular dynamics simulations revealed three distinct conformational clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5 inhibitor-bound. These groups differ in the orientation of key functional elements, including the microtubule-binding α4–α5 subdomain, loop8 subdomain, and α2b-β4-β6-β7 motor domain tip. However, group membership does not correlate with the nature of the bound nucleotide.

Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of ATP, ADP, and nucleotide-free Eg5 indicate that all three nucleotide states can sample the major crystallographically observed conformations. The simulations also show differences in the dynamic coupling of distal sites, with the neck-linker, loop8, and α4–α5 subdomain displaying correlated motions in ATP-bound simulations that are absent in ADP-bound simulations. The results suggest a network of dynamic communication between the active site, microtubule-binding interface, and neck-linker via loop7 and loop13.

The simulations also highlight sites critical for large-scale conformational changes and allosteric coupling between distal functional sites. Mutations G325A and G326A in loop13 reduce the flexibility of these regions and disrupt their couplings. The combined results indicate that the reported ATP and ADP-like conformations of kinesin are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide state and support a model where neck-linker docking leads to a tighter coupling of the microtubule and nucleotide binding regions.
Researchers have developed a new approach to accurately interpret bioluminescent data from the Lux system, a widely used gene expression reporter. The Lux system, originally developed for bacterial cells, has been adapted for eukaryotic cells and can be used in real-time with live animals without euthanasia. However, interpreting bioluminescent data has been limited due to nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. A new mathematical model has been created to relate gene expression to light output, taking into account the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC, and Fre enzymes, as well as protein synthesis and turnover. The model was calibrated with experimental data from Photorhabdus luminescens, the source of modern Lux reporters, and literature data for LuxEC. The model shows that bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian inference scheme, researchers can reverse-engineer promoter activity from bioluminescence. This approach can be applied to experiments using Lux reporter assays, allowing for more accurate interpretation of bioluminescent data. The model also accounts for product inhibition of the LuxAB reaction by FMNH2, a previously unreported mechanism. This new approach can benefit all users of Lux technology, including those studying gene expression and antimicrobial resistance.
Researchers have elucidated the structure of coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) in complex with a capsid binder called GPP3, which has been shown to inhibit the replication of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and CVA16, the primary causes of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. The crystal structure of CVA16 in complex with GPP3 reveals the key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. Using this model, the researchers performed in silico docking to investigate the interactions with two next-generation capsid binders, NLD and ALD, which were found to be potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with promising pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis was conducted to identify the structural features required for capsid binders to interact effectively and those that confer broad-spectrum anti-enterovirus activity.

The researchers also analyzed the structural and in silico results in the context of the antiviral activity of these inhibitors against a wide range of enteroviruses, demonstrating their potency and broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Two recently designed capsid binders, NLD and ALD, were docked into the CVA16 crystal structure, showing a similar binding mode to GPP3. The antiviral activity of these inhibitors was tested against a panel of enteroviruses, and structural comparisons were used to correlate structural features with differences in antiviral activity. The results suggest that NLD has potential as a candidate for a HFMD drug. The study highlights the importance of the hydrophobic pocket below the canyon in VP1 as a target for the development of novel inhibitors that target the early stage of enterovirus infection.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the serpin Necrotic plays a crucial role in regulating the humoral response to fungal and Gram-positive infections. Following immune challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated, which signals through the Toll receptor, leading to the synthesis of antibiotic peptides in the fat-body and their export to the haemolymph. The serpin Necrotic is synthesized in the fat-body, but its site of degradation has been unclear. Using a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation to "freeze" endocytosis, researchers found that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph in two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. The serpin is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localizes with the ubiquitin-binding protein HRS.

The researchers identified the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (LpR1) as an enhancer of the immune response and found that uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LpR1. Knockdown of the Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian LDL receptor family with dsRNA also identified LpR1 as the receptor responsible for the uptake and degradation of Necrotic. The scavenging of serpin/proteinase complexes may be a critical step in the regulation of proteolytic cascades. In the absence of infection, the Toll-mediated immune response is constitutively activated in Nec null mutants, implying that Nec continually restrains this immune response.
Researchers investigated the role of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry in sea urchin larvae. Nodal signaling is known to prevent the formation of the rudiment on the right side, but the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling was unclear. The study found that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, and is required for the expression of left-sided genes and the formation of left-sided structures. In contrast, Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling, controlling LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of small micromeres. The results suggest that BMP signaling is the positive signal for left-sided development in sea urchins, indicating that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved in deuterostomes. The study also found that BMP signaling is required for proper LR patterning and the expression of left-sided genes in the sea urchin embryo. Furthermore, BMP signaling is necessary for right-sided Nodal expression, which has also been observed in vertebrates. The findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of LR asymmetry in sea urchin embryos and shed light on the conserved mechanisms of Nodal and BMP signaling in deuterostomes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) lytic infection is strictly synchronized with the host cell cycle, with infected G0/G1 cells supporting viral immediate early (IE) gene expression and proceeding to the G1/S boundary where they arrest. In contrast, S/G2 cells can be infected but effectively block IE gene expression, which is not relieved until host cells have divided and re-entered G1. This block to IE gene expression is also observed during latent infection and must be overcome for reactivation to occur.

Research has shown that the block to IE gene expression during S and G2 phases can be overcome by genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of cellular DNA replication, indicating the involvement of checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways. Checkpoint-dependent rescue of IE expression requires p53 and is mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in a p53-dependent manner. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 is also required downstream of p53, suggesting a pivotal role for CDKs in controlling IE gene repression in S/G2.

Treatment of S/G2 cells with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine alleviates IE repression independently of p53, and CDK inhibition also overcomes the block to IE expression during quiescent infection of NTera2 cells. These findings suggest that a timely block to CDK activity secures phase specificity of the cell cycle-dependent HCMV IE gene expression program and plays a previously unrecognized role in preventing the establishment of a latent-like state.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism by which some individuals, known as HIV-1 elite controllers, are able to restrict the replication of the HIV-1 virus. These individuals have highly functional HIV-1-specific T cell responses, which play a crucial role in controlling the virus. However, the mechanisms behind the development of these effective T cell responses were not well understood. The study found that dendritic cells, a type of immune cell, from HIV-1 elite controllers are able to recognize and respond to HIV-1 through a cell-intrinsic immune response. This response involves the rapid and sustained production of type I interferons and the upregulation of several interferon-stimulated effector genes. The study also found that this response is associated with a reduced induction of SAMHD1 and LEDGF/p75, and an accumulation of viral reverse transcripts. Importantly, the improved cell-intrinsic immune recognition of HIV-1 in dendritic cells from elite controllers translated into stronger abilities to stimulate and expand HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses. These findings suggest that cell-intrinsic type I interferon secretion in dendritic cells plays a critical role in the induction of effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells, and may have implications for the development of immunologic approaches for HIV-1 treatment and prevention.
Researchers have developed a new screening method to identify genes that regulate fat storage in Drosophila larvae. This method, based on buoyancy, allows for the detection of larvae with increased levels of stored fat. Using this approach, 66 genes were identified, including Sir2, a sirtuin family member. Sir2 regulates the storage and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids by deacetylating key regulatory proteins. The study found that knockdown of Sir2 in the larval fat body results in increased fat levels, and that Sir2 restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the fat body in a cell-autonomous manner. Changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes in Sir2 mutants point to a shift away from catabolism. Surprisingly, Sir2 mutant larvae survive better than wild-type larvae under conditions of amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided. The findings suggest that Sir2 mediates a pathway that activates a catabolic response to amino-acid starvation, regardless of the sugar content of the diet. This study highlights the potential of genetic screens in invertebrates to identify genes and pathways that regulate fat storage, which are likely to be conserved in humans. The results also implicate Sir2 as a key regulator in the switch from utilizing ingested nutrients to stored fat as an energy source.
Researchers studied the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes, closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, to understand the evolution of asymmetric cell division. Asymmetric cell division is essential for generating cellular diversity, and the mitotic spindle plays a crucial role in determining the size and fate of daughter cells. The study recorded the first embryonic division of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabditis and 15 non-Caenorhabditis species, providing a large collection of subcellular phenotypes to study the evolution of various cellular processes.

The results showed that all species underwent an asymmetric first cell division, but exhibited large variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and spindle movement parameters, including spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. These parameters changed frequently during evolution, with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, except for spindle transverse oscillations, which were an evolutionary innovation at the base of the Caenorhabditis genus. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently, contrasting with expectations based on C. elegans studies.

The findings demonstrate that while the essential process of asymmetric cell division has been conserved over the course of nematode evolution, the underlying spindle movement parameters can combine in various ways. This suggests that asymmetric cell division is subject to system drift, like other developmental processes. The study provides new insights into the evolution of spindle mechanics and highlights the complexity of asymmetric cell division in nematodes.
The study investigated the evolution of the OmpR regulon in Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), two closely related bacteria with identical OmpR proteins. Despite their identical amino acid sequences, the OmpR regulons of S. Typhimurium and E. coli exhibit distinct responses to acid stress, with S. Typhimurium showing elevated OmpR expression and binding to its targets in response to low pH. In contrast, E. coli does not exhibit this response. The study found that the promoter regions of the ompR genes in S. Typhimurium and E. coli differ, and that introducing the S. Typhimurium promoter region into E. coli makes its OmpR gene acid-inducible. The OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium overlaps with that of E. coli at only 15 genes, and includes many horizontally acquired genes, including virulence genes, that are not present in E. coli. The study also found that OmpR binds to its targets in higher abundance when the DNA is relaxed, which occurs in S. Typhimurium as a result of acid stress, and is a requirement for optimal expression of its virulence genes. The study proposes that the ability of OmpR to recruit additional genes to its regulon arises from its modest requirements for specificity in its DNA targets, allowing it to cooperate with DNA-topology-based allostery to modulate transcription in response to acid stress.
Researchers have identified a novel protein, named Nuclear Effector (NUE), secreted by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. NUE contains a SET domain, characteristic of histone methyltransferases, and is translocated to the host cell nucleus during infection. The protein associates with chromatin and exhibits enzymatic activity as a histone methyltransferase, targeting histones H2B, H3, and H4, as well as itself in a process called automethylation. Automethylation appears to enhance NUE's enzymatic activity, increasing its affinity for target substrates.

In vitro assays confirmed NUE's ability to methylate mammalian histones, with a preference for histone H2B over a chlamydial histone, Hc1. The study demonstrates that NUE is the first bacterial effector protein to directly target mammalian histones in the host cell nucleus. The researchers propose designating CT737 and its homologs in other chlamydiae genomes as NUE, due to its unique role as a nuclear effector.

The findings suggest that NUE plays a crucial role in Chlamydia infection, but the specific genes regulated by NUE translocation in the nucleus remain unknown due to the lack of a genetic system to manipulate Chlamydia. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of Chlamydia infection and highlights the importance of further research into the functions of NUE in the host-pathogen interaction.
A recent study investigated the potential role of recessive genetic effects on human height by analyzing data from over 35,000 individuals from 21 different population samples. The researchers found a significant inverse association between genome-wide homozygosity and height, indicating that inbreeding depression may contribute to reduced height. Specifically, the study found that the offspring of first cousins had a height reduction of up to 3 cm compared to the offspring of unrelated individuals. This effect remained significant even after controlling for socio-economic status, a potential confounding factor. The study used three different measures of genomic homozygosity, each capturing a distinct aspect of the phenomenon, and found that all three measures were strongly correlated but also showed some differences. The results suggest that multiple, rare, recessive variants influence human height, and the study's methodology can be applied to investigate inbreeding effects on other heritable traits. The findings provide evidence for a polygenic recessive component in the genetic architecture of height, supporting the idea that many genetic variants of small effect size contribute to the heritability of height. The study's results have implications for understanding the genetic basis of human height and may pave the way for further research into the genetic architecture of other heritable traits.
Researchers have identified a distinct peripheral blood monocyte (MO) phenotype associated with anti-parasitic activity in patients with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Using flow cytometry, the study characterized the MO subpopulations in healthy malaria-exposed individuals and patients with acute uncomplicated malaria. The results showed that patients with high percentages and absolute numbers of CD16+ MO and CCR2+CX3CR1+ MO had a lower parasite load compared to those with low numbers of these MO subpopulations. Specifically, patients with high levels of CD14high (hi) CCR2+CX3CR1+ MO and strong antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) activity had lower blood parasitemias.

The study found two subgroups of patients with different MO phenotypes. Group 1 patients, characterized by elevated percentages of CD14hi CCR2+CX3CR1+ MO, had a low mean parasitemia. In contrast, Group 2 patients had low percentages of these MO subpopulations and higher parasitemias. The results suggest a causal association between the MO subpopulations and anti-parasitic activity, as patients with high levels of CCR2, CX3CR1, CD56, mTNF-α, and mIFN-γ-expressing MO had lower parasitemias and strong ADCI activity. The study also found increased expression of TREM-1, a marker of inflammatory MO, in patients with acute uncomplicated malaria compared to healthy malaria-exposed controls. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the complex relationships between MO phenotypes and functional activity in patients and healthy malaria-exposed individuals.
A cross-sectional study of 34 HIV- and malaria-uninfected Ugandan men who underwent elective circumcision found that Schistosoma mansoni infection was associated with an increased abundance and function of HIV target cells in the blood, but not the foreskin. The study aimed to investigate whether S. mansoni infection, which has been linked to an increased HIV prevalence in humans and SHIV incidence in primate models, would increase the frequency and activation of highly HIV-susceptible CD4 T cell subsets in the blood and foreskin through common mucosal homing.

The results showed that S. mansoni-infected men had a higher frequency of systemic Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells in the blood compared to uninfected men. Additionally, Th17 cells in the blood of S. mansoni-infected men demonstrated enhanced function, producing more pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, these immune alterations were not observed in the foreskin tissue. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection is associated with an increased frequency of highly HIV-susceptible T cell subsets in the blood, but these changes do not extend to the foreskin, which is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual Ugandan men. The findings imply that S. mansoni-induced changes in T cell immunology mediated through the common mucosal immune system are unlikely to increase HIV susceptibility in the foreskin.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the endosymbiont Wolbachia and filarial nematodes, which cause diseases such as river blindness and elephantiasis. Filarial nematodes rely on Wolbachia for their development, fertility, and viability. Depleting Wolbachia using antibiotics has been shown to be an effective approach for treating filarial diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study used whole mount confocal microscopy to examine the effects of Wolbachia depletion on filarial nematodes. The results show that depletion of Wolbachia leads to extensive apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in the adult germline, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilariae and fourth-stage larvae. Notably, apoptosis occurs in the majority of embryonic cells that were not infected with Wolbachia prior to antibiotic treatment. The study also found that the hypodermal chords, which are populated with large numbers of Wolbachia, do not undergo apoptosis, but do experience disruption of their cytoskeleton following Wolbachia depletion. The pattern of apoptosis correlates closely with the nematode tissues and processes that are initially perturbed following Wolbachia depletion, including embryogenesis and long-term sterilization. These findings provide a cellular mechanism to explain the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occur prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of action of antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, which target the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum's coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway. These analogues, including pantothenol and CJ-15,801, kill the parasite by interfering with CoA production or utilization. However, the exact mechanism of action of these compounds has remained unclear. To address this, researchers used continuous drug-pressuring with pantothenol or CJ-15,801 to generate parasite lines resistant to these analogues. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in the pantothenate kinase (PfPanK) gene, Pfpank1, in all resistant lines. These mutations significantly altered PfPanK activity, with some conferring a fitness cost, indicating that Pfpank1 codes for a functional PanK essential for normal growth. The mutants exhibited different sensitivity profiles to various pantothenate analogues, with one line being hypersensitive. This suggests that different classes of pantothenate analogues have distinct mechanisms of action, with some inhibiting CoA biosynthesis and others inhibiting CoA-utilizing enzymes. The study provides genetic evidence supporting the importance of metabolic activation of pantothenate analogues in their antiplasmodial activity. The findings have implications for the development of new antiplasmodial agents targeting the CoA biosynthetic pathway.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with the PR interval, a measure of atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time, in African Americans. The study analyzed data from four cohorts of African American individuals, totaling 6,247 participants, using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray. Imputation was performed for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using combined YRI and CEU HapMap phase II panels. A strong signal was observed in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the cardiac sodium channel, with a genome-wide significant association (p<2.5×10−8) in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans, with a beta value of 5.1 msec per minor allele (95% CI = 4.1-6.1, p=3×10−23). This variant was also associated with PR interval in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size and variability explained. Further meta-analysis identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A, MEIS1, and TBX5, which were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian genome-wide association studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration in one cohort, but not in the other three. The study demonstrates the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples, and identifies an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.
Researchers have identified a small GTP-binding protein called ARL8 that plays a crucial role in the replication of the Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). ToMV is a type of virus that infects plants and replicates its genetic material in the cells' membranes. The study found that ARL8 forms a complex with another protein called TOM1 and the ToMV replication proteins on the membranes of infected plant cells. This complex is necessary for the efficient replication of the virus.

The researchers used a technique called co-purification to show that ARL8 and TOM1 are associated with the ToMV replication proteins in infected cells. They also found that when ARL8 and TOM1 are present, the ToMV replication proteins are able to synthesize new RNA and add a cap to the 5' end of the RNA, which is a crucial step in the replication process.

In addition, the study found that mutations in the ARL8 gene completely inhibited the multiplication of ToMV in Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of plant. This suggests that ARL8 is essential for the replication of the virus. The researchers also showed that the ToMV 130K protein, which is responsible for adding the cap to the RNA, requires both TOM1 and ARL8 to function properly.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of ToMV replication and highlights the importance of ARL8 and TOM1 in this process. The findings have implications for the development of new strategies to control the spread of ToMV and other eukaryotic positive-strand RNA viruses.
Researchers investigated the role of feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibition in a basic olfactory circuit in locusts. Inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons in many brain systems. Two basic motifs, FF and FB inhibition, have been identified in various neuronal circuits. In the locust, a subset of lateral horn interneurons (LHNs) was thought to provide FF inhibition onto Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain their sparse firing. However, a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), was found to be the main source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and its inhibition is mediated by a FB loop including KCs and the GGN.

Using a model of the locust olfactory system, researchers found that both FF and FB inhibition were able to maintain sparse KC responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition could create a phase response consistent with data recorded in vivo. The findings suggest that the GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to the KCs. The study highlights the importance of understanding how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity, which could reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks. The results provide general rules for FF versus FB inhibition and have implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying olfactory learning and memory.
A novel dual combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay has been developed for the diagnosis of lyssavirus infection, including rabies, in animals and humans. This assay combines two complementary techniques: a probe-based RT-qPCR for detecting the rabies virus species (pan-RABV RT-qPCR) and a second reaction using an intercalating dye (SYBR Green) to detect other lyssavirus species (pan-lyssa RT-qPCR). The performance of this combined assay was evaluated with a large panel of primary animal samples covering almost all genetic variability encountered at the viral species level. The assay was also evaluated for the diagnosis of human rabies on 211 biological samples, including saliva, skin, and brain biopsies. The results showed that the assay detected all 41 human cases of rabies tested and confirmed the sensitivity and interest of skin biopsy (91.5%) and saliva (54%) samples for intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies. The assay was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries (Cambodia and Morocco). This combined RT-qPCR method constitutes a relevant and useful tool for the diagnosis of rabies in both humans and animals, and represents a promising tool for lyssavirus surveillance. The assay has high sensitivity and specificity, and is able to detect a large panel of animal lyssavirus samples.
In the Eastern Region of Ghana, an outbreak of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis resulted in over 50% losses of domestic pigs in 2007. To mitigate this issue, a control trial was conducted from May to October 2007 to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito fences in controlling tsetse flies. Two villages were selected, one as a control and the other as an experimental site where 24 pigsties were protected with insecticide-treated mosquito fences. The fences, made of 100 cm high, 150 denier polyester with 100 mg/m2 deltamethrin and a UV protector, were attached to surrounding timber poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring of tsetse densities using geo-referenced bi-conical traps showed a significant reduction of over 90% in the protected village within two months, with further reductions exceeding 95% in subsequent months. In contrast, the tsetse population in the control village remained unaffected, displaying only seasonal variations. The trypanosome prevalence in pigs was also significantly reduced in the protected village, from 76% to 16% after three months, compared to 84% in the control village. After six months, 8% of the protected pigs were infected, compared to 60% in the control group. The results suggest that insecticide-treated mosquito fences are an effective and sustainable method for controlling tsetse flies and reducing the risk of trypanosomiasis in domestic pigs in resource-poor areas of Ghana.
A recent survey of 441 biomedical journal articles published between 2000 and 2014 assessed the current status of reproducibility and transparency in the scientific community. The study found that only one article provided a full protocol, and none made raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare, with only four identified, and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention funding or conflicts of interest, although there was a significant decrease in the percentage of articles with no statement of conflict over the 15-year period, from 94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 2014. Articles published in clinical medicine journals were more likely to lack information on funding and to have private funding compared to other fields. The study found no significant differences between replication, article citation for systematic review and/or meta-analysis, and statements of conflict. However, articles in clinical medicine journals were more likely to not mention funding and less likely to have a PubMed Central reference number. The study provides baseline data to compare future progress in improving reproducibility and transparency in the scientific literature.
Researchers investigated the early host cell targets of Yersinia pestis during primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal disease caused by inhalation of the bacteria. The study found that Y. pestis targets alveolar macrophages early during infection, followed by a switch to neutrophils. The bacteria use a type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins directly to the cytosol of target cells, which is essential for their virulence and has anti-inflammatory and anti-phagocytic effects.

The researchers used a FRET-based probe to quantify the injection of effector proteins by the Y. pestis type III secretion system and found that neutrophil influx is unable to limit bacterial growth in the lung. Instead, it is responsible for the severe inflammation during the lethal pro-inflammatory phase of the disease. Depletion of alveolar macrophages had little effect on bacterial burden in the lung, suggesting that these cells may not play a significant role in limiting Yersinia survival in the lung.

The study provides new insights into the early host cell targets of Y. pestis during primary pneumonic plague and highlights the importance of neutrophils in the progression of the disease. The findings suggest that Y. pestis creates a localized protective environment in the lungs early during pneumonic plague by deactivating host innate immune responses. The study's results have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of pneumonic plague and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat this highly lethal disease.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the accuracy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests using soluble and recombinant antigens to detect asymptomatic Leishmania infantum infections in a cohort of 136 participants in an urban area of Brazil. The study aimed to identify asymptomatic carriers of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum. The participants were selected from a cohort with a two-year follow-up period and were clinically evaluated to ensure none had progressed to disease from their asymptomatic state.

The researchers used two molecular biology techniques as reference tests to confirm the presence of Leishmania: PCR with Leishmania-generic primer followed by hybridization using L. infantum probe, and PCR with specific primer to L. donovani complex. Plasma samples were tested by ELISA using three different antigens: L. infantum and L. amazonensis crude antigens, and rK39 recombinant protein. The results showed that kala-azar patients had high reactivity in ELISAs, while asymptomatic individuals presented low reactivity against the antigens tested.

The study found that the L. amazonensis and L. infantum antigens showed higher sensitivity than rK39, but the specificity of rK39 was higher than the other two antigens. However, there was low agreement among the different antigens used. The researchers concluded that serological tests were inaccurate for diagnosing asymptomatic infections compared to molecular methods, which could lead to misclassification bias in population studies. Therefore, studies that have used serological assays to estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention programs, or identify risk factors for Leishmania infection may have had their results compromised.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze the expression of retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells using microarray data. Retrotransposons are repetitive elements in the genome that can amplify and potentially disrupt gene function if not properly silenced. The study found that histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) is a key regulator of retrotransposon expression in mouse embryonic stem cells, and that it targets specific retrotransposons for silencing. The researchers also identified other mechanisms of retrotransposon silencing, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, and found that different genomic copies of the same retrotransposon can be differentially sensitive to these silencing mechanisms.

Using a computational approach to analyze microarray data, the researchers were able to identify retrotransposons that are silenced by these mechanisms in mouse embryonic stem cells. They found that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retrotransposons in these cells, and that different genomic copies of the same retrotransposon can be differentially sensitive to these silencing mechanisms. This suggests a complex interplay between silencing mechanisms that represses retrotransposon loci in germ cells and embryonic stem cells.

The study's findings provide new insights into the regulation of retrotransposons in mammals and highlight the importance of Hdac1 in silencing retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells. The methodology used in this study can be applied to gene expression microarray data to identify further components of the defense mechanisms that protect the mammalian genome from retrotransposition.
Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) plays a crucial role in regulating flowering time in response to light. CRY2 interacts with CIB1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein, in response to blue light to activate the transcription of Flowering Locus T (FT), a key regulator of flowering. In vitro, CIB1 binds to canonical E-box DNA sequences with higher affinity than non-canonical E-box sequences. However, in vivo, CIB1 binds to the chromatin region of the FT promoter, which contains non-canonical E-box sequences. The study found that CRY2 also interacts with at least CIB5 in response to blue light, but not in darkness or in response to other wavelengths of light. Genetic analysis revealed that CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 act redundantly to activate FT transcription and are positive regulators of CRY2-mediated flowering. Furthermore, CIB1 and other CIB proteins form heterodimers, which have a higher binding affinity to non-canonical E-box DNA sequences than CIB homodimers. This explains why CIB1 binds to canonical E-box sequences in vitro, but to non-canonical E-boxes in vivo. The expression of CIB proteins is specifically regulated by blue light, consistent with the hypothesis that different CIB proteins play similar roles in the CRY2-mediated blue light signaling pathway. The study demonstrates that CIB proteins function redundantly in regulating CRY2-dependent flowering and that different CIB proteins form heterodimers to interact with non-canonical E-box DNA in vivo.
An economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost of different treatment and screening options for intestinal helminth infections among US-bound refugees from Asia. The study compared four interventions: no program, domestic screening and treatment, overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and ivermectin, and overseas albendazole and domestic screening for Strongyloides. The analysis used a decision tree model and Markov processes to estimate the cost and health impacts of each intervention on an annual cohort of 27,700 US-bound Asian refugees. The results showed that the "No Program" option was the least expensive but also the least effective, resulting in 145 outpatient cases, 4 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths over a 60-year period. In contrast, the "Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin" option was the most effective, reducing outpatient cases, deaths, and hospitalizations by around 80% at an estimated net cost of $458,718 per death averted. The study found that overseas presumptive treatment for US-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs. The addition of ivermectin to albendazole reduced the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis and the probability of rare but potentially fatal disseminated strongyloidiasis.
Researchers have discovered a new species of microsporidian parasite, Nematocida displodere, that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike other microsporidian pathogens, N. displodere exhibits a broad tissue tropism, meaning it can infect and replicate in multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine. This is distinct from two closely related microsporidian pathogens, N. parisii and N. sp. 1, which exclusively infect and replicate in the intestine.

The life cycle of N. displodere was characterized, including pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. The parasite's genome was also sequenced and compared to those of N. parisii and N. sp. 1, revealing that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. Approximately 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins, which may play a role in interactions with the host.

The discovery of N. displodere provides a unique model system to study the mechanisms and evolutionary bases of pathogen tissue tropism. The parasite's ability to infect multiple tissues in C. elegans makes it an ideal system for investigating how pathogens establish infection in different host tissues. This research has implications for understanding host-microbe interactions and may contribute to the development of new strategies for controlling microsporidian infections.
The Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein plays a crucial role in transcription-coupled DNA repair, a process essential for maintaining genome stability. Mutations in CSB are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a devastating disease characterized by premature aging, sun sensitivity, and neurological and developmental defects. Research has shown that CSB belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, but the extent of its chromatin remodeling activity and its role in DNA repair was unknown. This study reveals that CSB repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner and that this activity is significantly enhanced by NAP1-like histone chaperones, which are identified as new CSB-binding partners. The study demonstrates that chromatin remodeling by the combined activities of CSB and NAP1-like chaperones is essential for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. Furthermore, the study shows that chromatin remodeling and repair protein recruitment mediated by CSB are separable activities. The collaboration between CSB and NAP1-like histone chaperones adds a new dimension to our understanding of how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones regulate chromatin structure. The results of this study provide new insights into the functions of chromatin remodeling by CSB in transcription-coupled DNA repair and the underlying mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome.
Researchers have created a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome by identifying regions with high inter-individual variation in DNA methylation patterns. These regions, called Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs), were found to occur preferentially at enhancers and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) in five purified cell types. While most VMRs have high heritability, a subset shows highly correlated variation in trans, forming co-regulated networks that have low heritability and differ between cell types. These networks are enriched for specific transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue.

For example, in T cells, a network of 95 co-regulated VMRs was identified, enriched for genes involved in T-cell activation. Similarly, in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-regulated VMRs was found, comprising all four HOX gene clusters and enriched for control of tissue growth. In neurons, a network of 18 VMRs was identified, enriched for roles in synaptic signaling.

The study also demonstrated that some VMR networks are responsive to environmental conditions, with methylation levels changing in a coordinated fashion in response to cellular growth. Notably, these environmentally-responsive VMRs showed a strong enrichment for imprinted loci, suggesting they are particularly sensitive to environmental conditions. The research provides new insights into the biology of variable methylation across the human genome and highlights the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in shaping epigenetic variation.
Researchers evaluated the performance of a new rapid test for dengue, called the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid, which detects the dengue virus's non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen. The test was compared to a commercial IgM/IgG rapid test in two studies conducted in Vietnam and Malaysia. The results showed that the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test had a sensitivity of 69.2% and specificity of 96% in Vietnam, and 68.9% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity in Malaysia when used alone. However, when combined with the IgM/IgG rapid test, the sensitivity increased to 93.0% in both studies. The study found that using the NS1 antigen detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG serology can significantly increase the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and extend the possible window of detection to include very early acute samples. The researchers concluded that the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid is a sensitive and specific rapid test for dengue NS1, and that combining it with an IgM/IgG rapid test can achieve optimal diagnostic sensitivity for acute dengue. The study suggests that this approach can improve the clinical utility of rapid immunochromatographic testing for dengue.
Researchers have developed a new computational method, Transat, to predict the conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-knotted, and alternative structures. Traditional RNA structure prediction methods assume a unique functional RNA structure and do not account for features required for in vivo folding. To address this, Transat detects conserved helices of high statistical significance, allowing for the prediction of structural features of known reference structures, including those with pseudo-knots and alternative configurations. The method also identifies unstructured sub-sequences bound by other molecules and provides evidence for new helices that may define folding pathways. Transat's comparative approach highlights conserved features and does not require a detailed knowledge of the cellular environment, unlike existing methods that predict folding pathways based on thermodynamic equilibrium. This approach has the advantage of being able to identify conserved features across homologous RNA sequences, suggesting that they not only assume similar reference RNA structures but also fold similarly in vivo. The predictions made by Transat are expected to facilitate more comprehensive and systematic studies of RNA folding pathways and alternative structural configurations, providing valuable input for the design and interpretation of future experiments.
Researchers have studied the immune system of plants, specifically Arabidopsis, to understand how it responds to potential pathogens. They found that the plant's immune network is highly buffered, meaning that different parts of the network can compensate for the loss of one another's functions. This buffering allows the network to remain effective even when some of its components are targeted and disabled by pathogen effectors. The researchers used a network reconstitution strategy to study the plant immune network, which involves disassembling and reassembling the network step by step. This approach allowed them to identify systems-level regulatory mechanisms underlying the plant's response to the immune stimulant flagellin-22 (flg22). The study revealed widespread interactions among major sub-networks, or sectors, in the flg22-responsive transcriptome. These interactions result in network buffering, which conceals the functions of individual network components. The researchers found that the jasmonate (JA), ethylene (ET), phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD4), and salicylate (SA) signaling sectors play key roles in controlling the transcriptional response to flg22. However, these regulatory mechanisms are not detectable by traditional genetic approaches, such as single-gene null-mutant analysis. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a systems biology approach, network reconstitution, in elucidating the dynamical component functions of the plant immune signaling network. This approach can help decipher the regulation of complex networks, such as the plant immune signaling network, which is highly resilient against perturbations.
The development of the central nervous system begins with the formation of monolayered neuroepithelial sheets, which are then subdivided into distinct domains through patterning mechanisms. In Drosophila, the embryonic optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primordium and the optic lobe primordium. A genetic network regulates the balance between larval eye and optic lobe precursors, as well as between primary and secondary photoreceptor (PR) precursors. The proneural factor Atonal (Ato) specifies larval eye precursors, while the orphan nuclear receptor Tailless (Tll) is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. The correct spatial placement of the boundary between Ato and Tll is required to control the precise number of primary and secondary PR precursors. Notch signaling also controls a binary cell fate decision, defining PR subtype identity through a cascade of transcription factor interactions. The study provides a model of how combinatorial action of cell extrinsic and cell intrinsic factors controls neural tissue patterning. The results show that the non-overlapping expression patterns of Ato and Tll specifically mark domains giving rise to larval eye precursors and the optic lobe primordium. Notch signaling regulates Ato expression and acts through lateral inhibition to select Ato-expressing R8 PR precursors, and is required for regulating PR cell number by maintaining epithelial cell fate of the optic lobe primordium.
Human Beta Defensin 1 (hBD1), a ubiquitously expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has been found to exhibit distinct antimicrobial mechanisms depending on its oxidation state. Researchers have discovered that the reduced form of hBD1 (hBD1red) forms a net-like structure that entraps bacteria, preventing their transmigration, whereas the oxidized form (hBD1ox) does not. This novel mechanism of action was observed using electron microscopy and confirmed through a transmigration assay. The nets formed by hBD1red are stable in the presence of human duodenal secretion and can completely prevent the migration of hBD1-resistant pathogens. In contrast to other defensins, such as Paneth cell-derived human α-defensin 6 (HD6), cysteins are necessary for net formation by hBD1. The redox-dependent function of hBD1 serves as an additional mechanism of action, providing host protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular net structures and preventing bacterial invasion. This study highlights the multifunctional activities of hBD1, including distinct antimicrobial mechanisms from a single peptide, and demonstrates the importance of understanding the modes of action of endogenous host peptides in developing new antimicrobial strategies. The findings suggest that hBD1 utilizes a "buy one get much more" strategy to combat bacterial challenges, utilizing multiple strategies to combat bacterial threats directly.
Researchers have investigated the role of the protein OCRL1 in the development of Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease, which are caused by mutations in the OCRL1 gene. These disorders are characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, a hallmark of renal tubulopathy. The study used zebrafish as a model to study the function of OCRL1 in the pronephric tubule, a model for the mammalian renal tubule. The results show that a deficiency in OCRL1 leads to a defect in endocytosis, a process by which cells take in substances from outside the cell. This defect is associated with a reduction in the levels of the scavenger receptor megalin and its accumulation in endocytic compartments. Additionally, the study found reduced numbers of early endocytic compartments and enlarged vacuolar endosomes in the sub-apical region of pronephric cells. However, cell polarity within the pronephric tubule remains unaffected in mutant embryos. The study also found that the catalytic activity of OCRL1 is required for renal tubular endocytosis and that suppression of PIP5K, a protein involved in the production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, can rescue the endocytic defect. These findings indicate that OCRL1 is required for endocytic trafficking in vivo and suggest that endocytic defects are responsible for the renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease. Furthermore, the study identifies PIP5K as a potential therapeutic target for these disorders.
A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in the Kilombero River Valley in southern Tanzania to investigate the presence and determinants of inter-epidemic Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission in livestock. The study found an overall seroprevalence of 11.3% among 1680 cattle, sheep, and goats, with 5.5% of animals born after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak and 22.7% of animals present during the outbreak testing positive for RVF virus (RVFV) antibodies. The seroprevalence increased linearly in post-epidemic annual cohorts, indicating a constant exposure and presence of active foci of recent transmission. Nine inhibition-ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVFV IgM antibodies, indicating recent infection.

The spatial distribution of seroprevalence showed a few hotspots, and animals living more than 15 km from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those living less than 5 km away. The study found no significant association between seropositivity and species, breed, herd composition, grazing practices, or altitude. However, a significant sex difference in seroprevalence was observed in animals present during the outbreak, with females having a higher seroprevalence than males.

The findings indicate post-epidemic transmission of RVFV in the study area, highlighting the need for active serological surveillance in livestock and human populations to detect inter-epidemic transmissions. The study provides baseline information on the exposure status to RVFV in livestock during the inter-epidemic period and assesses the relationship between RVF seropositivity, animal characteristics, and environmental factors.
Researchers investigated the role of the contractile vacuole complex (CVC) in Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. They found that the CVC is involved in the trafficking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, such as trans-sialidase (TcTS), to the plasma membrane of the parasite. TcTS is essential for the parasite's ability to infect host cells. The researchers used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to study the CVC's role in protein trafficking. They found that TcRab11, a protein associated with the CVC, is necessary for the transport of TcTS to the plasma membrane. A dominant-negative mutant of TcRab11 disrupted this process, preventing TcTS from reaching the plasma membrane and reducing the parasite's infectivity. However, when the mutant parasites were incubated with exogenous TcTS and a sialic acid donor before infecting host cells, their infectivity was partially restored. This suggests that TcRab11 plays a crucial role in osmoregulation and the trafficking of TcTS to the plasma membrane, and that TcTS is essential for the parasite's ability to infect host cells. The study reveals a novel mechanism of GPI-anchored protein secretion in eukaryotic cells, involving the CVC and lipid rafts.
A phase III clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine (PCECV) administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen compared to the currently recommended 2-site/Thai Red Cross (TRC) regimen. The study enrolled 443 healthy individuals aged 1 year and above, who were randomized into four groups to receive intradermal PCECV with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) administration. The primary objective was to assess the non-inferiority of the 4-site/1-week regimen to the 2-site/TRC regimen in terms of the percentage of participants with rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) concentrations ≥0.5 IU/mL at day 49.

The results showed that the 4-site/1-week regimen was non-inferior to the 2-site/TRC regimen, with a difference in percentage of participants with adequate RVNA concentrations of -1% (95% CI: -2.4-0.0) at day 49. The geometric mean concentrations of RVNA were 18 IU/mL in the 4-site/1-week groups and 12 IU/mL in the 2-site/TRC groups at day 14, and subsequently declined in all groups. The 2 regimens had similar safety profiles, with no vaccination-related serious adverse events reported. The study suggests that the 4-site/1-week regimen might be an alternative to current recommendations, offering potential benefits in terms of improved cost-efficiency and compliance to vaccination.
Researchers investigated the dynamic functional organization of the salience network (SN) in the human brain using high-resolution fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. The SN, anchored in the anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, plays a crucial role in detecting goal-relevant events and facilitating access to cognitive resources. The study applied novel graph-theoretical techniques to analyze the dynamic interactions of the SN with other brain networks, including the frontoparietal network, cingulate-opercular network, and ventral and dorsal attention networks.

The results showed that the SN demonstrated high levels of flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other brain networks, with dynamic functional interactions that were among the most spatially varied in the brain. The SN nodes maintained a consistently high level of network centrality over time, indicating that this network is a hub for facilitating flexible cross-network interactions. The time-varying connectivity profiles of the SN were distinct from all other prefrontal control systems, and temporal flexibility of the SN uniquely predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These findings were also observed in a second retest dataset, demonstrating the robustness of the results.

The study provides new insights into the dynamic functional architecture of the SN, highlighting its unique spatiotemporal organization characterized by high temporal flexibility, spatiotemporal diversity, and node centrality. The findings support the triple-network model and demonstrate how the SN is uniquely positioned to facilitate interactions with multiple functional systems, supporting a wide range of cognitive processes in the human brain.
Researchers have identified a key protein, VP4, in the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) that plays a crucial role in the release of the virus from host cells. SV40 is a nonenveloped virus, meaning it does not have a lipid coat, and must be released from the host cell without being encapsulated by cellular membranes. The study found that VP4 is a viroporin, a protein that forms pores in cellular membranes to facilitate viral release. When expressed and purified, VP4 was shown to bind to and disrupt biological membranes, causing them to become permeable to large molecules. This process involves the direct interaction of VP4 with the membrane bilayer, resulting in the formation of pores approximately 3 nanometers in diameter. The central hydrophobic domain of VP4 is essential for its membrane-binding and disruption activities. The study also found that VP4 has a preference for membranes composed of lipids similar to those found in plasma membranes, rather than nuclear membranes. Phosphatidylethanolamine, a lipid found in bacterial membranes, was found to inhibit the membrane-perforation activity of VP4. The disruption of membranes by VP4 was observed in mammalian cells, including the permissive SV40 host cells. These findings suggest that VP4 plays a central role in the perforation of cellular membranes to trigger SV40 viral release. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of nonenveloped viral release and highlights the importance of VP4 in this process.
Researchers have developed a DNA vaccine, pcTPANS1, which encodes the NS1 protein of the dengue virus (DENV). This vaccine has been shown to induce a robust immune response in mice, providing protection against DENV infection. The study aimed to investigate the role of both cellular and humoral immunity in this protection. Results showed that the vaccine elicited significant levels of anti-NS1 antibodies and T cell responses, particularly from CD4+ T cells. Passive immunization with anti-NS1 antibodies provided partial protection against low doses of the virus, but not against higher doses. The vaccine also activated CD8+ T cells, which produced interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and exhibited cytotoxic activity. However, the contribution of CD8+ T cells to protection was not as significant as that of CD4+ T cells. Depletion of CD4+ T cells completely abolished protection, while transfer of CD4+ T cells combined with anti-NS1 antibodies from vaccinated mice restored protection. These findings suggest that cooperation between CD4+ T cells and humoral immunity is critical for protection against DENV using the pcTPANS1 vaccine. The study provides new insights into the immune response elicited by the NS1 antigen and has implications for the development of a dengue vaccine.
Researchers have elucidated the structure-function relationship of the transcription factor ComR, a new member of the RNPP family, which regulates competence for natural DNA transformation in streptococci. ComR is directly activated by the binding of its associated pheromone XIP, the mature form of the comX/sigX-inducing-peptide ComS. The crystal structure analysis of ComR from Streptococcus thermophilus, combined with mutational analysis and in vivo assays, reveals that XIP-binding induces the release of the sequestered HTH domain and ComR dimerization to allow DNA binding. This activation mechanism is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues, demonstrating that ComR is not an Rgg protein as initially proposed, but instead constitutes a new member of the RNPP family. The identification of XIP and ComR residues important for competence activation provides a crucial step towards designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges among streptococci. This study offers opportunities to engineer well-controlled peptide-based expression systems in streptococci and other Gram-positive bacteria. The ComR regulon includes the comS and comX genes, which are essential for competence in streptococci. The structure-function analysis of the ComRS system from Streptococcus thermophilus provides a detailed molecular mechanism of the ComR activation process.
Researchers have identified a class of primary amines that activate the prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC. These ligands, which include the neurotransmitter GABA, bind to a conserved site on the protein and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time. ELIC forms cation-selective channels with properties similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The high single-channel conductance and simple functional behavior of ELIC make it an attractive model system for studying general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors.

The researchers used a combination of electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography to characterize the functional properties of ELIC. They identified a bound ligand in a crystal structure and characterized the functional properties of the channel. ELIC is activated by a range of primary amines, including alkylamines, aminothiols, aminoalcohols, bromoamines, diamines, and GABA.

The pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are a large family of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors that are widely expressed in the animal kingdom. All members of this family share a conserved molecular architecture and similar functional behavior. ELIC is closely related to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin receptors, and GLIC in terms of its ion conduction properties. It is a cation-selective channel that is impermeable to anions. The relationship between the crystal structure of ELIC and the resting or desensitized state of the channel is still unclear.
Researchers investigated the progression from eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD) to asthma, a phenomenon known as the "atopic march." They found that mice with skin-barrier defects developed AD-like skin inflammation and were susceptible to allergic asthma, similar to humans with AD. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a protein overexpressed by skin keratinocytes, was identified as the systemic driver of bronchial hyper-responsiveness. Mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of RBP-j, which sustained high systemic levels of TSLP, developed a severe asthmatic phenotype after antigen-induced allergic challenge. Elimination of TSLP signaling in these animals blocked the atopic march, demonstrating that high serum TSLP levels were required to sensitize the lung to allergic inflammation. Additionally, outbred K14-TSLPtg mice, which maintained high systemic levels of TSLP without developing skin pathology, showed that epidermal-derived TSLP was sufficient to trigger the atopic march, sensitizing the lung airways to inhaled allergens in the absence of epicutaneous sensitization. These findings suggest that in addition to early treatment of primary skin-barrier defects, selective inhibition of systemic TSLP may be key to blocking the development of asthma in AD patients.
A comprehensive analysis of the genome of Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium, was conducted using a multi-omics approach that integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data with bioinformatics tools. This approach enabled the detailed annotation of various genomic features, including protein-coding genes, functional RNAs, non-coding RNAs, transcription units, promoters, ribosome binding sites, and regulatory sites. The analysis revealed several distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome, including a high number of genes per transcription unit (3.3), a low number of putative non-coding RNAs (12), and few transcription units with multiple transcription start sites (3.7%). The promoters and ribosome binding sites showed increased sequence conservation compared to other bacteria. The 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) exhibited an atypical bimodal length distribution, consisting of "Short" 5'UTRs (11-17 nt) and "Common" 5'UTRs (26-32 nt). Transcriptional regulation was found to be limited by a lack of intergenic space for the majority of transcription units. Additionally, a high fraction of annotated genes were expressed independently of growth state, and a linear correlation between mRNA and protein abundance was observed (Pearson r = 0.63, p < 2.2 × 10^(-16) t-test). These characteristics are hypothesized to be a reflection of the organism's hyperthermophilic lifestyle and may provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on Earth.
Researchers investigated how visual context influences the perception of a target bar in a display. Participants judged whether a target bar was present at the center of a display, given a weak or missing input contrast at the target location with or without a context of other bars. The results showed that observers were more likely to perceive a target when the context had a weaker rather than stronger contrast. When the context could perceptually group well with the target, weak contrast contextual bars biased observers to perceive a target relative to the condition without context, as if filling in the target. In contrast, high-contrast contextual bars, regardless of whether they grouped well with the target, biased observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference was shown to account for the data well, illustrating that context influences perception in two ways: biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The study suggests that the context does not influence the perceived target contrast, despite its influence on the bias to perceive the target's presence, indicating that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for visual inferences.
Biologists have long been puzzled by the prevalence of cooperation in nature, particularly when it comes to the production of costly common goods. This is because cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors, which can consume the common good without contributing fairly, leading to population collapse and the destruction of cooperation. However, researchers have discovered that defectors can sometimes create conditions that rescue cooperation. In a structured population, defectors can increase the heterogeneity in population collapse dynamics, reducing the chances that all populations go extinct simultaneously. Additionally, selection for rare mutants adapted to resource limitation, which can be induced by defectors, introduces another population bottleneck, facilitating the survival of cooperation. Furthermore, defectors can create empty locations that support cooperator but not defector migrants, allowing cooperators to grow and outcompete defectors. This leads to the counterintuitive result that the initial presence of defectors in a population can sometimes improve the survival of cooperators. The researchers used individual-based modeling to demonstrate these mechanisms and found that defectors can provide a "built-in" mechanism for the persistence of cooperation in a structured population. By creating small population sizes, defectors can increase variability in cooperator frequency across different locations, allowing cooperators to outgrow defectors globally despite defectors outgrowing cooperators in each location.
Researchers have discovered a novel mechanism by which the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is eliminated from the body. The study found that P. aeruginosa adheres almost exclusively to sites of multi-cellular junctions in the epithelial barrier, where it binds to extruded apoptotic cells or apoptotic bodies. This interaction is independent of the type of cell death, as P. aeruginosa also binds to necrotic cells. The bacteria are then internalized through efferocytosis, a process in which surrounding epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells. Inside the epithelial cells, P. aeruginosa inhabits an efferocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features, ultimately leading to the elimination of the bacteria. This process is part of a host defense mechanism that prevents P. aeruginosa infection. The study suggests that the elimination of P. aeruginosa through efferocytosis could be relevant for the study of cystic fibrosis, a condition characterized by an exacerbated number of apoptotic cells and ineffective efferocytosis. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the interaction between P. aeruginosa and the epithelial barrier, particularly in contexts where the barrier is compromised, such as in cystic fibrosis.
During embryonic development in Drosophila, the formation of the gonad is a complex process involving the migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) to the somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs). To reach the SGPs, PGCs must traverse the midgut wall and migrate through the mesoderm, guided by local repulsive cues and attractive signals from the SGPs. The hedgehog (hh) pathway gene shifted (shf) plays a crucial role in directing PGC migration. Shf is a secreted protein that facilitates the long-distance transmission of Hh through the proteoglycan matrix, and its expression in the gonadal mesoderm is essential for PGC migration. The hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is also involved in generating the PGC attractant, which is produced by the SGPs and other tissues when hmgcr is ectopically expressed. The production of this attractant depends on shf and another hh pathway gene, gγ1. Ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release and transmission of the Hh ligand from these cells into the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. The potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend on cholesterol modification. The findings suggest that shf and the hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway work together to orchestrate PGC migration during embryonic development in Drosophila.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of a trivalent adenovirus type 5 HIV recombinant vaccine in priming the immune system to recognize and eliminate HIV-infected cells. The study focused on the cytotoxic capacity of CD8+ T-cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in eliminating infected cells. Participants who received the vaccine showed detectable HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell recall cytotoxic responses, which were significantly higher than those observed in HIV-negative individuals. However, the magnitude of these responses was not related to the number of vaccinations or the percentage of cytokine-secreting T-cells.

The study found that the cytotoxic capacity of CD8+ T-cells in vaccine recipients was significantly less than that of long-term non-progressors (LTNP), individuals who have durable control over HIV replication. However, vaccine recipients carrying specific HLA class I alleles (B*27, B*57, or B*58) showed significantly higher cytotoxic responses, which are associated with immune control over HIV replication in chronic infection. These findings suggest that protective HLA class I alleles may lead to better outcomes in both chronic infection and following immunization due to more efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic responses. The study's results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying protection from HIV infection or immune control over HIV replication, which is essential for the development of future HIV vaccine design strategies.
A new study formally models the coevolution of jointly intentional behavior and cumulative culture, providing a unified mechanism for the emergence or suppression of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans. According to the shared intentionality hypothesis, the evolution of modern human cognition was catalyzed by the development of jointly intentional modes of behavior among early hominins. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that composite tool manufacture and grammatical language emerged around the same time, approximately 300,000 years ago, and that socially learned culture has affected the evolution of cognitive traits.

The study models the evolution of the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior, showing that rapid techno-cultural advance is linked to the emergence of this ability. Conversely, in the absence of opportunities for significant techno-cultural improvement, the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is selected against. The study also finds that collaborative sharing of intentions directly alters how strategies are chosen, not which strategies are chosen, and that an environment rich in coordination problems is conducive to the emergence of jointly intentional behavior.

The study provides a formal model of the evolution of jointly intentional action, showing under what conditions it is likely to emerge. The results highlight the link between technology adoption and the evolution of collaboration, suggesting that the ability to share intentions and adjust strategies in tandem with others is essential for rapid techno-cultural advance. The study provides a potential cause of inter-species diversity in the prevalence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in male fertility, specifically focusing on the miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci. They found that these miRNAs are highly expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells and play a crucial role in spermatogenesis, the process by which sperm cells mature. Deletion of both miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci in mice resulted in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count, poor sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology. This condition is the leading cause of male infertility in humans.

The study revealed that the loss of miR-34b/c and miR-449 did not block spermatogenesis entirely, but rather impaired several developmental transitions, leading to the observed phenotypic hallmarks of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. Histological analysis of the seminiferous tubules in miR-34bc−/−;449−/− mice showed a thinning of the epithelium and a decrease in the quantity and quality of mature sperm. The miR-34bc−/−;449−/− sperm were immotile and had aberrant morphology.

The study identified the miR-34 family as the first functionally important miRNAs for spermatogenesis, whose deregulation is causal to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and infertility. The findings suggest that the miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci play a critical role in regulating meiosis and the later stages of spermiogenesis. The study highlights the importance of the miRNA pathway in fine-tuning gene expression during spermatogenesis and identifies the miR-34b/c and miR-449 as the first miRNA loci required for mammalian spermatogenesis.
Researchers investigated the dual properties of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), a bacterium used therapeutically for over a century, which exhibits both probiotic and genotoxic activities. The genotoxin colibactin, encoded by the pks island, is a virulence factor and potential pro-carcinogenic compound, while the siderophore-microcins (Mcc) are responsible for an antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteriaceae. The study aimed to decouple the antagonistic activity of EcN from its genotoxic activity. The researchers found that the pks-encoded ClbP, a peptidase that activates colibactin, is required for the antagonistic activity of EcN. A single amino acid substitution in ClbP inactivated the genotoxic activity but maintained the antagonistic activity. In an in vivo salmonellosis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to the wild-type strain. The ClbP-dependent antibacterial effect was also observed in vitro with other E. coli strains that carry both a truncated form of the Mcc gene cluster and the pks island. The interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways suggests that these genomic islands were co-selected and played a role in the evolution of E. coli from phylogroup B2. This co-evolution illustrates the fine margin between pathogenicity and probiotic activity, and the need to address both the effectiveness and safety of probiotics. Decoupling the antagonistic from the genotoxic activity by specifically inactivating ClbP peptidase domain opens the way to the safe use of EcN.
Researchers have identified two transporters, Uxt1 and Uxt2, that play a crucial role in the virulence of Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that causes hundreds of thousands of deaths annually due to meningitis. These transporters are essential for the incorporation of xylose, a neutral monosaccharide, into the polysaccharide capsule of the fungus, which is a major virulence factor. The capsule acts as a physical barrier against host defenses and as an immune modulator when shed into the extracellular space. The researchers found that Uxt1 and Uxt2 are specific for the xylose donor, UDP-xylose, and also transport the galactofuranose donor, UDP-galactofuranose. Both transporters are required for the incorporation of xylose into the capsule and for the fungus to cause disease in mice. However, surprisingly, they are not necessary for fungal viability in the context of infection. This study provides new insights into the glycan biosynthesis pathway of C. neoformans and identifies a potential target for therapy. The findings also contribute to our understanding of the fundamental biology of glycans and their role in fungal pathogenesis. The discovery of Uxt1 and Uxt2 expands our knowledge of nucleotide sugar transporters and sets the stage for further studies on the mechanisms of cryptococcal pathogenesis and host response.
Researchers have developed an open-access global database for mapping, control, and surveillance of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The database provides georeferenced data on NTDs, including schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and leishmaniasis, allowing for spatial disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, and disease monitoring and surveillance. The database was initially focused on schistosomiasis in Africa, with over 12,000 georeferenced survey locations from 35 African countries. The data were extracted from peer-reviewed journals, grey literature, and Ministries of Health and research institutions in schistosomiasis-endemic countries. The database is now expanded to include other NTDs, such as soil-transmitted helminthiasis and leishmaniasis, and is available online at http://www.gntd.org. The database allows for detailed geostatistical analyses of disease distribution in space and time, providing unique opportunities for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, and disease monitoring and surveillance. The development of this database demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a global NTD database and highlights the importance of open-access data for disease control and elimination efforts. The database is expected to be expanded to include other NTDs, such as ascariasis, hookworm disease, trichuriasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and trachoma.
Researchers investigated whether chronic helminth infections exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in cotton rats, a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomosoidis sigmodontis and an excellent model for human MTB. The study aimed to determine if chronic helminth infections, which induce a Th2 immune response and suppress Th1 immunity, would worsen the course of MTB infection. Cotton rats were co-infected with L. sigmodontis and then challenged with MTB. Immunological responses, histological studies, and quantitative mycobacterial cultures were assessed two months after MTB challenge. The results showed that spleen cell proliferation and interferon gamma production in response to purified protein derivative were similar between co-infected and MTB-only infected animals. Contrary to the hypothesis, MTB loads and the occurrence and size of lung granulomas were not increased in co-infected animals. Histological examinations and quantitative MTB cultures from two independent experiments demonstrated equivalent or reduced mycobacterial burden in co-infected animals compared to those infected with only MTB. These findings suggest that chronic filarial infections do not exacerbate MTB infection in the cotton rat model. The study's results indicate that filaria eradication programs may not facilitate MTB control, but also suggest that worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases may not substantially increase the risk for infections.
Researchers have identified a specific ion channel, ppk23, in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that plays a crucial role in courtship behavior. Ppk23 is a member of the DEG/ENaC family, which is one of the largest families of ion channels in Drosophila. The study found that ppk23 is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory-like chemosensory bristles that are distinct from those involved in feeding. Disrupting ppk23 or inhibiting the activity of ppk23-expressing neurons delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship behavior. Furthermore, blocking ppk23-positive neurons or mutating the ppk23 gene altered the behavioral response of males to the female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone 7, 11(Z), 11(Z)-Heptacosadiene. These findings indicate that ppk23 and the cells expressing it play an important role in the peripheral sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Drosophila. The study suggests that ppk23 is a potential candidate for a pheromone receptor or a key component of the pheromonal signaling cascade. The results also indicate that DEG/ENaC signaling contributes to sensory functions underlying sex-related behaviors, revealing a novel physiological function for this important family of ion channels.
Researchers investigated the relationship between mitochondrial tRNA import and codon usage in the green alga Chlamydomonas. They found a precise correlation between the mitochondrial codon usage and the nature and amount of imported tRNAs. This led to the hypothesis that tRNA import might be a dynamic process that adapts to the mitochondrial genome content. To test this hypothesis, the researchers manipulated the Chlamydomonas mitochondrial genome by introducing point mutations to modify its codon usage. They found that the codon usage modification resulted in reduced levels of mitochondrial translation and decreased levels and activities of respiratory complexes. This was linked to the limitations of the pool of tRNAs in mitochondria, indicating that tRNA mitochondrial import cannot be rapidly regulated in response to a novel genetic context. Instead, the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs in mitochondria result from a co-evolutionary adaptation between the tRNA import mechanism and the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery. The study suggests that the information residing in the mitochondrial DNA defines the levels of imported tRNAs to allow optimal mitochondrial translation. The findings have implications for understanding the regulation of mitochondrial translation in plants and highlight the importance of co-evolution between the tRNA import mechanism and the mitochondrial genome.
Researchers have identified new patterns of glucose dysregulation in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Current methods for measuring blood glucose levels are limited by relying on single-time-point measurements or average measures of overall glycemia, neglecting glucose dynamics. The study used CGM to evaluate postprandial glucose elevations, types of patterns, and how patterns vary between individuals given an identical nutrient challenge. Measurement of insulin resistance and secretion revealed that the physiology underlying dysglycemia is highly variable between individuals. An analytical framework was developed to group individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses, called "glucotypes," which reveal heterogeneity within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. The study found that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability using CGM, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. This suggests that glucose dysregulation is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought and can affect individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures. The study also developed a model for identifying potential mechanisms of personal glucose dysregulation and built a webtool for visualizing and classifying individualized glucose patterns into glucotypes.
EDR1, a Raf-like mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), negatively regulates plant defense responses and cell death in Arabidopsis. Research has shown that EDR1 mutants exhibit enhanced resistance to pathogens, including powdery mildew fungus, bacteria, and oomycetes, as well as increased ethylene-induced senescence. However, the mechanisms underlying EDR1's negative regulation of plant defense were not well understood.

This study found that EDR1 physically interacts with MKK4 and MKK5, two mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs), and negatively regulates the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade. The interaction between EDR1 and MKK4/MKK5 requires the N-terminal domain of EDR1. Furthermore, EDR1 negatively affects the protein levels of MKK4, MKK5, MPK3, and MPK6.

Mutations in MKK4 and MKK5 resulted in enhanced susceptibility to powdery mildew, and edr1-mediated resistance was found to require MKK4 and MKK5 function. Overexpression of MKK4 or MKK5 caused edr1-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death. These findings indicate that EDR1 physically associates with MKK4/MKK5 and negatively regulates the MAPK cascade to fine-tune plant innate immunity. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of EDR1's negative regulation of plant defense and highlights the importance of the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade in plant immunity responses.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to predict the spread of infectious diseases, such as Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, using a method called Gaussian processes. This framework allows for accurate predictions of disease dynamics and can be used by policymakers to make informed decisions. The researchers tested their framework on data from Turkey between 2004 and 2015 and found that it outperformed two commonly used machine learning algorithms, random forests and boosted regression trees, in temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction scenarios.

The framework uses Gaussian processes to identify complex dependencies between disease cases and location over time. It combines two similarity matrices, one for location and one for time period, to create a larger similarity matrix. This matrix is then used to train a Gaussian process regression model to make predictions under three different scenarios: temporal prediction, spatial prediction, and spatiotemporal prediction. Temporal prediction involves forecasting case counts for future time periods, spatial prediction involves predicting disease prevalence for each location, and spatiotemporal prediction involves forecasting disease cases for specific locations and time periods.

The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of their framework by applying it to a dataset of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever cases in Turkey. This framework has the potential to contribute significantly to public health policy-making by providing accurate and reliable predictions of infectious disease spread.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to investigate the transmission dynamics of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) among livestock in Africa and the Middle East. The model takes into account the effects of seasonality and socioeconomic factors, such as the Eid al Adha festival, on the spread of the disease. The study found that human activities associated with the festival, combined with climatic factors like rainfall and hydrological variations, contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the disease pathogen. The model suggests that outbreaks may occur when large numbers of livestock are brought into areas at risk from RVF due to the festival, and when abundant mosquitoes emerge.

The researchers used a three-patch model to simulate the transmission dynamics of RVFV over short and long periods of time, particularly during the festival period. The study also investigated the impact of festival- and seasonal-driven factors, such as the number of livestock imported daily, animal transportation speed, and death rate induced by ceremonial sacrifices, on patterns of disease outbreaks in each patch. The results show that when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive disease outbreaks increases, particularly in the patch where the religious ceremony will be held.

The study highlights the importance of considering both seasonal and socioeconomic factors in predicting and controlling the spread of RVFV. The model can be used to provide information to local governments on how to predict disease outbreaks and effectively control the transmission of the disease pathogen.
Researchers analyzed data on human anthrax cases in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010 to identify changes in the disease's spatial and temporal distribution. The study found that the incidence of human anthrax increased by 11.95% annually from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline of 35.24% after the introduction of a preemptive livestock vaccination program in 1996. The geographic distribution of the disease also shifted over time, with cases initially concentrated in the western part of the country and later shifting eastward towards the capital, Baku, and then remaining primarily in eastern and northern Azerbaijan.

The study revealed that the incidence of human cutaneous anthrax was more common in the west and south during the Soviet era, but shifted eastward in the mid-1990s. The introduction of a comprehensive livestock vaccination program in 1996 led to a significant decline in human anthrax cases. However, the disease has re-emerged in the Caucasus region, raising concerns about the potential for trans-boundary spread.

The study's findings highlight the need for an integrated "One Health" approach that takes into account the changing geographic distribution of the disease. Continued control measures in livestock are necessary to mitigate the occurrence of human anthrax in Azerbaijan. The study's results are consistent with previous research that has documented changes in the occurrence of zoonotic diseases following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
Researchers have investigated the molecular interactions between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel. PUFAs are essential components of cell membrane phospholipids in heart cells and neurons, and have been found to shift the voltage dependence of the Shaker KV channel to enable channel activation. However, the molecular mechanism by which PUFAs modulate channel functioning remains unclear.

Using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, the study determined a putative PUFA binding site in the open state of the Shaker KV channel, located at the protein-lipid interface near the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the voltage-sensor domain (VSD). The study found that the lipophilic PUFA tail interacts with the hydrophobic central core of the protein-lipid interface, while the carboxylic head group interacts with polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices.

The study also compared the interactions between PUFAs and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with the Shaker KV channel, and found that the polyunsaturated carbon tails of PUFAs exhibit increased conformational flexibility compared to saturated carbon chains. This increased flexibility may explain the specificity of PUFA action on channel proteins. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular basis of PUFA interactions with the Shaker KV channel, and may have implications for understanding the mechanism of ketogenic diets in treating refractory epilepsy.
Researchers have developed a screening pipeline to identify new antiparasitic agents targeting Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoan parasite responsible for significant disease burden in children in developing countries and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. Current treatments are ineffective, and the parasite's experimental tractability has hindered the discovery of novel therapeutics. A unique target, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), was identified through genome sequencing, but testing inhibitors has been challenging. To overcome this, the researchers genetically engineered the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii to serve as a model of C. parvum infection, allowing for a rapid assessment of anti-parasitic potential and target specificity. A fluorescence-based assay of host cell proliferation and a C. parvum growth assay using automated high-content imaging analysis were also developed to further evaluate potential compounds. The pipeline was used to evaluate C. parvum IMPDH inhibitors and identified a subset of 1,2,3-triazole ethers with excellent in vivo selectivity and improved anti-cryptosporidial activity. Two promising candidates, A103 and A110, were identified as being >100× more potent than the current standard for anticryptosporidial activity, paromomycin.
A genome-wide association study was conducted to investigate the genetic factors influencing primary tooth development in infancy. The study analyzed data from 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort and 1,518 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The researchers identified five genetic loci associated with the time to first tooth eruption and number of teeth at one year of age, with a significance level of P<5×10−8. An additional five loci showed suggestive associations (P<5×10−6). The identified loci included genes linked to tooth and organ development, such as KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, and MSRB3. Notably, genes at four of the identified loci are also implicated in cancer development. A variant within the HOXB gene cluster was associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31 years. The study's findings suggest that genetic factors play a significant role in primary tooth development and may have implications for the study of other developmental and organogenic processes. The identified genes have roles in organogenesis, growth, and developmental processes, and mutations in three of these genes have been linked to altered organogenesis and development. The study provides new insights into the genetic architecture of primary dentition and highlights the importance of genetic factors in tooth development.
Researchers created two new mouse models, Ts3Yah and Ms3Yah, to study the effects of partial trisomy and monosomy of the Hspa13-App region on chromosome 21, which is associated with Down syndrome (DS). The Hspa13-App region is syntenic with the 21q11.2-q21.3 region in humans. The Ts3Yah model has a tandem duplication of the Hspa13-App region, while the Ms3Yah model has a deletion of this region.

The study found that both trisomy and monosomy of the Hspa13-App region alter locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance in mice. The expression profiling of skeletal muscles revealed changes in the regulation of genes involved in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. In Ts3Yah mice, these genes were downregulated, while in Ms3Yah mice, they were upregulated.

The study also found that the shift in skeletal muscle metabolism correlates with a change in mitochondrial proliferation without an alteration in respiratory function. However, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondrial complex I decreased in Ms3Yah mice, while the membrane permeability of Ts3Yah mitochondria slightly increased.

The results suggest that the Hspa13-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles as a consequence of changes in the dose of Gabpa, Nrip1, and Atp5j genes. The study indicates that the copy number variation in the Hspa13-App region has a peripheral impact on locomotor activity by altering muscle function.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model of the GIRK1/2 channel, a type of ion channel that plays a crucial role in regulating heartbeat and neuronal excitability. The model reveals that the channel's basal and evoked activities are controlled by the unequal stoichiometry of Gα and Gβγ subunits. Basal activity, which occurs in the absence of neurotransmitter, is inversely related to the extent of activation by neurotransmitter. The model accurately recapitulates the channel's behavior in various expression systems, including Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, and hippocampal neurons. It also correctly predicts the dose-dependent activation of GIRK1/2 by coexpressed Gβγ and accounts for the inverse correlation between basal activity and agonist activation index.

The model suggests that between 3 and 4 Gβγ dimers are available for each GIRK1/2 channel, while the number of available Gα subunits decreases as the channel's density increases. This unequal association of GIRK1/2 with G protein subunits underlies the complex pattern of basal and agonist-evoked activities, allowing the channel to act as a sensitive bidirectional detector of both Gβγ and Gα. The model's predictions are supported by experimental data and provide new insights into the mechanisms of GIRK1/2 channel function.
Researchers have developed a novel computational model, PrediTALE, to predict the target genes of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) in plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. TALEs are proteins secreted by the bacteria that activate plant target genes to support bacterial virulence. The model accounts for recent findings on TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths and flexible strand orientation of target boxes relative to the transcription start of the downstream target gene. PrediTALE was trained on quantitative data and benchmarked using RNA-seq data after Xanthomonas infection in rice, showing an overall improvement in prediction performance compared to previous approaches. The model was used to predict several novel putative virulence targets, but also identified "orphan TALEs" for which no target genes were predicted, suggesting incomplete gene annotations. To address this, the researchers propose replacing promoterome-wide scans with genome-wide scans for target boxes. Genome-wide predictions using PrediTALE enabled the identification of novel targets independently of existing gene annotations, including previously missing non-coding RNAs. The study demonstrates the importance of accurate computational predictions of TALE target boxes for elucidating virulence targets of TALEs that support bacterial infection of host plants. The researchers also performed genome-wide scans for putative target boxes of TALEs from five additional Xanthomonas species and corresponding host plants, finding known targets on rank 1 or 2 of the corresponding PrediTALE predictions.
Researchers have developed a machine-learning algorithm called APOGEE to assess the functional impact of non-synonymous genome variations in human mitochondrial DNA. Non-synonymous variations refer to changes in the DNA sequence that result in a different amino acid being incorporated into a protein. There are 24,189 possible non-synonymous amino acid changes in human mitochondrial DNA, but only a small subset has been functionally evaluated, while the pathogenicity of the majority has been predicted using software tools. However, these tools have been found to be inconsistent in their predictions.

APOGEE was designed to improve upon existing prediction methods by using a machine-learning approach. The algorithm was trained on a set of 864 known mitochondrial variants and tested on a separate set of variants. The performance of APOGEE was evaluated using various metrics, which showed that it outperformed existing prediction methods.

APOGEE uses a classification model based on the Logistic Model Tree (LMT) and incorporates features related to the 13 mitochondrial proteins, such as multi-alignments and amino acid conservation estimates. The algorithm's reasoning strategy was tuned on finely curated training sets of variations, and its predicting model was based on decision tree learning to provide interpretable rules of pathogenicity. The results of APOGEE's predictions are available in a publicly accessible database called MitImpact, which includes the frequency of co-evolving amino acids and mean MI Z-scores for each amino acid site.
Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of dengue infection. Research has shown that DENV NS1 can stimulate immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and cause endothelial leakage. However, the direct effect of DENV NS1 on platelet activation and thrombocytopenia was unclear. This study investigated the role of DENV NS1 in platelet activation and thrombocytopenia during DENV infection. The results showed that DENV supernatant, but not Zika virus supernatant, induced P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine exposure in human platelets, which was abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Recombinant NS1 from all four serotypes of DENV also induced platelet activation, which was blocked by anti-NS1 F(ab')2, anti-TLR4 antibody, a TLR4 antagonist, and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor. The activation of platelets by DENV NS1 promoted subthreshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation and enhanced platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Furthermore, DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant. These findings suggest that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets triggers its activation, contributing to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during dengue infection.
Researchers conducted a mathematical analysis of the dynamic control loops regulating blood pressure, blood volume, and vasomotor tone in vascular smooth muscle. The study focused on the interactions between the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The analysis revealed two regulatory mechanisms that perform the same qualitative function, one affecting blood pressure through vasoconstriction and the other through blood volume regulation. Both systems are candidate oscillators, consisting of a negative-feedback loop of a monotone system, which can exhibit stable or oscillatory instability.

A subsystem, including ANP and AVP stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells, was identified as a candidate oscillator composed of a monotone system with multiple negative feedback loops. The study found that the oscillatory potential of this subsystem is higher when the delays along all feedback loops are comparable. The results provide insight into the physiological mechanisms governing long-term homeostasis of blood hydraulic parameters, which operate based on dynamic loops of interactions. The analysis suggests that the physiological mechanisms regulating blood pressure and blood volume are arranged into a complex of equivalent loop systems, consisting of candidate oscillators with a single equilibrium point. The study highlights the loop arrangement and its dynamic function in the AVP-ANP-RAAS endocrine control of body fluids and blood pressure.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism that regulates the growth of blood clots, known as thrombi, which are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The study focused on the role of fibrin networks, a component of thrombi, in controlling protein transport and thrombus growth. Experiments and model simulations revealed that the permeability and protein diffusivity of the fibrin network are crucial factors in determining the transport of proteins through the network. The researchers found that the fibrin network, also known as the "fibrin cap," limits the exposure of platelets on the thrombus surface to thrombin, a protein that activates platelets and promotes clot growth. By restricting the approach of resting platelets to the thrombus core, the fibrin cap also prevents platelets from reaching high concentrations of thrombin, which is necessary for platelet activation and thrombus growth. The study suggests that the formation of a fibrin cap prevents small, asymptomatic thrombi from developing into life-threatening events. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of thrombus growth and highlight the importance of spatial distributions of hemostatic activators, such as thrombin, in regulating thrombogenesis. The study's results complement recent research on thrombus development and emphasize the need to consider the role of fibrin networks in controlling protein transport and thrombus growth.
Researchers investigated the role of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth. They found that iNKT cell activation, as measured by CD25 upregulation and IFNγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18 produced by infected macrophages. However, iNKT cell control of Mtb growth was found to be CD1d-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFNγ. This suggests that conventional activation markers do not correlate with iNKT cell effector function during Mtb infection.

Further investigation revealed that iNKT cells produced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in vitro and in vivo in a CD1d-dependent manner during Mtb infection. GM-CSF was found to be both necessary and sufficient to control Mtb growth. The researchers found that GM-CSF production was a novel iNKT cell antimicrobial effector function and a potential role for GM-CSF in T cell immunity against Mtb.

The study used a co-culture system of iNKT cells and Mtb-infected macrophages to investigate the direct antimicrobial effector function of iNKT cells. The results showed that iNKT cells controlled Mtb growth independently of cytolytic activity and cytokines previously identified as antimycobacterial, such as TNF and IL-1β. The study suggests that iNKT cells limit bacterial growth through a non-classical effector function mediated by GM-CSF.
A recent study investigated the self-regulation of Candida albicans population size during gastrointestinal (GI) colonization. Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is a common component of human intestinal flora. Researchers studied genes expressed by fungi grown within a host to gain insight into C. albicans colonization. The EFH1 gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was highly expressed during growth of C. albicans in the intestinal tract. Unexpectedly, an efh1 null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, while an EFH1 overexpressing strain exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal tract and oral cavity of athymic mice. When inoculated into the bloodstream of mice, both efh1 null and EFH1 overexpressing strains caused lethal infections. In contrast, other mutants were attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation but exhibited normal levels of intestinal colonization. The results suggest that expression of EFH1 regulates the level of colonizing fungi, favoring commensalism as opposed to candidiasis. Furthermore, different genes are required in different host niches, and the pathways that regulate gene expression during host colonization can differ from those used during laboratory growth. The study highlights the importance of EFH1 in determining the population size of C. albicans during colonization and its potential role in reducing the likelihood of C. albicans infection.
Immunization with irradiated malaria sporozoites is a highly effective method for inducing protective CD8+ T cell responses against malaria liver stage parasites. However, the mechanisms underlying this approach are not fully understood. Researchers have found that prolonged antigen presentation is crucial for the optimal development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity. Using a model of immunization with irradiated sporozoites, they discovered that sporozoite antigen persists for over 8 weeks after immunization, despite the parasites being incapable of replication and differentiation. The persisting antigen was detected in lymphoid organs and was dependent on the presence of CD11c+ cells. This prolonged antigen presentation enhanced the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response in several ways. Firstly, reducing the time primed CD8+ T cells were exposed to antigen in vivo severely reduced the final size of the developing memory population. Secondly, fully developed memory cells expanded in previously immunized mice but not when transferred to naive animals. Finally, persisting antigen was able to prime naive cells, including recent thymic emigrants, to become functional effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in the liver. These findings suggest that the optimal development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages is dependent on the prolonged presentation of sporozoite-derived antigen.
Researchers investigated the potential of polymyxin B (polB) as a treatment for leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania amazonensis. They created nanoparticles coated with polB (PBCAnp-polB) and tested their leishmanicidal and antibacterial properties. The nanoparticles had a size of 261.5 ± 25.9 nm and a stable zeta potential of 1.79 ± 0.17 mV. The polB release from the nanoparticles was 6-7 times slower than the free polB, allowing for a prolonged release profile.

In vitro tests showed that polB alone had limited leishmanicidal activity, reducing amastigote infection of macrophages by 10 μg/mL but not completely eliminating the parasite. However, the PBCAnp-polB nanoparticles demonstrated leishmanicidal activity and surpassed the activity of free polB. The nanoparticles also showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella, making them a potential treatment for secondary infections associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis.

The researchers found that higher concentrations of polB did not increase its leishmanicidal efficacy, and the IC50 value for free polB was 77.1 μg/mL. In contrast, the PBCAnp-polB nanoparticles had an IC50 value of 6.0 μg/mL, a significant decrease compared to the free drug. The study suggests that the PBCAnp-polB formulation has antileishmanial and antimicrobial properties, making it a promising treatment option for leishmaniasis.
A historical cohort study was conducted in Belo Horizonte, Brazil to investigate the prognostic factors for death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The study analyzed data from the Reportable Disease Information System-SINAN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) for the period 2002-2009. Two multivariate logistic regression models were developed to identify variables associated with death from VL. Model 1 included variables present in both SINAN versions, while Model 2 included additional variables from the Net version. In Model 1, weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, and age ≥60 years were significantly associated with a greater risk of death from VL. In Model 2, bleeding, other associated infections, jaundice, and age ≥60 years were associated with an increased likelihood of death from VL. A prognostic score was developed using the variables from Model 2, which showed a predictive performance of 71.4% sensitivity, 73.7% specificity, 28.9% positive predictive value, and 94.5% negative predictive value. The study found that the factors associated with death from VL were weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, other associated infections, bleeding, jaundice, and age ≥60 years. These findings are consistent with previous studies, including those by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which identified age, jaundice, bleeding, and co-morbidities as factors associated with death from VL.
A novel allele of the Arabidopsis regulatory leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) BAK1, called bak1-5, has been identified, which differentially regulates plant growth, cell death, and innate immunity. The bak1-5 mutant is severely impaired in innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent receptor kinases FLS2 and EFR, but not in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling or cell death control. In contrast to the RD kinase BRI1, the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR have low kinase activity and are unable to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro. However, kinase activity is not required for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta. The specific suppression of FLS2- and EFR-dependent signaling in bak1-5 requires BAK1-5 kinase activity. The interaction of EFR and FLS2 with BAK1 is a requirement rather than a consequence of detectable phosphorylation. BAK1 is able to dictate specificity of downstream signaling, as BAK1-5 nearly totally blocked FLS2- and EFR-mediated PTI signaling but barely influenced cell death control and BRI1-mediated BR signaling. The results demonstrate a phosphorylation-dependent differential control of plant growth, innate immunity, and cell death by the regulatory RLK BAK1, revealing key differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ligand-binding RD and non-RD receptor kinases.
Researchers have developed a new approach to understand how cancer cells respond to anticancer treatments. Current methods do not fully capture the complexity of the cell's response to treatment, which involves multiple cell cycle phases and generations. To address this, the researchers combined time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometric data to create a computational model of the cell cycle and subsequent generations during and after treatment.

The model includes modules that describe the functional activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase. This framework allows for the application of different types of modules in each phase and testing of models at varying levels of complexity. The researchers applied this method to X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells, using time-course measures taken in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse live cell microscopy.

The resulting model provided a detailed rendering of the cell cycle process following X-ray exposure, including separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2/M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. This model reconciled known effects of ionizing radiation and provided new insights into the cell's response to treatment. The approach enables a detailed study of the mechanisms contributing to the response to anticancer treatment at the cell population level, accounting for inter-cell variability.
Researchers have identified a link between a genetic mutation in the Pdss2 gene and isolated renal disease in mice. The Pdss2 gene plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q (CoQ), an essential electron carrier in the respiratory chain. Mice with a missense mutation in the Pdss2 gene (Pdss2kd/kd) exhibited significantly lower levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in their kidneys compared to control mice. The disease manifestations in these mice were found to originate specifically in glomerular podocytes, as renal disease was observed in mice with podocyte-specific Pdss2 dysfunction but not in mice with conditional knockouts targeted to renal tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes.

The study suggests that the disease manifestations of CoQ deficiency are related to tissue-specific respiratory capacity thresholds, with glomerular podocytes being the most sensitive to Pdss2 impairment. The researchers also found that the inflammatory response is not the primary cause of the renal disease, but rather a mechanism used to collect and dispose of cellular debris. The availability of B6.Pdss2loxP/loxP mice will enable future investigations into the specific sites of CoQ deficiency and tissue damage in other tissues, such as the central nervous system and skeletal muscle, which are affected in human patients with primary mitochondrial disease caused by PDSS2 mutations.
Researchers have investigated the underlying mechanisms of phenotypic robustness, a key characteristic of life that enables organisms to withstand environmental and genetic disturbances. They found that determinative developmental cell lineages in two protostomes and one deuterostome exhibit robustness to cell deaths, which can be caused by necrosis or cell division program failure. This robustness is attributed to several features of the cell lineages, including their shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearances of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types. The researchers used computational simulations to demonstrate that these features can arise as an adaptation to random cell deaths in development, suggesting a new mechanism of phenotypic robustness. This mechanism operates at the supracellular level, distinct from previously studied mechanisms that act at the subcellular or cellular levels. The study provides a novel explanation for the contribution of ontogenesis to phenotypic robustness and highlights the importance of cell lineage robustness in species with predominantly determinative development, where cell fate is largely fixed. The findings also suggest that cell lineage robustness complements subcellular and cellular mechanisms of robustness to form a multi-layer defense system against environmental and genetic perturbations. Overall, the study reveals general organizing principles of determinative developmental cell lineages and sheds light on the evolutionary origins of phenotypic robustness.
Researchers have developed an open-source high-throughput platform called EmbryoPhenomics for studying the development of aquatic embryos. The platform consists of an Open-source Video Microscope (OpenVIM) and a Python package called Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV). OpenVIM captures high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under controlled environmental conditions, while EmbryoCV analyzes the videos to extract data on morphological, physiological, behavioral, and proxy traits during embryonic development.

The platform was tested on over 30 million images of more than 600 embryos from two species, the pond snail Radix balthica and the marine amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. The results showed that EmbryoCV successfully extracted phenome-level data from 95% of the images, providing high-dimensional data on embryo responses to environmental changes such as temperature and salinity.

The EmbryoPhenomics platform is capable of acquiring and processing data on functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest stages of life, making it a valuable tool for studying development and phenomics. The platform is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of experimental designs, from short-term to long-term experiments. The data generated by EmbryoPhenomics is comparable in scale, diversity, and quality to that produced by molecular-omic technologies, making it a valuable resource for understanding organismal responses to environmental change.
Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) undergo significant changes in metabolism as they transition between their complex life cycles in mosquito and human hosts. Researchers have used stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics to study the metabolic changes in Plasmodium berghei, a rodent malaria parasite. The study found that the parasite's metabolism shifts from a highly glycolytic metabolism in the asexual blood stages to a dependence on tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism in mosquito stages. Glutamine was identified as the primary input into TCA metabolism in both asexual and sexual blood stages, and is essential for complete male gametogenesis. Additionally, glutamine catabolism and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are crucial for the transition from ookinete to oocyst in the mosquito. These findings highlight significant metabolic differences between Plasmodium species and suggest potential targets for transmission-blocking intervention strategies. The study also underscores the importance of integrating metabolomics data with other platforms to inform drug discovery and design. The research provides new insights into the metabolic flexibility of Plasmodium mosquito stages and the impact of parasite metabolism on the development of these stages in the mosquito vector.
Incoherent feedforward loops (IFFLs) are a common motif in biological signaling pathways that enable cells to differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals in the regulation of downstream gene expression. This ability is crucial for various biological processes, including the timing of amoeba development and the maintenance of stem cell pluripotency. IFFLs consist of an input that simultaneously activates an output and an inhibitor of the output, allowing the system to exhibit temporal adaptation and distinguish input signals with varying temporal profiles.

Researchers have used quantitative modeling to examine the ability of IFFLs to process oscillatory signals. The study found that the system's ability to translate pulsatile dynamics is limited by two constraints: the kinetics of the IFFL components and the match between the network parameters and input signal characteristics. The results indicate that IFFLs can count the number of pulses in oscillatory signals, but only within a specific input range and with optimal network parameters.

The study highlights the importance of understanding how cells process oscillatory signals, as many natural biological networks exhibit the ability to distinguish oscillatory and sustained signals. The IFFL motif is found downstream of divergent signals in various biological processes, including social amoeba and mammalian cell differentiation. The findings of this study can be used to identify natural information decoding systems and understand the effect of perturbations to such networks, with implications for the design of synthetic gene circuits for processing oscillatory signals.
Researchers have developed improved methods for the quantification, propagation, purification, and long-term storage of Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, a leading cause of serious febrile illness in rural Southeast Asia. The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogen that can only be cultured in mammalian cells, making research into its basic mechanisms of cell biology and pathogenicity challenging. A clinical isolate of O. tsutsugamushi was grown in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast (L929) cells, and bacterial growth was measured using an O. tsutsugamushi-specific qPCR assay. A standardized method for comparing the viability of O. tsutsugamushi after purification, treatment, and propagation under various conditions was established. The study presents a body of data to support improved techniques for propagation, purification, and storage of this organism, which will be useful for improving clinical isolation rates and performing in vitro cell biology experiments. The developed methods will also be applicable to other obligate intracellular pathogens, such as those in the Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales families. The research aims to address the technical difficulties and uncertainties associated with culturing O. tsutsugamushi in vitro, which has hindered research into its fundamental mechanisms of cellular infection.
A recent study investigated the safety and efficacy of the antihelminthic drug praziquantel (PZQ) in treating schistosomiasis in children aged 1-5 years. Currently, children in this age group are excluded from schistosome control programs due to a lack of safety data on PZQ in this age group. The study involved 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 years who were treated with PZQ tablets, and their caregivers reported any side effects within 24 hours of treatment. The study found that 3.8% of the children experienced side effects, including stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation of the face and body.

The study also assessed the efficacy of PZQ treatment by measuring schistosome egg counts in urine 6 weeks after treatment. The results showed that PZQ treatment significantly reduced schistosome infection levels in 1-5 year olds, with an egg reduction rate of 99% and a cure rate of 92%. This was comparable to the efficacy of PZQ in 6-10 year olds, where the egg reduction rate was 96% and the cure rate was 67%. The study concluded that PZQ treatment is as safe and efficacious in children aged 1-5 years as it is in older children. These findings support the inclusion of pre-school children and infants in schistosome-control programs.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide functional screen in Drosophila to identify genes involved in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. They used RNAi-mediated knockdown to test the role of conserved genes between Drosophila and humans in tumorigenesis in vivo. The screen identified multiple novel and evolutionarily conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. Among the top 100 candidate tumor suppressor genes, 80 were validated in secondary Drosophila assays, including many known cancer genes and novel candidate genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumorigenesis.

The study found that low expression of the confirmed hits significantly correlated with the KRASG12 mutation status and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. The researchers mechanistically characterized the function of the top hit, Tetraspanin 29Fb (Tsp29Fb), which regulates EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrains tumor growth and invasion. Tsp29Fb was identified as a key regulator of EGFR/Ras-induced epithelial tumor growth and invasion.

This study provides a starting point for the identification of novel genes and pathways involved in tumor suppression and metastasis of Ras-driven epithelial cancers. The findings suggest that Tsp29Fb may be a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for a diverse range of epithelial tumors. The use of Drosophila as a model organism allowed the researchers to genetically dissect cancer-relevant signaling networks in the context of a whole animal, leading to the identification of novel and evolutionarily conserved epithelial cancer genes.
Researchers have identified a new gene, wtf13, in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe that acts as a meiotic driver. Meiotic drivers are genes that manipulate the reproductive process to increase their own transmission to offspring, often at the expense of other genes. Wtf13 achieves this by producing a poison that kills spores that do not inherit it, while also producing an antidote that rescues spores that do inherit it. This poison-antidote mechanism is similar to that of other meiotic drivers in the wtf gene family.

A second gene, wtf18-2, has been found to suppress the drive of wtf13 by mimicking the antidote produced by wtf13. Wtf18-2 only rescues spores that inherit it, allowing it to selfishly gain a transmission advantage while reducing the drive of wtf13. This discovery establishes a new paradigm for meiotic drive suppressors, which were previously thought to act indiscriminately to prevent spore destruction.

The study also suggests that the wtf gene family may have evolved from an ancestral gene that was a dual-transcript poison-antidote meiotic driver. Duplications of this ancestral gene may have been selected for their ability to cause drive and protect spores from the poison of the ancestral driver. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms and evolution of drive systems, and highlight the complex interactions between meiotic drivers and their suppressors.
Researchers have developed an algorithm that can predict changes in gene expression among human individuals using only their genetic variation. The algorithm uses information from multiple genetic variants in the local vicinity of the predicted gene and has been shown to be remarkably robust, agreeing well between training and test sets, even when the training and test sets consist of individuals from distinct populations. The algorithm's predictions are based solely on genotype information, ignoring environmental factors and trans sequence variation, resulting in a relatively small number of genes that can be predicted. However, the robust nature of the predictions means that the identity and quantitative degree to which genes can be predicted is known in advance.

The algorithm has been extended to incorporate heterogeneous types of genomic annotations to differentially weigh the importance of the various genetic variants. Assigning higher weights to variants with particular annotations, such as proximity to genes and high regional G/C content, can further improve the predictions. Genes that are successfully predicted have, on average, higher expression and more variability across individuals, providing insight into the characteristics of the types of genes that can be predicted from their cis genetic variation. The algorithm's ability to predict gene expression changes among individuals based on their genetic sequence variation has significant implications for understanding the susceptibility to different diseases and phenotypes.
A study investigated the cause of competitive suppression in rodent malaria, where a virulent clone of Plasmodium chabaudi (AJ) outcompetes an avirulent clone (AS). The researchers used dynamical-model based Bayesian inference to analyze the interaction between the two clones in immuno-deficient and competent mice. They tested six possible causes of competitive suppression: adaptive immune clearance of merozoites and parasitized red blood cells (RBCs), background loss of merozoites and parasitized RBCs, RBC age preference, RBC infection rate, burst size, and within-RBC interference. The study found that only one parameter, the ratio of background loss rate of merozoites to invasion rate of mature RBCs, needed to be clone-specific to predict the data. This parameter was the same for both clones in single-clone infections but different between the clones in mixed infections. The size of this difference was largest in immuno-competent mice and smallest in immuno-deficient mice, explaining why competitive suppression was alleviated in immuno-deficient mice. The results suggest that the innate immune response clearing merozoites is the most likely mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avirulent clones. The study also found that competitive suppression acts early in infection, even before the day of peak parasitemia, and predicts an interaction between the clones and the innate immune response that induces changes in the strength of its clearance of merozoites.
Researchers have proposed a new model, Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIRA), to explain the generation of interstitial, inverted triplications in the genome. This model suggests that a replication error at pre-existing short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences creates an extrachromosomal, inverted dimeric, autonomously replicating intermediate. This intermediate subsequently integrates into the genome, resulting in an inverted triplication without loss of distal chromosomal sequences. To test the feasibility of this model, the researchers used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They demonstrated that the proposed replication error, the ligation of leading and lagging nascent strands to create "closed" forks, can occur in vitro at short, interrupted inverted repeats. The removal of molecules with two closed forks results in a hairpin-capped linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted, dimeric plasmid. This plasmid then integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication. The ODIRA model can also explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons with a 2:1 mixture of sequences from both homologues of a single parent. The researchers' tests of key features of ODIRA lend support to this mechanism and suggest further avenues of enquiry to unravel the origins of interstitial, inverted copy number variations pivotal in human health and evolution.
Researchers have investigated the process of translation initiation in cells infected with the influenza virus. Translation initiation is the first step in protein synthesis, and it can occur at non-canonical start codons in response to stressful stimuli, such as viral infection. The study aimed to comprehensively map the landscape of translation initiation during influenza virus infection in human lung epithelial cells. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, including ribosome profiling, the researchers identified several candidate sites of alternate translation initiation in influenza mRNAs. These sites occur at AUG codons downstream of the canonical initiation codon and result in the production of novel proteins, including a truncated form of the N1 neuraminidase protein. This truncated protein is expressed on the cell surface, is enzymatically active, and is conserved in most N1 viral lineages. The study also found that human-adapted lineages of influenza virus exhibit signatures consistent with selection against alternate initiation at CUG codons. However, the researchers did not detect globally higher levels of alternate translation initiation on host transcripts upon influenza infection or during the anti-viral response. The study provides the first comprehensive analysis of translation initiation during influenza virus infection and sheds light on the evolutionary forces shaping this process.
Enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), cause foodborne disease, resulting in significant economic and health burdens. EHEC can lead to severe bloody diarrhea and potentially fatal kidney disease (hemolytic uremic syndrome) for which there is no effective treatment or prophylaxis. EHEC and other enteric pathogens utilize a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells, disrupting normal intestinal epithelial cell function. However, the mechanisms by which these effectors bind to host proteins have not been fully characterized. This study investigated the binding of E. coli O157:H7 T3SS effectors, NleH1 and NleH2, to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) transcriptional complexes. The study found that NleH1 and NleH2 bind to the N-terminus of RPS3 in the cytoplasm, independent of their kinase activity. NleH1, but not NleH2, reduced the nuclear abundance of RPS3 and repressed the transcription of a RPS3/NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid. In contrast, NleH2 stimulated RPS3-dependent transcription. Deletion of the nleH1 gene from E. coli O157:H7 resulted in a hypervirulent phenotype in a gnotobiotic piglet model of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection. The study suggests that NleH may disrupt host innate immune responses by binding to a cofactor of host transcriptional complexes.
Researchers have developed a new method for modeling the interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and DNA, called feature motif models (FMMs). The current dominant model, position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), assumes independence between binding positions, but FMMs can capture complex position dependencies and other high-level features. FMMs are based on log-linear models, which represent Markov networks, and use sequence features to represent TF binding specificities. Each feature may span multiple positions, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of TF-DNA interactions.

The researchers developed an algorithm for learning the structural features of FMMs from binding site data and a discriminative motif finder that discovers de novo FMMs enriched in target sets of sequences compared to background sets. They evaluated their approach on synthetic data and the widely used TF chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harbison et al. The results showed that FMMs explain TF binding significantly better than PSSMs.

The researchers applied their algorithm to high-throughput TF ChIP data from mouse and human and revealed sequence features present in the binding specificities of mouse and human TFs. They demonstrated the benefits of using log-linear models for representing important features of TF binding specificities and suggested a methodology to learn such features from both aligned and unaligned input sequences. The FMM learning and motif finder software are available online.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system in humans and chimpanzees by examining the adrenergic α2C receptor (ADRA2C) gene. They found that the neuronal expression of ADRA2C is lower in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. By analyzing three-dimensional chromatin structure, the team identified a cis-regulatory region whose DNA sequences have been accelerated in humans and chimpanzees. This region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binding motifs, each harboring a polymorphism. The derived alleles of these polymorphisms have reached fixation in humans and chimpanzees, but not in bonobos or macaques.

The researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays to show that the derived nucleotides repress ADRA2C expression by increasing NRSF binding. Additionally, they detected signatures of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans. The study suggests that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees. The researchers also identified two segregating variants in humans that appear to reflect positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression, and propose that a different repression mechanism may have evolved in humans compared to chimpanzees.
Researchers conducted a deep evolutionary comparison of gene expression in two independent lineages of C4 plants, Cleome gynandra and Zea mays, to investigate the genetic networks underlying the C4 photosynthetic pathway. C4 photosynthesis is a complex trait that has evolved at least 60 times in different plant lineages, resulting in a 50% increase in productivity in tropical and subtropical areas. The study used a new informatics framework to compare gene expression in species lacking reference genomes and identified a cohort of 3,335 genes that represent conserved components of leaf and photosynthetic development in these species. The researchers found that genes encoding proteins of the C4 cycle are recruited into networks defined by photosynthesis-related genes, and that homologous transcription factors are used to induce C4 photosynthesis and maintain cell-specific gene expression in both species. A core molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthetic maturation was identified, which is likely shared by angiosperm species derived from the last common ancestor of monocotyledons and dicotyledons. The study demonstrates that deep evolutionary comparisons of gene expression can reveal novel insights into the molecular convergence of complex phenotypes and that parallel evolution of trans-factors underpins the repeated appearance of C4 photosynthesis. The findings suggest that the transcription factors shared by independent C4 lineages are key targets for engineering the C4 pathway into C3 crops such as rice.
Researchers investigated the persistence of Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA in a healthcare worker (HCW) infected with EBOV in Sierra Leone, who was hospitalized in Italy. The study aimed to understand EBOV infection patterns in different body compartments to develop new countermeasures and comprehend human-to-human transmission pathways. The team longitudinally analyzed EBOV-specific negative sense genomic RNA (neg-RNA) and positive sense RNA (pos-RNA), including replication intermediate (antigenomic-RNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules, in the upper and lower respiratory tract, as compared to plasma.

The results showed that pos-RNA and neg-RNAs persisted in the lower respiratory tract even after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting possible local replication. The study found that the decay of EBOV total RNA, neg-RNA, and pos-RNA over time was significantly different in plasma compared to respiratory samples. The detection of pos-RNA together with neg-RNA in sputum supported the concept of active viral replication within the respiratory tract, rather than plasma spill-over or prolonged RNA stability.

The presence of replication markers in respiratory samples combined with the absence of detectable neg-RNA in plasma from day 5 suggested active replication of EBOV in lung tissues. This finding is consistent with a recent review of post-mortem examinations of fatal filoviral infections, which showed evidence of viral replication within the respiratory tract, including the presence of viral antigens in lung tissues and EBOV nucleic acids in resident macrophages. The study's findings contribute to the understanding of EBOV's biological features that contribute to human-to-human transmissibility and inform the development of effective intervention strategies.
Researchers investigated the role of the glycoprotein (GPC) from the Candid#1 (Cd#1) vaccine strain of Junin virus (JUNV) in attenuating Machupo virus (MACV), a New World arenavirus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF). A recombinant, chimeric MACV (rMACV/Cd#1-GPC) expressing Cd#1 GPC was previously found to be completely attenuated in a murine model and protected animals from lethal challenge with MACV. However, a single F438I substitution in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of GPC, equivalent to the F427I attenuating mutation in Cd#1 GPC, was not sufficient to fully attenuate JUNV. To investigate the contribution of different domains of Cd#1 GPC to attenuation, researchers rescued several rMACVs expressing the ectodomain of GPC from Cd#1 either alone (MCg1), along with the TMD F438I substitution (MCg2), or with the TMD of Cd#1 (MCg3). All rMACVs exhibited similar growth curves in cultured cells. In mice, MCg1 displayed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMACV, while MCg2 and MCg3 were completely attenuated and induced neutralizing antibody production against Cd#1. The results suggest that the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC plays a crucial role in the attenuation of rMACV/Cd#1-GPC, although the ectodomain alone is not sufficient for complete attenuation. These findings have implications for the development of vaccine candidates for MACV and other New World arenaviruses.
Researchers studied the centromeric histone 3 variant (CENH3) in Arabidopsis plants to understand its functional constraints. They created mutant alleles with single amino acid changes in conserved residues of the histone fold domain and found that many of these lines displayed normal growth and fertility when self-pollinated, but exhibited post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. This phenomenon is similar to the genome elimination syndromes observed in chimeric CENH3 and CENH3 from diverged species. The study suggests that a single point mutation in the histone fold domain of CENH3 is sufficient to generate a haploid inducer, providing a simple method for identifying non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized collections of crop species. An in silico search identified an Arabidopsis line carrying the A86V substitution within the histone fold domain, which produced post-zygotic death and uniparental haploids when crossed to wild-type plants. The results indicate that altering single conserved amino acid residues in the histone fold domain of CENH3 can lead to post-zygotic incompatibility and haploid production in F1 hybrids. The study also suggests that haploid inducers may exist among mutagenized populations or natural variants, and that a simple one-step method can be used to identify them.
Researchers investigated the role of alternative splicing in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiac precursors. They modified the H9 hESC line to allow selection of pluripotent hESCs by neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors by puromycin resistance. Exon-level microarray expression data from undifferentiated hESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify splice isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural differentiation expression patterns. The study found that splice events for these groups corresponded to pathways of cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle checkpoint control, as well as genes with serine/threonine kinase and helicase activity.

Using a new program called AltAnalyze, the researchers identified novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that were predicted to affect protein function and expression. These included an enrichment of splice isoforms that oppose cell-cycle arrest in hESCs and that promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors. The study suggests that specific splice isoforms and microRNA regulation may influence lineage commitment and hESC maintenance.

The researchers identified several genes that undergo alternative splicing during differentiation, including those involved in calcium signaling, cell metabolism, cell cycle, and double-stranded RNA binding. These findings imply that the loss of pluripotency corresponds to alternative splicing of genes that regulate transcription, cell-cell contact formation, and metabolism, while cardiac-enriched events favor contractile pathways, inhibition of neurogenesis, and Wnt signaling. The study provides new insights into the role of alternative splicing in the differentiation of hESCs into cardiac precursors and offers potential targets for driving the expression of pluripotent cells to distinct lineages.
Researchers have identified trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) as a potential target for developing antimicrobials against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), a pathogen responsible for tuberculosis. T6P is synthesized through the OtsA-OtsB2 pathway, which involves the enzymes OtsA and OtsB2. To assess the potential of OtsB2 as a drug target, the researchers created a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis that allowed for the regulated silencing of the otsB2 gene. They found that OtsB2 is essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and during the acute infection phase in mice, but not during the chronic infection phase. The researchers discovered that blocking OtsB2 leads to the accumulation of T6P, which is toxic to the cells, causing self-poisoning. This toxicity is responsible for the essentiality of OtsB2. By blocking T6P production in a mutant lacking the OtsA enzyme, the researchers were able to abrogate the essentiality of OtsB2. The accumulation of T6P also triggered a global upregulation of over 800 genes, which may be due to an increase in RNA stability caused by the neutralization of toxins with ribonuclease activity. A genome-wide screen for synthetic lethal interactions with OtsA identified numerous genes that could serve as potential drug targets for combination therapies with OtsB2 inhibitors to minimize the emergence of resistance.
Researchers have identified Trypanosoma cruzi proline racemase (TcPR) as a promising target for developing new treatments for Chagas' disease, a life-threatening illness affecting 11-18 million people. Current treatments have poor efficacy and safety profiles, making it essential to find alternative approaches. TcPR plays a crucial role in the parasite's ability to evade the host's immune system by exposing critical residues that trigger a mitogenic B-cell response. Understanding the conformational changes associated with substrate binding to TcPR is essential for developing effective therapies.

Using advanced molecular dynamics simulations, researchers were able to capture large-scale motions of TcPR and identify potential conformational epitopes located near newly identified binding pockets. The study revealed that the mitogenic properties of TcPR are associated with the exposure of conserved conformational epitopes around these binding pockets. The researchers also identified a model for the open form of TcPR, which was previously inaccessible through standard molecular dynamics simulations.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular basis of TcPR's mitogenic B-cell response and open up possibilities for structure-based drug discovery. The results suggest that targeting TcPR could lead to the development of more effective treatments for Chagas' disease, which is a significant step towards combating this devastating illness.
Researchers have developed a new method for controlling gene expression in mice, allowing for reversible and inducible gene knockout and rescue. This system, called iKO, enables scientists to turn genes on and off at will by treating the mice with doxycycline. The iKO system consists of two genetically modified mouse lines: a knockout (KO) line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated genomic locus. This locus provides low basal expression and high inducibility, allowing for precise control over gene expression.

The iKO system has been successfully applied to the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, allowing for sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. The results demonstrated reversible switching of ApoE transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The iKO system shows stringent regulation and is a versatile genetic system that can easily incorporate other techniques and adapt to a wide range of applications.

The iKO system offers several advantages over existing inducible gene expression approaches, including reversibility, efficiency, and flexibility. It can be used to generate iKOs for a large number of genes in a cost-effective manner, making it a valuable tool for high-throughput applications. The system has been engineered for streamlined production of both KO and TIGRE mice, allowing for a wide range of applications, including modeling human conditions such as hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.
Researchers investigated the genetic response of the placental environment in mice infected with two different strains of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. The study aimed to understand how the placenta responds to infection and how different parasite genotypes affect this response. Two strains of T. cruzi were used: K98, a non-lethal strain, and VD, a strain isolated from a human case of congenital infection.

Microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression in the placentas of infected and uninfected mice. The results showed that the "Secretory Granule" pathway was down-regulated in both infected groups, while the "Innate Immune Response" and "Response to Interferon-gamma" pathways were up-regulated in VD-infected mice but not in K98-infected mice. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm revealed that metabolic processes, transcription, and macromolecular transport were down-regulated in infected placentas, and some pathways related to cascade signaling had opposite regulation in VD and K98 groups.

The study also found that the VD strain had a stronger tropism to the placental organ, with detection of parasite DNA and RNA, indicating living parasites. The results suggest that the placental environment responds differently to infection with different T. cruzi genotypes, with a strong immune response in VD-infected mice that may contribute to controlling infection and preventing congenital transmission. This study provides new insights into the genetic response of the placental environment to T. cruzi infection and highlights the importance of understanding the role of parasite genotypes in pregnancy and congenital infection.
Researchers investigated the relationship between Sindbis virus (SINV) prevalence in mosquito vectors and outbreaks of polyarthritis and rash in northern Europe. SINV, also known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland, is a mosquito-borne virus that primarily occurs in tropical and sub-tropical countries, but also causes recurring outbreaks in northern Europe. A seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks has been suggested, but this hypothesis is based on reported human cases. To find a more objective outbreak signal, the researchers analyzed mosquito abundance and SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes from an endemic area in central Sweden. They collected mosquitoes from the River Dalälven floodplains during the years before, during, and after the hypothesized 2002 outbreak year and assayed them for virus on cell culture. The results showed a significant increase in SINV infection rates in both enzootic and bridge-vector mosquitoes in 2002, with 15 strains recovered compared to only one in 2001 and four in 2003. Sequence analysis revealed that all isolates belonged to the SINV genotype I (SINV-I) and showed local maintenance of four SINV-I clades in the River Dalälven floodplains over the years. The findings suggest that increased SINV-I prevalence in vector mosquitoes constitutes the most valuable outbreak marker for further scrutinizing the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks and the mechanisms behind. The study provides the first objective markers for SINV polyarthritis outbreaks in northern Europe.
Researchers investigated how the locust olfactory system transforms dense, synchronized spike trains from the antenna lobe (AL) into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB), a region associated with memory. Recordings from Kenyon cells (KCs) in the MB showed highly specific responses to odors, with typically only a few KCs responding reliably to a specific odor. Different odors induced responses in different KCs. A biologically plausible model was used to explore the possibility that plasticity at the synapses between the AL and MB regulates the specificity of KCs' responses to familiar or meaningful odors. The model found that activity-dependent plasticity efficiently regulated the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter the intense AL oscillatory output and condense it to a sparse representation in the MB. This plasticity drove the observed specificity, reliability, and persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role for plasticity in information processing and making a testable prediction about synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses. The study focused on the effects of plasticity at the synapses connecting projection neurons (PNs) of the AL to KCs in the MB calyx. The results are consistent with a recent set of experimental results supporting a pre-synaptic mechanism of plasticity between KCs and mushroom body extrinsic neurons as a critical process in olfactory memory.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study aimed to identify functionally associated genes involved in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). Researchers analyzed transcriptional profiles from five CAD-relevant tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, atherosclerotic arterial wall, and unaffected arterial wall, from 278 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Two-way clustering identified 60 tissue clusters, with one cluster in atherosclerotic arterial wall and one in visceral fat segregating patients into two groups based on the extent of coronary stenosis. These associations were validated by analyzing carotid atherosclerosis expression profiles. The study found that genes involved in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TEML) pathway were overrepresented in all three clusters, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A-module). The A-module was found to be genetically enriched with CAD risk by 1.8-fold. The transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 (LDB2) was identified as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module. Subnetwork analysis, cellular and lesion expression of LDB2, and expression of 13 TEML genes in Ldb2-deficient arterial wall supported this notion. The A-module appears to be important for atherosclerosis development and, together with LDB2, merits further attention in CAD research.
Researchers have identified a two-loop transcriptional feedback mechanism in the circadian clock of cyanobacteria, specifically in the model organism Synechococcus. The KaiC protein, a central component of the circadian clock, undergoes different phospho-states during the 24-hour day-night cycle. However, it was unclear which phospho-state of KaiC promotes or suppresses the transcription of its own gene, kaiBC. To address this, a combined model of post-translational oscillation and transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL/PTO) was developed. The model revealed that threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate kaiBC transcription, while unphosphorylated KaiC hexamers suppress it. This two-loop feedback mechanism was able to reproduce existing experimental observations, including the effects of knocking out or overexpressing kai genes. The model suggests that the peak expression ratio of the positive and negative components of kaiBC expression is crucial in determining how the circadian clock responds to changes in kai gene expression. This study provides new insights into the regulation of the cyanobacterial circadian clock and its output pathways, which control hundreds of rhythmically regulated genes in the genome. The findings also show parallels with two-loop feedback structures found in the mammalian clock, highlighting the conservation of circadian clock mechanisms across different organisms.
Researchers investigated the characteristics of HIV-2 reservoirs in individuals with a poorly productive HIV-2 infection and slow or absent disease progression. They found that HIV-2 reservoirs differ from those of HIV-1 in two key ways. Firstly, HIV-2 does not infect monocytes, suggesting that the virus is poorly adapted to the myeloid compartment. Secondly, HIV-2 primarily infects transitional-memory CD4 T-cells (TTM) rather than central-memory CD4 T-cells (TCM), which are the main reservoirs of HIV-1. This difference in infection patterns is associated with the expression of the CXCR6 co-receptor and restriction factors, such as TRIM5, which are thought to act on HIV-2 but not on HIV-1. The study suggests that HIV-2 may be less adapted to human central-memory CD4 T-cells than to transitional-memory ones. The findings provide new insights into the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection and shed light on the mechanisms underlying its attenuated replication. The study's results are consistent with those of other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infection, where TCM reservoirs are limited compared to more differentiated cells due to low CCR5 co-receptor expression. Overall, the study highlights the unique characteristics of HIV-2 reservoirs and their implications for understanding the virus's low pathogenicity.
Researchers have developed a new model called the Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) to explain how selective attention affects the activity and selectivity of cortical neurons. This model provides a mechanistic description of selective attentional processing in the cortex and is implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons. The ARC model maps computations for selective attentional processing to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry, allowing it to simulate various forms of attentional modulation.

The ARC model demonstrates that with shifts of spatial attention, neurons may exhibit shifting and shrinking of receptive fields, increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features (response gain), and that the effect on contrast-response functions is better explained as a response-gain effect than as contrast-gain. The model is consistent with a wide array of available data and makes several specific and quantifiable predictions.

The ARC model overcomes limitations of past models by providing a unified explanation of attentional effects, being implemented in spiking neurons, defining the relationship of attentional modulation across multiple cortical areas, and making detailed testable predictions. The model's mechanisms for selective routing predict that spatial attention only affects neural spatial selectivity, without altering selectivity for other feature dimensions. The ARC model also predicts that an increasing proportion of neurons at each higher cortical level will show attentional modulation, with the magnitude of modulation increasing in higher cortical areas.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study to investigate the genetic factors contributing to atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and heritable arrhythmia. They analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 without AF from four population-based cohorts. The study aimed to identify coding genetic variants associated with AF susceptibility. After adjusting for multiple testing, none of the 99,404 common variants evaluated were significantly associated with AF. However, a common missense variant in the SYNPO2L gene (rs3812629) was found to be significantly associated with AF, with an odds ratio of 1.27. This variant lies at a known AF susceptibility locus and is in linkage disequilibrium with a top marker from prior analyses at the locus. The study did not observe significant associations between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. Furthermore, individuals with AF did not display any statistically significant enrichment for common or rare coding variation in previously implicated AF genes. The results suggest that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF. The study highlights the need for larger sample sizes or populations enriched for large genetic effects to identify biologically meaningful coding variation underlying AF. The findings are consistent with other whole exome sequencing efforts of complex diseases, which have generally not identified coding variation as the major mechanisms underlying these conditions.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 human cases of alveolar echinococcosis (AE) were detected in Poland. The disease, caused by Echinococcus multilocularis infections, is a serious health concern in the Northern Hemisphere. The cases were verified through clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory criteria, with 83 confirmed, 16 probable, and 22 possible cases. The majority of patients were diagnosed in an advanced stage of the disease, with the liver being the primary location of AE in all cases. In 30 patients, the disease spread to other organs. The patients' ages ranged from 6 to 82 years, with a mean age of 47.7 years. The disease was fatal in 23 patients, with a mean age at death of 54.1 years.

The study found a continuous increase in the detection rate of AE cases over the two decades, with a sex ratio of 0.86:1 (male to female). Family agglomeration of AE was found in four foci, involving nine patients. The majority of patients (94) were treated with albendazole, and 73 underwent surgical operations, including 15 liver transplantations. The study highlights the need for a wider national program to implement screening in high-risk areas, increase public awareness of the disease, and train primary care physicians to recognize the risk of AE for early detection. The results indicate that AE is an emerging disease in Poland, making it the fourth country in Europe with over 120 cases detected.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein in Escherichia coli to understand how microorganisms respond to changes in zinc availability. They solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PznuABC promoter and found that Zur represses gene expression by binding to the promoter in a highly cooperative manner. This cooperative binding requires a pair of asymmetric salt bridges between Arg52 and Asp49′ that connect two adjacent dimers. The researchers also discovered a new member of the Zur-regulon, pliG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-responsive manner. However, the pliG promoter forms stable complexes with either one or two Zur dimers with significantly less protein-DNA cooperativity than observed at other Zur-regulon promoters.

The researchers compared the in vitro Zur-DNA binding affinity at each of four Zur-regulon promoters and found a 10,000-fold variation in Zur-DNA binding constants. The degree of Zur repression observed in vivo paralleled this trend, with a 100-fold difference in transcript copy number between wild-type and Δzur strains. These findings suggest that the number of ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-family dimers that bind within any given promoter varies significantly and that the thermodynamic profile of the Zur-DNA interactions directly correlates with the physiological response at different promoters. The results provide strong support for the idea that the thermodynamics of an ensemble of protein-DNA interactions play a dominant role in the physiological control of gene regulation networks.
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that affects ruminants, causing high morbidity and mortality. A 2008-2009 outbreak occurred in Madagascar, including the Anjozorobe district in the highlands. An entomological survey found no Aedes mosquitoes, a primary RVF virus (RVFV) vector, and low mosquito abundance due to unfavorable climatic conditions. No signs of infection were detected in wild terrestrial mammals, suggesting no wild RVFV reservoir. However, a three-year serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed recurrent RVFV circulation.

A spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was developed to understand the key determinants of this transmission. Three scenarios were analyzed: (i) RVFV overwintering through direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve, (ii) low-level vector-based circulation during winter, and (iii) a combination of both mechanisms. Multi-model inference methods selected a model incorporating both low-level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. This model satisfactorily reproduced field observations, attributing 84% of cattle infections to vector-borne transmission and 16% to direct transmission.

The study suggests that interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange practices are key elements for understanding RVFV circulation in the Madagascar highlands. The findings indicate that RVFV circulation in this area is attributable to both vector-based transmission and direct transmission at calving of viraemic cows, with socio-economic practices playing a determinant role in virus introduction, spread, and persistence.
Researchers investigated the invasion history and genetic structure of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, in the Indo-Pacific region. The study used 13 nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial COI sequences from 911 individuals to analyze the species' movements and population structure. The results suggest that Aedes albopictus was introduced to New Guinea via mainland Southeast Asia, before colonizing the Solomon Islands via either Papua New Guinea or Southeast Asia. The analysis also indicates that the recent incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait Islands was seeded primarily from Indonesia. A recently colonized population in the Torres Strait Islands showed rapid temporal changes in its genetic makeup, which could be due to genetic drift or a secondary invasion from an unknown source. The study found high spatial genetic structure and high gene flow between some geographically distant populations, suggesting that human movements drive the species' dispersal pattern. The research provides a more comprehensive understanding of the species' native range, revealing more spatial population structure than previously shown. The study also presents the most probable invasion history of Aedes albopictus in the Australasian region using Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) analysis.
A cross-sectional study conducted in the Mwanza Region of North-Western Tanzania investigated the impact of Schistosoma mansoni infection on the quality of life and physical fitness of 572 schoolchildren aged 7-8 years. The study found that 58.7% of the children were infected with S. mansoni, with 56.5% having light infections and 16.4% having heavy infections. Girls had significantly higher infection intensities than boys. The study also found that 30.1% of the children were anemic, but there was no association between S. mansoni infection and anthropometry, anaemia, liver or spleen pathology. However, children with S. mansoni infection had a significantly lower score in the emotional dimension of quality of life compared to uninfected children. In contrast, infected children had a higher VO2 max (a measure of physical fitness) compared to uninfected children. In multivariable linear regression analyses, age, S. mansoni infection, haemoglobin, and VO2 max were significant predictors of emotional quality of life, while physical quality of life, height, age, and haemoglobin were significant predictors of VO2 max. The study concluded that S. mansoni infection had a significant effect on the emotional dimension of quality of life, but not on physical fitness.
Researchers compared the effects of three different routes of Leptospira infection in rats: mucosal, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal. Leptospira is a spirochete that causes leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease found worldwide. The study aimed to investigate the natural transmission routes of Leptospira in rat colonies, as previous studies used an intraperitoneal inoculation route, which is not a natural route of infection. The researchers found that Leptospira infection was asymptomatic in all rats, regardless of the inoculation route, and caused similar antibody production. However, the rates of renal colonization were different among the three routes: 8 out of 8 rats for intraperitoneal, 5 out of 8 rats for mucosal, and 1 out of 8 rats for subcutaneous inoculation. The mucosal route was found to be more efficient for renal colonization associated with urinary excretion than the subcutaneous route and induced a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route. The study suggests that mucosal inoculation is a more natural and efficient route of Leptospira infection in rats, which can facilitate understanding of the infection modalities in rat colonies. The findings of this study can contribute to the development of more accurate rat models for studying Leptospira infection and disease transmission.
Researchers have identified a novel role for Annexin A2 (AnxA2) in regulating the inflammatory response during sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by excessive inflammation, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction. In a study using a mouse model of sepsis, mice lacking AnxA2 (anxa2-/-) exhibited increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and decreased bacterial clearance, leading to higher mortality. The study found that AnxA2 functions as a putative inhibitor of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that cysteine 9 of AnxA2 is crucial for regulating ROS levels. Elevated ROS levels, in turn, contribute to increased levels of IL-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that exacerbates the inflammatory response. Depletion of IL-17 via CRISPR/Cas9 knockout strategy reduced inflammation and improved survival in anxa2-/- mice. These findings suggest that AnxA2 plays a critical role in modulating the inflammatory response during sepsis by regulating ROS and IL-17A levels. The study provides new insights into the pathophysiology of sepsis and identifies AnxA2 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in the anti-HIV-1 effects of Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) stimulation in macrophages. They found that stimulation of macrophages with polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a ligand for TLR4, significantly reduced HIV-1 infection. In contrast, stimulation with TLR2, TLR7, or TLR9 agonists only partially reduced infection. The suppression of infection did not correlate with changes in CD4 or CCR5 expression, type I interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or β-chemokines. Microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed increased miR-155 levels in macrophages stimulated with TLR3/4, but not TLR7. A miR-155 specific inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly(I:C)-stimulated macrophages. Ectopic expression of miR-155 significantly reduced HIV-1 infection in primary macrophages and cell lines. The study suggests that miR-155 exerts an anti-HIV-1 effect by targeting several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the circadian clock, light signaling, and growth-promoting hormone pathways in plants. They analyzed the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under various growth conditions and mutant backgrounds using DNA microarrays. The study found that a group of plant hormone-associated genes are co-expressed at the time of day when hypocotyl growth rate is maximal. This expression is correlated with the presence of a specific cis-acting element (CACATG) in phytohormone gene promoters, which is sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian expression patterns in vivo.

The researchers also showed that both internal coincidence of phytohormone signaling capacity and external coincidence with darkness are required to coordinate wild-type growth. The circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive gating of light-mediated phytohormone transcript levels to the proper time of day. This temporal integration of hormone pathways allows plants to fine-tune phytohormone responses for seasonal and shade-appropriate growth regulation.

The study suggests that the circadian clock acts upstream of light signaling to gate phytohormone gene expression during the early evening. The circadian clock and light signaling pathways interact to coordinate the expression of biosynthetic, catabolic, receptor, and signaling genes from multiple phytohormone pathways. This extensive transcriptional network, governed by the circadian clock, light, and temperature cycles, ensures that almost 90% of transcripts in Arabidopsis accumulate at specific times over the day.
Researchers have explored the use of RNA interference (RNAi) to control the spread of Chagas disease, which is transmitted by the insect Rhodnius prolixus. To achieve this, they genetically modified the insect's gut microbiota to deliver molecules that silence specific genes. Two genes, Rhodnius heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT), were targeted for silencing. RHBP is involved in egg production, while CAT is an antioxidant enzyme essential for the insect's survival.

The researchers used two types of bacteria, Escherichia coli and Rhodococcus rhodnii, to deliver double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that silences the targeted genes. The results showed that feeding the bacteria to nymphs and adult insects led to a significant reduction in RHBP and CAT gene expression in various tissues, including the fat body, midgut, and ovaries. This gene silencing had a range of effects on the insects, including increased mortality rates, reduced molting rates, and decreased oviposition (egg-laying).

The researchers found that the effects of gene silencing were systemic and temporal, meaning they occurred throughout the insect's body and lasted for several days. They also discovered that the earlier the insect received the bacterial treatment, the greater the impact on its fitness. The study suggests that modifying the insect microbiota to induce RNAi could be a sustainable strategy for controlling Chagas disease vectors.
A study conducted on the Thai-Burmese border from 2004 to 2006 found that fever in pregnancy is a significant health concern, increasing the risk of maternal death and infant morbidity and mortality. Approximately 5% of pregnant women attending antenatal clinics experienced febrile episodes, with malaria being the leading cause, accounting for 55.5% of cases. Arthropod-borne diseases such as malaria, rickettsial infections, and dengue, as well as zoonotic diseases like leptospirosis, were responsible for nearly half of all febrile illnesses. Coinfections were observed in 3.9% of women, mostly malaria and rickettsia. Pyelonephritis was also a common cause of fever, affecting 19.7% of women. After excluding malaria, pyelonephritis, and acute respiratory illness, one-third of remaining febrile infections were attributed to rickettsia or leptospirosis. Scrub and murine typhus were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth weight. Malaria remains the leading cause of fever in pregnancy on the Thai-Burmese border. The study suggests that febrile pregnant women without malaria, pyelonephritis, or respiratory tract infection should be treated with azithromycin, effective against typhus and leptospirosis. The findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the causes of febrile illness in pregnant women in rural tropical areas to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
Researchers investigated the relationship between maternal age and recombination rates in humans by analyzing over 600,000 genetic markers in 69 French-Canadian pedigrees. They localized recombination events at high resolution and observed a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age. This effect was found to be localized in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions. The study suggests that for some chromosomes, the protective effect of recombination against non-disjunction becomes less efficient with increasing maternal age, contributing to higher rates of aneuploidy in older women. The researchers propose a model that reconciles their findings with reported associations between maternal age and recombination in cases of trisomies. Chromosome-specific effects were observed, which may vary among populations due to genetic differences in factors regulating the recombination machinery. The study highlights the importance of understanding the complex relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans, particularly in relation to the mechanisms involved in human trisomies. The findings suggest that different chromosomes are subjected to distinct selective, mechanistic, or structural constraints influencing recombination patterns over successive generations.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to induce innate memory in macrophages, a type of immune cell, to provide long-term protection against opportunistic infections. This method involves priming macrophages with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in vivo, which activates the STAT1 signaling pathway and leads to the up-regulation of genes associated with anti-fungal immunity. The primed macrophages exhibit a memory-like phenotype that lasts for at least 70 days and provides complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells.

RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the enhanced cytokine recall responses in primed macrophages are pathogen-specific, dependent on changes in histone methylation and acetylation, and correlated with increased STAT1 binding to promoter regions of genes associated with protective anti-fungal immunity. This approach is particularly relevant for patients who are deficient in aspects of the adaptive immune system, making them more susceptible to opportunistic infections.

The study demonstrates that IFN-γ priming of macrophages in vivo is a realistic therapeutic approach that selectively targets IFN-γ associated genes, leaving residual TLR and CLR functions intact for host-defense mechanisms. This concept suggests that immunization strategies that drive memory-like innate immune responses may provide a novel and effective mechanism for inducing vaccine-mediated protection in immunocompromised patients.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play a crucial role in transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in plants and animals. In Arabidopsis, the depletion of different members of PRCs causes both overlapping and unique phenotypic defects, but the underlying molecular mechanism determining target specificity and functional diversity is not well understood. Researchers used a quantitative comparison of H3K27 tri-methylation and gene expression profiles in loss-of-function mutants of PRC1 and PRC2 components in Arabidopsis seedlings. They found that CURLY LEAF (CLF), a major catalytic subunit of PRC2, coordinates with different members of PRC1 in the suppression of distinct plant developmental programs. The expression of flower development genes is repressed in seedlings preferentially via a non-redundant role of CLF, which specifically associates with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1). In contrast, the expression of embryo development genes is repressed by PRC1-catalytic core subunits AtBMI1 and AtRING1 in common with PRC2-catalytic enzymes CLF or SWINGER (SWN). This context-dependent role of CLF corresponds with changes in H3K27me3 profiles and is associated with differential co-occupancy of binding motifs of transcription factors, including MADS box and ABA-related factors. The study suggests that different combinations of PRC members distinctively regulate different developmental programs, and their target specificity is modulated by specific transcription factors.
Researchers studied the "trigger loop" (TL) of RNA polymerase II, a crucial component of the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA. The TL plays a multifaceted role in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation. By analyzing nearly all single variants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II TL at the individual-residue level, the study revealed three distinct mutant classes linked to transcription defects or various stresses. Mutations disrupting an intra-TL hydrophobic pocket led to phenotypes consistent with pocket disruption and increased catalysis, suggesting a mechanism for substrate-triggered TL folding through destabilization of a catalytically inactive TL state. The study also found that allele-specific genetic interactions among TL and TL-proximal domain residues support the contribution of the funnel and bridge helices to TL dynamics. This structural genetics approach provides a high-resolution dissection of transcription mechanisms and their evolution, and can be applied to other essential yeast proteins. The research sheds light on the functional contribution of TL residues to its dynamics, catalysis, and evolutionary constraints, and expands the scope of existing deep mutational scanning studies. The findings suggest that both intra-TL interactions and TL interactions with nearby domains are critical for TL function, and support a multi-step TL folding model for the promotion of catalysis. The study identifies many predicted gain-of-function and loss-of-function TL variants, some of which are predicted to confer epistatic interactions.
Researchers investigated the pathogenesis of rabies virus (RV) in mice by comparing the effects of intramuscular (i.m.) and intravenous (i.v.) inoculation of two RV strains: DOG4, associated with dogs, and SB, associated with silver-haired bats. The study aimed to determine whether RV can invade the central nervous system (CNS) through hematogenous spread, a process where the virus enters the bloodstream and directly infects the brain. The results showed that while i.m. inoculation of both strains caused a lethal encephalopathy, only i.v. inoculation of SB resulted in a lethal infection. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that i.v. administered SB directly infected the forebrain, specifically targeting the hypothalamic nuclei connected by neurosecretory fibers to the circumventricular organs neurohypophysis and median eminence. The study suggests that hematogenous spread of SB can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. This alternative mode of virus spread has implications for post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly for silver-haired bat-associated RV.
Researchers studied the evolutionary history of the H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus, which has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans since the 1918 pandemic. They analyzed 71 complete genome sequences from 1918 to 2006 and found that segmental reassortment played a crucial role in the genomic evolution of A/H1N1. This process involves the exchange of genetic material between different influenza viruses, which can lead to the creation of new viruses with pandemic potential.

The study revealed that an A/H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired new PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the sudden antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may have been associated with reassortant A/H1N1 viruses. These findings suggest that intra-subtype reassortment is a more significant process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously thought.

The researchers also found strong phylogenetic evidence for several distinct reassortment events affecting specific segments of the H1N1 genome. This study provides new insights into the evolutionary history of A/H1N1 and highlights the importance of reassortment in the emergence and spread of influenza viruses. The findings have implications for our understanding of the origins of the 1918 pandemic and the potential for future pandemics.
A computational model of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) circuitry and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function has shed light on the mechanisms by which nicotine exerts its reinforcing action. The model suggests that both direct stimulation of dopamine (DA) cells through nAChR activation and disinhibition mediated through desensitization of nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons can contribute to the phasic mesolimbic dopamine response to nicotine. The model illustrates that α4β2-containing nAChRs on either DA or GABA cells can mediate the acute effects of nicotine, and that the rate of endogenous acetylcholine input is crucial in determining the evoked DA response for both mechanisms.

The study used a novel mesoscopic computational modeling approach to describe the interplay between the pharmacodynamics of nicotine and the dopaminergic signal constructed in the VTA. The results show that low endogenous cholinergic input rates are necessary for direct stimulation, while high cholinergic inputs are required for disinhibition to occur. This is consistent with known activation and desensitization properties of α4β2 nAChRs. The study also reconciles in vitro and in vivo data on nicotine-evoked modulation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to DA neurons.

The findings suggest that the VTA mediates the acute rewarding properties of nicotine and propose an acetylcholine dependence hypothesis for nicotine reinforcement. The study identifies specific circuit-level pathways of nicotine action in the VTA and highlights the critical role of GABAergic cells in the action of nicotine.
A randomized controlled phase IIa trial was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan, to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel therapeutic approach for treating cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania (L.) tropica. The study involved 113 patients with CL, who were randomly assigned to receive either bipolar high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by daily moist-wound-treatment (MWT) with polyacrylate hydrogel with (group I) or without (group II) pharmaceutical sodium chlorite (DAC N-055). The primary outcome was the time needed for complete lesion epithelialization.

The results showed that the mean duration for complete wound closure was 43.1 days in group I and 42 days in group II, with no significant difference between the two groups. However, in patients with Leishmania-positive biopsies after wound closure, the addition of DAC N-055 resulted in a more rapid wound epithelialization, with a mean duration of 37.2 days compared to 58.3 days without DAC N-055. Superinfections occurred at the same rate in both groups, but reulcerations were more common in patients with persistent high parasite loads after healing.

In vitro studies showed that DAC N-055 had a leishmanicidal effect on both pro- and amastigotes. Compared to previous results with intralesional antimony injections, the EC plus MWT protocol led to more rapid wound closure. The study suggests that the addition of DAC N-055 may accelerate wound healing and reduce the risk of relapse in patients with persistent parasite loads.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify factors impacting RAS-mediated MAPK activation. The screen revealed 101 validated hits, including most previously known factors associated with the pathway. Epistasis experiments determined the position of individual candidates relative to core pathway components, revealing new factors acting at different steps along the pathway, including a new protein complex modulating RAF activation. However, most hits unexpectedly work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors, suggesting that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. Characterization of two representative members of this group revealed that they act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila, indicating that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events, but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. Core splicing components can also specifically impact alternative splicing.
A retrospective study of 498 Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii isolates from Thailand was conducted to gain a better understanding of cryptococcosis in the country. The majority of the isolates (68.9%) were from male patients with a mean age of 37.97 years, and 88.5% of C. neoformans and 37.5% of C. gattii strains were from HIV patients. Molecular typing revealed that the majority of the isolates were C. neoformans molecular type VNI (94.8%), regardless of their source. Other molecular types, such as VNII, VNIV, VGI, and VGII, were found less frequently. Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST) analysis identified 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand, with ST30 for C. gattii and ST82, ST83, ST137, ST141, ST172, and ST173 for C. neoformans being unique to Thailand. The study found that most C. gattii isolates were ST7=VGIIb, which is identical to the less virulent minor Vancouver island outbreak genotype, indicating Thailand as a potential stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types among Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. The findings suggest that C. neoformans is the most common species identified among HIV-positive patients, while C. gattii is mainly a primary pathogen in immunocompetent patients.
Researchers investigated the role of transcription factor (TF) variation in the evolution of regulatory networks across 12 Drosophila species. They focused on the Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, the largest class of metazoan TFs. The study found that a significant fraction of C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs exhibit variations that can affect their DNA-binding specificities. Approximately 44% of domains shared between Drosophila melanogaster and other fly species have diverging DNA-contacting residues, which are conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues. These variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D. melanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation. The predicted specificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Furthermore, proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in developmental functions, while those with varying domains exhibit no functional enrichments. The study suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and other metazoans. The findings challenge the assumption that 1-to-1 orthologous TFs are always highly conserved and provide evidence that binding specificity modifications in single-copy TFs may play an important role in the regulatory evolution of Drosophila and other higher metazoans.
Researchers have developed specific PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays to identify and differentiate between Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, the causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers. These assays target a unique region of the Salmonella genome known as CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), which is highly stable and specific to each serotype. The CRISPR-based PCR assays were validated on a large collection of strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins, and time periods, demonstrating 100% sensitivity and specificity for each protocol. The assays were also tested on 70 strains of bacteria frequently encountered in bloodstream infections, including 29 other Salmonella serotypes and 42 strains from 38 other bacterial species, with no false positives or false negatives.

The researchers used two types of PCR assays: conventional multiplex PCR and EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex PCR. The conventional multiplex PCR assay was able to detect and differentiate between serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates, while the real-time singleplex PCR assays were used to detect each serotype separately. The CRISPR targets used in the assays are suitable for the specific detection of all populations of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, making them a valuable tool for clinical and public health laboratories with access to PCR technology. The assays can be used with DNA from cultured isolates, and with modifications, could be adapted for use with clinical and other samples.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the differentiation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off intracellular parasites. They found that Notch receptors, specifically Notch1 and Notch2, are essential for the production of interferon-gamma (IFNγ), a key cytokine produced by Th1 cells that helps to eliminate parasites. The study used mice with specific deletions of Notch1, Notch2, or both, and infected them with the protozoan parasite Leishmania major. The results showed that mice lacking both Notch1 and Notch2 (N1N2ΔCD4Cre) were unable to produce IFNγ and developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia. In contrast, mice with single deletions of Notch1 or Notch2 (N1ΔCD4Cre or N2ΔCD4Cre) were resistant to infection and developed a protective Th1 immune response. This suggests that Notch1 and Notch2 have redundant functions in driving Th1 differentiation. Furthermore, the study found that Notch signaling is required for IFNγ secretion by Th1 cells, and that this effect is independent of the major effector of Notch receptors, CSL/RBP-Jκ. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Notch signaling in the development of a functional Th1 immune response against Leishmania major infection. The findings have implications for the development of new vaccines and immunotherapeutic targets against Leishmania and other infections requiring a protective IFNγ-secreting CD4+ Th1 immune response.
This study investigated whether pre-existing infection with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni increases susceptibility to HIV-1 infection in rhesus macaques. The researchers exposed two groups of animals, one with and one without S. mansoni infection, to decreasing doses of a simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C). The results showed that S. mansoni-infected monkeys became systemically infected with SHIV-C at viral doses that were sub-infectious in uninfected animals. In fact, the dose required to infect 50% of the S. mansoni-infected monkeys was 17 times lower than in the uninfected group. Additionally, the infected monkeys had higher peak viral RNA loads and increased viral replication in CD4+ central memory cells compared to the uninfected group. These findings provide the first direct evidence that acute schistosomiasis increases the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. The study suggests that controlling helminth infections, such as schistosomiasis, may be a useful public health intervention to reduce the spread of HIV-1, particularly in areas where both parasites and HIV-1 are endemic. The results have significant public health implications, as sub-Saharan Africa, where schistosomiasis is prevalent, accounts for more than 62% of the world's HIV/AIDS cases.
A biophysical model of the cortex has been developed to investigate the role of acetylcholine (ACh) in regulating neural excitability and network dynamics. The model consists of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons with a M-current regulated by ACh, which reduces spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) and shifts the phase response curve (PRC). The model demonstrates three distinct functional regimes: localized asynchronous, traveling asynchronous, and traveling synchronous patterns of activity. These regimes are influenced by changes in neural excitability and network structure, and are consistent with experimental observations of cortical activity during slow wave sleep (SWS), REM sleep, and waking states. During SWS, traveling patterns of activity are observed, whereas stationary patterns occur in other states. The model shows that the level of ACh determines the sensitivity of network activity to synaptic heterogeneity, and that ACh-induced changes in SFA and PRC shape occur over different values of the M-current. The results suggest that ACh plays a crucial role in determining patterns of cortical activity and functional differences arising from these patterns. The model's predictions are consistent with experimental findings, including the induction of traveling waves of high frequency upstates and quiescent downstates during SWS, and the role of ACh in modulating neural excitability and synchronization properties.
Researchers investigated the impact of mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway genes on the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). They analyzed whole genome sequencing data from 171 EAC patients and found that non-synonymous mutations affecting the TLR pathway were present in 14.6% of the tumors. These mutations were associated with more proximal tumors and metastatic disease, suggesting a possible clinical significance. The study also found that TLR pathway mutations were rare in adjacent Barrett's esophagus samples, which is a precursor to EAC.

The researchers validated their findings in an external EAC dataset and in other solid tumor types exposed to microbiomes, including uterine endometrioid carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. TLR4 was the most frequently mutated gene, with 11 mutations identified in 5.8% of EAC tumors. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that certain TLR4 mutants had impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, leading to reduced signaling.

The study suggests that TLR pathway genes are recurrently mutated in EAC and that TLR4 mutations may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients. The findings also indicate that TLR pathway mutations are more common in solid tumors arising in body sites exposed to microbiota, such as the oral and gastrointestinal tract, skin, urogenital tract, and respiratory tract.
Researchers investigated the development of taste cells in mice using a combination of in silico and in vivo analyses. They focused on the transcriptional regulatory network of taste receptor calcium signaling molecules (TRCSMs), which are essential for sweet, bitter, and umami taste signal transduction. By analyzing the upstream regulatory regions of TRCSMs, the researchers identified Hes1 as a potential common regulatory factor. Hes1 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the development and differentiation of various cell types.

The researchers found that Hes1 expression was correlated with the expression of type II taste cell markers in developing taste buds. In mice lacking Hes1 (Hes1−/− mutants), the number of TRCSM-immunoreactive cells in the circumvallate papillae (CVP) was significantly higher than in wild-type littermates. This suggests that Hes1 may play a role in regulating the differentiation of taste cells in developing taste buds. The researchers also observed a reduction in nuclear HES1 expression in type I and type III taste bud cells in older animals, further supporting the idea that Hes1 is involved in taste bud cell differentiation.

The study's findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of taste cell development and suggest that Hes1 is a key regulator of this process. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Hes1 in the development and function of the taste system.
Researchers investigated the relationship between ethylene and auxin in regulating root elongation in rice seedlings. They found that the transcriptional activation of OsEIL1 on the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using a YUC activity inhibitor, they showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation is dependent on YUC-based auxin biosynthesis. The researchers identified a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, in which YUC8/REIN7 is truncated at its C-terminus, resulting in reduced auxin biosynthesis and enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots. Overexpression of YUC8/REIN7 enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots, indicating that YUC8/REIN7 is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings. Ethylene induced YUC8/REIN7 expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots, and the addition of low concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) rescued the ethylene response in the rein7-1 mutant, demonstrating that ethylene-inhibited root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed that YUC8/REIN7-mediated auxin biosynthesis functions downstream of OsEIL1, which directly activates the expression of YUC8/REIN7. These findings provide a model of interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling primary root elongation, enhancing our understanding of ethylene signaling in rice.
A nationwide epidemiological study was conducted in Saudi Arabia to investigate the trend of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases. The study collected 527 NTM isolates with clinical and demographic data over a 24-month period. Primary species identification was performed using line probe assays, followed by sequencing of four genes. The results showed that 75.1% of isolates were pulmonary in origin, with 44.7% having proven clinical significance. A total of 34 NTM species, including 17 rare species, were identified, with M. simiae (22.6%), M. fortuitum (18.1%), and M. abscessus (17.8%) being the most prevalent. Notably, 27 new cases of clinically relevant M. riyadhense were reported. Rare clinical events, such as mycobacteremia, cecum abscess, peritonitis, and ascites, were caused by M. wolinskyi, M. holsaticum, M. duvalii, and M. monacence, respectively. Diabetes mellitus and previous history of tuberculosis were identified as independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases. The study highlights the emerging challenge of NTM disease spectrum and pathogen diversity in Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the need for immediate development of diagnostic infrastructures and disease management plans.
Yeast cells have a unique ability to enter a state of quiescence when starved of glucose or other essential nutrients, allowing them to survive for extended periods. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. Researchers have identified three kinases, Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15, as key regulators of quiescence entry and lifespan extension in yeast. These kinases work together to integrate starvation signals from multiple pathways, including the SNF1/AMPK complex, cell wall integrity pathway, and cell cycle regulators. The accumulation of storage carbohydrates, such as trehalose and glycogen, is essential for quiescence entry and lifespan extension, and is mediated by the Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15 kinases. The levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species are also cooperatively controlled by these kinases, and the activation of anti-oxidant defense systems is crucial for quiescence entry and lifespan extension. The data suggest that the primary objective of the signaling pathways activated by glucose starvation is to reprogram carbon metabolism to accumulate sufficient energy stores to power quiescence exit. The accumulation of trehalose appears to be a better predictor of lifespan extension than glycogen in most cases. Overexpression of glycogen and trehalose biosynthetic genes or supplementation with trehalose can rescue the defects in quiescence exit exhibited by mutants lacking the Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15 kinases.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the influenza A virus (IAV) adapts to evade the human immune system. Through the use of high-definition virus population sequencing, they found that the addition of sugar molecules (glycosylation) to the hemagglutinin (HA) protein on the surface of the virus can compensate for the loss of fitness that occurs when the virus mutates to evade antibodies produced by the immune system. This process, known as antigenic drift, is a key factor in the persistence of seasonal influenza viruses in human populations.

The study used a technique called primerID to sequence the genetic material of IAV populations and identify the mutations that occur during antigenic drift. They found that the addition of glycosylation to the HA protein can increase the virus's ability to bind to host cells, even in the absence of antibodies. This suggests that glycosylation can play a dual role in the evolution of IAV: not only can it block antibody binding, but it can also compensate for the loss of fitness that occurs when the virus mutates to evade antibodies.

The findings of this study expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which IAV adapts to the human immune system and highlight the importance of glycosylation in this process. They also demonstrate the power of high-definition virus population sequencing in revealing novel mechanisms of viral adaptation. The study's results have implications for the development of more effective vaccines and therapeutics against IAV.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of 13 ventricular myocyte models to identify potential targets for antiarrhythmic drugs that exhibit favorable rate dependence. The study aimed to overcome the problem of reverse rate dependence, a property of antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the cardiac action potential (AP) more at slow heart rates, leading to reduced arrhythmia suppression at fast rates and increased arrhythmia risk at slow rates. By simulating populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzing population results statistically, the researchers predicted the rate-dependent effects of changes in multiple model parameters. An average of 40 parameters were tested in each model, and effects on AP duration were assessed at slow (0.2 Hz) and fast (2 Hz) rates.

The analysis identified various forward rate-dependent (FRD) ionic current perturbations and generated specific predictions regarding their mechanisms. For instance, an increase in L-type calcium current is FRD when accompanied by indirect, rate-dependent changes in slow delayed rectifier potassium current. The study also found that inward rectifier potassium current and the sodium-potassium pump are the two targets most likely to produce FRD AP prolongation. A statistical analysis of results from the 13 models demonstrated that models displaying minimal rate-dependent changes in AP shape have little capacity for FRD perturbations, whereas models with large shape changes have considerable FRD potential. This can explain differences between species and between ventricular cell types. The study provides new insights into the determinants of AP duration rate dependence and illustrates a strategy for designing potentially beneficial antiarrhythmic drugs.
Researchers conducted a Phenome-Wide Association Study (PheWAS) to investigate the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and a quantitative trait, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity, in patients treated with thiopurine drugs. A new method was developed to perform PheWAS using International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) codes and biological test results. The study analyzed 442 patient records from a French academic hospital, representing 10,252 ICD-10 codes and 72,711 biological test results. Two aggregation methods for ICD-10 codes were used: an ICD-10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes. Biological test results were also analyzed using discretization algorithms. The results showed that iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with high TPMT activity. The study validated the ICD phenotypes using cross-validation with biological test results. This is the first PheWAS performed using ICD-10 classification, as previous studies were based on ICD-9-CM. The study highlights the potential of PheWAS in identifying new subgroups of patients who require personalized clinical and therapeutic management in the field of pharmacogenomics. The findings suggest that high TPMT activity may be associated with signs of failure of thiopurine therapy and sustained steroid requirements in inflammatory bowel disease patients.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies on stem cell transplantation in traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) suggests that allogeneic stem cell treatment may improve both motor and sensory outcomes in animal models of SCI. The analysis, which included 156 publications using 45 different stem cell preparations, found that allogeneic stem cell treatment resulted in a significant improvement in motor function, with an effect size of 27.2% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 25.0-29.4%), and sensory function, with an effect size of 26.3% (95% CI, 7.9-44.7%). The study also identified several factors that influenced the efficacy of stem cell treatment, including the type of stem cell used, the route of delivery, and the presence of immunosuppression. Differentiation before implantation and intravenous route of delivery were found to favor better outcomes, while stem cell implantation did not appear to improve sensory outcome in female animals and was enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. The study also found that the location of injury, method of injury induction, and presence of immunosuppression had an impact on motor outcomes. However, the study noted that the reporting of measures to reduce bias was suboptimal and that motor outcomes studies that did not report blinded assessment of outcome gave inflated estimates of efficacy. The results suggest that stem-cell-based therapies may offer promise for the treatment of SCI, but the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias may mean that efficacy is likely to be lower than reported.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) reinfection after drug treatment was conducted to assess patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection. The study included 51 studies and found that reinfection rates for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm were 26%, 36%, and 30% respectively at 3 months post-treatment, increasing to 68%, 67%, and 55% at 6 months, and 94%, 82%, and 57% at 12 months. The prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. The study suggests that STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, indicating a need for frequent anthelmintic drug administrations to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Integrated control approaches emphasizing health education and environmental sanitation are necessary to interrupt transmission of STH. The study also highlights the importance of considering seasonality of transmission in planning and timing of preventive chemotherapy to enhance its effectiveness.
Researchers have developed a new method called Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) to investigate the deregulation of metabolic processes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a spectrum of diseases characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the liver, ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Traditional pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) methods rely on predefined pathway maps, which can be biased due to differences in pathway annotations and cannot capture the complex interactions within genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMs).

MiNEA generates all possible alternative minimal networks (MiNs) that can synthesize a target metabolite, allowing for the identification of deregulated MiNs and key regulators in different NAFLD phenotypes. The method was applied to human and mouse liver samples with condition-specific transcriptomics data, revealing key deregulations in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and hexadecanoate in both species. The study also found that key regulators of the hydrogen peroxide synthesis network were regulated differently in humans and mice.

MiNEA is a flexible method that can be applied to any GEM and target metabolite, making it suitable for studying condition-specific metabolism in various diseases or organisms. The method can identify deregulated metabolic processes and key regulators, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD phenotypes.
Researchers investigated the efficiency of primacy coding, a method where the identity of an odor is encoded by the types of olfactory receptors that respond earliest. They analyzed a simple model of neural representations of olfactory stimuli and found that primacy coding provides a compact and informative representation that can be interpreted efficiently by the brain. The encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included in the primacy representation, but only weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. This representation is independent of the odor intensity and the transmitted information is useful for performing typical olfactory tasks with performance close to experimentally measured values. The model suggests that a smaller receptor repertoire can be advantageous for discriminating odors in certain situations, and that overly sensitive receptor types can dominate the entire response, making the array useless. The results show that primacy coding is more useful than simple binary and normalized coding, as the sparsity of the odor representations is independent of the odor statistics. The model predicts that receptors are only useful if their likelihood to respond to incoming odors is similar, and that the primacy code formed in the olfactory bulb is more useful to identify odors in the subsequent olfactory cortex than simple alternatives. Overall, primacy coding provides an efficient odor representation that is independent of the odor intensity and might help to identify odors in the olfactory cortex.
A recent study investigated the neutralization profiles of broadly neutralizing HIV monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) targeting various regions of the HIV envelope (Env) spike. The researchers found that all bnMAbs tested exhibited incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves, where the neutralization effect did not reach 100% and the curves did not follow a typical sigmoidal shape. This phenomenon was observed across a wide range of viruses produced in both cell lines and primary cells.

The study found that bnMAbs targeting the V2 apex of Env and gp41 were more likely to show non-sigmoidal neutralization curves, while those targeting the high-mannose patch epitopes were less likely to exhibit this behavior. Two CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibodies showed this behavior relatively infrequently. The researchers also observed incomplete neutralization in a large panel of molecular virus clones derived from patient viral swarms.

The study's findings suggest that incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves are possible for all HIV bnMAbs against a wide range of viruses. This has implications for the use of antibodies in therapy and as tools for vaccine design. The researchers note that there may be mechanisms other than glycan heterogeneity contributing to incomplete neutralization, such as conformational heterogeneity of the Env trimer. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between incomplete neutralization in pseudovirus assays and anti-viral activity of bnMAbs in vivo.
Researchers developed a computational model of human central metabolism to investigate how cancer cells utilize glucose and glutamine for energy and biomass production. The study aimed to understand how these metabolic rearrangements contribute to cancer cell growth and proliferation. The model simulated various scenarios of glucose and glutamine uptake rates, and the results showed that at high glutamine utilization rates, oxidative glucose utilization decreased, while lactate production from glutamine increased. This metabolic pattern was observed only when the available carbon exceeded the amount that could be fully oxidized by oxygen. The study found that this pattern is optimal for maximizing biomass and ATP production, requiring a branched tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and redox-controlled metabolic reactions. The researchers experimentally validated these findings in a K-ras transformed cell line, using an extension of Flux Balance Analysis to predict metabolite variations. The study suggests that this metabolic rewiring may occur in various tumor cell lines, and that the competition between glucose and glutamine plays a crucial role in cancer cell growth. The findings provide new insights into the logic of metabolic reprogramming underlying cancer cell growth and proliferation.
Researchers have investigated the interactions of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) and its mammalian paralogs, Doppel (Prnd) and Shadoo (Sprn), in a cell culture model that allows for prion replication. The study aimed to identify the molecular environment that facilitates the conformational conversion of PrPC to disease-associated isoforms. Using a quantitative interactome analysis, the researchers found that PrPC, Prnd, and Sprn share a similar physiological environment in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting direct interactions among them. The study also confirmed interactions between PrPC and several other proteins, including the neural cell adhesion molecule, laminin receptor precursor, Na/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI). These findings reconcile previously separate observations and suggest that PrPC interacts with PDI beyond the endoplasmic reticulum, potentially playing a previously unrecognized role in the accumulation of PrPSc. The researchers propose a hypothesis that PrPC organizes its molecular environment by binding to adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin-like domains, which in turn recognize oligomannose-bearing membrane proteins. The study provides new insights into the molecular environment that hosts the earliest steps in prion disease manifestation in neuronal cells and suggests that members of the prion protein family may be embedded in specialized membrane domains that support functions in adhesion control, lactate metabolism, and cell fusion events.
Researchers investigated the production of IL-5, a type 2 cytokine, during influenza virus infection in mice. They found that IL-5 was released into the airways and accumulated in the lungs, particularly during the recovery phase after virus clearance. The source of IL-5 was identified as group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) that infiltrated the infected lungs. These ILC2 cells produced IL-5 in response to IL-33, a cytokine produced by NKT cells and alveolar macrophages. The production of IL-5 by ILC2 led to the recruitment and accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs. Eosinophils are white blood cells that play a crucial role in fighting infections, but their accumulation in the lungs can also contribute to asthma exacerbation. The study suggests that the interaction between ILC2, NKT cells, and alveolar macrophages is essential for the production of IL-5 and the subsequent accumulation of eosinophils during the recovery phase of influenza infection. The findings provide new insights into the complex immune response to respiratory virus infections and highlight the potential role of ILC2 and IL-33 in regulating the production of IL-5 and eosinophil accumulation in the lungs.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of iNTS disease in Asia are not well-documented. This study retrospectively analyzed 102 cases of iNTS infections in an infectious disease hospital in southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. The majority of patients (71%) were HIV-infected adults, with 71% being male and 33% reporting intravenous drug use. The most commonly identified serovars were Salmonella Enteritidis (ST11) and Salmonella Typhimurium (ST19, 34, and 1544), which accounted for 43% and 30% of all cases, respectively. Salmonella Typhimurium was significantly more common in HIV-infected individuals. The mortality rate was 26%, with HIV infection being a significant risk factor for death. Isolates from HIV-infected patients were more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than HIV-negative patients. The study highlights that iNTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam, with a high mortality rate, and that HIV infection is a major risk factor for both infection and death. The findings suggest that continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for the emergence or introduction of multi-drug resistant strains or strains with enhanced virulence.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify viral and phage structural proteins using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These proteins are crucial for the survival and pathogenicity of their hosts, and their identification can aid in disease diagnosis, vaccine development, and understanding environmental physiology. However, detecting these proteins from sequence data can be challenging due to low sequence conservation and limited experimental data.

The researchers trained ANNs to classify viral structural proteins using amino acid frequency and protein isoelectric points. The ANNs were able to correctly classify a large fraction of test cases with high specificity and sensitivity. The addition of protein isoelectric points as a feature improved the accuracy of the ANNs in classifying specialized families of proteins, such as major capsid and tail proteins.

To validate the ANN predictions, the researchers experimentally examined several ORFs with no significant similarities to known sequences that were predicted to be structural proteins. The results showed that some of these ORFs self-assembled into structures resembling virion structures, confirming the accuracy of the ANN predictions.

The developed ANNs are valuable tools for identifying phage and potential prophage structural proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect by other bioinformatic analysis. They can be used when sequence data is available but in vitro propagation of the phage may not be practical or possible. The ANNs have the potential to aid in disease diagnosis, vaccine development, and understanding environmental physiology.
Researchers have identified a protein called oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL) as an interacting partner of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) protein ORF20. ORF20 is a member of the herpesviral core UL24 family, but its function and role in the viral life cycle were not well understood. The study used a quantitative affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (q-AP-MS) approach to identify OASL as an interaction partner of ORF20. This interaction was found to be conserved among all ORF20 isoforms and multiple ORF20 homologs of the UL24 family in other herpesviruses.

The researchers also found that OASL and ORF20 share numerous ribosomal interaction partners and copurify with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. When expressed together, they associate with polysomes, but do not have a global effect on translation. Furthermore, the study found that OASL expression is induced early after reactivation of latently infected HuARLT-rKSHV cells, and that OASL enhances KSHV infection. However, when a KSHV ORF20stop mutant was used, OASL-dependent enhancement of infectivity was lost. These findings suggest that ORF20 usurps the function of OASL to benefit KSHV infection. The study provides new insights into the interaction between OASL and ORF20 and their roles in KSHV infection.
A prospective study was conducted to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. The study included 913 consecutive febrile children aged 1 month to 15 years admitted to the Children's Emergency Room of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital over a 1-year period. The overall prevalence of LVD was 3.5% (13/373) in febrile admissions, with 2.8% (3/108) in children with convulsions and 3.8% (10/265) in those without convulsions. The odds ratio of LVD in children with convulsions versus those without was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.2, 2.7), indicating no significant association between LVD and convulsions. However, vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of LVD. The study highlights the importance of LVD as a cause of fever, including undifferentiated fever, in children in endemic areas. The lack of clinical differentiation on presentation underscores the need for a high index of suspicion in diagnosis. The study suggests that screening febrile children with undifferentiated fever in endemic areas for LVD could be an important medical and public health control measure.
Researchers investigated the role of the karrikin receptor KAI2 in regulating drought resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that mutations in the KAI2 gene result in increased sensitivity to water deprivation, leading to higher rates of water loss, cell membrane damage, and reduced drought-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis. Transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses revealed that kai2 mutants have enlarged stomatal apertures and higher cuticular permeability. The study also found that kai2 plants are hyposensitive to abscisic acid (ABA) in stomatal closure and cotyledon opening assays. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified genes associated with the observed physiological and biochemical changes. The data suggest crosstalk between ABA- and KAI2-dependent signaling pathways in regulating plant responses to drought. A comparison with the strigolactone receptor mutant d14 indicated that strigolactones also contribute to plant drought adaptation, but through a different mechanism. The findings suggest that chemical or genetic manipulation of KAI2 and D14 signaling may provide novel ways to improve drought resistance. Overall, the study demonstrates that KAI2-mediated signaling positively regulates drought resistance in Arabidopsis by controlling cell membrane stability, stomatal movement, cuticle development, and anthocyanin production.
Researchers investigated the role of insulin receptors in the growth, development, and reproduction of adult Schistosoma japonicum, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans. They focused on the insulin receptors (SjIRs) of S. japonicum, which they had previously cloned and partially characterized. The study found that human insulin binds to the L1 subdomain of the SjIRs, suggesting that the parasite uses host insulin for growth and development. The researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the expression of the SjIRs in adult S. japonicum in vitro and observed a significant decrease in glucose uptake and reduced transcription of downstream genes involved in glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity. In vaccine/challenge experiments, recombinant SjLD1 and SjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and fecal egg production in S. japonicum-infected mice. These findings suggest that the SjIRs are potential targets for a veterinary transmission-blocking vaccine against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines. The study provides further evidence that schistosomes exploit host insulin for growth and development, and that targeting the insulin pathway may be an effective strategy for controlling the parasite.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a significant cause of disability in the South Pacific, affecting over 1.7 million people, with 96% of the population at risk of infection. Current mass drug administration (MDA) efforts have reduced LF prevalence, but the mosquito vector biology complicates the MDA strategy. In some regions, MDA alone may not be sufficient to achieve LF elimination. The primary vector, Aedes polynesiensis, is difficult to control using existing methods. Researchers have developed a new strategy by creating an A. polynesiensis strain (CP strain) that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. This strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays show that CP males are equally competitive, leading to population elimination when introduced into wild-type A. polynesiensis populations. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of a vector elimination strategy as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts. The strategy involves inundative releases of bi-directionally incompatible males to induce sterility in A. polynesiensis females, resulting in vector population elimination. This approach has the potential to break the LF transmission cycle and is recommended for integration with MDA in areas where A. polynesiensis is the primary vector. The successful demonstration of this strategy encourages its extension to a broader geographic range and to additional vector species.
A study conducted in Urambo District, Tanzania, estimated the public health burden of rhodesiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and financial costs. The study analyzed data from 143 patients admitted to Kaliua Health Centre in 2004 for HAT treatment. The results showed that the disease imposes a significant burden on affected communities, with estimated DALYs of 215.7 (95% CI: 155.3-287.5) and 281.6 (95% CI: 209.1-362.6) without and with age-weighting, respectively. Accounting for 45% under-reporting, the estimated DALYs increased to 622.5 (95% CI: 155.3-1098.9) and 978.9 (95% CI: 201.1-1870.8). The study also estimated the costs of treating 143 patients at $15,514, with patients paying $3,673 and the health services $11,841. Indirect non-medical costs for the patients were estimated at $9,781. The study highlights the urgent need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates tailored to rural settings in countries like Tanzania, where infectious diseases are prevalent and concentrated in certain areas. The findings emphasize the significant burden of HAT on healthcare systems and affected communities, underscoring the importance of addressing this neglected disease.
Researchers investigated the role of the Ngly1 gene in mice, which encodes a de-N-glycosylating enzyme. Mice lacking the Ngly1 gene (Ngly1-deficient mice) were found to be embryonic lethal in a C57BL/6 background. However, when the Engase gene, another de-N-glycosylating enzyme, was also deleted, the lethality of the Ngly1-deficient mice was partially rescued. Additionally, changing the genetic background of the Ngly1-deficient mice by crossing them with an outbred mouse strain (ICR) also partially rescued the embryonic lethality. Viable Ngly1-deficient mice in a C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background showed severe phenotypes similar to those observed in human subjects with NGLY1-deficiency. The deletion of Engase in these mice suppressed many of the observed defects. The study suggests that the Ngly1 or Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice could serve as a valuable animal model for studying the pathogenesis of NGLY1-deficiency, and that cytoplasmic ENGase may be a potential therapeutic target for this genetic disorder. The results indicate that the embryonic lethal phenotype of Ngly1-deficient mice is mainly related to its deglycosylation-dependent function, as the lethality was partially suppressed by the additional deletion of Engase.
Researchers studied how gene expression noise affects spatial patterning in fruit fly (Drosophila) segmentation. They focused on the hunchback (hb) gene, which is activated by the Bicoid (Bcd) protein gradient. Gene regulation is subject to intrinsic noise, which can produce variable expression. The study aimed to identify how noise is controlled during gene expression by characterizing the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output noise on hb promoter structure and transcriptional dynamics.

The researchers used a stochastic model of the hb promoter, varying the number and strength of Bcd and Hb binding sites. They fit the model to data from wild-type embryos, a self-regulation mutant, and lacZ reporter constructs with different portions of the hb promoter. The results showed that wild-type Hb output noise is primarily dependent on transcription and translation dynamics, rather than Bcd fluctuations. The study also found that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter play a role in buffering noise.

The model was robust to variations in Bcd binding site number across different fly species. The study identified specific ways in which promoter structure and regulatory dynamics reduce hb output noise, including the importance of multiple regulatory sites, cooperativity, and self-feedback. These findings contribute to the general understanding of the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development. The study's results have implications for understanding how noise is controlled in spatial gene expression patterns, which is a fundamental problem in developmental biology.
Researchers have studied the genetic legacy of Neanderthals in modern humans, finding that selection has acted against Neanderthal alleles in the human population. A new method was developed to estimate the strength of selection against Neanderthal ancestry, using data on Neanderthal allele frequencies in modern humans. The study found that East Asians had higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. The majority of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is attributed to many weakly deleterious alleles that were effectively neutral in Neanderthals but became selected against after entering human populations of larger effective size. These alleles, individually of small effect, imposed a significant genetic load on early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids. The study suggests that differences in effective population size may play a more significant role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought. The results provide new insights into how selection shaped the genomic contribution of Neanderthals to the human genome and shed light on the nature of human-Neanderthal hybridization. The study's findings have implications for understanding how populations remain distinct after secondary contact and the role of nearly neutral dynamics in shaping levels of introgression across species and along the genome.
Researchers have investigated the control of stochastic gene expression by host factors at the HIV promoter within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). They found that stochastic fluctuations in viral gene expression, amplified by the Tat positive feedback loop, can contribute to the formation of either a productive, transactivated state or an inactive state. In a significant fraction of cells harboring an integrated copy of the HIV-1 model provirus, this bimodal gene expression profile is dynamic, with cells spontaneously switching between active (Bright) and inactive (Off) expression modes. The HIV-1 promoter contains cis-acting Sp1 and NF-κB elements that regulate gene expression via the recruitment of both activating and repressing complexes. The researchers hypothesized that the interplay between these positive and negative factors could modulate the stability of the Bright and Off modes and alter the sensitivity of viral gene expression to stochastic fluctuations in the Tat feedback loop. Using model lentivirus variants with mutations introduced in the Sp1 and NF-κB elements, they found that each Sp1 site influences the control of stochastic gene expression by stabilizing both the active and inactive states. The Sp1 sites functionally "dampen" transcriptional noise and modulate the frequency and maintenance of this model of viral latency. The NF-κB sites exhibit distinct properties, with κB site I serving a stronger activating role than κB site II. The results suggest that each Sp1 and NF-κB site differentially contributes to the regulation of viral gene expression and may have implications for the treatment of HIV latency.
Researchers compared the accuracy of nine leading orthology projects and methods, including COG, KOG, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene, RoundUp, EggNOG, and OMA, as well as two standard methods, bidirectional best-hit and reciprocal smallest distance. The study aimed to evaluate the performance of these methods in identifying orthologs, which are genes in different species that have evolved from a common ancestral gene. The researchers used six different tests to compare the predictions of these methods with respect to both phylogeny and function. The results showed that OMA and Homologene performed best in phylogenetic analysis and functional analysis with high specificity. At lower functional specificity but higher coverage, OrthoMCL outperformed Ensembl Compara, and to a lesser extent, Inparanoid. EggNOG provided the largest coverage for coarse-grained functional categories but was not specific enough for phylogenetic or detailed function analyses. The study also found that standard bidirectional best-hit often outperformed projects with more complex algorithms. The findings provide guidance for users of orthology data and introduce new methodology for verifying orthology. The study sets performance standards for current and future approaches, highlighting the importance of accurate ortholog prediction for applications such as protein annotation and phylogenetic analysis.
Researchers have developed a new approach to combat schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, by repurposing existing drugs. The current treatment, praziquantel, has been in use for 40 years and is showing signs of resistance. A computational pipeline was created to identify new targets for the disease, focusing on protein kinases, which play a crucial role in parasite biology. The study elucidated the kinome of Schistosoma japonicum and updated the kinomes of S. mansoni and S. haematobium. By comparing these kinomes to the human kinome, researchers identified potential targets of existing inhibitors that are unique to Schistosoma species. This led to the discovery of novel targets and suggested approved drugs that could inhibit them, including bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib, as well as new inhibitors such as vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, and dinaciclib. Additionally, 22 new targets were identified, including CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, and MEK1. The study also suggested primary and secondary targets in Schistosoma for these approved drugs, paving the way for the development of new therapeutics against schistosomiasis.
Researchers studied the binding and folding mechanism of the pKID domain of the transcription factor CREB to the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP. The pKID domain is known to be unstructured when not bound to a target, suggesting that folding and binding occur simultaneously. Simulations of a topology-based Gō-type model predicted a coupled folding and binding mechanism, with the existence of partially bound intermediates. Analysis of transition-path and Φ-value data revealed that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, indicating that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. This is consistent with an induced-fit mechanism, where the ligand (pKID) changes conformation upon binding. Increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduced the rate of binding, suggesting a "fly-casting"-like process. The inclusion of attractive non-native interactions resulted in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhanced the on-rate of binding but did not significantly change the binding mechanism. The study's findings are in agreement with a recent nuclear magnetic resonance study and provide insight into how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition.
A systematic review was conducted to analyze the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries and territories. The review included 132 articles published between 1942 and 2014, providing 1,242 prevalence and 199 intensity of infection data points. Most of the data came from Brazil, which showed several "hot spots" with high prevalence. The review found that Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia need to update their national programs to target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. In contrast, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but follow-up surveys are needed to verify this status. The review also highlighted the need for improved reporting and standardization of monitoring and evaluation methodologies used in schistosomiasis programs. Meeting a regional elimination goal will require additional and improved epidemiological data by age group and sex. Schistosomiasis is a significant public health problem, with over 200 million people infected and 700 million at risk globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) has established guidelines for verification of elimination, which include reaching a prevalence of severe intensity of infection of less than 5% and 1%, respectively.
Researchers investigated the characteristics of HIV-1 subtype C viruses that facilitate heterosexual transmission. They analyzed 167 near full-length viral genomes and generated 40 infectious molecular clones, including transmitted/founder (TF) variants and non-transmitted (NT) variants from six linked heterosexual transmission pairs. The study found that consensus-like genomes sensitive to donor antibodies were selected for during transmission in these pairs. However, TF variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness in terms of particle infectivity or viral replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Additionally, resistance of the TF variant to the antiviral effects of interferon-α (IFN-α) was not significantly different from that of non-transmitted variants from the same transmission pair. These findings suggest that neither in vitro viral replicative capacity nor IFN-α resistance discriminated the transmission potential of viruses in the quasispecies of these chronically infected individuals. The study supports the hypothesis that within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to adaptive immune responses reduces viral transmission potential. The results indicate that factors other than IFN-α resistance are the dominant determinants of transmission fitness in these pairs, and that heterosexual HIV-1 transmission is permissive to viruses with a range of in vitro interferon resistance profiles.
Filarial parasites, which cause diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and elephantiasis, have been found to directly influence the lymphatic system by inducing lymphangiogenesis, a process in which new lymphatic vessels form. In a study, human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or serum from infected patients. The results showed that live parasites or filarial antigens stimulated LEC to proliferate and differentiate into tube-like structures in vitro. Additionally, serum from patients with lymphatic filariasis promoted LEC proliferation and differentiation compared to serum from uninfected individuals. The study also found that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development, as well as those associated with junction adherence pathways, leading to decreased trans-endothelial transport. The data suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathology seen in lymphatic filariasis. The study's findings indicate that filarial proteins stimulate LEC to undergo proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures, involving matrix metalloproteases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases. This research provides new understanding of how filarial parasites affect the lymphatic system and may lead to the development of new treatments for lymphatic filariasis.
Researchers have developed a new method for amplifying DNA from single bacterial cells using a technique called Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) in extremely small reaction volumes, known as nanoliters. This approach eliminates the need to culture the bacteria in a laboratory setting, allowing for the study of microorganisms that are difficult or impossible to grow in a lab. The researchers used a microfluidic device to isolate individual Escherichia coli cells and amplify their genomic DNA in 60-nanoliter reactions. The results showed that reducing the reaction volume from microliters to nanoliters significantly reduced nonspecific DNA synthesis and improved the quality of the genome amplification. The amplified DNA was then sequenced using high-throughput pyrosequencing, producing high-quality sequence data.

The study compared the performance of MDA in nanoliter and microliter volumes and found that the smaller reaction volume resulted in reduced amplification bias, providing a more even representation of all sequences. The quality of the genome amplification was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and was found to be comparable to standard 50-microliter volumes. The researchers also demonstrated that single-cell amplicons from both nanoliter and microliter volumes provided high-quality sequence data, making it a straightforward route to sequencing genomes from single cells. This method has significant implications for the study of microbial ecology and evolution, as it allows for the recovery of whole genome sequences from single cells that cannot be obtained in pure culture.
Researchers studied the relationship between hantavirus host populations and human disease in the Atlantic Forest, a tropical region in South America. They analyzed data from 283 rodent capture records and used geographically weighted models to identify factors influencing hantavirus transmission dynamics. The study found that landscape diversity, particularly the presence of agricultural areas and native habitats, positively influenced the proportion of hantavirus hosts in rodent communities. Local small mammal diversity also had a positive effect on the proportion of known pathogenic hantavirus hosts. In contrast, defaunation intensity, which refers to the loss of native species, did not significantly impact the proportion of hantavirus hosts in rodent communities. The study also found that sugarcane and tree plantations increased the proportion of rodent hosts, while defaunated areas could still be hotspots for hantavirus disease outbreaks. The researchers discovered a spatial match between hantavirus host hotspots and human disease vulnerability, particularly in the southern and southeastern regions of the Atlantic Forest. This suggests that disease surveillance should be reinforced in these areas. The study's findings indicate that rodent community dynamics and interactions with human disease are more complex than previously thought, and that landscape structure and biodiversity patterns play a crucial role in shaping hantavirus transmission dynamics.
Researchers investigated the role of BCL2 family proteins in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus. They found that BCLXL, a pro-survival BCL2 protein, plays a crucial role in the survival of infected cells by suppressing the expression of another pro-survival protein, MCL1. Inhibition of BCLXL or deficiency of the BCLXL gene led to BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis in infected cells, indicating that BCLXL is essential for cell survival during flavivirus infection.

The study showed that flavivirus infection reduces the expression of MCL1, a short-half-life protein, leading to a decrease in cell survival. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors or BH3 mimetic compounds increased phagocytosis of infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. In vivo, haploinsufficiency of the BCLXL gene or administration of BH3 mimetic compounds increased survival rates after Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection and suppressed inflammation.

The researchers propose a model explaining the regulation of BCL2 family proteins upon flavivirus infection, where BCLXL delays apoptosis in infected cells by suppressing MCL1 expression, allowing viral dissemination to neighboring cells. Inhibition of BCLXL, on the other hand, accelerates apoptosis in infected cells, reducing viral dissemination and pathogenicity. The study suggests that BCLXL is a critical cell survival factor during flavivirus infection and may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress the propagation of flaviviruses.
A study estimated the economic impact of canine rabies in Viet Nam from 2005 to 2014. The analysis included direct and indirect costs of rabies in dogs, livestock, and humans, as well as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and dog vaccination efforts. The study found that the total economic impact of canine rabies in Viet Nam over the 10-year period was over $719 million USD, with 92% of the costs attributed to PEP-related expenses. Canine rabies resulted in between 36,560 and 45,700 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), measured in years of life lost (YLL), and 914 human deaths were reported during the study period. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75 USD.

The study's findings indicate that canine rabies impacts in Viet Nam are consistent with those reported in other Asian countries, with large expenditures on PEP and minimal investments in dog vaccination. The results suggest that the most cost-effective control of canine rabies in humans is through coordinated veterinary public health campaigns that prevent human rabies, rather than suppressing the disease through PEP administration. The study highlights the need for increased investment in dog vaccination efforts to reduce the economic burden of canine rabies in Viet Nam.
The Type II Secretion System (T2SS) is a molecular machine responsible for secreting fully-folded protein substrates across the bacterial outer membrane. A key component of the T2SS is the secretin, a multimeric outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore. Researchers have identified three distinct forms of T2SSs based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores. Two of these forms, the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, are distinguished by the pilotin that mediates their transport and assembly into the outer membrane.

A novel pilotin, AspS, has been identified in Vibrio cholerae, which is structurally unrelated to the pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria. However, AspS is functionally equivalent to these pilotins, binding to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins and enhancing the kinetics of secretin assembly. Homologs of AspS are found in all species of Vibrio, as well as in some strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS.

The presence of AspS is correlated with the presence of Vibrio-type secretins and AcfD/SslE substrates in diverse bacteria. This suggests that some bacteria have acquired a complete functional unit of secretin-pilotin-substrate incorporated with the rest of the T2SS operon. The crystal structure of AspS shows no structural similarity to the PulS-OutS family of proteins, indicating convergent evolution to a common function. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that AspS binds to an S-domain sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, distinguishing it from the Klebsiella-type secretins.
Researchers investigated the role of three surface-exposed proteins, OmpL36, OmpL37, and OmpL47, in the pathogenic bacterium Leptospira, which causes leptospirosis. They found that OmpL37 specifically binds to human skin and vascular elastin, a key component of connective tissue, with high affinity. This binding is dose-dependent and saturating, indicating a strong interaction between OmpL37 and elastin. OmpL37 also binds to other host tissue components, including fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin. The binding of OmpL37 to human skin elastin is enhanced by antibodies against OmpL37, suggesting that host-generated antibodies may promote rather than inhibit the adherence of Leptospira to elastin-rich tissues. The researchers detected OmpL37 in pathogenic Leptospira serovars but not in saprophytic Leptospira, indicating that OmpL37 is a novel elastin-binding protein specific to pathogenic Leptospira. The study suggests that OmpL37 may play a role in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis by facilitating the attachment of Leptospira to host tissues. The researchers propose that OmpL37 may be involved in the initial stage of infection, allowing Leptospira to attach to the inner elastin-rich layer of the skin exposed by abrasion. The study highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between Leptospira and host tissues in the development of diagnostic and protective antigens for leptospirosis.
Researchers have developed a model to estimate the probability of polyreactive antibodies 4E10 and 2F5 disabling a gp41 trimer after T cell-HIV adhesion. These antibodies, isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 that are transiently exposed during viral entry. The model predicts that for these antibodies to be effective at neutralization, the time to disable an epitope must be shorter than the time the antibody remains bound in a stably bound complex, which is about five minutes or less for 4E10 and 2F5. The researchers investigated the role of avidity in neutralization and found that 2F5 IgG, but not 4E10, is more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment, likely due to 2F5 interacting more stably with the viral membrane. The model also predicts that only a small number of gp41 bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion, but the exact number cannot be determined from neutralization experiments alone. The researchers propose an extension of the model to analyze neutralization data and predict the dependencies of neutralization on the rate constants that characterize antibody binding, the rate of fusion of gp41, and the number of gp41 bridges at the start of the pre-hairpin intermediate.
A longitudinal study was conducted in three hyperendemic onchocerciasis foci in Mali and Senegal to assess the effectiveness of 15 to 17 years of annual or six-monthly ivermectin treatment in interrupting transmission and eliminating the parasite. The study aimed to evaluate residual levels of infection and transmission, and determine whether treatment could be safely stopped. Skin snip surveys were conducted in 131 villages, examining 29,753 people and analyzing 492,600 blackflies for the presence of Onchocerca volvulus larvae. The results showed a declining trend in infection and transmission levels after the last treatment. In two sites, the prevalence of microfilaria and vector infectivity rate were zero 3 to 4 years after the last treatment. In the third site, where infection levels were high before stopping treatment, there was a consistent decline in infection and transmission to very low levels 3 to 5 years after stopping treatment. All infection and transmission indicators were below postulated thresholds for elimination. The study established the proof of principle that onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment is feasible in at least some endemic foci in Africa. The study's findings have contributed to the evolution from onchocerciasis control to elimination in Africa, with nearly all endemic areas under annual ivermectin treatment and control of the disease as a public health problem achieved in most areas.
Researchers have investigated the role of the capsid protein VP4 in the entry of human rhinovirus, a common cause of the common cold, into host cells. Human rhinovirus is a non-enveloped virus that must deliver its genetic material across the cell membrane without fusing with it. The study found that the small, myristoylated protein VP4 is released from the virus and interacts with the cell membrane, facilitating the delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm. To understand this process, the researchers produced a recombinant version of VP4 with a histidine tag and tested its ability to induce membrane permeability in model membranes. The results showed that VP4 forms a multimeric, size-selective pore in the membrane, with a channel size consistent with the transfer of single-stranded RNA. The researchers also found that the membrane permeability induced by VP4 was influenced by pH and was comparable to the permeability induced by infectious virions. These findings provide a molecular mechanism for the involvement of VP4 in cell entry and suggest that VP4 could be a novel antiviral target for the picornavirus family, which includes other significant pathogens such as poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus. The study provides a model system for further exploration of VP4 as a potential target for antiviral therapy.
Francisella tularensis (Ft) is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease designated as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers have identified three enzymes required for lipid A carbohydrate modifications in Francisella novicida (Fn), a pathogen of mice. Mutants lacking galactosamine (flmF2) or galactosamine/mannose (flmK) addition to their lipid A were found to be attenuated in mice by both pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. Aerosolization of the mutants (flmF2 and flmK) provided protection against challenge with wild-type (WT) Fn, while subcutaneous administration of only the flmK mutant provided protection from challenge with WT Fn. Infection of an alveolar macrophage cell line by the flmK mutant induced higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 (MIP-2) compared to infection with WT Fn. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and TLR2/4 knockout mice infected with the flmK mutant produced significantly higher amounts of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and MIP-2 than BMMø infected with WT Fn. However, production of IL-6 and MIP-2 was undetectable in BMMø from MyD88−/− mice infected with either strain. The researchers hypothesize that the ability of the flmK mutant to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production and innate immune responses mediated by the MyD88 signaling pathway may be responsible for its attenuation, leading to the induction of protective immunity by this mutant.
Researchers have investigated the role of Era, a ribosome-associated GTPase, in the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Era is a highly conserved protein across the bacterial kingdom, but its function in ribosome assembly was unclear. The study found that Era is not essential for the growth of S. aureus, but is important for the assembly of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Era interacts with the 16S rRNA endonuclease YbeY and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CshA, and both Era and CshA are required for growth at suboptimal temperatures and rRNA processing. The study also found that Era and CshA interact with the (p)ppGpp synthetase RelSau, with RelSau positively affecting the GTPase activity of Era but negatively affecting the helicase activity of CshA. The researchers propose that Era acts as a hub protein on the ribosome, directing enzymes involved in rRNA processing and degradation to their site of action. This activity is impeded by multiple components of the stringent response, contributing to the slowed growth phenotype associated with this stress response pathway. The study provides new insights into the role of Era in ribosome biogenesis and its interaction with other proteins involved in rRNA processing and degradation.
Researchers investigated the effects of anthrax lethal toxin (LT) on mice and found that the heart is an early target of the toxin. Mice lacking the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) were more sensitive to LT and showed increased mortality compared to mice with normal nNOS levels. This increased sensitivity was not due to changes in macrophage sensitivity or cytokine responses. Histopathological analysis revealed that LT caused architectural changes in the hearts of nNOS-deficient mice, including the rapid appearance of novel inter-fiber spaces, but no associated apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Electron microscopic analysis showed pathological changes in the hearts of both nNOS-deficient and wild-type mice, including endothelial/capillary necrosis, inter-myocyte edema, and myofilament and mitochondrial degeneration. Biomarkers of cardiac injury, such as myoglobin, cardiac troponin-I, and heart fatty acid binding protein, were elevated in LT-treated mice as early as 6 hours after toxin injection. Echocardiography showed a reduction in ejection fraction following LT treatment in both nNOS-deficient and wild-type mice, indicating decreased contractile function in the heart. The study suggests that nNOS plays a protective role against LT-mediated cardiac damage and that the heart is an early target of LT in mice.
Researchers have developed a new method for introducing targeted gene disruptions in the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasite that infects over 1 billion people worldwide and causes neglected tropical diseases. The method uses CRISPR-Cas9, a powerful tool for editing genes, to disrupt the twitchin gene unc-22, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects. This is the first time targeted gene disruptions have been achieved in a parasitic nematode, and it paves the way for future studies of gene function in these medically relevant parasites.

The researchers used the complex life cycle of S. stercoralis to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 constructs into free-living adults, and characterized Ss-unc-22 mutations in iL3 progeny. They found that CRISPR-Cas9-induced double-strand breaks at Ss-unc-22 are resolved by homology-directed repair when an appropriate repair template is provided, and that omission of a repair template results in deletions at the target locus. The mutations were heritable, and the researchers were able to pass Ss-unc-22 mutants through a host and successfully recover mutant progeny.

The researchers also demonstrated the applicability of CRISPR-Cas9 to another parasitic nematode, Strongyloides ratti, a parasite of rats. They targeted the unc-22 gene of S. ratti using the same method, resulting in mutant nematodes with similar phenotypes to those observed in S. stercoralis. These results demonstrate the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 for studying gene function in parasitic nematodes, which have been previously genetically intractable.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the effects of ribosome drop-off on protein translation efficiency and ribosome density profiles. Ribosome drop-off is a phenomenon where ribosomes, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, prematurely terminate translation. This can occur under stress conditions, such as amino acid starvation or high-level recombinant protein expression. The model predicts that ribosome drop-off can lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, where the density of ribosomes increases from the 5' to the 3' end of the mRNA. Importantly, the model shows that the effects of ribosome drop-off on translation rate are mRNA-specific, with some mRNAs being more resilient to drop-off than others. Specifically, mRNAs that can sustain a queue of ribosomes are less affected by drop-off, while those that cannot present a queue are more susceptible. The model also predicts that mRNAs with higher translation rates are more resilient to ribosome drop-off. This is consistent with a genome-wide analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which shows that mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off. The model provides a tool to analyze variations in translational efficiency of individual mRNAs and explains mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies.
The World Health Organization's current strategy to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in children involves routine deworming of school and pre-school aged children. However, this approach may not be sufficient to interrupt transmission due to persistent reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and the environment. Researchers are exploring alternative strategies, such as mass drug administration (MDA), to accelerate the interruption of transmission. The DeWorm3 trial aims to test the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission using MDA. The trial involves three years of high treatment coverage followed by two years of surveillance to assess whether transmission has been interrupted. However, determining whether transmission interruption has been achieved can be challenging due to the high reinfection rates of STH. To address this issue, researchers used a stochastic, individual-based simulation model to investigate whether criteria can be defined to determine whether transmission interruption is unlikely at earlier timepoints. The analysis suggests that all clusters should be assessed for transmission interruption after two years of surveillance, unless transmission interruption can be effectively ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage. The study found that a tight range of homogeneous prevalence estimates following high coverage MDA across clusters does not allow for discrimination between bounce-back or transmission interruption within 24 months following cessation of MDA.
Researchers evaluated a conjugate vaccine for cholera made from Vibrio cholerae O1 (Ogawa) O-Specific Polysaccharide (OSP) and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (TThc) in mice. The study aimed to assess the vaccine's ability to induce protective immunity against cholera, which is serogroup specific and determined by the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mice were immunized intramuscularly on days 0, 21, and 42 with OSP:TThc or OSP only, with or without dmLT, a non-toxigenic immunoadjuvant derived from heat labile toxin of Escherichia coli.

The results showed that significant serum IgG antibody responses targeting OSP were detected following a single immunization in mice receiving OSP:TThc with or without adjuvant. Anti-LPS IgG responses were detected following a second immunization in these cohorts. In contrast, no anti-OSP or anti-LPS IgG responses were detected in animals receiving un-conjugated OSP with or without immunoadjuvant, and in animals receiving immunoadjuvant alone. The study also found that administration of OSP:TThc and adjuvant induced memory B cell responses targeting OSP and resulted in 95% protective efficacy in a mouse lethality cholera challenge model. The findings suggest that the cholera conjugate vaccine is protectively immunogenic and could assist in inducing long-term protective immunity, particularly in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens.
Researchers investigated the interaction between the fungus Candida albicans and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the gut. They used a mouse model to study how these two microorganisms interact and affect each other's virulence. The study found that Candida albicans suppresses the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting the production of two key virulence factors: pyochelin and pyoverdine. These factors are essential for Pseudomonas aeruginosa's ability to acquire iron and cause disease.

The researchers discovered that Candida albicans secreted proteins directly suppress the expression of pyochelin and pyoverdine genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to reduced virulence. They also found that heat-killed Candida albicans had no effect on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating that live Candida albicans is necessary for the suppression of virulence. Furthermore, the study showed that oral iron supplementation restored Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence in mice colonized by both Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The findings suggest that Candida albicans can modulate the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the gut by suppressing the production of key virulence factors. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between different microorganisms in the gut and highlights the potential for therapeutic targets to prevent microbial disease.
Research has shown that escape mutant (EM) viruses, which evade CD8+ T cell recognition, are frequently observed in HIV-1 and SIV infections. These EM viruses are often less replicatively fit compared to wild-type (WT) viruses, as demonstrated by their reversion to WT upon transmission to a naive host and association with lower viral loads in vivo. However, the rate and timing of reversion is highly variable. A study investigated the reversion of SIV and SHIV viruses containing minor amounts of WT virus in pigtail macaques using a sensitive PCR assay. The results showed that infection with mixes of EM and WT virus containing ≥10% WT virus resulted in immediate and rapid outgrowth of WT virus at SIV Gag CD8 T cell epitopes within 7 days of infection. In contrast, infection with biologically passaged SHIVmn229 viruses with smaller proportions of WT sequence or a molecular clone of pure EM SIVmac239 demonstrated a delayed or slow pattern of reversion, with WT virus not detectable until ≥8 days after inoculation and taking ≥8 weeks to become the dominant quasispecies. The study found that the diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion to WT virus, which in turn predicts the outcome of infection. The delay in reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 T cell escape mutations in some scenarios suggests opportunities to reduce the pathogenicity of HIV during very early infection.
Researchers studied yeast strains collected from Evolution Canyon, Israel, and found that they exhibit extremely high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium. The primary cause of this tolerance is an enhanced function of a metal efflux pump called PCA1. Molecular analyses revealed that mutations in the PCA1 promoter sequence are responsible for this enhancement, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect. Reconstruction experiments showed that three specific single nucleotide substitutions in the PCA1 promoter increase its activity and enhance cadmium resistance. These nucleotides are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other yeast species, suggesting they represent an ancestral type. However, these nucleotides have diverged in most Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, which gave cells a growth advantage under conditions where cadmium is low or absent. The study provides a rare example of a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by a tradeoff in metal resistance. The findings suggest that a weak allele of PCA1 spread to most S. cerevisiae populations due to a tradeoff between metal resistance and fitness under low cadmium conditions. This tradeoff allowed cells to maintain a certain level of cadmium efflux activity without compromising their fitness under normal conditions.
Researchers have identified three major oncogenic pathways - proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin - that are deregulated in more than 70% of gastric cancer cases. These pathways are associated with patient survival and can be used to stratify gastric cancer patients into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. An in silico method was developed to map activation levels of different pathways in primary tumor profiles, which was validated using proof-of-concept examples from breast cancer. The method was then applied to gastric cancer to evaluate eleven oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways previously implicated in gastric carcinogenesis.

The researchers used gene expression signatures to predict levels of oncogenic pathway activation in gastric cancer. They defined pathway signatures as sets of genes exhibiting altered expression after functional perturbation of a specific pathway. These signatures were then mapped onto gene expression profiles from a heterogeneous series of cancers. The results showed that it is feasible to predict patterns of pathway activation in gastric cancer using expression signatures obtained from different experimental conditions and tissue types.

Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting that pathway interactions may play an important role in influencing disease behavior. This approach allows for the study of multiple cancer-related pathways interacting simultaneously in primary cancers, at a scale not currently achievable by other platforms. Gastric cancer, the second leading cause of global cancer mortality, is a molecularly heterogeneous disease with deregulation of canonical oncogenic pathways such as E2F, K-RAS, p53, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling occurring with varying frequencies.
Researchers used a method called stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) analysis to identify regions in the Escherichia coli K12 genome that are susceptible to strand separation under negative superhelical stress. They found that strongly destabilized sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions containing promoters, but rarely in coding regions. The study investigated whether genes grouped in different functional categories have characteristic SIDD properties in their upstream flanks. The results showed that strong SIDD sites are statistically significantly overrepresented in the upstream regions of genes encoding transcriptional regulators. Specifically, the upstream regions of genes that directly respond to physiological and environmental stimuli are more destabilized than those of genes not involved in these responses. Furthermore, if a pathway is controlled by a transcriptional regulator with a destabilized 5' flank, the genes in that pathway usually contain strongly destabilized SIDD sites in their 5' flanks. This association was observed in 38 of 43 genomes of free-living bacteria, but in only four of 18 genomes of endosymbionts or obligate parasitic bacteria. The study suggests that strong SIDD sites 5' to participating genes may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes, which are known to transiently alter superhelicity. The researchers propose that these SIDD sites are active and necessary participants in superhelically mediated regulatory mechanisms governing changes in the global pattern of gene expression in prokaryotes in response to physiological or environmental changes.
Researchers have identified a network of high-mobility group (HMG) box transcription factors in the fungus Podospora anserina that play a crucial role in regulating the sexual cycle. The study found that 11 out of 12 HMG-box genes in P. anserina are involved in the sexual cycle, with two genes, PaHMG5 and PaHMG9, displaying striking features. PaHMG5 is a pivotal activator of mating-type genes, while PaHMG9 is a repressor of several phenomena specific to the stationary phase, including hyphal anastomoses. The researchers discovered that PaHMG5 is at the hub of a network of several HMG-box factors that regulate mating-type genes and mating-type target genes. This network also controls fertility genes that are not regulated by mating-type transcription factors. The study highlights the critical role of HMG-box members in sexual reproduction in fungi. The researchers also found that PaHMG5 and its ortholog, SpSte11 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, are conserved transcriptional regulators of mating-type genes, despite the two species diverging 550 million years ago. The study reveals a commonality of sex regulation in animals and fungi, with the P. anserina and S. pombe mating-type genes and their upstream regulatory factor forming a module of HMG-box genes analogous to the SRY/SOX9 module in mammals. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role and relationships of HMG-box genes in P. anserina and sheds light on the evolution of sex regulation in eukaryotes.
An observational cohort study was conducted in Sierra Leone to investigate the persistence of Ebola virus (EBOV) in survivors' body fluids during the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic. The study aimed to address the urgent need to determine the persistence of EBOV in survivors' body fluids and the potential risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. The study was implemented within five months of initial protocol discussions and consisted of two phases. The first phase assessed the persistence of EBOV in the semen of 100 adult men, while the second phase evaluated the persistence of the virus in multiple body fluids, including semen, vaginal fluid, menstrual blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, and tears, in 120 men and 120 women.

The study demonstrated that EBOV can persist in the body fluids of survivors for an extended period, highlighting the need for semen testing programs among EBOV survivors. The study's findings informed national and global guidelines in real-time and accelerated the implementation of semen testing programs in EBOV-affected countries. The study also informed studies examining the persistence of Zika virus. Strong community engagement facilitated the rapid implementation of the study during the epidemic. The study's methodology and lessons learned underscore the importance of adequate resources being rapidly made available to answer critical research questions to inform public health response efforts during an epidemic of a poorly characterized disease.
Researchers used in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments to study the chemotaxis sensory system of Escherichia coli bacteria. They analyzed dose-response curves to predict the chemical gradients these cells typically encounter in their natural environment. The team reevaluated Weber's law and its generalizations, including the Weber-Fechner law and fold-change detection, to understand how bacteria perceive and respond to chemical stimuli. Using information theory and simulations, they considered the limitations of information transmission from both external and internal noise. The results showed that chemotactic E. coli cells typically encounter broad distributions of exponential gradients, leading to log-normal stimuli and maximal drift velocity. This suggests that the bacteria's sensory system has evolved to maintain perception in environments with exponential gradients. The study provides a first step towards understanding the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible cellular microenvironments, such as the human intestine. The researchers found that maximizing mutual information implies maximizing the alignment of cell trajectories with the gradient, and thus the drift velocity of cells swimming up the gradient. Their multidisciplinary approach connects phenomenological laws with information theory at the molecular level, providing new insights into the chemotaxis sensory system.
Researchers investigated the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are crucial for the long-term supply of blood cells. Contrary to previous assumptions that HSCs have indefinite lifespans due to their self-renewal capacity, the study found that genetically identical HSCs within the same animal can have different lifespans. The lifespan of an HSC is defined as the time it gives rise to all mature blood cells. Using clonal repopulation experiments and computational-mathematical modeling, the researchers developed a new model based on reliability theory to explain the diversity of HSC lifespans. The model suggests that small-scale failures at the molecular level are dissipated at the HSC population level, with failure rates increasing during population-wide division events and being counteracted by repair processes. In the long run, a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior occurs, leading to rapid clonal extinction due to a slow increase in the mean failure rate of self-renewal. The study found that the lifespan of each HSC depends on the amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in the failure rate kinetics, with shorter and longer-lived HSCs differing significantly in their pre-programmed ability to dissipate perturbations. The findings suggest that the lifespan of HSCs is determined by pre-programmed differences in repair capacity. This research has implications for understanding aging in HSCs and other non-homogenous, hierarchically organized cell systems.
Antibodies play a crucial role in protecting against chronic helminth infections, which affect approximately one-third of the world's population. However, the mechanisms by which antibodies target these large multicellular parasites have remained unclear. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity against the natural murine parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (Hp). They found that helminth-specific antibodies induce the rapid trapping of tissue-migrating larvae and prevent tissue necrosis following challenge infection. Mice lacking antibodies or activating Fc receptors harbored highly motile larvae, developed extensive tissue damage, and accumulated fewer Arginase-1 expressing macrophages around the larvae. Antibodies also induced FcRγ- and complement-dependent adherence of macrophages to larvae in vitro, resulting in complete larval immobilization. Furthermore, antibodies reprogrammed macrophages to express wound-healing associated genes, including Arginase-1, and the Arginase-1 product L-ornithine directly impaired larval motility. Notably, antibody-induced expression of Arginase-1 occurred independently of IL-4Rα signaling, indicating a novel IL-4Rα-independent mechanism of alternative macrophage activation. This mechanism, referred to as helminth-antibody activated macrophages (HAAM), mediates anti-helminth immunity and prevents tissue disruption caused by migrating larvae. The study demonstrates a novel effector function of antibodies in activating macrophages to modulate the expression of genes associated with the alternatively activated phenotype, providing new insights into the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity against helminths.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the early stages of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in living cells. The method, called ParB-INT, uses protein oligomerization to form visible foci without interfering with the repair process. This allows for the first real-time analysis of resection in single living cells. The study focused on the HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III and observed the dynamics of a chromatin locus next to a DSB. The results showed that the damaged chromatin region is transiently confined during the early steps of resection, consistent with the need to keep DNA ends in contact. In a yku70 mutant, resection began approximately 10 minutes earlier than in wild-type cells, indicating the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. The study also revealed a distinct phase of confinement of chromatin neighboring the DSB early in the resection period. The ParB-INT visualization system has the potential to be widely applicable to the study of fine-scale chromosome positioning and dynamics in various cellular processes, such as gene expression, replication, and recombination. The findings provide new insights into the dynamics and mechanism of resection and highlight the importance of understanding the early stages of DSB repair in maintaining genome integrity.
Researchers developed an epidemiological model to study the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, in humans. The model aimed to estimate the frequency and timing of reinfections, which can lead to mixed infections with multiple genotypes of the parasite. The study used agent-based modeling and a hybrid genetic algorithm to fit the model to epidemiological data from Argentinean rural villages, where 56% of humans are infected with multiple genotypes of T. cruzi.

The model predicted that 0.032 (0.008-0.042) annual reinfections per individual occur, with 98.4% of them occurring during the chronic phase of the disease. The parasite escapes the adaptive immune response mounted after the primary infection in at least 20% of re-inoculation events. The estimated risks of reinfection during the chronic stage of the disease are 14% (4-18%) and 60% (21-70%) after 5 and 30 years, respectively, with most individuals being re-infected 1-3 times overall.

The study suggests that the low rates of reinfection are better explained by the weak efficiency of the stercorarian mode of transmission rather than a highly efficient adaptive immune response. This finding has implications for vaccine development and understanding the higher risk of chronic disease manifestations suffered by infected people living in endemic areas. The model provides the first estimate of the frequency of human reinfection and highlights the importance of considering multiple genotypes of T. cruzi in epidemiological studies of Chagas disease.
A recent study investigated the relationship between pre-existing immune responses and the clinical outcome of dengue virus (DENV) infection in a cohort of school-aged Thai children. Blood samples were collected from the children before and after a DENV infection, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with DENV to measure the secretion of 30 cytokines. The results showed significant differences in cytokine production based on the type of DENV used for stimulation and the occurrence of clinical illness. Specifically, higher levels of IL-15 and MCP-1 were found in PBMC from subjects who later developed symptomatic DENV infection, while lower levels of IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1α, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFα were observed. Notably, IL-6 was produced by PBMC from all subjects who subsequently developed symptomatic infection, whereas it was produced by only 59% of subjects who had subclinical infection. These findings suggest the existence of both protective and pathologic immune profiles associated with the clinical outcome of DENV infection. The study's results may have implications for evaluating immune responses to dengue vaccines and understanding the mechanisms controlling differential clinical outcomes in DENV infections.
In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning along the anterior-posterior axis. Hh forms an extracellular gradient that specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. However, the prevailing view that Hh functions as a classical morphogen has not been definitively proven, as a direct correspondence between Hh concentration thresholds and gene expression patterns has not been demonstrated. This study provides evidence that the interpretation of Hh signaling depends on the history of exposure to Hh and proposes that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Mathematical modeling predicts that at steady state, only two domains can be defined in response to Hh, suggesting that the boundaries of two or more gene expression patterns cannot be specified by a static Hh gradient. Computer simulations suggest that a spatial "overshoot" of the Hh gradient occurs, resulting in a transient state where the Hh profile is expanded compared to the steady-state gradient. This overshoot is observed in vivo through a temporal examination of Hh target gene expression, which initially expands anteriorly and then refines. The Hh gene network architecture suggests that this overshoot results from the Hh-dependent up-regulation of the receptor, Patched (Ptc). Altering the network structure to prevent Ptc up-regulation results in overlapping patterns of gene expression, supporting a model in which Hh gradient dynamics play an instructional role in the establishment of patterns of gene expression.
Researchers have identified a new mouse mutation, Lightweight (Lwt), which disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) unc-79 gene. This mutation was isolated in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) forward mutagenesis screen for animals with enhanced locomotor activity. While Lwt/Lwt homozygotes are perinatal lethal, Lightweight heterozygotes are dramatically hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate a conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and extend this observation to the related unc-80 mutant and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants.

Lightweight heterozygotes also exhibit an altered response to the anesthetic isoflurane, reminiscent of unc-79 invertebrate mutant phenotypes. They are mildly hyperactive when exposed to a novel environment, smaller than wild-type animals, and have a leaner body composition. Interestingly, Lightweight heterozygotes voluntarily consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. The acute hypersensitivity to and increased voluntary consumption of ethanol observed in Lightweight heterozygous mice, combined with the observed hypersensitivity to ethanol in C. elegans unc-79, unc-80, and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants, suggests a novel conserved pathway that might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans.
Researchers have identified the Anopheles gambiae immune response as a potential source of anti-Plasmodium genes and mechanisms to control malaria transmission. The Imd pathway, a conserved immune signaling pathway, has been shown to have potent anti-Plasmodium activity. Silencing the negative regulator of the Imd pathway, caspar, or over-expressing the Imd pathway-controlled NF-kappaB transcription factor, rel2, confers a resistant phenotype on A. gambiae mosquitoes to Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological agent of human malaria. To further explore this mechanism, researchers used RNA interference to silence caspar and other components of the Imd pathway, identifying genes participating in the anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar. These genes represent potential targets to achieve over-activation of the pathway. The study found that the Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, with reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts. Additionally, silencing caspar alone was sufficient to induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response even in the absence of resident gut microbiota. The study also established the relevance of Imd pathway components and regulated effectors TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1 in parasite infection intensity-dependent defense. These findings highlight the physiological considerations necessary for implementing Imd pathway manipulation in A. gambiae to limit malaria transmission and reveal nuances in the Imd-directed immune response against P. falciparum.
Researchers investigated the potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) as a treatment for pulmonary fibrosis caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection in mice. The study found that late infusion of BMMSCs into infected mice did not have an anti-fibrotic effect and may even exacerbate the condition. Instead of reducing fibrosis, BMMSCs treatment led to an increase in granulomatous inflammatory areas, fibrocytes count, and soluble collagen in the lungs. Additionally, the expression of genes related to fibrosis, such as collagen-3α1, TGF-β3, MMP-8, and MMP-15, was also increased in BMMSCs-treated mice. Furthermore, human fibroblasts stimulated with lung homogenates from infected and BMMSCs-transplanted mice showed a higher expression of collagen I. The study suggests that the interaction between BMMSCs and the fungus may promote collagen expression and tissue remodeling. In contrast, a combined therapy of BMMSCs and itraconazole (ITC) showed promising results, reducing the expression of TIMP-1 and MMP-13 genes in infected mice. Overall, the findings indicate that BMMSCs may not be an effective treatment for pulmonary fibrosis caused by P. brasiliensis infection and may even worsen the condition.
A recent study investigated the seasonal dynamics of phlebotomine sand fly species that transmit Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of Mediterranean Leishmaniasis, in the Mediterranean subregion. The study analyzed data from 99,000 collected specimens, resulting in the description of seasonal dynamics of 56,000 sand flies belonging to six species competent to transmit L. infantum. The study found that the time of sand fly appearance and disappearance differed between sites, and seasonal densities showed variations in each site. Significant correlations were found between latitude/mean annual temperature of sites and the first month of sand fly appearance, which ranged from early April to the first half of June, and the type of density trend, varying from a single peak in July/August to multiple peaks increasing in magnitude from May through September. A 3-modal trend was recorded for P. tobbi in Cyprus, representing a novel finding for a L. infantum vector. The period of potential exposure to L. infantum in the Mediterranean subregion was associated with a regular bell-shaped density curve, with a wide peak center encompassing the July-September period, and falling between early May to late October for more than 99% of values. No risk for leishmaniasis transmission was identified from December through March in the years considered. The study also found a common pattern of nocturnal female activity, peaking between 11 pm and 2 am, and identified a higher potential risk for L. infantum transmission in the June-October period, particularly in southern territories.
Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, has been found to replicate in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. Microarray analysis revealed that O. tsutsugamushi altered the expression of over 4,500 genes in monocytes, including type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes, and genes associated with the M1 polarization of macrophages. The bacterium also induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and promoted cell death in a small percentage of monocytes. Live O. tsutsugamushi was necessary for the type I interferon response and apoptosis, and enhanced the expression of M1-associated cytokines. These findings were related to the transcriptional changes detected in mononuclear cells isolated from patients with scrub typhus, who showed upregulation of 613 genes, including interferon-related genes, and features of M1 polarization. This study demonstrates that monocytes are polarized in vitro and ex vivo following exposure to O. tsutsugamushi, and highlights the role of interferon-mediated activation of monocytes and their subsequent polarization into an M1 phenotype in the pathogenesis of scrub typhus. The study also suggests that these molecules may be associated with the inflammatory complications of scrub typhus. The findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of scrub typhus and may lead to the development of new diagnostic tools for the disease.
Researchers have explored how ants use visual memory to navigate complex environments, but the neural mechanisms behind this ability are not well understood. The mushroom body, a crucial memory circuit in the insect brain, has been primarily studied in the context of simple olfactory association tasks. A spiking neural model of the mushroom body, originally developed to describe fruitfly olfactory learning, was adapted to simulate the ability of desert ants to learn visual routes through complex natural environments. The model was able to account for the ants' ability to rapidly learn routes and distinguish between on-route and off-route images. The researchers found that the neural architecture of the mushroom body can implement the "familiarity" algorithm, which is essential for ant route following. In the simulation, the model learned over 80 on-route images and reliably distinguished them from off-route images. Notably, the model required minimal modification to perform this complex function, suggesting that the mushroom body is capable of supporting navigation under realistic conditions. The study estimated the theoretical storage capacity of the ant mushroom body to be hundreds of independent images, based on the key computational principles of the circuit, including one-shot learning of sparse codes.
Researchers have identified a novel defense mechanism in plants, specifically in Arabidopsis cauline leaves, where infected leaves are shed to prevent the spread of disease. This process, known as abscission, is triggered by the presence of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. The study found that the abscission response is mediated by a unique set of genes, including HAESA/HAESA-like 2, INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION, and NEVERSHED, which are required for the response to occur. The researchers also discovered that long-distance signals are sent from infected tissue to the abscission zone, alerting it to the presence of the pathogen.

The study suggests that salicylic acid plays a crucial role in regulating both pathogen- and drought-triggered leaf abscission. Plants with mutations in genes necessary for bacterial defense and salicylic acid signaling, such as phytoalexin deficient 4, enhanced disease susceptibility 1, and salicylic acid induction-deficient 2, fail to abscise cauline leaves normally. Additionally, NahG transgenic plants with low levels of salicylic acid also exhibit reduced leaf abscission. The researchers propose a threshold model, where minor infections are handled by limiting bacterial growth, but when an infection is deemed out of control, cauline leaves are shed. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between plants and pathogens, and highlights the importance of salicylic acid in regulating plant defense mechanisms.
Researchers investigated the mechanism behind direction selectivity in starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina, which is crucial for detecting image motion direction. They used somatic whole-cell recordings and Fourier analysis to measure electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular wave visual stimuli. The results showed that SACs generated larger dendritic Ca2+ signals when motion was from their somata towards their dendritic tips than in the opposite direction. This direction selectivity (DS) persisted even in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory network interactions are not essential.

The study found that harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli, indicating nonlinearity, which is likely due to the activation of voltage-gated channels. Two-photon microscopy revealed that SAC dendrites are tonically depolarized relative to the soma, due in part to resting currents mediated by tonic glutamatergic synaptic input. Compartmental modeling supported the conclusion that dendritic DS in SACs can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, which provides the spatial asymmetry necessary for direction discrimination.

The researchers also found that dendritic Ca2+ responses to light stimuli were seen in a minority of cells, while electrical responses were present in all cells. Blocking GABA and glycine receptors simultaneously was required to completely block surround effects on the dendritic Ca2+ signals, indicating that GABA- and glycine-mediated lateral inhibition can contribute to dendritic DS in SACs. However, DS persisted almost unchanged when direct connections between SACs were blocked, suggesting that SAC dendrites generate DS signals independently of lateral inhibitory interactions.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of pathogenesis, infective dose, and virulence in human parasites. They analyzed data from 43 species of human pathogens, including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses, and found that pathogens using locally acting molecules require a lower infective dose than those using distantly acting molecules. Contrary to the hypothesis that pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators are more virulent, the study found no significant relationship between case fatality rate or severity of infection and the mechanism of pathogenesis. However, case fatality rate was significantly negatively related to infective dose, indicating that pathogens with lower infective doses tend to be more virulent. The study also found that pathogens infecting hosts through wounded skin result in significantly higher case fatality rates than pathogens inhaled or ingested. These findings suggest that broad-scale comparative analyses can explain variation in parasite traits such as infective dose and virulence, while highlighting the importance of mechanistic details. The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis and the factors that influence the virulence of human parasites.
Researchers have investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic helminth that causes schistosomiasis, a disease affecting approximately 200 million people worldwide. Using a novel bioinformatics tool, Sylamer, they analyzed the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of transcripts differentially expressed between juvenile and adult stages of the parasite. The study found that the miR-277/4989 family target sequence is significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. A novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989, was identified, and its genomic location suggests that it forms a miRNA cluster with sma-miR-277. The expression of sma-miR-277/4989 miRNAs is up-regulated in adults, while their predicted targets are down-regulated in paired adult worms but remain unchanged in immature females. The study also found that sma-miR-4989 is expressed in tegumental cells near the oesophagus gland and throughout the male worm's body. The results suggest that sma-miR-277/4989 may play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation during the development of juvenile worms and in the sexual development of female schistosomes. The study provides evidence for the role of miRNAs in the intra-mammalian development of this parasite and highlights the importance of miR-277/4989 in regulating gene expression changes underlying the development of juveniles and sexual maturation.
Researchers conducted a 5-year surveillance of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) in a cave in Yunnan Province, China, inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats. They discovered 11 new SARSr-CoV strains, in addition to four previously identified strains, and analyzed their full-length genomes. The study found that the SARSr-CoVs in this cave are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3, and ORF8 regions. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, as well as in the ORF3 and ORF8 regions, were detected in the cave. The researchers also found that SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared to those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis revealed evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. The study suggests that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further highlighting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. The findings provide new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and emphasize the importance of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.
The faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) is a widely used method for detecting drug resistance in human soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections. However, recent evidence suggests that density-dependent fecundity, where the reproductive rate of female worms increases as their population density decreases, may distort FECRT data. This phenomenon has been observed in canine hookworms and is likely to apply to human STHs as well. As a result, the FECRT may underestimate drug efficacy, particularly in cases where a significant proportion of the population is drug-resistant. The degree of underestimation will depend on the extent to which worm egg output is constrained prior to treatment and the ability of surviving worms to increase their egg production after treatment. This may lead to difficulties in identifying apparent changes in drug efficacy, making it challenging to detect the emergence of drug resistance. To improve the accuracy of FECRT, it is suggested that cases with the heaviest infections be omitted from the test, as they may have the greatest potential to increase their egg output upon removal of density-dependent constraints. This highlights the need to develop new drug resistance monitoring methods, such as in vitro phenotypic assays or changes in worm genotypes, to complement the FECRT.
Researchers investigated the role of epithelial heparan sulfate (HS) in regulating Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling during lung development. They found that deleting HS synthetase Ext1 in epithelial cells resulted in expanded branching tips and reduced branching number in the lung, associated with mesenchymal developmental defects. This was accompanied by increased FGF10 expression and FGF signaling activity, suggesting a cell non-autonomous mechanism. Further analysis revealed reduced SHH signaling activity, which is responsible for suppressing FGF10 expression. Reactivating SHH signaling in mutant lungs rescued the tip dilation phenotype and attenuated FGF signaling. Importantly, the reduced SHH signaling activity was not due to decreased Shh expression or protein stability, but rather a reduction in the biologically active form of SHH proteins in both mutant epithelial cells and surrounding wild-type mesenchymal cells. The study highlights the critical role of epithelial HS in maintaining SHH signaling activity, which is essential for lung morphogenesis. The findings suggest that HS plays a key role in regulating the SHH-FGF10 signaling cascade, and its loss leads to an FGF gain-of-function phenotype during lung development. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells during lung branching morphogenesis.
Researchers have evaluated the effectiveness of paired-end sequencing strategies for detecting genome rearrangements in cancer. Paired-end sequencing is a technique that assesses genome rearrangements and structural variation on a genome-wide scale, particularly useful for detecting copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions and translocations, which are common in cancer and can produce novel fusion genes. The study addressed the question of how much sequencing is required to detect rearrangement breakpoints and localize them precisely using both theoretical models and simulation. A formula was derived for the probability that a fusion gene exists in a cancer genome given a collection of paired-end sequences from this genome. The formula was used to compute fusion gene probabilities in several breast cancer samples, and it was found that a relatively small number of fragments of large size were sufficient to accurately predict fusion genes. The study also demonstrated how the ability to detect fusion genes depends on the distribution of gene lengths and evaluated how different parameters of a sequencing strategy impact breakpoint detection, breakpoint localization, and fusion gene detection, even in the presence of errors that suggest false rearrangements. The results will be useful in calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, particularly large-scale studies of many cancer genomes enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies.
Chemotaxis, the ability of cells to sense and respond to chemical gradients, involves the coordinated action of three processes: motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. Researchers have proposed that these processes are mediated by separate modules that can be combined to recreate the behaviors of chemotactic cells. A mathematical model has been developed to simulate these processes using reaction-diffusion equations and a mechanical model of the cell cortex implemented in the level set framework. The model consists of three main modules: an excitable network that accounts for random migration, a local excitation, global inhibition module that biases the direction of excitable activity, and a polarization module linked to the excitable network through the cytoskeleton.

The model demonstrates that cells can migrate and change their morphology in response to uniform stimuli and gradients. The polarization module allows unstimulated cells to move persistently and cells in gradients to acquire distinct sensitivity between the front and back. By varying the strengths of feedback loops in the model, the researchers obtained cellular behaviors that mirror those of genetically altered cell lines. The model also shows that adaptation is not absolutely required for chemotaxis, as cells without an adaptation mechanism can still perform chemotaxis, although less efficiently. The results suggest that chemotaxis is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple modules, and that these modules can be combined to recreate the behaviors of chemotactic cells.
TDRD6, a protein essential for male fertility, plays a crucial role in the early steps of spliceosome maturation in primary spermatocytes. In meiotic prophase I, TDRD6 interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, which is involved in splicing. TDRD6 also associates with the spliceosomal core protein SmB in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. In the absence of TDRD6, the association of PRMT5 with SmB and arginine dimethylation of SmB are significantly reduced, leading to impaired assembly of spliceosomes. As a result, TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes exhibit increased levels of U5 snRNPs and decreased numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies, which are involved in nuclear snRNP maturation.

Transcriptome analysis of TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes reveals a high number of splicing defects, including aberrant usage of introns and exons, as well as aberrant representation of splice junctions. These findings demonstrate a novel function of TDRD6 in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes. The study suggests that TDRD6 may have acquired the role of a spliceosome assembly factor to ensure proper RNA splicing events, including those specific to spermatogenesis. The data also highlight the importance of TDRD6 in the maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs during the transcriptionally active prophase I of spermatogenesis.
A new Bayesian model has been developed to study the acquisition and clearance of bacterial colonization in hosts. The model provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same, allowing for the determination of bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. Unlike previous approaches, this model does not rely on a fixed genetic distance threshold to determine the relationship between isolates. Instead, it uses a fully probabilistic approach that automatically provides uncertainty estimates for all relevant quantities.

The study of colonization dynamics is based on inferring whether bacteria from samples collected over time represent the same population or distinct colonization events. Whole genome sequencing has provided a detailed measure of genetic distance between isolates, which can be used to infer the relationship between them. However, previous methods have been inadequate to account for the diversity of the underlying within-host evolving population, the time intervals between consecutive measurements, and the uncertainty in the estimated acquisition and clearance rates.

The new model uses a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to infer the relationship between isolates. It explicitly models the within-host variation using population genetic simulation. The model was validated with multiple simulations and demonstrated its use in practice by analyzing a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a large longitudinal clinical study. An R-code implementation of the method is freely available for use.
Plants generate new organs through the activity of stem cells called meristems, which initiate leaves, flowers, and lateral meristems in a process called phyllotaxis. The plant hormone auxin plays a major role in this process. Current hypotheses propose that cellular hormone transporters of the PIN family create local auxin maxima at precise positions, leading to organ initiation. However, different concepts have been proposed to explain how auxin transporters create hormone fluxes to distinct regions within the plant. A major hypothesis, canalization, suggests that auxin transporters amplify and stabilize existing fluxes, which could be initiated by local diffusion. Another hypothesis proposes that auxin is systematically transported towards areas with the highest concentrations. To test these complex hypotheses, computational modeling was used to simulate auxin transport at the shoot apical meristem. The results show that a flux-based polarization hypothesis is able to explain auxin transport at the shoot meristem, providing a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in the plant. This hypothesis suggests that cells transport auxin from cell to cell, creating fluxes that lead to local hormone maxima and minima, which are interpreted in terms of differential gene expression and growth rates. The flux-based hypothesis remains a potential unifying mechanism for auxin transport throughout the plant, and further experiments are required to distinguish it from other hypotheses.
Researchers used a combination of in silico searches and wet lab experiments to identify diagnostic peptides for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. The study aimed to develop improved point-of-care diagnostic tests for early case detection and surveillance. Previous investigations had identified IgG1 as a potential biomarker for monitoring clinical status in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), but used a crude lysate antigen (CLA) as the capturing antigen. This study sought to replace the CLA with specific antigens to create more robust RDTs. Immunoblots revealed L. donovani protein bands detected by IgG1 from VL patients, and mass spectrometry (MS) was used to confidently identify these antigens. The researchers then searched for evidence of constitutive protein expression and antigenic domains or high accessibility to B-cells. In silico algorithms were used to map linear epitopes from the shortlisted proteins, and multiple high-scoring predicted epitopes were screened in peptide arrays. The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes using VL and non-endemic healthy control (NEHC) patient sera. The results showed that over 90% of the proteins identified from the immunoblots did not meet the selection criteria and were excluded from further analysis. The most reactive peptide had a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 60-97%) for IgG1 with Sudanese VL sera on RDT prototypes, and none of the NEHC sera were positive. This study demonstrates the potential of in silico searches to reduce the output of wet lab experiments and identify promising diagnostic peptides for VL.
A study of 317 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from six countries found that 61.5% of cases had granulomas, with 25.2% being caseating granulomas, 4.6% suppurative granulomas, and 70.2% tuberculoid granulomas without necrosis. The presence of caseating granulomas was significantly associated with geographic location, with a higher incidence in Saudi Arabia. Histologically, caseating and tuberculoid granulomas differed in the distribution of Ridley's pattern (RP), with a higher RP3 in caseating granulomas and a higher RP5 in tuberculoid granulomas. The time needed to achieve healing was shorter in tuberculoid granulomas compared to caseating granulomas. The study found no association between granuloma type and parasitic index, CL species, or other variables.

The study also found that 18.2% of all CL cases had caseating granulomas, suggesting that CL should be considered in the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions, alongside tuberculosis (TB) and other causative infections. The study identified Leishmania tropica as the predominant species in the majority of cases, with Leishmania major identified in the remaining cases. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering CL in the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions, particularly in regions where both CL and TB are prevalent.
Researchers have identified a candidate gene, Zfp69, which is associated with the development of obesity-related diabetes in mice. The gene, a zinc finger domain transcription factor, is located on distal chromosome 4 and is responsible for the diabetogenic effect of the Nidd/SJL quantitative trait locus (QTL). The QTL is a region of the genome that contributes to the development of diabetes in mice. The researchers used positional cloning, a technique that involves identifying a gene based on its location on the chromosome, to identify Zfp69 as the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL.

The study found that the diabetogenic allele of Zfp69, which is present in the SJL, NON, and NZB strains, produces a normal mRNA, whereas the non-diabetogenic alleles in the NZO and C57BL/6J strains produce a truncated mRNA that lacks the coding sequence for the KRAB and Znf-C2H2 domains of Zfp69. The researchers also found that the diabetogenic Zfp69 allele produces hyperglycemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma and liver triglycerides in mice. Furthermore, the expression of the human orthologue of Zfp69, ZNF642, was found to be significantly increased in adipose tissue from patients with type 2 diabetes.

The study suggests that the expression of Zfp69 in adipose tissue may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. The researchers conclude that Zfp69 is the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL and that the retrotransposon IAPLTR1a contributes to the genetic heterogeneity of mouse strains.
Researchers have proposed a comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling the differentiation of T helper (Th) cells. Th cells are a type of immune cell that play a crucial role in the body's response to infection and disease. The model takes into account the complex interactions between various signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks that influence Th cell differentiation.

Using a logical formalism, the researchers performed extensive dynamical analyses of the network and identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes. However, they also found that these canonical subtypes coexist with transient hybrid cell types that express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg, and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent manner.

The researchers used an original model reduction approach to cope with the size and complexity of the network, and a stable state identification algorithm to assess the effects of heterogeneous environments on Th cell differentiation. They performed systematic simulations considering various prototypic environments and found that the model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico.

The study highlights the diversity and plasticity of Th cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes. The proposed model provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions between signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks that control Th cell differentiation, and can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model to understand how transcription factors bind to specific regions of the genome during early Drosophila development. Transcription factors are proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to DNA, and their binding patterns are crucial for proper development. However, predicting where, when, and to what extent these factors bind has been challenging. The researchers used a thermodynamic model to evaluate the contribution of different biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of early embryonic anterior-posterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster. They found that predictions based on DNA sequence and protein-DNA affinities alone achieved a moderate correlation with experimental measurements of in vivo binding. However, incorporating experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility into the model significantly improved the predictions, achieving a correlation of 0.6-0.9 for various factors across known target genes. The results suggest that in regions of open chromatin, binding can be predicted almost exclusively by the sequence specificity of individual factors, with a minimal role for protein interactions. The researchers propose that a combination of experimentally determined chromatin accessibility data and simple computational models of transcription factor binding can be used to predict the binding landscape of any animal transcription factor with significant precision. The model was applied to predict the genome-wide binding across 4,251 genes and found a strong relation between the model's ability to accurately predict binding and gene expression levels.
In Drosophila, the basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Daughterless (Da) and Extramacrochaetae (Emc), play a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression in epithelial cells of imaginal discs. These factors are part of the E protein family, which is involved in controlling cell proliferation in metazoans, and their activity is often deregulated in cancerous cells. Through genetic analysis, researchers have found that Emc controls the G2/M transition and subsequent cell proliferation by regulating the activity of Da. Specifically, Emc downregulates Da, which in turn triggers mitosis by transcriptionally repressing the Cdc25 phosphatase, string. The ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced levels of Emc or high levels of Da is sufficient to rescue the proliferative defects seen in these mutant cells. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that Da acts as a transcriptional repressor of string, highlighting a novel mechanism through which Emc controls cell proliferation. This research provides new insights into the regulation of cell cycle progression in Drosophila and has implications for understanding the development processes that occur in both physiological and pathological conditions, such as cancer. The findings also shed light on the role of bHLH transcription factors in controlling the balance between proliferation and differentiation.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive pipeline to analyze phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments, enabling the systematic discovery of signaling networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of budding yeast. Phosphorylation, a key mechanism of signal transduction, plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and development. However, few signaling networks have been fully elucidated. To address this, the researchers employed quantitative phosphoproteomics, a technique that allows for the large-scale determination of relative phosphorylation levels. They used the SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) technique with interventional experiments (kinase-dead mutations) to generate a dataset. The pipeline consists of phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery, with a focus on compensating for the missing value problem, a common issue in proteomics studies. The analysis identified 5 high-confidence proteins from meta-analysis and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis, all of which are involved in stress responses. Nine of these proteins have direct or indirect evidence of involvement in filamentous growth. The researchers validated four predicted proteins through interventional phenotypic experiments, demonstrating differential invasive growth. This pipeline presents a systematic approach for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and suggests candidate proteins for further investigation. The methodology is anticipated to be applicable to other interventional studies via different experimental platforms.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the X chromosome in the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster. They found that X chromosome-wide dosage compensation, which is the equalization of X chromosome gene expression in males and females, appears to be absent in most of the Drosophila male germline. Additionally, microarray analysis did not provide evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis, a process known as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). The study also showed that the expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus the autosomes, but this difference in expression is established in premeiotic cells and persists in meiotic cells. The magnitude of the X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting that a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. These findings help to resolve several previously conflicting reports and have implications for patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.
Researchers have investigated the early stages of Citrobacter rodentium infection, a mouse model for human diarrheal infections caused by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). The study found that the development of colonic C. rodentium "attachment/effacement" (A/E) lesions, which determine the severity of infection, is critically dependent on early bacteria-host interactions. These lesions originate from a limited number of single-bacterial epithelial infection events that occur within the first 18 hours of infection.

The researchers discovered that the initiation of colonic C. rodentium microcolonies is restricted to an early stage of infection, and these early-established, clonally-renewing A/E lesions trigger a local innate immune response that protects the epithelium from de novo A/E lesion formation by luminal bacteria. This innate immune response is mediated by TLR-MyD88/Trif-dependent signaling and is induced specifically by virulent C. rodentium in a virulence gene-dependent manner.

The study also found that the epithelium-adherent population of C. rodentium is derived from a very small founder population (one bacterium per microcolony) and is subject to a population bottleneck. This suggests that the establishment phase of C. rodentium pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to a very short window of opportunity that determines both disease geography and severity. The findings of this study provide new insights into the early dynamics and control of A/E lesion development and highlight the importance of early bacteria-host interactions in determining the outcome of C. rodentium infection.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations, such as species or gene variants, when only a fraction of each population is sampled. This is a common problem in fields like ecology and genomic epidemiology, where complete sampling is often not feasible. The new method, based on Bayesian inference, takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. It also provides a framework for quantifying the uncertainty of these estimates.

The method is particularly relevant for estimating the overlap between populations of fixed size, such as the number of gene variants in a parasite. For example, in the case of Plasmodium falciparum parasites, which have a repertoire of 60 var types, the method can estimate the true repertoire overlap between two parasites from the number of shared types in a sample. The method can also be used prospectively in study planning to quantify the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty.

The new method differs from existing indices of β-diversity, which often treat species counts as complete and can lead to bias. It can be applied to various contexts, including the analysis of multigene antigen families in Plasmodium spp. and general studies of β-diversity in multigene families. The method can be improved by incorporating additional information, such as the distribution of repertoire sizes, as larger whole-genome datasets become available.
Eukaryotic protein kinases play a crucial role in regulating most cellular functions by phosphorylating targeted protein substrates. The active state of these enzymes involves a highly conserved catalytic core that oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations. However, the intramolecular interactions that regulate these mechanics were not well understood. Researchers used cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a model to investigate these interactions using biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques. They identified a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that work together to regulate the active state mechanics. These interactions include a salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix, as well as an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and the αC-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell.

Contrary to previous assumptions, the researchers found that the highly conserved lysine residue in the β3-strand is not essential for phosphoryl transfer, but rather plays a structural role in facilitating the active state mechanics by coordinating the transition of the β-sheet region of the N-lobe and linking it with the αC-helix. The study also showed that the active state mechanics can be regulated through the R-spine and Shell, even in the absence of the salt bridge and electrostatic interaction between the activation loop and the αC-helix. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of eukaryotic protein kinases and highlight the importance of the lysine residue in the β3-strand in facilitating the active state mechanics.
A study was conducted in American Samoa to compare the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-mass drug administration (MDA) surveillance of lymphatic filariasis (LF): a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 years and a community-based survey targeting individuals aged 8 years and older. The study aimed to assess the residual transmission of LF 10 years after the last round of MDA. The school-based survey, conducted in 29 elementary schools, identified nine antigen-positive children, with an overall adjusted circulating filarial antigen (CFA) prevalence of 0.7%. In contrast, the community-based survey, conducted in 28 villages, identified 102 antigen-positive individuals, with an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2%. The results showed that CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. The school-based survey had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but high specificity and positive predictive value for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community-based survey, although more operationally challenging, identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence. Both surveys confirmed the recrudescence of LF transmission in American Samoa. The study highlights concerns about the suitability of school-based surveys for post-MDA surveillance and suggests that community-based surveys may be more effective in detecting ongoing transmission.
Researchers investigated the role of oocyte-produced signaling molecules in the maintenance of the adult female sexual phenotype in zebrafish. The study focused on two genes, Bmp15 and Gdf9, which are expressed in zebrafish oocytes and have been implicated in female sex determination and maintenance. The results showed that females deficient in Bmp15 undergo sex reversal during the mid-to-late juvenile stage and develop as fertile males. This suggests that Bmp15 plays a crucial role in maintaining the female sex phenotype in zebrafish.

Further investigation revealed that Bmp15 promotes the development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle, which is essential for female development. The study also found that estrogen production is necessary for female development, and that the function of Bmp15 in female sex maintenance is linked to the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis. The results provide the first mechanistic insights into how oocytes regulate the maintenance of sex in zebrafish.

The study proposes a model in which the oocyte-somatic gonad interaction stabilizes the expression of the cyp19a1a gene, which is responsible for estrogen production. The somatic gonad expresses probable receptors for Bmp15, suggesting a direct interaction between the oocyte and the somatic gonad. The findings establish a genetic pathway required for female sexual development and maintenance in zebrafish, which is likely conserved in other fish species. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying sex determination and maintenance in zebrafish.
Hox proteins play a crucial role in regulating gene expression along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals, controlling cell diversification and pattern formation. To achieve high-regulatory specificity, Hox proteins are thought to co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress target genes in a context-specific manner. However, only a few of these factors have been identified. This study investigated the regulation of the cell death gene reaper (rpr) by the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) and found that local activation of rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of Dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. The study suggests that context-dependent combinations of Hox proteins and other transcription factors on small, modular Hox response elements (HREs) could be responsible for the proper spatio-temporal expression of Hox targets. The findings indicate that a large number of transcription factors are likely to be directly involved in Hox target gene regulation in vivo. This study provides new insights into the complex regulation of Hox target genes and highlights the importance of combinatorial interactions between Hox proteins and other transcription factors in achieving proper spatio-temporal gene expression.
Researchers investigated the genetic requirements for signaling from an autoactive plant NB-LRR intracellular innate immune receptor, ADR1-L2. ADR1-L2 is a coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR protein that functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in plant defense responses. The study found that ADR1-L2 can act as a "helper" to transduce specific microbial activation signals from "sensor" NB-LRRs, and this helper activity does not require an intact P-loop. The researchers generated an autoactive missense mutation, ADR1-L2D484V, which leads to dwarfed plants with increased disease resistance and constitutively high SA levels. The morphological phenotype also requires an intact P-loop, suggesting that these ADR1-L2D484V phenotypes reflect canonical activation of this NB-LRR protein.

The researchers used ADR1-L2D484V to define genetic requirements for signaling and found that signaling from ADR1-L2D484V does not require NADPH oxidase and is negatively regulated by EDS1 and AtMC1. Transcriptional regulation of ADR1-L2D484V is correlated with its phenotypic outputs, which are both SA-dependent and -independent. The genetic requirements for ADR1-L2D484V activity resemble those that regulate an SA-gradient-dependent signal amplification of defense and cell death signaling initially observed in the absence of LSD1. Importantly, ADR1-L2D484V autoactivation signaling is controlled by both EDS1 and SA in separable, but linked pathways. The study proposes a genetic model that provides insight into an SA-dependent feedback regulation loop, which includes ADR1-L2.
This study investigated the role of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in Arabidopsis and its interaction with the MORC6 protein, which mediates transcriptional silencing. The researchers found that SUVH2 and SUVH9, components of the RdDM pathway, interact with MORC6 and can either act in the same pathway or synergistically with MORC6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. Additionally, the double-stranded RNA-binding protein IDN2 interacts with MORC6 and mediates the silencing of a subset of MORC6 target loci. Other RdDM components, including Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2, are also required for transcriptional silencing at a subset of MORC6 target loci. The study also found that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex components SWI3B, SWI3C, and SWI3D interact with MORC6 and SUVH9, and mediate transcriptional silencing. The results suggest that the RdDM components are involved not only in DNA methylation but also in MORC6-mediated heterochromatin condensation, which enhances transcriptional silencing at methylated genomic regions. The study demonstrates that MORC6 interacts with IDN2 and the SWI/SNF complex to mediate heterochromatin condensation, linking DNA methylation to heterochromatin condensation and transcriptional silencing.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in vertebrate development using zebrafish as a model. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that helps buffer genetic variation and protect against developmental malformations. The study found that inhibiting Hsp90 function in zebrafish revealed previously unobserved developmental anomalies, including severe structural eye malformations reminiscent of human conditions such as anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia complex. The severity of these malformations varied depending on the level of Hsp90 inhibition and the genetic background of the fish. In some cases, Hsp90 inhibition increased the severity of a recessive eye phenotype, while in others, it decreased it. The study also found that inbreeding of offspring from unaffected carrier parents led to significantly elevated malformation frequencies, suggesting an oligogenic nature of the phenotype. In contrast to previous findings in Drosophila, Hsp90 inhibition decreased developmental stability in zebrafish, leading to increased asymmetric presentation of developmental anomalies. The study suggests that mild perturbation of Hsp90 function at critical developmental stages may underpin the variable penetrance and expressivity of many developmental anomalies, where the interaction between genotype and environment plays a major role. The findings have implications for understanding the molecular events that can alter the balance between cryptic and overt phenotypes.
Researchers have identified and characterized N-terminally acetylated proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, a common protein modification found throughout the tree of life. The study analyzed amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells and detected over 1,200 mature protein N-termini. The results show that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans. A specific rule, referred to as the (X)PX rule, was identified as the sole determinant for N-terminal acetylation, indicating that certain amino acid sequences prevent acetylation under all circumstances. This rule was used to genetically engineer proteins to study the biological relevance of N-terminal acetylation, generating a generic assay to probe the functional importance of this modification. The assay was applied by expressing mutated proteins as transgenes in cell lines and in flies. The study provides a straightforward strategy to systematically study the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylations in cells and whole organisms. The (X)PX rule is proposed to be of general validity in lower and higher eukaryotes, suggesting its applicability to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in all species. The findings demonstrate that N-terminal acetylation promotes various biological functions that cannot be predicted from the primary amino acid sequence, highlighting the need for a method to generate and express proteins that differ in N-terminal acetylation to investigate functional consequences.
Researchers have investigated the termination mechanisms of RNA polymerase III (RNAP III), a crucial enzyme for producing abundant tRNA molecules during cell growth, development, and cancer. To understand how RNAP III efficiently recycles from termination to reinitiation, scientists used two tRNA-mediated suppression systems to screen for mutants with gain- and loss-of-termination phenotypes in the yeast Saccharomyces pombe. The study identified 122 point mutations that cluster in the active center of RNAP III, specifically in the bridge helix and trigger loop, as well as the pore and funnel regions. These mutations were mapped to a 3.9 Å structure of the yeast RNAP III elongation complex.

Purified RNAP III from a readthrough mutant exhibited an increased elongation rate, supporting a kinetic coupling model where elongation rate is inversely related to termination efficiency. The mutants showed good correlations between terminator readthrough in vitro and in vivo, as well as amounts of transcription in vivo. Using a tRNA reporter with a processing defect and a strong terminator, the researchers found that mutants with the readthrough phenotype synthesized more RNA than wild-type cells, which could not be accounted for by their increased elongation rate. The study suggests that the mobile elements of the RNAP III active center, including the C11 subunit, are key determinants of termination and that some mutations activate RNAP III for overall transcription. These findings have implications for understanding RNAP III activation in disease, as similar mutations have been observed in spontaneous cancer.
Researchers have developed a method to predict protein-protein interactions mediated by SH2 domains using the FoldX algorithm and structural information from SH2-phosphopeptide complexes. This approach was shown to perform similarly to experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices in predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. The method was used to provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure, filtered on secondary structure and phosphorylation state. The predictions were validated using literature-derived SH2 interactions and a probabilistic score obtained from a naive Bayes integration of information on coexpression, conservation of the interaction in other species, shared interaction partners, and functions. The results suggest that the FoldX algorithm is a useful alternative to peptide library experiments for predicting SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions. The method was applied to nine SH2 domain-containing proteins, and the predicted interactions were annotated with supporting information, providing a resource for further experimental testing. The portability of this method to other SH2 domains remains to be shown, but its applicability for genome-wide predictions was demonstrated by predicting the in vitro binding thermodynamics of protein-phosphopeptide complexes for nine different SH2 domains.
Researchers have identified a protein called cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) that has the ability to dissolve toxic amyloids in the brain, which are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These amyloids are formed when a protein called tau accumulates and aggregates, leading to neuronal damage and cognitive decline. CyP40 is a type of enzyme called a cis/trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) that helps regulate the structure of proteins. The study found that CyP40 can interact with tau and other aggregating proteins, breaking them down into smaller, non-toxic forms. This process is dependent on the PPIase activity of CyP40 and does not require the use of energy, a unique property among PPIases.

In experiments using a mouse model of tau accumulation, CyP40 was shown to reduce the formation of toxic tau oligomers and amyloid deposits, preserving neuronal health and cognitive function. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that CyP40 altered the morphology and reduced the size of tau fibrils. The study also found that other PPIases, such as FKBP51 and FKBP52, did not have the same effect on amyloid content, suggesting that CyP40 has a unique ability to interact with and break down tau. These findings suggest that CyP40 may be a potential therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative disorders associated with amyloid accumulation, such as Alzheimer's disease.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the formation and maintenance of heterocyst patterns in cyanobacteria filaments. Heterocyst differentiation is a process of cellular differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms. The model combines the genetic regulatory network of cyanobacteria with the principles of systems biology to simulate the behavior of individual cyanobacteria under different external conditions, such as nitrogen deprivation. The model incorporates the diffusion of combined nitrogen along the filament and the dynamical properties of the underlying genetic circuit of each single cyanobacterium.

The model is based on a set of differential equations that describe the time evolution of the concentrations of relevant molecular products. By coupling the genetic circuits of individual cyanobacteria via molecular diffusion, the model simulates the dynamics of cyanobacteria filaments. The results show that the model can reproduce the main features of heterocyst pattern formation and maintenance as observed experimentally.

The study highlights the importance of noise in the onset of differentiation, enabling the development of characteristic heterocyst patterns for a wide range of model parameters. This suggests that cyanobacteria filaments have developed an efficient response to the noisy conditions of their natural environment. The model provides a framework for understanding the principles of heterocyst pattern formation and maintenance, shedding light on the theoretical gap between microscopic and macroscopic processes.
A study conducted in Cameroon aimed to investigate the relationship between people's perceptions of the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program, their beliefs about onchocerciasis, and their adherence to ivermectin treatment in three regions with high onchocerciasis prevalence. The study found that people's perceptions of the CDTI program were more strongly associated with adherence to ivermectin than their beliefs about onchocerciasis. Specifically, individuals who had a positive opinion of the ivermectin distribution campaigns and believed that community drug distributors were committed to their work were more likely to adhere to the treatment. In contrast, those who held misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission, such as believing that the disease is caused by poor hygiene or high sugar intake, were less likely to adhere to the treatment. The study highlights the importance of addressing misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission and promoting a positive perception of the CDTI program in order to improve adherence to ivermectin treatment. The findings suggest that local health authorities should prioritize education and sensitization on onchocerciasis and ivermectin use, as well as involve communities in the implementation of the CDTI program to increase its effectiveness.
Researchers investigated the relationship between genetic and epigenetic variations and protein biomarkers for various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. They analyzed data from over 10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 470,000 DNA methylation sites in relation to 121 protein biomarkers. The study used epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify associations between DNA methylation, SNPs, and protein biomarkers.

The results showed that 124 DNA methylation sites and 45 SNPs were associated with protein biomarkers, with effect sizes ranging from 0.22 to 4 standard units per 1% change in DNA methylation levels or per copy of the effective allele. Most of the SNPs associated with protein biomarkers were located in cis-regulatory regions, while most of the DNA methylation sites associated with protein biomarkers were located in trans-regulatory regions. Eleven DNA methylation sites were associated with multiple protein biomarkers, including one site associated with levels of CXCL11, CXCL9, IL-12, and IL-18.

However, the study found no evidence that DNA methylation directly affects protein biomarker levels. Instead, the associations between DNA methylation and protein biomarkers were likely due to underlying genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or secondary effects of disease pathogenesis. The study suggests that DNA methylation has a limited direct effect on biomarkers of complex diseases, and that genetic variants play a more significant role in determining protein biomarker levels.
Researchers have discovered that varicella zoster virus (VZV) can directly impair the function of natural killer (NK) cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting viral infections. In laboratory experiments, VZV was found to potently inhibit the ability of NK cells to respond to target cells, leading to a loss of both cytotoxic and cytokine responses. This impairment was observed not only in NK cells that were infected with VZV, but also in uninfected NK cells that were exposed to VZV-infected cells in culture. The researchers found that direct contact between NK cells and VZV-infected cells was necessary for the impairment of NK cell function. Analysis of the NK cell surface receptors revealed that their expression remained stable, but the cells were unable to respond to stimulation. Furthermore, the researchers found that VZV-infected NK cells were still capable of releasing cytotoxic granules, but only when the stimulation signal bypassed the normal receptor-ligand interactions and early signaling pathways. The study also found that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a closely related virus, was able to infect NK cells and render them unresponsive to target cell stimulation, but with some differences in cytokine production compared to VZV. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which VZV evades the immune response and highlight the importance of NK cells in fighting viral infections.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanism underlying apparent motion (AM), a phenomenon where two stimuli alternately presented at different locations evoke a percept of a stimulus continuously moving between the two locations. They found that AM has a distinct effect on the detection of target gratings, limiting the maximum performance at high contrast levels. The masking effect is strongest when the target orientation matches the orientation of the inducers. A population code model of early visual processing, based on a standard contrast normalization model, was developed to explain these findings. The model predicts that AM-related activation in early visual cortex is too small to cause masking or be perceived as motion. Instead, it suggests that early sensory responses are strongly suppressed during AM, consistent with the theoretical framework of predictive coding. Predictive coding models propose that higher-level predictions of motion are generated, which "explain away" lower-level responses to expected sensory input. This suppression of early sensory responses is thought to be the major cause of AM masking, rather than increased activation of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons tuned to locations along the AM path.
HTLV-1 Tax, a protein encoded by the Human T-lymphotropic virus 1, plays a crucial role in the transformation of CD4+ T cells by promoting cell proliferation and survival through the activation of the NF-κB pathway. To understand the underlying molecular mechanism, researchers reconstituted Tax-stimulated IKK activation in a cell-free system. This allowed them to dissect the essential cellular components required for primary IKK activation by Tax and study the biochemical mechanism involved.

The study revealed that Tax functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, working together with specific E2 enzymes to catalyze the assembly of free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains. These polyubiquitin chains directly activate the IKK complex by binding to its NEMO subunit. This biochemical function of Tax clarifies the confusion surrounding HTLV-1-induced IKK-NF-κB activation and identifies the essential cellular factors hijacked by HTLV-1.

The research provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of Tax-induced IKK activation, which utilizes minimal cellular ubiquitination components for NF-κB activation. This understanding may shed light on the development of therapeutics for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM), diseases caused by HTLV-1 infection. The study advances our understanding of the pathophysiological activation of NF-κB, a key transcription factor involved in inflammation and immune responses.
Researchers conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between the number of individuals introduced to establish a new population (propagule pressure) and the success of alien species establishment. They analyzed data from a wide range of taxa, including invertebrates, plants, and vertebrates, and found a positive correlation between propagule pressure and establishment success. However, the effect of propagule pressure on establishment success was most significant when the number of individuals introduced was between 10 and 100. The study also found that the effect size of propagule pressure varied depending on the analytical approach used, with larger effect sizes observed in animal introductions compared to plant introductions. In contrast, the scale of the study (from field to global) and the methodology used (observational, experimental, or proxy) did not significantly impact the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success. The researchers used Bayesian meta-analytical methods to estimate the overall effect of propagule pressure on establishment success and to identify sources of heterogeneity in the relationship. Their analysis revealed remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success. This study provides the first quantitative systematic review of the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success, shedding light on the factors that influence the success of alien species introductions.
Interleukin 17A (IL-17) plays a significant role in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases by enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Research has shown that IL-17 attenuates the degradation of mRNAs encoding these mediators by altering the interaction between AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) and microRNA16 (miR16). AUBPs target AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs, facilitating either mRNA decay or stabilization. In the presence of miR16, AUBPs and the target mRNA assemble in a novel ribonucleoprotein complex, leading to mRNA degradation. However, IL-17 reduces miR16 expression and promotes the binding of stabilizing AUBPs over destabilizing AUBPs, resulting in reduced mRNA decay. This suggests that miR16, independent of its seed sequence, directs the competition between degrading and stabilizing AUBPs for target mRNAs. The interaction between AUBPs, miR16, and target mRNAs depends on specific RNA sequences and structural restraints, and IL-17 exerts its function by changing the contribution of miR16 and AUBPs. This regulation affects the expression of approximately 8% of the human transcriptome, and miR16 is ubiquitously expressed, indicating that IL-17 may influence many other cellular processes beyond inflammation.
A study was conducted in Uganda to investigate the association between bovine and human trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in newly affected areas. The research focused on two districts, Kaberamaido and Dokolo, where the disease has been spreading rapidly due to the movement of infected cattle. Cattle act as long-term reservoirs of human-infective Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, showing few signs of morbidity but posing a significant risk to human health.

The study found a significant association between the sleeping sickness status of a village and the likelihood of Trypanosoma brucei s.l. infection in cattle. Villages with reported cases of sleeping sickness had a higher prevalence of T. brucei s.l. in their cattle compared to villages without reported cases. The study also found that cattle age was a significant factor in the likelihood of T. brucei s.l. infection, with cattle between 18-36 months and over 36 months having a higher odds of infection than those under 18 months.

Furthermore, the study found a significant association between the sleeping sickness status of a village and the detection of T. b. rhodesiense in the village cattle herd. Villages with reported cases of sleeping sickness had a higher likelihood of detecting T. b. rhodesiense in their cattle. The study suggests that a high prevalence of T. brucei s.l. in a village herd is associated with a higher likelihood of detecting T. b. rhodesiense, providing a useful means of determining risk at village or parish level in endemic districts in Uganda.
Researchers have investigated the role of the NSL complex in regulating gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. The NSL complex is composed of four subunits: NSL1, NSL3, MBD-R2, and MCRS2, and is involved in the regulation of autosomal genes. A comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis revealed that 85.5% of NSL-bound genes are constitutively expressed across different cell types. These genes are characterized by increased levels of histone modifications, including H4K16ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac, in their promoter regions. Additionally, NSL-targeted genes have a well-defined nucleosome-free region and broad transcription initiation patterns.

The study found that the NSL complex is required for the efficient recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to NSL-targeted gene promoters. Depletion of NSL1 and NSL3 resulted in reduced Pol II binding and compromised binding of TBP and TFIIB to target promoters. Furthermore, genes that undergo the most dramatic loss of Pol II upon NSL knockdowns are enriched in DNA Replication-related Element (DRE). The NSL complex preferentially targets housekeeping genes, which are constitutively expressed across different developmental stages of Drosophila. The study suggests that the NSL complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes in flies by modulating the initiation of Pol II transcription.
Researchers have developed a transgenic mouse model to study facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a germline transcription factor. The model consists of two mouse lines: one carrying a D4Z4 genomic region from a contracted pathogenic FSHD1 allele and one carrying a normal-sized, non-pathogenic allele. The results show that somatic epigenetic silencing of DUX4 is an evolutionary conserved mechanism, and contracted D4Z4 repeat arrays are silenced less efficiently, leading to a variegated expression pattern of DUX4 protein in skeletal muscle nuclei. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA methylation analyses indicate a relative chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 repeats in mice carrying the contracted allele compared to those carrying the normal-sized allele. This is consistent with the observed DUX4 expression pattern, accurately modeling the difference between FSHD patients and control individuals. The transgenic mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, incomplete epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. These mice represent a valuable animal model for FSHD and will be useful for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease and testing new therapeutic intervention strategies.
Researchers have been working to develop a malaria vaccine using the Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) protein, but current vaccines only provide protection against closely related parasite strains. To overcome this limitation, scientists created a vaccine called AMA1 Quadvax (QV) by combining four diverse AMA1 allelic proteins. This vaccine elicited polyclonal antibodies in rabbits that inhibited the invasion of four vaccine and 22 non-vaccine strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria. The QV vaccine induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies compared to a monovalent 3D7 AMA1 vaccine, which were associated with increased conserved face and domain-3 responses and reduced domain-2 response. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against QV reacted with a novel cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough on domain-1, which mapped to the conserved face of AMA1 and encompassed the 1e-loop. These mAbs were 10-fold more potent than previously characterized AMA1-inhibitory mAbs and inhibited AMA1 binding to its ligand RON2. Another mAb, 1E10, which bound to domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked the proteolytic processing of AMA1. These novel inhibition susceptible regions and epitopes can form the basis for improving the antigenic breadth and inhibitory response of AMA1 vaccines. Vaccination with a few diverse antigenic proteins could provide universal coverage by redirecting the immune response towards conserved epitopes.
Researchers have discovered a previously unknown mechanism that regulates the timing of mitotic spindle displacement in cells. This process is crucial for unequal cell division, where the mitotic spindle is displaced to one side of the cell. The study, conducted in Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, found that a conserved mitotic progression mechanism involving the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) serves as a timer for spindle displacement. The researchers found that reducing the function of the proteasome, APC, or Cdc20/Fizzy delayed spindle displacement, while inactivating CDK in prometaphase caused the spindle to displace early. This suggests that the delay in spindle displacement is necessary to ensure that the spindle is fully assembled before it begins to move. The study demonstrates that the APC-dependent negative regulation of CDK activity serves as a previously unrecognized timer for mitotic spindle displacement, resulting in a 60-90 second delay in spindle displacement. This delay allows spindle assembly to complete before cortical forces pull the spindle away from the center of the cell. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of asymmetric cell division and suggest that this mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved across different systems.
Researchers conducted a genome scan to identify genes associated with adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in two populations, the Tibetans and Andeans, who have lived in high-altitude regions for millennia. The study aimed to understand the genetic basis of physiological adaptations to life at high altitude, such as changes in circulatory, respiratory, and hematological systems. The researchers used four population genetic statistics to detect signatures of natural selection and identified candidate genes and gene regions in each population separately. The results showed that the Tibetan and Andean populations have distinct patterns of genetic adaptation, with different genes or gene regions showing evidence of positive natural selection. One gene, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), involved in cellular oxygen sensing, was found to be under positive selection in both populations, but with different patterns of variation. The study also identified several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes responsible for adaptation to high altitude in both populations. The findings suggest a genetic role in high-altitude adaptation and provide a basis for future studies to confirm the role of selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in adaptation to altitude. The study contributes to the understanding of the genetic and evolutionary architecture of adaptation to altitude and provides insights into the genes responsible for human phenotypic diversity.
Inverted DNA repeats (IRs) near double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) can influence the choice of DSB repair pathway, leading to genetic instability. When IRs are present near a DSB, the repair pathway shifts from accurate gene conversion to break-induced replication (BIR), resulting in genomic destabilization. This occurs because IRs can form unusual DNA structures when present in single-strand DNA (ssDNA) formed by DSB resection. The type of structure formed depends on the length of the spacer separating the IRs, with long (1-kb) spacers leading to inter-molecular single-strand annealing (SSA) and short (12-bp) spacers leading to intra-molecular SSA. Both types of structures interfere with accurate DSB repair by gene conversion and promote BIR. The processing of these structures involves different protein complexes, with the MRX-Sae2 complex processing fold-back (FB) structures with short loops and the Rad1-Rad10 complex processing FBs with long loops. The presence of IRs near DSBs also promotes BIR, a deleterious repair mechanism that can lead to chromosomal rearrangements. This study highlights the mechanisms by which IRs can contribute to genomic destabilization and may have implications for understanding IR-mediated genomic instability associated with human disease, given the high abundance of IRs in the human genome.
Researchers have developed a novel animal model using Drosophila melanogaster to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts, with chronic infections attributed to bacterial biofilms. Biofilms are highly structured, multicellular communities encased in an extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival in the host. In this study, Drosophila was orally infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, resulting in biofilm formation in the Drosophila crop. The biofilms had a characteristic aggregate structure and an extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysaccharide. Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells recovered from in vivo-grown biofilms showed increased antibiotic resistance compared to planktonically grown cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on the expression of the pel exopolysaccharide genes, as a pelB::lux mutant failed to form biofilms. The pelB::lux mutant was more virulent than the wild-type strain PAO1, while a hyperbiofilm strain (PAZHI3) demonstrated reduced virulence. Biofilm formation was associated with the induction of antimicrobial peptide gene expression in Drosophila. The study highlights the use of Drosophila as an infection model for studying Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in vivo and provides insights into host-pathogen interactions during oral infection.
Researchers studied the vasopressin receptor 1a gene (Avpr1a), which plays a crucial role in mediating social behaviors in animals. The gene's expression patterns vary significantly between and within species, but the underlying genomic mechanisms are not well understood. The study used homologous recombination in mice to investigate the contribution of the proximal 5' flanking region and a polymorphic microsatellite element to Avpr1a expression and behavior. The results showed that the proximal 5' flanking region makes a modest contribution to species differences in vasopressin receptor 1a (V1aR) distribution, and variation in V1aR distribution impacts stress-coping behavior in the forced swim test. The study also found that the vole Avpr1a microsatellite structure contributes to Avpr1a expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring some of the inter- and intra-species differences observed in central V1aR patterns in voles. This is the first direct evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes can contribute to diversity in brain gene expression profiles. However, the results suggest that many features of species-specific expression patterns are mediated by elements outside of the immediate 5' flanking region of the gene.
Researchers have investigated the role of Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) in generating double-strand breaks (DSBs) at immunoglobulin switch (S) regions and the c-MYC oncogene in yeast cells with impaired mRNP biogenesis. The study used a yeast chromosomal system to analyze chromosomal rearrangements in both wild-type and THO mutants. The results show that AID acts at heterologous S and c-MYC transcribed sequences, leading to DSBs that cause chromosomal translocations via Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ). AID-induced translocations were significantly enhanced in yeast THO null mutants, suggesting that AID-mediated DSBs depend on R-loop formation.

The study demonstrates that AID induces DSBs in S regions and c-MYC sequences in yeast THO mutants, which are impaired in mRNP biogenesis. The data suggest that AID-mediated deamination of cytosines at S sequences in yeast are channeled by the Ung1 activity into DSBs, as occurs in mammalian B cells, which are then repaired by NHEJ. The c-MYC oncogene, which shares features of S sequences, also acts as a hotspot of recombination in yeast THO mutants.

The findings provide new insights into the role of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of AID-mediated genome instability. The study also shows that yeast cells, like mammalian B cells, have the factors and pathways required to channel AID-mediated DNA lesions into DSBs responsible for NHEJ-dependent genome rearrangements and class switch recombination.
Researchers investigated how Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells partition their chromosomes during asymmetric cell division, where the cell division apparatus is not accurately positioned relative to the nucleoids. Using quantitative time-lapse imaging, they found that the protein FtsK can pump up to 80% of the chromosome (3.7 Mb of DNA) from one daughter compartment to another at an average rate of 1700±800 bp/s. This process occurs at the latest stages of cell division, when the cell division protein ZipA has already dissociated from the septum, and the septum has closed to a narrow channel with a diameter much smaller than the resolution limit of the microscope (~250 nm). The narrow constriction is necessary for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK. The researchers also found that the majority of DNA movement occurs once the septum is closed to a small channel, and translocation speeds tend to increase the later the process occurs in the cell cycle. This suggests that E. coli cells are capable of repositioning their chromosomes when their cell division plane is not properly localized. The study provides new insights into how E. coli cells coordinate cell division and chromosome replication, and how they can still produce viable progeny even when the cell division apparatus is not accurately positioned.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to optimize the selection of peptides for epitope-based vaccines (EVs), which are used to prevent or treat various diseases, including infectious diseases and cancer. The framework, based on integer linear programming (ILP), allows for the identification of the most effective set of epitopes that can elicit a broad and potent immune response. This is crucial because the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding these epitopes is highly polymorphic, meaning that a peptide combination effective for one person may be ineffective for another.

The ILP approach enables the formulation of various flavors of the vaccine design problem and efficiently identifies the optimal set of epitopes from a user-defined set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. The framework can incorporate common immunological requirements for a good EV, such as coverage of epitopes from each antigen, coverage of all MHC alleles in a set, or avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates. The algorithm outperforms a simple greedy strategy and a previously suggested evolutionary algorithm, with runtimes on the order of seconds for typical problem sizes.

The framework is flexible and can account for variants of the problem, including personalized vaccines. It is the first epitope selection framework that finds the optimal solution, providing a provably optimal set of epitopes that displays the highest overall immunogenicity of all sets that meet the pre-defined requirements. This approach does not suggest one optimal epitope selection strategy, but rather provides a mathematical framework that allows for various definitions of a good vaccine, yielding a combination of epitopes that is provably optimal for a chosen definition.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in facilitating HIV-1 transmission to cervico-vaginal tissue. They simulated an in vivo situation by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vaginal tissue in combination with IL-7 at concentrations comparable to those found in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. The results showed that IL-7 significantly enhanced virus replication in ex vivo infected cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of T cells isolated from infected tissues revealed that IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell depletion by preventing apoptosis and increasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2). Additionally, IL-7 increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ T cells, as evidenced by staining for the nuclear factor Ki-67. These findings suggest that high levels of seminal IL-7 in vivo may facilitate the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of HIV infection. The study demonstrates that exposure of cervico-vaginal and lymphoid tissues to IL-7 at concentrations comparable to those found in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals facilitates HIV-1 infection. The results have implications for understanding the role of IL-7 in male-to-female HIV-1 transmission and suggest that a high concentration of IL-7 in semen may render the female lower genital tract mucosa more susceptible to HIV-1 acquisition.
Researchers investigated the response of Aedes aegypti cells to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. They found that ZIKV triggers the production of two types of small RNAs: virus-specific siRNAs (vsiRNAs) and piRNA-like molecules. The vsiRNAs were loaded into the exo-siRNA pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2), but knocking down Ago2 did not enhance virus replication. In contrast, knocking out the Dicer 2 (Dcr2) protein, which is involved in the exo-siRNA pathway, led to increased ZIKV replication. This suggests that the exo-siRNA pathway plays a role in the antiviral response against ZIKV. The researchers also found that ZIKV-specific piRNA-sized small RNAs were produced, but they lacked the characteristic piRNA ping-pong signature motif and were bound to Ago3, not Piwi5 or Piwi6. Silencing of Ago3, Piwi5, or Piwi6 did not enhance ZIKV replication, but silencing of Piwi4 showed antiviral activity. Additionally, the researchers found that the ZIKV capsid protein amplified the replication of a reporter alphavirus, but unlike the yellow fever virus capsid protein, it did not inhibit the exo-siRNA pathway. These findings provide insights into the interactions between ZIKV and the RNA interference (RNAi) response in Aedes aegypti cells, which is important for understanding the spread of the virus.
A recent study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, investigated the association between Sporothrix species and clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis, a fungal infection caused by the Sporothrix genus. The study analyzed 50 patients with different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and found that Sporothrix brasiliensis was associated with atypical clinical presentations, including disseminated cutaneous infection, hypersensitivity reactions, and mucosal infection. In contrast, patients infected with Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto presented with less severe and more localized disease, similar to the majority of previously described sporotrichosis cases. The study also found that patients infected with S. brasiliensis required shorter durations of itraconazole treatment compared to those infected with S. schenckii. The findings suggest that Sporothrix species are linked to different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and that S. brasiliensis is effectively treated with oral itraconazole. This study is the first to demonstrate an association between genotypic identification of Sporothrix species and several clinical aspects of human sporotrichosis, highlighting the importance of careful speciation of Sporothrix isolates to guide clinical care. The study's results contribute to a better understanding of the clinical implications of recent changes in the nomenclature and molecular taxonomy of Sporothrix.
Recent studies have suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed, but the nature and quantity of these transcripts remain unclear. Researchers used RNA-Seq and tiling arrays to investigate the quantity and composition of transcripts in human and mouse tissues. They found that RNA-Seq identified fewer transcribed regions outside known exons and non-coding RNAs compared to tiling arrays. Most non-exonic transcribed regions are located within introns, suggesting they may be fragments of pre-mRNAs. The chromosomal locations of many intergenic transcribed regions are near known genes, consistent with alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons. The researchers identified 4,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes, through reads that bridge splice sites.

The majority of intergenic transcribed regions have low sequence coverage, with 70-80% of the transcribed area detected by a single RNA-Seq read in only one sample. This is consistent with random placement. Tiling arrays were found to be poorly suited for detecting transcripts expressed at low levels. In contrast, RNA-Seq data revealed that most non-exonic transcripts are associated with known genes, including thousands of new alternative exons and hundreds of alternative promoters. A genome-wide analysis of "de novo" splice junctions in human samples revealed 2,789 previously uncharacterized transcript fragments, 1,259 of which map to intergenic regions. The intergenic regions that are transcribed above background levels consist of a mix of coding and non-coding transcripts.
Researchers have developed a new method to improve the thermostability of a protein called the Bacillus subtilis YtvA LOV domain. This protein is used as a fluorescent marker, but its current thermostability is limited, making it unsuitable for use in thermophilic systems. The new method combines computational and experimental approaches to identify mutations that increase the protein's thermostability. The method involves five steps: single mutant computer screening, experimental evaluation, computational redesign, experimental reevaluation, and multiple mutations combination.

Using this method, the researchers were able to increase the thermostability of the YtvA LOV domain by 31°C, making it more suitable for use in thermophilic systems. The method was successful in identifying thermostable mutant candidates, with a success rate of 62%. The thermostable sites were found to be located at the dimeric interface of the protein, suggesting that strengthening interactions between subunits is an effective way to increase thermostability. The researchers also identified a mutant, V120I, which had the highest thermostability, with a melting temperature of 54.2°C.

This new method provides a useful tool for improving protein thermostability, which is essential for studying anaerobic microorganisms, especially thermophilic ones. The method is simple and effective, and can be applied to other important proteins where other methods have difficulties. The researchers suggest that this method can be used to further improve the thermostability of the YtvA LOV domain by combining multiple mutations.
Researchers conducted a study on the diversity of Lutzomyia sand fly species and their infection rates by Leishmania and Wolbachia on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. The study aimed to identify the sand fly species present, their evolutionary relationships, and their infection status with Leishmania and Wolbachia. The researchers collected and sorted sand flies from the island's understory and used DNA sequences to determine the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of the Phlebotominae species. The results showed that 18 species were identified, including two possible "cryptic" species, Lu. sp. nr vespertilionis and Lu. gomezi.

The study found that Leishmania DNA was detected in 43.3% of Lu. trapidoi, 26.3% of Lu. gomezi, and 0% of the other 18 sand fly species. The Leishmania infecting Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi had an identical ITS-1 sequence, which was 93% similar to Leishmania (viannia) naiffi, a species previously unknown in Panama. Wolbachia was detected in three of 20 sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania. The study suggests that Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi are likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species, and that Le. naiffi may have recently expanded its range to include the Isthmus of Panama. The occurrence of Leishmania and Wolbachia in Lu. trapidoi identifies this species as a potential target for gene introductions using Wolbachia population sweeps.
Researchers have investigated the triggers of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs), which is crucial for understanding the devastating clinical consequences associated with HCMV infection and reactivation. The study found that the mitogen and stress-activated kinase (MSK) family plays a key role in ERK-mediated reactivation of HCMV. Specifically, MSK-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. This process is dependent on CREB binding to the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP), which provides the target for MSK recruitment.

The study used an adenovirus vector approach to directly associate the ERK-MSK relationship with CREB-histone H3 phosphorylation and the induction of IE gene expression from latency. The results showed that IE gene expression from latency in DCs is acutely sensitive to MSK chemical inhibition and that reactivation of HCMV involves the phosphorylation of histones bound to the latent MIEP. Furthermore, the study found that MSK-mediated phosphorylation of these histones is highly dependent on concomitant CREB binding to the MIEP.

These findings suggest that CREB binding to the MIEP is necessary for the recruitment of the kinase activity of MSKs to initiate chromatin remodeling at the MIEP required for reactivation. The study provides evidence for a functional interaction between MSK and CREB at promoters, which is important for controlling the gene expression of a clinically important pathogen. The results also suggest that specific inhibition of this interaction between CREB and MSKs could provide a strategy for therapeutic intervention.
Researchers investigated the role of Nol11, a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, in the development of a multicellular organism. They found that Nol11 is essential for optimal pre-rRNA transcription and processing in human tissue culture cells, but its function in vertebrate development was unknown. The study revealed that Nol11 is strongly expressed in the developing cranial neural crest (CNC) of both amphibians and mammals. Knockdown of Nol11 in Xenopus resulted in impaired pre-rRNA transcription and processing, increased apoptosis, and abnormal development of craniofacial cartilages. Inhibition of p53, a protein involved in cell survival, rescued the skeletal phenotype but not the underlying ribosome biogenesis defect. This suggests an evolutionarily conserved control mechanism that removes ribosome-impaired craniofacial cells. Excessive activation of this mechanism impairs craniofacial development. The study provides the first frog model of a ribosomopathy, a group of disorders caused by defects in ribosome biogenesis. The findings demonstrate a novel requirement for Nol11 in craniofacial development and highlight the relationship between specific ribosome biogenesis proteins and craniofacial cell survival. Nol11 expression is tightly linked to CNC cells, where it is required for normal differentiation and development of craniofacial cartilages. Overall, the study reveals a critical function for Nol11 in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis, cell survival, and craniofacial development.
Researchers used a high-density protein microarray approach to identify seroreactive proteins of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni, a bacterium that causes leptospirosis, a widespread zoonotic disease. The study aimed to develop an efficient diagnostic test for leptospirosis, which lacks an adequate laboratory test, especially during the early stages of illness when antibiotic therapy is most effective. The researchers constructed a protein microarray chip comprising 61% of the Leptospira interrogans proteome and investigated the IgG response from 274 individuals, including 80 acute-phase, 80 convalescent-phase patients, and 114 healthy control subjects from regions with endemic, high endemic, and no endemic transmission of leptospirosis.

The study identified 16 antigens that can discriminate between acute cases and healthy individuals from a region with high endemic transmission of leptospirosis, and 18 antigens that distinguish convalescent cases. Some of the identified antigens, such as LipL32, the non-identical domains of the Lig proteins, GroEL, and Loa22, are already known to be recognized by sera from human patients, serving as proof-of-concept for the serodiagnostic antigen discovery approach. The study also identified novel antigens, including the hypothetical protein LIC10215, which showed good sensitivity and specificity rates for both acute- and convalescent-phase patients. These novel antigens may have potential use in the development of new tests and the improvement of currently available assays for diagnosing leptospirosis. Further research is needed to assess the utility of these antigens in more deployable diagnostic platforms.
Researchers investigated the role of melanization, a key immune response in insects, in the defense of mosquitoes against the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. Using the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae as a model, they found that melanization is triggered against all stages of B. bassiana, including conidia, germ tubes, and hyphae. However, melanization rarely aborts the growth of the fungus, and the mycelium continues to grow despite being melanized. Silencing key regulators of melanization, TEP1 and CLIPA8, abolished melanin formation on hyphae but not on germinating conidia or germ tubes. The study suggests that melanization of early fungal stages is a cell-mediated response, while late-stage melanization is a humoral response dependent on TEP1 and CLIPA8. Microscopic analysis revealed that TEP1 is associated with the surfaces of hyphae and that both TEP1 and CLIPA8 are required for recruiting phenoloxidase to these surfaces. Notably, fungal proliferation was more rapid in mosquitoes with silenced TEP1 and CLIPA8, which exhibited increased sensitivity to natural B. bassiana infections. These findings indicate that the mosquito melanization response significantly retards B. bassiana growth and dissemination, suggesting a potential target for designing transgenic fungi with enhanced bio-control activities against mosquitoes.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of four compounds, bafilomycin (BAF), mycophenolic acid (MPA), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), in blocking dengue virus (DENV) infection in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. These compounds are known to inhibit DENV host factors (HFs) in mammalian cells. The researchers tested the compounds using various treatment methods, including direct injection, ingestion through sugar feeding or blood feeding, and RNA interference (RNAi) to silence target genes.

The results showed that injection of BAF and MPA prior to feeding on virus-infected blood significantly reduced DENV titers in the mosquito midgut and salivary gland. Ingestion of BAF and MPA through a sugar meal or with an infectious blood meal also resulted in varying degrees of virus inhibition. RNAi-mediated silencing of vATPase subunit genes and the IMPDH gene reduced DENV infection, indicating that BAF- and MPA-mediated virus inhibition likely occurred through the inhibition of these DENV HFs.

The study found that the route and timing of BAF and MPA administration were crucial, and treatment after exposure to the virus diminished the antiviral effect of these compounds. The results provide proof-of-principle that chemical inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of DENV HFs, specifically vATPase and IMPDH, can be used to suppress DENV infection in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which may lead to a reduction in DENV transmission.
Researchers investigated the role of cell volume in the dynamics of seizure, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization. They developed a model that incorporates cell swelling, dynamic ion concentrations, and oxygen supply into the Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking dynamics. This model demonstrated the spontaneous transition between epileptic seizure and spreading depression states as the cell swells and contracts in response to changes in osmotic pressure. The study revealed a dynamical definition for the physiological ceiling that separates seizure from spreading depression, as well as a second ceiling that demarcates spreading depression from anoxic depolarization. The model highlights the neuroprotective role of glial K buffering against seizures and spreading depression, and provides novel insights into anoxic depolarization and the relevant cell swelling during ischemia. The researchers argue that the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane, which can be understood only when dynamic ion concentrations, oxygen homeostasis, and cell swelling in response to osmotic pressure are taken into consideration. The study demonstrates the feasibility of a unified framework for a wide range of neuronal behaviors, which may be of substantial importance in understanding and potentially developing universal intervention strategies for these pathological states.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the immune response to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a fungal pathogen that causes paracoccidioidomycosis, a prevalent disease in Latin America. They found that murine dendritic cells responded to P. brasiliensis infection by releasing the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which is essential for host defense against fungal infections. This response was dependent on the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), caspase-1, and the NLRP3 inflammasome. The researchers also discovered that P. brasiliensis-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation required potassium efflux, reactive oxygen species production, phagolysosomal acidification, and cathepsin B release. Furthermore, they demonstrated that IL-1β signaling plays a crucial role in killing P. brasiliensis by murine macrophages. The study suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome senses and responds to P. brasiliensis infection, highlighting its importance in host defense against this fungus. Future studies are needed to investigate the role of IL-1R1 and NLRP3 inflammasome components in protecting against P. brasiliensis infection in vivo and to determine how IL-1β activates macrophages for enhanced killing activity in vitro.
Toxoplasma gondii, a brain-tropic parasite, primarily infects neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) in vivo, despite its ability to infect various nucleated cells, including astrocytes, in vitro. Research suggests that neurons are persistently infected because they lack the ability to clear intracellular parasites. To investigate this theory, a novel Toxoplasma-mouse model was developed to track host cells interacting with parasites. The study found that Toxoplasma shows a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection, even in the presence of interferon-γ depletion, infection with parasites resistant to astrocyte clearance, or direct injection into the brain. These findings indicate that neurons are not incidentally infected, but rather are the primary target cells for Toxoplasma in vivo. The study used a Toxoplasma strain that injects Cre recombinase into host cells, allowing researchers to identify and track host cells interacting with parasites. The results show that neurons consistently make up the majority of GFP+ parenchymal CNS cells, regardless of time point or infecting strain. This research provides new insights into how Toxoplasma establishes a persistent brain infection and has implications for developing therapies to eliminate the parasite, which is estimated to chronically infect up to 1/3 of the world's population.
A free-boundary model of a motile cell has been developed to explain the turning behavior of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility. The model consists of the force-balance and myosin transport equations, which account for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion. The contraction generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow, which reinforces the contraction via myosin redistribution and causes retraction of the lamellipodial boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters the retraction, and the balance of protrusion and retraction shapes the lamellipodium.

The model analysis shows that initiation of motility critically depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, representing myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along either straight or circular trajectories, and the motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary. The contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in conditions where short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion cause an accumulation of myosin in a small region at the cell rear, destabilizing the axial symmetry of a moving cell.
Researchers have developed a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of interactions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks obtained from experimental studies. These networks are crucial for understanding complex biological processes, but they are often plagued by high levels of noise and incompleteness. For example, yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screens have a false positive rate of up to 64% and a false negative rate of 43-71%, while tandem affinity purification (TAP) experiments have comparable levels of noise.

The new technique uses a geometric graph model to de-noise PPI data sets by detecting false positives and false negatives. It achieves a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%, outperforming existing PPI network post-processing techniques. The method assigns confidence scores to physical protein-protein interactions in the human PPI network and predicts 251 new interactions, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

The researchers validated a statistically significant portion of the predicted interactions in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and the newer release of BioGRID. The data and Matlab code implementing the method are freely available online. This technique has the potential to guide future biological experiments and improve our understanding of PPI networks.
Researchers have developed a Drosophila (fruit fly) model to study myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a genetic disorder caused by non-coding CTG repeat expansions. The study aimed to investigate the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG repeat transcripts in disease pathogenesis. The results showed that co-expression of CTG and CAG expanded repeats in flies led to dramatically enhanced toxicity, accompanied by the generation of 21-nt triplet repeat-derived siRNAs. These small RNAs targeted the expression of CAG-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA binding protein (TBP), which bear long CAG repeats in both flies and humans. The findings suggest that the generation of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs may significantly contribute to the toxicity in human repeat expansion diseases where anti-sense transcription occurs. The study also demonstrated that non-coding, uninterrupted CTG repeats confer length-dependent toxicity when expressed in brain and muscle in flies, recapitulating key features of the human disease DM1. Furthermore, co-expression of expanded CAG repeat transcripts with CTG repeats resulted in enhanced toxicity, highlighting the potential role of bi-directional transcription in disease pathogenesis. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying trinucleotide repeat diseases and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
Researchers have re-examined the phylogeny and virulence of Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, a model soft rot pathogen isolated from a diseased potato stem in Finland in the early 1980s. Genomic analysis revealed that SCC3193, previously classified as Pectobacterium carotovorum, is more accurately classified as Pectobacterium wasabiae. This reclassification indicates that P. wasabiae has been present in potato fields worldwide, although it has gone unnoticed. The study identified novel virulence determinants of P. wasabiae, including the putative transcriptional regulator SirB, two partially redundant type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters (Vic1 and Vic2) containing predicted virulence genes. The absence of a type III secretion system, which contributes to virulence in other soft rot species, is a distinctive feature of P. wasabiae. Genome comparison also revealed other traits that may be related to life in planta or specific environmental conditions, such as a predicted benzoic acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase of eukaryotic origin. These findings suggest that soft rot bacteria have a reservoir of unknown traits that may be utilized during the poorly understood latent stage in planta. The study provides a solid basis for further investigation of the virulence, distribution, and phylogeny of soft rot bacteria and potentially other bacteria.
Researchers investigated how mitochondrial protein expression changes in response to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion, a condition linked to various human diseases. They used network analysis of gene expression data to examine the systemic alterations of mtDNA-depleted (ρ0) mitochondria. The study found that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks with distinct biological processes. Down-regulated proteins were involved in typical mitochondrial functions such as energy production, metabolism, and protein folding, while up-regulated proteins were responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport.

Comparing proteome and transcriptome data revealed that ρ0 cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. The results demonstrate that mt protein composition changed to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. This study provides a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions and highlights the importance of mt protein functional networks in understanding the biological implications of mt regulatory mechanisms under dysfunctional mt states.

The researchers used a data-integrative approach to select reliable mt proteins for network analysis, applying isotope-coded affinity tag (cICAT) quantitative analysis to compare protein abundances in mitochondria isolated from normal (ρ+) and mtDNA-depleted (ρ0) osteosarcoma cells. The results suggest that the expression control of mt proteins involved in different functional modules is regulated separately under dysfunctional mt states, allowing eukaryotic cells to monitor and respond to changes in mt conditions through alterations of nuclear gene expression.
Researchers have developed a method to deduce the kinetics of protein synthesis in living cells (in vivo) from measurements taken in a laboratory setting (in vitro). This method involves two key components: the kinetic distance, a new concept that quantitatively compares the kinetics of a multistep process in different environments, and a constrained minimization procedure that reproduces a known global property of the in-vivo process. The kinetic distance depends logarithmically on the transition rates and can be interpreted in terms of the underlying free energy barriers.

The method was applied to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a crucial process in gene expression. A codon-specific Markov model with three reaction pathways was used to describe the process, and individual transition rates were determined in vitro. The in-vivo rates were then predicted using the constrained minimization procedure and validated against three independent sets of in-vivo data: codon-dependent translation speeds, codon-specific translation dynamics, and missense error frequencies. The results showed good agreement between theory and experiment without adjusting any fit parameters.

The deduced in-vivo rates led to smaller error frequencies than the known in-vitro rates, primarily due to an improved initial selection of transfer RNA (tRNA). The method is computationally simple and can be applied to any biomolecular process with detailed information about the in-vitro kinetics.
Researchers studied the evolution of Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that infects humans, by analyzing DNA sequences from 97 isolates collected from 34 pairs of sequential samples and 29 individuals from 10 families over a period of 0.25 to 10.2 years. The study aimed to estimate the short-term rates of mutation and recombination in the bacteria. The results showed that the accumulation of genetic diversity increased over time in a clock-like manner in the sequential isolates. Using a statistical method called Approximate Bayesian Computation, the researchers estimated the rates of mutation, recombination, and other evolutionary processes.

The study found that the short-term mutation rate in Helicobacter pylori is between 1.4×10−6 and 4.5×10−6 per nucleotide per year, with recombination introducing three times as many substitutions as mutation. The researchers also estimated that the long-term mutation rate over millennia is 5-17 times lower due to the removal of non-synonymous mutations by purifying selection. This study provides a more accurate estimate of the short-term mutation rate in Helicobacter pylori compared to previous estimates, which were based on a universal molecular clock rate that is no longer accepted. The findings suggest that short-term mutation rates can vary significantly between different bacterial species, spanning several orders of magnitude.
Researchers have found that melanopsin, a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, plays a significant role in the thalamo-cortical visual system. These cells, known as mRGCs, are responsible for driving reflex light responses such as circadian photoentrainment and pupillomotor movements. However, their contribution to conventional visual pathways had not been directly assessed until now. Using new reporter lines, the study reveals that mRGC projections are more extensive than previously thought, extending across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. In mice lacking rods and cones, a model of advanced retinal degeneration, mRGCs support extensive physiological light responses in the dLGN and visual cortex. The study also shows that melanopsin input to the LGN supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of neurons. In mice with an intact visual system, chromatic stimuli isolated melanopsin-derived responses, revealing strong melanopsin input to approximately 40% of neurons in the LGN that show sustained activation to a light step. The findings suggest that melanopsin-based photoreception provides unique irradiance information and allows visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods and cones. The study identifies mRGCs as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception and indicates that they may support vision in people suffering retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection is associated with a significant depletion of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating the immune response to antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces. This study investigated whether the depletion of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected individuals affects the humoral response to microbial and food antigens. The results show that HIV-1-infected individuals have reduced IgG responses to antigens from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but not Bacteroidetes, in their systemic humoral responses. Additionally, intestinal secretions of HIV-1-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) exhibit elevated IgM levels and decreased IgA/IgM and IgG/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to various microbial and food antigens. This suggests that mucosal B cells in HIV-1-infected individuals have reduced competence for class switch recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their ability to respond to changing antigens in the gut lumen. The decreased availability of microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may contribute to the translocation of microbial antigens across the intestinal mucosal barrier and their systemic dissemination, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals. The study also found that HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4+ T cell counts have reduced levels of plasma IgG specific to antigens from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Overall, the findings indicate that the depletion of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected individuals leads to dysregulation of systemic and mucosal humoral responses, contributing to microbial translocation and chronic inflammation.
Researchers have proposed a new model to describe population dynamics in ecosystems where resources are limited. In this model, the growth of one population is balanced by the decline of others, leading to the emergence of "diversity waves." These waves occur when a dominant population collapses, freeing up resources for other species to grow. The model is relevant to communities of bacteria, where strain-specific collapses can be caused by invading bacteriophages, and other ecosystems where infectious diseases play a significant role.

The model shows that the population diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species abundances have a bimodal time-aggregated distribution, with a lower peak formed by recently collapsed or newly introduced species and an upper peak formed by species that have not yet collapsed. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term memory that is transmitted across several waves, resulting in a scale-free tail of the time-aggregated population distribution.

The model is robust to variations in parameters such as diffusion between multiple environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies. Simulations of the model preserve the general patterns of collapse-driven dynamics, including diversity waves and a broad time-aggregated distribution of population sizes with a scale-free tail. The model challenges the classic definition of fitness in terms of long-term exponential growth rate, as the long-term growth rate of each species is exactly zero.
Researchers have studied the chemotactic movement of Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria, to understand how it navigates its environment. Chemotaxis is the ability of bacteria to move towards or away from chemicals in their surroundings. E. coli uses a sensory system to detect changes in chemical concentrations and modulate its flagellar motors to reorient its movement. This process is thought to be the primary mechanism of chemotaxis in E. coli. However, a new study suggests that there may be an additional mechanism of gradient navigation in E. coli.

Using computer simulations, the researchers found that the degree of reorientation during a tumble, in addition to the probability of tumbling, depends on the swimming direction along the gradient. This fine-tuning of tumbling angle results in a significant enhancement of the cellular drift velocity along the gradient. The study suggests that this additional mechanism arises from the switching of several flagellar motors and a resulting fine-tuning of tumbling angle. This strategy is likely to be used by other peritrichously flagellated bacteria with similar chemotaxis behavior.

The researchers used a hybrid model of chemotactic E. coli to investigate the dependence of tumbling angle on the number of switching motors. They found that even a small difference in tumbling angles up and down the gradient significantly improves the chemotactic efficiency of E. coli. The study demonstrates a new level of optimization in E. coli chemotaxis, which arises from the switching of several flagellar motors and a resulting fine-tuning of tumbling angle.
Researchers have discovered that the Stat3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which are essential for establishing central tolerance in the immune system. mTECs express a diverse array of self-peptides that help eliminate autoreactive immune cells and promote the development of regulatory T cells. The study found that activation of the Stat3 pathway in mTEC precursors is necessary for their maturation and proliferation, leading to proper formation of the medullary region in the thymus. Experiments using a constitutively active Stat3 transgene targeted to the mTEC compartment showed increased mTEC cellularity and bypassed the need for signals from positively selected thymocytes to drive medullary region formation. Conversely, conditional deletion of Stat3 in mTECs disrupted medullary region architecture and reduced the number of mTECs. The study also found that Stat3 signaling promotes the survival of immature mTEC precursors, but does not affect their proliferation. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to the NFκB pathway, Stat3-mediated signals are essential for regulating mTEC cellularity and medullary region homeostasis. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Stat3 signaling in the development and maintenance of the thymic medullary compartment.
Researchers have identified 511 small noncoding RNA (sRNA) candidates in the human pathogen Clostridium difficile using an in silico approach. These sRNAs were found in both intergenic and coding regions of the genome. To validate these predictions, the researchers used RNA-seq and differential 5'-end RNA-seq to identify 251 putative regulatory sRNAs, including 94 potential trans-riboregulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. The expression of 35 sRNAs was confirmed through gene-specific experimental approaches. Some sRNAs showed growth phase-dependent expression profiles, and 16 predicted c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitches were found to regulate motility and biofilm formation. Additionally, the researchers detected abundant sRNAs encoded by multiple C. difficile CRISPR loci, which may be important for the bacterium's survival in bacteriophage-rich gut communities. This study provides the first experimental genome-wide identification of C. difficile sRNAs and sets the stage for future research on the molecular mechanisms of sRNA-based regulation of gene expression in this emergent enteropathogen. The discovery of novel sRNAs highlights the potential diversity of RNA-based mechanisms controlling key steps in the infection cycle of C. difficile.
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein has been found to downregulate the liver-specific microRNA miR-122 by promoting its destabilization through the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. miR-122 plays a crucial role in liver development and metabolism and is a key proviral factor for HCV. The decrease in miR-122 expression resulted in the dysregulation of its known functions, including its proviral activity for HCV. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies revealed that the 22-nucleotide prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3' end by 3'-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. These single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability compared to the 22-nt prototype miR-122. The HCV core protein specifically inhibited GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm was found to be responsible for miR-122 downregulation. This study provides new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation. The results also suggest that the HCV core protein affects multiple miRNAs in addition to miR-122 by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers.
Researchers have discovered evidence of acquired immunity to Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes disease in humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, in wild African lions. The study found a distinct peak and decrease in age prevalence of T. brucei infection in lions, which is consistent with an exposure-dependent increase in cross-immunity following infections with other trypanosome species, such as T. congolense. This cross-immunity allows lions to clear most infections of T. brucei by 3-5 years of age and eliminate all infections of T. brucei rhodesiense, the causative agent of human sleeping sickness, by 6 years of age. The findings suggest that frequent re-exposure to trypanosomes through tsetse bites accelerates the onset and extent of immunity, with prevalence being lowest in areas of high-tsetse exposure. This is the first epidemiological evidence of acquired immunity to trypanosomes in any host species, and it challenges the long-held assumption that immunity to trypanosomes is impossible. The study's results have significant implications for the development of vaccines against trypanosomiasis, a disease that has been difficult to combat due to the complex antigenic surface proteins of the parasites. The discovery of acquired immunity in lions provides a new perspective on existing data and future research in this field, particularly in regions where cattle act as a major reservoir of human infection, such as East Uganda.
Researchers used a mathematical model of the human coagulation cascade to identify sensitive mechanisms that could serve as therapeutic targets. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 published datasets generated from two different in vitro coagulation models. The model accurately simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation profiles in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across all trials. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. These findings are consistent with current therapeutic strategies, as anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants used to prevent venous thromboembolism and treat deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The results support the hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades can be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty. Further research is needed to refine the model and explore the robustness of fIX mechanisms using in vivo animal models or cell-based assays. The study demonstrates the potential of mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine and clinical development.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of bacteriophage-host interactions in an in vitro system using a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The study focused on Campylobacter jejuni, a food-borne pathogen, and a virulent phage that targets this bacterium. The goal was to understand the non-linear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions, which is crucial for the successful application of phage therapy. Phage therapy involves using bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents to control pathogenic bacteria.

The study found that phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni arose readily in the in vitro system. The researchers tested a simple model of phage-bacteria interactions against in vitro data and found that it fit the data surprisingly well. The model incorporated phage-insensitive or resistant bacteria and estimated the inundation and proliferation thresholds, which are important parameters for phage therapy. The study also revealed density-dependent features of phage infectivity that warrant further investigation.

The researchers emphasized the importance of developing a theoretical framework for understanding the non-linear kinetic properties of phages as "self-replicating pharmaceuticals." They believe that testing models of in vitro phage therapy is a necessary step in understanding how phage therapy can be applied in clinical and other in vivo settings. The study highlights the need for a threshold-based understanding of phage-bacteria interactions for phage therapy, as partially-resistant cells can lead to the resurgence of bacterial populations.
Researchers have identified a novel Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata, which plays a crucial role in the snail's immune response to the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. Schistosomiasis, caused by S. mansoni, affects over 260 million people worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The snail's immune response is essential for protecting against schistosome infection, but few specific snail immune factors have been identified and functionally characterized. This study provides the first functional report of a snail TLR, named BgTLR, which is involved in the cellular immune response of B. glabrata following challenge with S. mansoni. The study found that the S. mansoni-resistant strain of B. glabrata (BS-90) displayed higher levels of BgTLR compared to the susceptible (M-line) strain. Transcript expression of BgTLR was significantly increased in BS-90 snails when challenged with S. mansoni, whereas expression in susceptible M-line snails was not significantly increased. Knockdown of BgTLR in BS-90 snails via targeted siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in a significant alteration of the resistant phenotype, yielding patent infections in 43% of the normally resistant snails. This study demonstrates that BgTLR is an important snail immune receptor that influences infection outcome following S. mansoni challenge, providing new insights into the molecular basis of the interactions between schistosomes and their snail hosts.
Researchers have developed a new tool to assess human exposure to disease-carrying mosquitoes in the Pacific region. Aedes mosquitoes, specifically Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, transmit diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and Bancroftian filariasis. Current methods for measuring exposure to these mosquitoes are limited, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of vector control programs. To address this issue, the researchers created an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test to detect antibodies in human blood that are directed against proteins found in the saliva of Aedes mosquitoes. The test was conducted on human populations in Tahiti and Moorea, where both mosquito species are present, and on a cohort of people from metropolitan France who were not exposed to these mosquitoes. The results showed that 98% of individuals in Tahiti and 68% in Moorea had developed antibodies against Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis saliva, respectively. In contrast, only 3% of the metropolitan France cohort had antibodies against the saliva of either mosquito species. The study found no cross-reactivity between the two mosquito species, indicating that the antibody response is specific to each species. This new tool has the potential to enhance understanding of human exposure to mosquito bites, identify areas with high disease transmission risk, and evaluate the effectiveness of vector control strategies in the Pacific region and other tropical settings.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a highly successful pathogen that adapts to the intracellular environment of human macrophages. Research has shown that Mtb's pathogenicity is linked to its ability to regulate the metabolic machinery of the host cell. A study investigated how Mtb infection influences the metabolic pathways of the host macrophage by examining time-dependent changes in macrophage metabolism after infection with mycobacterial strains of varying virulence. The results confirmed that Mtb pathogenicity is closely tied to its capacity to regulate host cell metabolism, with significant implications for disease pathology.

The study found that Mtb targets a core subset of host metabolic reactions, integrating pathways that promote macrophage survival with those that support mycobacterial sustenance. This integration of host and pathogen-derived factors defines the determinants of pathogenicity. Notably, the study revealed that the glycemic status of an individual contributes to pathogenicity by influencing macrophage apoptosis, in addition to compromising immunity in hyperglycemic individuals.

The findings suggest that metabolic intervention plays a crucial role in determining the pathology of tuberculosis (TB). This challenges existing paradigms for understanding Mtb pathogenicity, which have primarily focused on host immunity as a determinant of disease susceptibility. The study's results support revisiting these paradigms and highlight the importance of considering metabolic factors in the development of effective treatments and vaccines against TB.
Researchers have investigated the role of ZHP-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the budding yeast ZIP3 gene, in meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation. ZHP-3 is required for crossover recombination, a process that ensures proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division. The protein's localization is dynamic, shifting from along the synaptonemal complex (SC) to asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually to foci marking crossover recombination events. A ZHP-3::GFP transgene partially complements a null mutation, promoting nearly wild-type levels of recombination but resulting in high aneuploidy among progeny, indicating defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. The structure of bivalents is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting an inability to properly remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. The smo-1 mutant exhibits similar phenotypes at higher temperatures, and smo-1; zhp-3::gfp double mutants exhibit more severe meiotic defects, consistent with a role for SUMO in SC disassembly and bivalent differentiation. The study proposes that coordination of crossover recombination with SC disassembly and bivalent formation reflects a conserved role of Zip3/ZHP-3 in coupling recombination with SC morphogenesis. ZHP-3 is the first protein known to mark crossovers in C. elegans, providing a valuable tool for analyzing meiotic events in this organism.
Aedes albopictus, a tropical mosquito species, has become a public health concern in temperate regions of Europe and the US due to its ability to transmit exotic arboviruses and cause nuisance problems. This study investigated the effects of eco-climatic factors on the abundance and dynamics of Aedes albopictus in metropolitan and suburban/rural areas in Rome, Italy, which is one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe. Longitudinal adult monitoring was conducted along a 70 km transect across and beyond the metropolitan area, and two fine-scale spatiotemporal datasets were analyzed to examine the impact of climatic and socio-environmental variables on Aedes albopictus abundance and dynamics.

The results showed that highly anthropized habitats were associated with high adult abundance in both metropolitan and suburban/rural areas, with "small green islands" corresponding to hotspots of abundance in metropolitan areas only. A bimodal seasonal dynamics was observed, with a second peak of abundance in autumn due to heavy rains and permissive temperatures. The study found that an increase in vegetation cover was negatively associated with mosquito abundance in both environments. The results suggest that public mosquito control measures should be prioritized in temperate urban areas where nuisance, human-mosquito contact, and risk of local arbovirus transmission are higher, and highlight potential public health risks after the summer months typically associated with high mosquito densities.
Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM) are major virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that play a crucial role in the early step of infection when the bacterium encounters host macrophages. Research has shown that DIM participate in the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb and the prevention of phagosomal acidification. Studies using Mtb mutants deleted for genes involved in DIM biosynthesis demonstrated that DIM are essential for the efficient phagocytosis of Mtb by macrophages. The effects of DIM require a state of membrane fluidity, as experiments with cholesterol-depleting drugs abolished the differences in phagocytosis efficiency and phagosome acidification between wild-type and mutant strains. The insertion of a new cholesterol-pyrene probe in living cells showed that the polarity of the membrane hydrophobic core changes upon contact with Mtb, and this effect is dependent on DIM. This suggests that DIM control the invasion of macrophages by Mtb by targeting lipid organization in the host membrane, thereby modifying its biophysical properties. The DIM-induced changes in lipid ordering favor the efficiency of receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Mtb and contribute to the control of phagosomal pH, creating a protective niche for the bacterium.
Researchers have found that mean-field approximations, a common tool for studying large neural networks, do not accurately describe the behavior of small neural networks composed of a few tens of neurons. This limitation hinders the understanding of neural dynamics at intermediate scales. To address this gap, the authors developed a systematic analysis of the dynamics of small networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. They studied the local bifurcations of neural activity using an analytically tractable approach and numerically determined the global bifurcations. The results show that strong inhibition in these networks leads to complex dynamics, characterized by the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations through spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This phenomenon reveals qualitative differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. A key consequence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking is the ability of mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, which is thought to help reduce the detrimental effects of noise correlations on cortical information processing. The authors' approach provides a novel methodology for studying the dynamics of small neural networks, which is essential for understanding neural behavior at intermediate scales.
Researchers investigated the presence and viability of Leishmania parasites in extralesional sites, such as blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin, of patients with dermal leishmaniasis. They used a specific RNA target, Leishmania 7SLRNA, to determine parasite viability and estimate burden in these sites. The study found that viable Leishmania parasites were present in extralesional tissues, including blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin, in 100% of patients with detectable Leishmania DNA in these tissues. Quantitative PCR of Leishmania 7SLRNA genes and transcripts confirmed the presence of live parasites in 73% of patients. The study also showed that the number of 7SLRNA transcripts correlated with the number of viable Leishmania parasites, indicating that this target can be used to diagnose and monitor the status of infection. The researchers detected 7SLRNA transcripts in 68% of monocyte samples, 42% of tonsil swabs, and 36% of normal skin aspirates, and quantifiable genes in 79% of monocyte samples, 92% of tonsil swabs, and 73% of normal skin aspirates. These findings suggest that Leishmania 7SLRNA is an informative target for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of human leishmaniasis, allowing for the detection and quantification of parasites in extralesional tissues.
Researchers investigated the relationship between chromatin features and DNA replication timing in Drosophila using a comprehensive dataset of 95 chromatin-binding proteins (CBPs) and histone modifications (HMs). They found that combinations of CBPs and pairwise interactions between HMs can accurately predict DNA replication timing genome-wide and across different cell types. The study suggests that combinatorial patterns of HMs contribute to the regulation of DNA replication timing.

The researchers developed a quantitative model that uses linear combinations of chromatin features to predict replication timing with high accuracy. They found that combinations of HMs and their pairwise interactions are key to achieving accurate predictions. The model was trained on a dataset of 7552 unique promoters in Drosophila S2 cells and was able to predict replication timing with 80% accuracy using six model terms.

The study provides evidence for the existence of combinatorial HM patterns for DNA replication and identifies key elements that contribute to this process. The findings suggest that the relationship between chromatin features and DNA replication timing is cell-type independent, and that pairwise combinations of HMs can predict differential DNA replication timing across different cell types. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of DNA replication and highlights the importance of combinatorial patterns of HMs in this process.
Researchers investigated the spread of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 in Brazil using genetic and epidemiological data. The study found that new lineages of these serotypes were introduced to Brazil approximately every 7 to 10 years, with the Caribbean region being the primary source of these introductions. The virus then dispersed throughout the country at a rate of approximately 0.5 kilometers per day.

The study used a statistical framework to analyze complete genome sequences of the virus and found that aerial transportation of humans and/or mosquitoes, rather than the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito or geographical distances, was the primary driver of dengue virus spread in Brazil. This conclusion was supported by joint analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological, and ecological data.

The researchers used a combination of genetic and epidemiological data to characterize the introduction, establishment, and drivers of dengue virus spread in Brazil. They found that distinct introductions and co-circulation of distinct serotypes and genotypes occurred, with periodic dengue serotype-specific peaks in incidence coinciding with the introduction of new lineages in Brazil every 7 to 10 years.

The study's findings suggest that air travel plays a significant role in the spread of dengue virus within Brazil, and that the introduction of new lineages is followed by epizootic amplifications. However, the study also notes that caution is needed when making predictions about viral emergence, as new lineages from outside the Americas can be introduced to Brazil due to chance importation events.
Researchers investigated how differences in the organization of receptive fields (RFs) across three parallel sensory maps in weakly electric fish influence correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. Receptive fields are the areas of sensory space within which stimuli cause a neural response. The team used a combination of mathematical modeling and in vivo electrophysiology to study the correlations between pyramidal neuron activities across the three maps. Contrary to their initial predictions, the researchers found that the average levels of correlation between pyramidal neuron activities were nearly identical across all three segments. To explain this result, they considered the effects of the antagonistic center-surround organization of RFs, where the center of the RF is excited by stimuli and the surround is inhibited. By including and systematically varying the size and gain of the RF surround in their model, the researchers found that different combinations of RF center-surround balance gave rise to nearly identical correlations between pyramidal neuron activities. Further simulations showed that the sign and magnitude of correlations were largely determined by the relative strength of positively and negatively correlated inputs. These findings suggest that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations, which has important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity.
Researchers investigated how noise correlations between sensory neurons impact the population's ability to encode a stimulus. They considered a general setting for population coding, where neural tuning curves and other aspects of the problem were held fixed. The study yielded unifying insights into the role of noise correlations, summarized in the form of theorems and illustrated with numerical examples involving neurons with diverse tuning curves.

The researchers generalized previous results to prove the sign rule (SR), which states that if noise correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs compared to their signal correlations, coding performance will improve compared to the independent case. This holds for three different metrics of coding performance and for arbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity.

However, the SR does not provide a necessary condition for good coding. The study showed that a diverse set of correlation structures can improve coding, many of which violate the SR and are consistent with experimentally observed correlations. The optimal correlation structures must lie on the boundaries of the possible set of noise correlations.

The researchers also provided a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which the coding performance in the presence of noise will be as good as it would be if there were no noise present at all. These conditions are satisfied with high probability for large populations, and the set of such correlation matrices is very high-dimensional.
Research has shown that chronic coinfections of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa often fail to respond to antibiotic treatment, leading to significant patient morbidity and mortality. To understand the impact of interspecies interaction on S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility, a study investigated the effects of P. aeruginosa exoproducts on S. aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics. The study used a panel of P. aeruginosa burn wound and cystic fibrosis (CF) lung isolates to demonstrate that P. aeruginosa alters S. aureus susceptibility to antibiotics in a variable, strain-dependent manner. The researchers identified three independent interactions responsible for antagonizing or potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus: P. aeruginosa LasA endopeptidase, which potentiates lysis of S. aureus by vancomycin; rhamnolipids, which facilitate proton-motive force-independent tobramycin uptake; and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO), which induces multidrug tolerance in S. aureus through respiratory inhibition and reduction of cellular ATP. The production of these factors varies between clinical isolates and corresponds to the capacity of each isolate to alter S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility. The study also demonstrated that vancomycin treatment of a S. aureus mouse burn infection is potentiated by the presence of a LasA-producing P. aeruginosa population. These findings highlight the complexity of antibiotic susceptibility, which depends not only on the genotype of the pathogen being targeted but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the infection environment.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection is associated with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of platelet clearance in DENV infection and found that the binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to platelets and the removal of sialic acid (desialylation) contribute to thrombocytopenia. Two observational cohort studies in Indonesia showed that adult patients with DENV had higher plasma concentrations of VWF antigen and active VWF, and circulating platelets had bound more VWF to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. Additionally, sialic acid levels in DENV patients were significantly reduced, as assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL-II) to platelets. The neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation. The study demonstrates that excessive binding of VWF to platelets in DENV results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance. The findings suggest that oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in DENV infection.
Researchers have identified a new regulatory mechanism in the human genome, known as bidirectional promoters, which are regions of DNA that control the expression of adjacent genes. These promoters are often associated with genes involved in DNA repair and have the potential to play a role in cancer development. A comprehensive analysis of spliced-expressed sequence tags (ESTs) revealed a large collection of human transcripts under the control of bidirectional promoters, many of which function as alternative promoters or regulate novel transcripts. The study found a significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancer, including breast and ovarian cancers.

Using microarray expression data from 79 human tissues, the researchers verified regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters. They identified subsets of these promoters that contain similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor binding sites in ERBB2, FANCD2, and BRCA2. These findings suggest that bidirectional promoters may regulate co-expression patterns among groups of genes, including those involved in cancer. The study highlights the importance of understanding the regulation of genes involved in co-expression networks, particularly those involved in cancer, to define molecular events that contribute to disease. The results also suggest that misregulation of bidirectional promoters, especially those containing common transcription factor binding sites, may play a role in cancer development.
Researchers have discovered a significant diversity of sex chromosome configurations in Diptera, the order of flies that includes Drosophila melanogaster, a widely used model organism. While most Diptera have XY sex chromosomes and a conserved karyotype, a whole-genome analysis of 37 fly species from 22 different families revealed over a dozen different sex chromosome configurations. The small dot chromosome, which is part of the conserved karyotype, is used as a sex chromosome in many species, suggesting it may be the ancestral sex chromosome of higher Diptera. However, other species have undifferentiated sex chromosomes, or use a different chromosome as the sex chromosome, or have up to three chromosomal elements incorporated into the sex chromosomes. Some species even have female heterogamety, with ZW sex chromosomes. Transcriptome analysis showed that dosage compensation, which balances gene expression between males and females, has evolved multiple times in flies, often through up-regulation of the single X chromosome in males. The X chromosomes generally lack genes with male-biased expression, possibly due to sex-specific selective pressures. This diversity of sex chromosome configurations in Diptera provides a rich resource for studying sex chromosome biology in a comparative manner. The findings suggest that similar selective forces have shaped the unique evolution of sex chromosomes in diverse fly taxa. Future studies of high-quality genomes and transcriptomes of fly species with independently formed sex chromosomes may reveal the underlying mutational routes by which X chromosomes have become demasculinized repeatedly across flies.
Researchers investigated the link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and microcephaly in babies born in Hawaii between 2009 and 2012. They analyzed blood samples from six mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 mothers who gave birth to healthy babies. The samples were tested for the presence of ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA kit. The results showed that one mother who delivered a baby with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody (16.6%), and three mothers tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody (50%). The study found a trend towards significance between ZIKV infection and microcephaly, with ZIKV IgG antibody-positive mothers being more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than those who were negative for ZIKV IgG antibodies (odds ratio = 11.0, 95% confidence interval = 0.8-147.9, p = 0.083). Similarly, ZIKV IgM antibody-positive mothers were also more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than those who were negative for ZIKV IgM antibody (odds ratio = 6.8, 95% confidence interval = 0.2-195.1, p = 0.333). These findings provide further evidence of a link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly and suggest that ZIKV-positive cases and associated microcephaly may have occurred in the United States as early as 2009.
Researchers conducted a study in the Ashanti region of Ghana to investigate the source of Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infections, which cause Buruli ulcer (BU). Although previous studies have linked MU infections to slow-moving water bodies, the exact mode of transmission remains unclear. The study used Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) typing to differentiate MU strains from other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria (MPM) and to determine the genetic relatedness of clinical and environmental isolates. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four BU-endemic communities, and VNTR profiles were compared to those from 14 confirmed BU patients in the same area.

The study found that MU was present in three types of water bodies, with significantly higher levels in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes (W, X, Y, and Z) were typed in both human and environmental samples, while other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping identified a mouse with a lesion characteristic of BU, which was confirmed as an MU infection. The findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community-associated water bodies, and that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. The study's results indicate that M. ulcerans transmission may involve multiple routes, including contact with risk environments and water bodies that act as vehicles for disseminating strains.
Researchers analyzed a comprehensive database of 27,723 distribution records for 971 alien bird species worldwide to investigate the global distribution and drivers of alien bird species richness. The study found that the locations of origin and introduction of alien birds, and their identities, were initially driven by European (mainly British) colonialism. However, recent introductions involve more species and countries, and are driven in part by increasing economic activity. The researchers discovered that alien bird species richness is currently highest at midlatitudes and is strongly determined by anthropogenic effects, particularly the number of species introduced, known as "colonisation pressure." Environmental drivers also play a significant role, with native and alien species richness being strongly and consistently positively associated. The study demonstrates that colonisation pressure is key to understanding alien species richness and shows that areas of high native species richness are not resistant to colonisation by alien species at the global scale. The findings highlight the ongoing threats to global environments from introductions of species. The researchers used a combination of abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic variables to identify the determinants of alien species richness and found that both human and biotic factors influence global patterns of alien species richness in birds.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a multi-HMGB-box protein that plays a crucial role in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes by RNA polymerase I (RPI/PolI). Previous studies have shown that UBF is essential for the recruitment of the pre-initiation complex SL1/TIF1B to the RPI promoter, but its role in RPI transcription has been questioned due to its poor DNA sequence selectivity and ability to form nucleosome-like nucleoprotein complexes. Using conditional deletion in mouse, researchers have now demonstrated that UBF is essential for embryo development beyond the morula stage and for the transcription of rRNA genes in cell cultures. UBF defines the active chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences, and its loss prevents the formation of the SL1/TIF1B pre-initiation complex and the recruitment of the RPI-Rrn3/TIF1A complex. The absence of UBF also leads to the formation of a large sub-nuclear structure resembling the nucleolar precursor body (NPB) of oocytes and early embryos, which contains rRNA synthesis and processing factors but does not associate with the rRNA gene loci. Unexpectedly, the loss of UBF does not suppress the transcription of other genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that rRNA gene activity does not coordinate global gene expression for ribosome biogenesis.
Researchers have re-examined the role of Wingless/Wnt signaling in tissue patterning, specifically in the adult Drosophila intestine. Contrary to the conventional model, which suggests that Wingless secretion and movement are essential for long-range signaling, the study found that a membrane-tethered form of Wingless can produce viable adults with largely normal external morphology. However, when Wingless is tethered in the adult intestine, several critical processes are disrupted, including regulation of target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling crosstalk with the Decapentaplegic pathway. These findings suggest that the direct, long-range action of Wingless is necessary for tissue patterning in the adult intestine. The study highlights the importance of Wingless signaling gradients in demarcating major boundaries between compartments in the adult gut. The results provide new evidence supporting the requirement for the direct, long-range action of Wingless in tissue patterning, with implications for animal development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. The study's findings may also be relevant to the mammalian intestine, which is similarly divided into distinct compartments and relies on Wnt expression for regionalization.
Researchers investigated the role of the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in invasive Group A streptococcal (GAS) infection, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. They found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and subsequent invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of a source of host plasminogen activators, streptokinase (Ska) was required to facilitate cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of Ska, host activators were sufficient to promote cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS strain 5448 during incubation with plasminogen or human plasma. Furthermore, GAS were able to mediate a significant increase in the activation of zymogen pro-uPA in human plasma. To assess the contribution of uPA to invasive GAS disease, a previously undescribed transgenic mouse model of infection was employed. Both C57/black 6J and AlbPLG1 mice expressing the human plasminogen transgene were significantly more susceptible to invasive GAS disease than uPA−/− mice. The observed decrease in virulence in uPA−/− mice was found to correlate directly with a decrease in bacterial dissemination and reduced cell surface plasmin accumulation by GAS. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of GAS pathogenesis and research aimed at therapeutic targeting of plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of type IV secretion system (T4SS) components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host cell interface. The cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) encodes components of the T4SS that translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. CagL, CagI, and CagH are specialized components of the cag T4SS that bind the host receptor α5β1 integrin and are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag PAI. These proteins are detectable on the bacterial surface and are required for CagA translocation into host cells and H. pylori-induced IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells. Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that these proteins are involved in the formation of pili at the interface between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif is present in CagH, CagI, and CagL, and deletion of these motifs results in abrogation of CagA translocation and IL-8 induction, and the C-terminal motifs of CagI and CagL are required for formation of pili. The results indicate that CagH, CagI, and CagL are components of a T4SS subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis, and highlight the important role played by unique constituents of the H. pylori cag T4SS.
Researchers conducted a study to identify potential biomarkers for protection against bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis, in cattle. They vaccinated calves with BCG or a heterologous BCG prime-adenovirally vectored subunit boosting protocol and challenged them with M. bovis. The team analyzed the global gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected, and unvaccinated control cattle using RNA sequencing. The results showed that 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected cattle compared to vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle. The most significant pathway related to this dataset was cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, with interleukin-22 (IL-22) expression identified as a dominant surrogate of protection, alongside interferon-gamma (INF-γ). The importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy was further confirmed by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG-vaccinated and unvaccinated calves. These findings suggest that IL-22 plays a crucial role in protection against bTB and could be a useful biomarker for predicting vaccine efficacy. This study contributes to the development of a cattle vaccine against bTB and highlights the potential of IL-22 as a predictive biomarker for vaccine success.
Researchers investigated the role of essential centrosome components, γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) and AIR-1/Aurora A, in regulating microtubule organization and dynamics at non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs) in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. Using a tissue-specific degradation system, they found that GIP-1/GCP3, a core component of γ-TuRC, is required to recruit other γ-TuRC components, including MZT-1, to the apical ncMTOC. In contrast, AIR-1 and MZT-1 were specifically required to recruit γ-TuRC to the centrosome, but not to centrioles or the apical ncMTOC. Surprisingly, microtubules remained robustly organized at the apical ncMTOC upon γ-TuRC and AIR-1 co-depletion, and upon depletion of other known microtubule regulators. However, loss of GIP-1 removed a subset of dynamic microtubules, and the remaining dynamic microtubules grew faster. These results suggest that different microtubule organizing centers use discrete proteins for their function, and that the apical ncMTOC is composed of distinct populations of γ-TuRC-dependent and -independent microtubules that compete for a limited pool of resources.
Researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes, which involves determining the parental origin of genetic variants in an individual's DNA. Most human sequencing initiatives do not phase the genome, as it is a complex and costly process. The study used the "Genome-In-A-Bottle" (GIAB) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a gold standard to evaluate the performance of the 11 approaches. The methods included laboratory-based assays that prepare DNA in unique ways to facilitate phasing and computational approaches that reconstruct phase information from sequencing reads and population-level haplotype frequency information.

The study found that a hybrid or combined approach that leverages population-based phasing, genome-wide sequencing read data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. The inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors. The study also identified DNA sequence signatures associated with genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, which include regions of low polymorphism or single nucleotide variant (SNV) density. The results suggest that hybrid computational approaches to phasing a single genome are accurate and cost-effective, and exhibit a performance that nearly matches or surpasses laboratory-based approaches.
Researchers have investigated the role of ATPase activity in the type-III protein secretion system of Salmonella enterica, a gram-negative pathogen. This system is responsible for secreting building blocks of the bacterial flagellum, virulence effectors into host cells, and structural subunits of the needle complex. The flagellar type-III secretion apparatus typically utilizes both the energy of the proton motive force and ATP hydrolysis to energize substrate unfolding and translocation. However, the study found that functional flagella can form in the absence of type-III ATPase activity. This was achieved by increasing the proton motive force and flagellar substrate levels, which bypassed the requirement for the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 virulence-associated type-III ATPase. The results suggest that ATPase activity is not essential for protein export via type-III secretion systems, but rather enhances secretion efficiency under limited secretion substrate concentrations. The study proposes that the function of the T3SS-associated ATPase complex is to deliver secretion substrates to the export apparatus and ensure efficient substrate unfolding. The findings have implications for the evolution of the bacterial flagellum and type-III secretion systems, and demonstrate the dispensability of ATPase activity in the type-III protein export process.
Researchers investigated the emergence of switch-like behavior in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using chemical reaction network theory. They analyzed over 40,000 simple networks consisting of two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins, assuming only basic biochemical processes. The study found that approximately 90% of these networks can exhibit bistability, which is the ability to switch between two stable states. This is a significant finding, as bistability plays a crucial role in various biological functions, including cellular differentiation and cell cycle control.

The researchers identified 36,771 bistable GRN architectures, including 11 minimal bistable networks that do not contain smaller bistable subnetworks. These minimal networks are the building blocks for the entire two-gene bistable network family. The study also found that 36% of the networks are bistable for at least some sets of network parameters, 9% have the capacity for multiple steady states, and 6.5% are monostable regardless of the network parameters.

The researchers used a systematic approach to identify bistable networks, which can be applied to real biological systems. They integrated publicly available data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion. The study suggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. The findings provide powerful hypotheses for further experimentation and can be used to provide guidance or functional context to any system for which the necessary interaction data is available.
Researchers have identified a new genetic cause of orofacial clefting, a common birth defect, in humans and mice. Mutations in the HYAL2 gene, which encodes the enzyme hyaluronidase 2, were found to be responsible for the condition. Hyaluronidase 2 degrades extracellular hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. The mutations in the HYAL2 gene lead to reduced levels of the enzyme, resulting in craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate, in both humans and mice. Additionally, cor triatriatum sinister, a rare heart defect, and hearing loss were also observed in affected individuals and mice. The study highlights the importance of hyaluronidase enzymes in human and mouse development and reveals a previously unrecognized pathway involved in the pathogenesis of orofacial clefting, myopia, and cor triatriatum sinister. The findings demonstrate that a deficiency of the HA-degrading enzyme HYAL2 is a novel cause of syndromic orofacial clefting in humans and submucosal cleft palate in mice, and define the first molecular explanation for cor triatriatum sinister in humans. The study provides evidence of the importance of HYAL2 for normal heart development in humans and mice, and identifies mutation of HYAL2 as the first described molecular mechanism for cor triatriatum sinister in humans.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism for the regeneration of mechanosensory tip links in auditory hair cells, which are crucial for sound detection in the inner ear. These tip links, composed of proteins protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), connect stereocilia and convey force to unidentified transduction channels. Current models suggest a static composition of the tip link, with PCDH15 at the lower end and CDH23 at the upper end. However, this study reveals that functional tip links have at least two molecular compositions, containing either PCDH15/CDH23 or PCDH15/PCDH15.

During regeneration, shorter tip links with nearly equal amounts of PCDH15 at both ends appear first and mediate mechanotransduction currents, but with abnormal calcium-dependent decay. The mature PCDH15/CDH23 tip link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation. This two-step molecular remodeling process may underlie the formation of tip links in the developing hair bundle, their turnover in the mature bundle, and their regeneration after intense acoustical stimulation. The study used a novel implementation of backscatter electron scanning microscopy to visualize the tip links and their components. The findings provide a molecular mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells and could help identify elusive components of the mechanotransduction machinery.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the changes in serum metabolites in adult patients with severe dengue (DHF) during the critical and recovery phases of the infection. Dengue virus (DENV) causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The study used mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling to analyze sera from adult DF and DHF patients at the critical phase (5-7 days after onset of fever) and recovery phase (21-28 days after onset of fever). The results showed 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF patients at the critical phase, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were found to be significantly higher in DHF patients, suggesting liver injury, while uric acid levels were lower in DHF patients, indicating decreased antioxidant capacity and increased oxidative stress. In the recovery phase, eight metabolites remained significantly altered in DHF patients, including chenodeoxyglycocholic acid, a bile acid associated with liver injury. The study identified altered metabolic pathways linked to DHF in both the critical and recovery phases of dengue infection, providing insights into the mechanisms of DHF pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for dengue management.
Researchers have identified and characterized the guanosine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) enzyme in Trypanosoma brucei, a parasitic protozoan that causes African trypanosomiasis. GMPR plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of purine nucleotides within the cell by converting guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) to inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). The study found that the GMPR protein in T. brucei is distinct from its host animal counterparts, with a unique insertion of a cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain. This domain is absent in mammalian and bacterial GMPRs. The recombinant T. brucei GMPR enzyme was found to have different affinities for GMP and NADPH compared to mammalian GMPRs. Additionally, the addition of monovalent cations such as potassium (K+) and ammonium (NH4+) increased the activity of T. brucei GMPR, whereas mammalian GMPRs were not affected. The study also found that the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin inhibited T. brucei GMPR activity, but had little to no effect on mammalian GMPRs. These findings suggest that the mechanism of GMPR in T. brucei is distinct from that in its host organisms. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that ribavirin inhibited the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis.
Researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to study how two drugs, benzocaine and phenytoin, interact with a bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel called NavAb. Sodium channels play a crucial role in controlling electrical excitability in cells, and blocking them can be used to treat conditions such as epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia. To develop more targeted treatments, it is essential to understand how current channel blockers work.

The study used the recently determined crystal structure of NavAb to simulate how benzocaine and phenytoin bind to the protein and enter the channel. The results suggest that both drugs have two likely binding sites within the pore, characterized by non-specific, hydrophobic interactions. One site is located just above the activation gate, and the other is at the entrance to the lateral lipid-filled fenestrations.

The simulations indicate that both drugs can pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with minimal energy barriers, supporting the idea of a hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs. The study highlights the importance of specific residues in directing drugs into and through the fenestration, and in forming the drug binding sites. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanism of action of sodium channel inhibitors and can inform the development of more targeted and effective treatments for various conditions.
Researchers investigated the role of MyD88 signaling in specific cell types during intestinal infection with the pathogen C. rodentium. MyD88 is a key mediator of the immune response, and its deficiency has been linked to increased susceptibility to various bacterial infections. To understand the cell type-specific contribution of MyD88, the researchers used a novel mouse model that allows for the reactivation of functional MyD88 expression in specific cell types. They found that MyD88 signaling in dendritic cells (DCs) was sufficient to activate the early group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) response and the development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells in response to C. rodentium infection. In contrast, restricting MyD88 signaling to other cell types, such as macrophages, T cells, or ILC3, did not induce efficient intestinal immune responses. However, the researchers also observed that MyD88 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) partially protected mice during intestinal infection, associated with enhanced epithelial barrier integrity and increased expression of antimicrobial peptides and acute phase proteins. These findings suggest that MyD88 signaling in DCs and IECs is essential and sufficient to induce a full spectrum of host responses upon intestinal infection with C. rodentium.
Onchocerciasis, a disease caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin. An immunodiagnostic test detecting human IgG4 antibodies to the Onchocerca volvulus-specific antigen Ov16 is used to determine whether transmission is interrupted and mass treatment can stop. A mathematical model, ONCHOSIM, was extended to explore the relationship between post-MDA Ov16 antibody prevalence in children and the duration and coverage of MDA, microfilaria (mf) prevalence in the population, and the probability of onchocerciasis elimination.

The study found that yearly repeated MDA leads to a strong reduction in parasite acquisition rate in humans, reducing seroconversion rates in newborns and young children. Both mf prevalence in the population aged 5 years and above and Ov16 antibody prevalence in children under 10 declined with increasing duration of MDA. However, the association between these indicators and the model-predicted probability of elimination was influenced by baseline endemicity levels, assumptions regarding the trigger of seroconversion, and diagnostic test characteristics.

The study suggests that understanding the dynamics of Ov16 antibody responses is crucial for accurate interpretation of seroprevalence data and precise estimation of the endpoint for MDA. The results indicate that the endpoint will depend on baseline endemicity levels, which should be taken into account in guidelines for defining when to stop MDA.
Researchers investigated how prions, misfolded proteins that can cause disease, adapt to their environment and develop resistance to drugs. They found that when prions were propagated in the presence of an inhibitory drug, swainsonine, in certain cell lines, they became resistant to the drug and in some cases, even dependent on it for propagation. This means that the prions grew more rapidly in the presence of the drug. The researchers also discovered that the misfolded prion protein associated with the drug-dependent variant was less rapidly cleared from cells than its drug-sensitive counterpart, suggesting that structural differences in the protein underlie the properties of the prions.

The study used two types of prions, 22L and RML, and found that while 22L prions were naturally resistant to swainsonine, RML prions were sensitive to the drug. However, when RML prions were propagated in the presence of swainsonine in certain cell lines, they became resistant to the drug. The researchers propose that prion populations are quasi-species, consisting of a major conformer and multiple variants that are constantly selected against and replenished by mutation.

The study suggests that the ability of prions to adapt to their environment and develop resistance to drugs is due to conformational changes in the misfolded prion protein. The findings have implications for the development of treatments for prion diseases, as they suggest that the use of inhibitory drugs may not only select for drug-resistant prions but also for stable variants that propagate more efficiently in the presence of the drug.
Researchers conducted an exhaustive analysis of a genotype space comprising 1015 central carbon metabolisms to understand the potential for metabolic innovation. They mapped all possible subsets of 51 reactions in central carbon metabolism and predicted the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 1024 potential metabolic phenotypes. The study found that viable metabolisms with any one phenotype form a single network of genotypes that can be reached from each other through a series of single reaction changes. This suggests that metabolisms with novel phenotypes, viable on new carbon sources, can be reached through one or few genotypic changes.

The researchers also analyzed the neighborhoods of different metabolisms viable on the same carbon source and found that they contain different novel phenotypes. The location of a viable metabolism in metabolic genotype space determines which novel phenotypes are accessible. By sampling 1000 pairs of metabolisms with n reactions and viable on a given carbon source, the study found that most or all such metabolisms reside in a single connected genotype network.

The analysis was extended to metabolisms viable on some number k > 1 of carbon sources. The researchers sampled 1000 metabolisms of a given size from each of the distinct genotype networks viable on different carbon sources and found that multiple distinct novel phenotypes exist in the neighborhood of a given metabolism. The study suggests that increasing metabolic complexity enhances the potential for both evolutionary conservation and evolutionary innovation.
Researchers analyzed the genetic variation and phylogeography of the Triatoma dimidiata complex, a group of insects that transmit the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. The study focused on the Mexican Neotropics and found that the lowest genetic diversity of T. dimidiata occurs in areas with high levels of human modification, where T. cruzi infection prevalence is also highest. The researchers identified three main haplogroups of T. dimidiata, with significant differences in Trypanosoma cruzi infection prevalence and Discrete Typing Unit (DTU) specificity among them. Haplogroups 1 and 3 had higher T. cruzi infection prevalence than expected, while haplogroup 2 had lower prevalence. The study also found that haplogroups 1 and 3 had different DTU infection frequencies, while haplogroup 2 had no difference. The researchers estimated that the T. dimidiata complex diverged from its most recent common ancestor around 0.97-0.85 million years ago, with primary divergence of haplogroups 2 and 3. The study suggests that the complex originated in the region surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus, which is a biogeographic barrier that has separated many species for millions of years. The findings have implications for vector control programs, as haplogroup 1 has expanding populations in Mexico, indicating a potential increase in the risk of Chagas disease transmission. Overall, the study provides new insights into the population genetics and phylogeography of the T. dimidiata complex and highlights the importance of understanding the genetic diversity of the parasite in an area to analyze the efficacy of therapeutic tools.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease primarily caused by two hantaviruses, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV), in China. Environmental factors significantly impact the risk of contracting hantavirus infections, mainly through their effects on rodent population dynamics and human-rodent contact. A 10-year field surveillance study in Chenzhou, a hantavirus hotspot in Hunan Province, analyzed 709 cases of HFRS to investigate the relationships between environmental factors, rodent species, and disease occurrence.

The study found that different rodent species were associated with transmission risks in various land types. Rattus norvegicus and R. flavipectus were linked to HFRS risk in grassland, while M. musculus and R. flavipectus were associated with this risk in built-on land. The rodent community composition was also influenced by environmental variability. Predictive risk models based on significant factors indicated that cultivated land represented the highest risk for HFRS incidence, consistent with 2014-2015 statistics.

The study suggests that the spatial heterogeneity of HFRS disease is influenced by rodent community composition, which is associated with local environmental conditions. The research highlights the importance of understanding the relationships between environmental factors, rodent species, and disease occurrence to develop effective prevention and control strategies for HFRS. The findings emphasize the need to focus on preventing HFRS in moist, warm environments.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between activating mutations in the HRAS proto-oncogene and Costello syndrome (CS), a congenital disease characterized by growth retardation, tumor predisposition, and developmental delay. They found that mutations in codon 12/13 of HRAS can cause CS, but the frequency and severity of the disease vary depending on the specific mutation. The most frequent CS-causing mutation, c.34G>A, has a modest negative effect on exon 2 inclusion and is common in both CS and cancer due to its high mutation rate and modest transforming potential. In contrast, the HRAS p.Gly12Val mutation, which has high transforming activity and is frequent in cancer, is rare in CS and causes a severe, early lethal phenotype.

The researchers identified a new germline p.Gly12Val mutation, c.35_36GC>TG, in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS. Analysis of his HRAS cDNA showed high levels of exon 2 skipping, which was confirmed using wild-type and mutant HRAS minigenes. They found that the c.35_36GC>TG mutation disrupts the function of a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE) and creates an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS), leading to exon 2 skipping. This vulnerability of HRAS exon 2 is caused by a weak 3' splice site, making exon 2 inclusion dependent on binding of splicing stimulatory proteins, such as SRSF2.

The study demonstrates that the phenotype in CS and somatic cancers is not only determined by the different transforming potentials of mutant HRAS proteins, but also by the efficiency of exon 2 inclusion resulting from the different HRAS mutations. The researchers also show that a splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) that blocks access to the critical ESE causes exon 2 skipping and halts proliferation of cancer cells, suggesting a potential for development of new anti-cancer therapies based on SSO-mediated HRAS exon 2 skipping.
Researchers have found that a specific type of RNA modification called N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays a crucial role in the development of the cerebellum, a part of the brain responsible for motor coordination and balance. This modification is catalyzed by a protein called methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), which is part of a complex that adds the methyl group to the RNA molecule. In a study using mice, researchers found that inactivating METTL3 in the nervous system led to severe developmental defects in the brain, including a condition called cerebellar hypoplasia, where the cerebellum is underdeveloped. This was caused by the premature death of a type of cell called cerebellar granule cells, which are essential for the development of the cerebellum.

The researchers found that the loss of m6A caused by METTL3 inactivation led to changes in the stability and splicing of specific genes involved in cerebellar development and cell death. This resulted in the dysregulation of gene expression and the premature death of cerebellar granule cells. The study suggests that METTL3-mediated m6A is essential for regulating the development of the mammalian cerebellum and that its dysregulation can lead to severe developmental defects. The findings provide new insights into the role of m6A in the development of the central nervous system and highlight the importance of METTL3 in modulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
Researchers investigated the role of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in regulating gene expression in human and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. These transcription factors are essential for maintaining the ability of ES cells to differentiate into any cell type in the developing embryo. The study found that the combination of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG binding is strongly associated with the co-localization of the transcriptional co-activator Mediator, H3K27ac, and increased expression of nearby genes in ES cells. The researchers observed that the same loci bound by OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2 in ES cells frequently drive expression in early embryonic development.

Comparing human and mouse ES cells, the study found that less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are shared between species. However, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and 53-63% of combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development are conserved. This suggests that the combination of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG binding is critical for transcription in ES cells and likely plays an important role in embryogenesis by binding at conserved early developmental enhancers. The study also found that the fast evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding events, whereas "gene regulatory hotspots" bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues throughout early development are under stronger evolutionary constraints.
AML1/ETO, a fusion protein resulting from a chromosomal translocation, plays a key role in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This protein interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML1, by targeting AML1 binding sites on DNA. However, the regulation of gene expression by AML1/ETO is more complex and involves interactions with other transcription factors, including E-proteins such as HEB. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling identified AML1/ETO-dependent transcriptional regulation, revealing that the fusion protein co-localizes with AML1 and HEB on many of its regulated targets. The DNA binding profile of HEB was significantly altered upon expression of AML1/ETO, and the level of HEB protein was increased in both primary cells and cell lines expressing the fusion protein. These findings suggest that the functional interaction of AML1/ETO with AML1 and HEB plays a major role in transcriptional regulation determined by the fusion protein. AML1/ETO targets common binding regions with AML1 and HEB, and these regions represent preferential binding sites for the fusion protein. The study also found that two isoforms of AML1/ETO, AML1/ETO and AML1/ETO9a, can cooperate to induce leukemia and block myeloid cell differentiation at an earlier stage.
Researchers investigated the role of the Leishmania donovani histone acetyltransferase HAT2 in regulating gene expression. They found that HAT2 acetylates histone H4K10 in vitro and in vivo, and is essential for cell growth and survival. Depletion of HAT2 led to defects in cell cycle progression, particularly in the S phase and G2/M phases, due to reduced expression of cyclins CYC4 and CYC9. These cyclins are crucial for cell cycle progression, and their downregulation in HAT2-depleted cells highlights the importance of stringent modulation of their expression in Leishmania.

Further investigation revealed that CYC4 and CYC9 have their own specific promoters, which are activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and nuclear run-on analyses confirmed that these promoters are transcriptionally activated at specific cell cycle stages. This suggests that there are two tiers of gene regulation in Leishmania: transcription of polycistronic units primarily initiates at divergent strand switch regions (dSSRs) constitutively, while a subset of genes, including CYC4 and CYC9, have their own promoters that are activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner.

HAT2-dependent H4K10 acetylation is crucial for the activation of these gene-specific promoters, and its depletion leads to reduced expression of CYC4 and CYC9. This study provides new insights into gene regulation in Leishmania and highlights the importance of HAT2 and H4K10 acetylation in regulating cell cycle progression in this parasite.
Researchers investigated how humans infer the intentions of others in social interactions using a computational modeling approach. In an economic game, 16 pairs of volunteers played a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, where one player received information about a binary lottery from a visual pie chart and the other player, the adviser, provided an additional recommendation. The adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information varied over time. Using a meta-Bayesian modeling framework, the researchers found that the players' behavior was best explained by hierarchical learning, where they inferred the volatility of the adviser's intentions to optimize their predictions about the validity of the advice. The players' estimates of volatility also affected their trial-by-trial variability in decisions, with participants relying more on their estimates of advice accuracy when they believed the adviser's intentions were stable. The model predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness, and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy. The results suggest that humans employ hierarchical generative models to infer the changing intentions of others, use volatility estimates to inform decision-making in social interactions, and integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework can quantify individual differences in these mechanisms from simple behavioral readouts and may be useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition.
Scrub typhus, a disease endemic to Asia, has traditionally been considered a rural disease. However, indigenous urban cases have been reported in Seoul, South Korea. This study aimed to investigate the presence and clinical characteristics of urban scrub typhus in Seoul. Using national notifiable disease data from 2010 to 2013, 88 cases of urban scrub typhus were identified in Seoul. The possible sites of infection were mountainous areas, city parks, the vicinity of one's own residence, and riversides. Chigger mites were collected in Gwanak mountain, one of the suspected infection sites, and 87.4% were identified as Helenicula miyagawai and 9.2% as Leptotrombidium scutellare. Pooled DNA extracted from H. miyagawai mites yielded O. tsutsugamushi Boryong strain. Twenty-six patients showed low APACHE II score, low complication rate, and no hypokalemia, indicating mild clinical features. The study confirmed the presence of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul and identified the chigger mite H. miyagawai infected with O. tsutsugamushi within the city. The findings suggest that urban scrub typhus needs to be considered as one of the differential febrile diseases in endemic areas and a target for prevention. The study also highlights the possibility that scrub typhus can spread into urban areas under high incidence pressure from surrounding areas.
Researchers investigated the role of the Caenorhabditis elegans HEN1 RNA-methyl-transferase homolog, HENN-1, in the germline of the nematode. HENN-1 is involved in the methylation of small RNA (sRNA) molecules, which is crucial for their stability. The study examined the effects of HENN-1 on two endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in C. elegans: the 26G and 21U pathways. The results showed that HENN-1 has a differential impact on these pathways, with most 26G RNAs displaying reduced stability and increased 3'-uridylation frequencies in the absence of HENN-1. In contrast, the stability of 21U RNAs, the C. elegans piRNAs, was only mildly affected by the loss of methylation. Furthermore, the study found that specifically ERGO-1-bound 26G RNAs are modified by HENN-1, while ALG-3/ALG-4-bound 26G RNAs are not. Global gene expression analysis of henn-1 mutants revealed mild effects, including down-regulation of many germline-expressed genes. The study suggests that the effects of reduced 26G RNA levels on gene expression are indirect, and that HENN-1 plays a crucial role in the stabilization of ERGO-1-bound 26G RNAs. These findings refine our understanding of endogenous RNAi in C. elegans and the roles of Hen1-like enzymes in these pathways.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and high-throughput glycomics analysis on 2,705 individuals from three population cohorts to investigate the genetic regulation of N-glycans in human plasma. The study identified common variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and FUT8 that influence N-glycan levels. HNF1α and its downstream target HNF4α were found to regulate the expression of key fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes. The researchers demonstrated that HNF1α is both necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells. This study reveals a new role for HNF1α as a master transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in the fucosylation process. The findings have implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders. The study also showed that HNF1α regulates the expression of fucosyltransferase genes, including FUT6, and is involved in the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose, a substrate used by fucosyltransferases to N-glycosylate proteins. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic regulation of N-glycans and highlights the importance of HNF1α in the fucosylation process.
Researchers have investigated the role of single-stranded RNA in stabilizing the binding of Centromere Protein C (CENPC) to DNA at centromeres, the attachment points between the genome and the cytoskeleton. Centromeres are unique in that their DNA sequence has little to no role in recruiting kinetochores, the structures that bind to spindles and move chromosomes during cell division. Instead, RNA transcribed from centromeres remains bound within the kinetochore region and is thought to be part of the epigenetic marking system. A study on maize CENPC, a key inner kinetochore protein, found that a localized region of 122 amino acids is responsible for DNA binding, and that single-stranded RNA strongly promotes this binding. The study suggests that centromeric RNA helps recruit CENPC to the inner kinetochore by altering its DNA binding characteristics. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that CENPC has both DNA-binding and RNA-binding capacities, and that the DNA/RNA-binding domain is required for efficient centromere localization. The study proposes that CENPC is first recruited to kinetochores by protein-protein contacts and then converted to a functional DNA binding protein by centromeric RNA. The findings support the view that RNA facilitates or stabilizes the association of kinetochore proteins with centromeric DNA, and implicate CENPC as a primary target of this activity.
Researchers have identified genetic variants associated with birth weight (BW), childhood obesity (CO), and childhood body mass index (CBMI) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The placenta, a critical organ for fetal development and postnatal health, was found to play a significant role in mediating the genetic causes of these traits. By examining the placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), the study revealed that GWAS loci associated with BW, CO, and CBMI were substantially enriched for placenta eQTLs. This suggests that placental transcription in utero is a key factor in determining postnatal body size and may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity.

The study found extensive enrichment of placenta eQTLs for GWAS hits and identified hundreds of transcripts controlled by genetic variants that influence these anthropometric traits. The results demonstrate that placental transcription and related functions defined by identified trait genes play important roles in determining BW, CO, and CBMI. Notably, the placenta was found to be a highly relevant tissue for determining not only weight at birth but also body weight in childhood.

Comparing placenta eQTLs with eQTLs from other tissues, including adipose and liver, revealed that placental eQTLs are enriched to a greater extent for CO/CBMI GWAS hits. The study's findings support the hypothesis that genetically controlled in utero expression patterns linked to BW, CO, and CBMI are crucial for understanding the mechanisms controlling these traits and developing clinical prevention strategies.
Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a chronic condition that often goes untreated due to its non-life-threatening nature and lack of standard diagnostic and treatment guidelines. PKDL is a significant concern in the context of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) elimination efforts. A study conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India aimed to determine the disease burden, compare diagnostic tools, and assess lesion regression after treatment. The study found a prevalence rate of 27.5% among antileishmanial antibody-positive cases, with 26 PKDL cases detected through active surveillance and confirmed by PCR-based diagnosis.

The study compared three diagnostic methods: PCR, slit skin smear, and rK-39 rapid diagnostic kit. PCR demonstrated a high sensitivity of 88.46% for case confirmation, while the slit skin smear had a sensitivity of 15.38%. The rK-39 strip test was not conclusive due to the persistence of anti-leishmanial antibodies after L. donovani infections.

Treatment with sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or oral miltefosine resulted in skin lesions persisting in most cases, which gradually disappeared within 6-12 months post-treatment. Two cases showed reappearance of lesions after 1.5 years of miltefosine treatment. The study highlights the need for active mass surveys to identify undiagnosed PKDL cases and the importance of PCR-based diagnosis for confirming PKDL. A well-designed study with a larger sample size is necessary to determine when PKDL patients are free from parasites after treatment and to identify those requiring longer treatment periods.
Researchers have investigated the process of competence development in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a type of bacteria. Competence is a genetic program that enables horizontal gene transfer, allowing the bacteria to acquire new genes and adapt to their environment. The study found that competence development in liquid cultures of S. pneumoniae is a two-step process. Initially, a small fraction of cells switches to over-produce a signaling molecule called Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP). These cells then induce competence in the rest of the population through cell-to-cell contact.

The researchers discovered that CSP is retained on the surface of competent cells, allowing it to be transmitted to other cells through random collisions. This process promotes horizontal gene transfer and genome plasticity in S. pneumoniae, enabling the bacteria to evade vaccines, antibiotics, and host immune defenses. The study also found that competence development is linked to the metabolic state of the cells, rather than cell density, and is triggered by a growth-time dependent mechanism.

The researchers propose that competence initiator cells arise stochastically in response to stress, forming a distinct subpopulation that then transmits CSP to other cells. This cell-contact sensing mechanism is unique to S. pneumoniae and its close relatives, and is essential for the bacteria's ability to adapt and evolve. The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex process of competence development in S. pneumoniae and highlight the importance of cell-to-cell contact in promoting horizontal gene transfer.
The human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) L2 protein acts as a chaperone to facilitate the trafficking of the viral genome (vDNA) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus, where HPV replication occurs. A critical step in this process is the translocation of the L2/vDNA complex across limiting intracellular membranes. Researchers have developed a system to study this process using the enzyme BirA and its cognate substrate to detect membrane translocation of L2-BirA from incoming virions. The study found that L2 translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell cycle arrest causes retention of L2/vDNA at the TGN, and only release and progression past G2/M enables translocation across the limiting membrane and subsequent infection. Microscopy of EdU-labeled vDNA revealed a rapid and dramatic shift in vDNA localization during early mitosis, with vDNA egressing from the TGN to a pericentriolar location and accumulating there through prometaphase, where it begins to associate with condensed chromosomes. By metaphase and throughout anaphase, the vDNA is seen bound to the mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into both daughter nuclei. Mutations in a newly defined chromatin binding region of L2 potently blocked translocation, suggesting that translocation is dependent on chromatin binding during prometaphase. This study represents the first time a virus has been shown to functionally couple the penetration of limiting membranes to cellular mitosis, explaining in part the tropism of HPV for mitotic basal keratinocytes.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to estimate the relative transmissibility, or "transmission fitness," of one strain of a pathogen compared to another. This framework is applied to data from "competitive mixtures" experiments, where animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains, and the mixture is observed over time and multiple generations of transmission. The method is demonstrated using data from influenza experiments in ferrets.

The relative transmissibility of one strain of influenza compared to another is crucial in various contexts, including seasonal/seasonal interactions, seasonal/pandemic interactions, and NAI-resistant/NAI-sensitive interactions. The competitive mixtures animal model paradigm is applicable in all three contexts, making the mathematical framework presented here widely applicable in influenza research.

The framework estimates the within-host reproduction number and provides an estimate for the number of successfully infecting units transferred from the donor to recipient, which is essential for parameterizing epidemiological models of influenza transmission. The method is also applicable to pathogens other than influenza, as long as the within-host dynamics of the two strains and any competitive or synergistic effects due to co-infection are considered.

The researchers have previously observed the growth of mixtures within an animal model and sustained transmission of mixtures over multiple host generations of infection, allowing them to measure the relative transmissibility of one strain compared to the other. The framework's behavior is demonstrated using data from ferret transmission studies, and simulations suggest how to optimize experimental design for assessing transmissibility.
Researchers have investigated how plants integrate light and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling to adapt to their environment. ABA is a hormone that plays a crucial role in plant growth and development, while light is a key environmental cue that regulates various aspects of plant growth. The study found that BBX21, a protein involved in seedling photomorphogenesis, also plays a role in ABA signaling. Genetic data suggest that BBX21 acts upstream of several ABA INSENSITIVE (ABI) genes and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) in ABA control of seed germination. HY5 is a transcription factor that directly activates ABI5 expression, and BBX21 interacts with HY5. The study shows that BBX21 negatively regulates ABI5 expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. Additionally, ABI5 was found to directly activate its own expression, and BBX21 negatively regulates this activity by directly interacting with ABI5. The research indicates that BBX21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI5 on the ABI5 promoter, integrating light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between light and ABA, which is essential for plant adaptation and survival. The findings suggest that multiple transcription factors in the light signaling pathway regulate ABA responses by controlling ABI5 expression.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Mediator complex in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. The Mediator complex is a co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that is conserved across eukaryotes. The study focused on three subunits of the Mediator complex: Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13. The results show that the C. albicans Mediator shares some functions with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, such as responding to certain stresses and regulating the expression of genes controlled by the activator Ace2. However, the C. albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of genes associated with virulence, including those involved in morphogenesis and the expression of cell wall adhesins. The study found that Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C. albicans, such as filamentation and biofilm formation. Furthermore, Med31 affects the virulence of C. albicans in a worm infection model. The researchers also discovered that the roles of Med31 and Srb9/Med13 in regulating the expression of cell wall adhesins differ between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, with Med31 acting as a repressor in S. cerevisiae and an activator in C. albicans. This suggests that the Mediator complex regulates adhesion in a distinct manner between these two distantly related fungal species.
Researchers investigated the factors contributing to the increased antibiotic tolerance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria in biofilms compared to their planktonic counterparts. They used a genome-wide functional profiling approach to analyze a complex mutant population of P. aeruginosa in both biofilm and planktonic growth conditions, with and without the antibiotic tobramycin. The study aimed to quantify the contribution of each genetic locus to antibiotic tolerance in these different states.

The results revealed large sets of mutations that contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or planktonic setting only, highlighting the differences and similarities between biofilm and planktonic antibiotic tolerance. The study's mixed population-based experimental design recapitulated the complexity of natural biofilms and revealed clinically observed behaviors, including the emergence of quorum sensing-deficient mutants.

The researchers found that the cellular state has a substantial contribution to the antibiotic tolerance of biofilms, providing a rational foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections. The study also showed that while there is a considerable overlap between the loci that modulate antibiotic tolerance in biofilm and planktonic cells, the relative importance of most genes is state-specific. For example, the vast majority of mutants with the strongest fitness advantages in the biofilm state also have only a weak to moderate advantage in the planktonic state.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FAMoS (Flexible and dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection) to analyze complex biological systems. These systems are challenging to study due to numerous interacting components and limited information about their dynamics. Traditional model selection algorithms often rely on preselected models or exhaustive searches of the entire model space, which can be impractical for complex systems. FAMoS overcomes these limitations by using local and non-local search methods to explore large model spaces in a dynamic way, preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in local minima. The algorithm was tested on simulated data and shown to be flexible in handling different model structures. It was also applied to experimental data on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation dynamics, revealing dynamical changes in cell proliferation potential when cultured in 3D tissue-like ex vivo cultures compared to suspension. FAMoS's flexibility in handling various model structures makes it applicable to a wide range of biological problems, representing a useful tool for evaluating complex model spaces. The algorithm's ability to efficiently search large model spaces and provide a systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics makes it a valuable contribution to various research questions in biology.
Researchers conducted a 12-month follow-up study in Bolivia to evaluate the effectiveness of benznidazole (BNZ) treatment in children infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. The study involved 103 seropositive school-age children who received BNZ treatment for 60 days. Blood samples were collected at seven time points during and after treatment, and serology, conventional PCR (cPCR), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) tests were performed to assess treatment efficacy. Additionally, plasma levels of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines, including IL-17A, were measured.

The results showed that 73 children completed the follow-up period, with 6 (11%) showing both cPCR and qPCR positive results, 24 (42%) showing cPCR negative but qPCR positive results, and 27 (47%) showing both cPCR and qPCR negative results. IL-17A levels were significantly higher in seropositive children before treatment compared to age-matched seronegative children and decreased to normal levels one year after treatment. IL-17A levels were also positively correlated with parasite counts detected by qPCR throughout the follow-up period. Notably, IL-17A levels in non-reactive subjects were significantly higher than in reactive or ambiguous subjects at the 12-month time point, suggesting that IL-17A may be a useful biomarker for detecting persistent infection and treatment response.

The study highlights the importance of IL-17A as a potential biomarker for evaluating treatment response in children with Chagas disease. The findings also underscore the need for further research to understand the factors contributing to treatment failure, particularly in the non-reactive group.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary cause of bacterial meningitis, has a genome rich in repetitive DNA, with nearly 2% occupied by a small transposon called the Correia element. Researchers have identified eight subtypes of the Correia element, each with four distinct types of ends, and found that two of these ends encode strong promoters. The activity of the strongest promoter is influenced by a specific polymorphism at the right end of the element. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the Correia elements can drive the expression of adjacent genes and may also produce small non-coding RNAs.

The Correia elements exhibit strain-to-strain variability, with no more than two-thirds of elements maintaining their subtype at a particular locus. This variability is due to recombinational class switching between elements within a single strain, which can lead to the spread of new alleles through the population by natural transformation. This process may represent a previously unrecognized mechanism for phase variation in the meningococcus.

The Correia elements encode numerous strong promoters, allowing for potentially widespread effects within the population. The researchers have defined the strength of the promoters encoded by the eight subtypes of Correia ends, providing a resource to predict the transcriptional effects of a particular subtype at a given locus. This study highlights the importance of the Correia elements in the meningococcus and their potential role in the development and persistence of hypervirulent lineages that cause most global meningococcal disease.
Researchers have identified two proteins, ChLae1 and ChVel1, in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus that play a crucial role in regulating the production of T-toxin, a host-selective toxin that promotes high virulence to maize carrying Texas male sterile cytoplasm (T-cms). T-toxin production is significantly increased in the dark in wild-type (WT) strains, whereas Chvel1 and Chlae1 mutant toxin levels are much reduced in the dark compared to WT. The expression of T-toxin biosynthetic genes (Tox1) is also up-regulated in the dark in WT, while dark-induced expression is much reduced in Chvel1 and Chlae1 mutants. Overexpression of ChVEL1 and ChLAE1 increases T-toxin production and Tox1 gene expression in the dark and in light, respectively. These findings establish ChLae1 and ChVel1 as the first factors known to regulate host-selective toxin production. The study also shows that ChLae1 and ChVel1 positively regulate virulence, oxidative stress responses, sexual development, and aerial hyphal growth, and negatively control melanin biosynthesis and asexual differentiation. The results suggest that ChLae1 and ChVel1 act as positive regulators of T-toxin production through transcriptional control of Tox1 genes, and that there may be an additional T-toxin biosynthesis regulatory mechanism independent of ChLae1 and ChVel1.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of functional asymmetry in bacterial Nav channels, which have been characterized as having distinct properties compared to their eukaryotic counterparts. Using a combination of non-equilibrium simulation data and two-dimensional equilibrium unperturbed landscapes, the study provides new insights into the selective ion permeation in bacterial Nav channels. The results indicate that two or three extracellular potassium (K+) ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter of the bacterial NavAb channel when forces are applied in the inward direction, but not in the outward direction. This block state occurs in an unstable local minimum of the equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscape of two K+ ions, which can be stabilized by modest applied forces. In contrast, three sodium (Na+) ions move favorably through the selectivity filter together as a unit in a "knock-on" mechanism of permeation in both inward and outward directions, with no similar local minimum in the two-dimensional free-energy landscape of two Na+ ions for a block state. The study suggests that the inclusion of non-equilibrium factors in simulations can provide detailed information about mechanisms of ion selectivity that is missing from mechanisms derived from crystal structures or equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscapes. The findings are consistent with electrophysiological measurements of bacterial Nav channels and provide a new understanding of the mechanism of ion selectivity in these channels.
Researchers compared the spread of the rabies virus in dogs with the furious and paralytic forms of the disease. They found that in the furious form, the virus colonized the cerebral hemispheres more quickly, as measured by viral antigen within neuronal cell bodies and viral RNA levels. In contrast, the paralytic form showed a slower spread of the virus. The study used image analysis to quantify the amount of rabies viral antigen in cell processes in a group of naturally infected dogs. The results showed that the amount of antigen in cell processes decreased in a rostral direction, following the pattern for the amount of antigen in neuronal cell bodies. However, there was a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement, suggesting that replication occurred in the cell body region and subsequent transport out to cell processes. The study found that dogs with the furious form had greater amounts of antigen in cell processes compared to those with the paralytic form, at all anatomic levels examined. This suggests that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form, resulting in slower viral propagation. Possible mechanisms for this difference include host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport, which could be mediated by cytokines, as previous studies have documented greater inflammation in the paralytic form.
Researchers investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein CTCF in the regulation of gene expression in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly. CTCF is known to act as an enhancer-blocking factor in vertebrates, but its function in Drosophila was not well understood. The team used a technique called chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites in various regions of the Drosophila genome, including the Bithorax complex (BX-C). They found that CTCF binds to specific sites within the BX-C, including the known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8. Additionally, they identified three new presumptive insulator elements, "Fab-2," "Fab-3," and "Fab-4." These findings suggest that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, indicating a common CTCF-dependent mechanism for their functioning. The researchers also compared the locations of CTCF sites with characterized Polycomb target sites and histone modification patterns, providing support for the domain model of BX-C regulation. The study provides new insights into the role of CTCF in the regulation of gene expression in Drosophila and highlights the importance of CTCF in the functioning of insulators in the BX-C.
Biomedical researchers have long understood the importance of molecular recognition in biochemistry, particularly in enzymes, where substrate binding often triggers conformational changes that facilitate efficient catalysis. However, the dynamic nature of this process has made it challenging to characterize at a structural level. A recent study provides a detailed mechanism for an induced-fit process at atomic resolution using the actinonin-peptide deformylase system. Crystal structures of the initial open state and final closed state, as well as intermediate mimics, were solved to reconstruct the sequence of events from the encounter complex to the key-lock binding state of the enzyme. The study reveals that ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, which is then "zipped up" by additional binding interactions. This research integrates biophysical, computational, and kinetic analyses to provide a comprehensive understanding of the slow-binding mechanism. The findings have implications for the broader area of receptor-ligand interactions and highlight the importance of induced-fit mechanisms in enzyme inhibition and catalysis. The study also sheds light on the precise structural inhibitory mechanism of actinonin, a slow, tight-binding inhibitor of peptide deformylase, which is a metal cation-dependent enzyme.
Researchers investigated the role of the thalamus in relaying sensory information to the cerebral cortex. They created a hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, mimicking the synaptic bombardment of cortical origin through a stochastic mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances. The study found that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key features: the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-to-one convergence from thalamus to cortex, the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment, and the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. Counterintuitively, the results showed that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. The study proposes that active decorrelation of background synaptic activity in the thalamic layer provides a powerful optimization mechanism controlling the efficiency of the retinocortical signal transfer. A stochastic facilitation process emerging at the whole thalamic population level enhances the global sensory information transfer in the presence of decorrelated corticogeniculate feedback bombardment. This process may be the basis for attentional modulation of sensory signals at the thalamic level.
Researchers have investigated the role of NMAD-1, a putative DNA demethylase, in regulating DNA replication and repair during meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. The study found that nmad-1 mutants exhibit reduced fertility, defects in prophase I of meiosis, and an increased incidence of males due to defective chromosomal segregation. Analysis of the nmad-1 germline revealed delayed DNA replication, impaired DNA repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing oocytes. RNA sequencing data showed reduced induction of DNA replication and DNA damage response genes during meiosis in nmad-1 mutants.

Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified NMAD-1 binding proteins, including topoisomerase TOP-2, which regulates DNA repair and replication. NMAD-1 co-localizes with TOP-2 on chromatin, and the majority of TOP-2 binding to chromatin depends on NMAD-1. These findings suggest that NMAD-1 functions at DNA replication sites to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis. The study also found that nmad-1 deletion and catalytic mutant strains have impaired fertility, increased incidence of males, and reduced replication rates, indicating that NMAD-1's demethylation activity at DNA is central to its role in meiosis. Overall, the study provides evidence for a critical role of NMAD-1 in regulating DNA replication and repair during meiosis in C. elegans.
Researchers have identified a new protein called adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) that plays a crucial role in the early stage of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. HCMV is a common virus that can cause serious health problems in newborns and people with weakened immune systems. The virus has a complex structure and can infect a wide range of human cells. Despite its importance, the mechanism of HCMV infection is not yet fully understood.

The study found that APMAP is necessary for HCMV infection in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Knocking down APMAP expression significantly reduced HCMV infection in these cells. Conversely, over-expressing APMAP in cells that are normally resistant to HCMV infection, such as canine MDCK and murine NIH/3T3 cells, promoted HCMV infection. This suggests that APMAP is a key player in the early stage of HCMV infection.

Biochemical studies showed that APMAP interacts with HCMV proteins, specifically the gH/gL containing glycoprotein complexes, at low pH. This interaction is thought to facilitate the nuclear translocation of the tegument protein pp65, which is essential for HCMV infection. The study's findings indicate that APMAP functions as a modulator that promotes HCMV infection in multiple cell types and is an important component of the complex HCMV infection mechanism. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of APMAP in HCMV infection and its potential as a therapeutic target.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how hematopoietic progenitor cells make decisions about their lineage commitment. Traditionally, models of cell differentiation have focused on intrinsic factors, such as the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors. However, this study highlights the importance of extrinsic cues, such as cytokines, in instructing lineage choice and biasing cell-fate decisions. The model suggests that cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback can induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli, providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment. This model supports both the instructive and stochastic theories of commitment, indicating that cell fates are ultimately driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can regulate these decisions with complex behaviors such as ligand-mediated ultrasensitivity and robust multistability. The model also shows that the kinetics of differentiation to a mature cell state can depend on the starting progenitor state and the route of commitment chosen. Furthermore, the model agrees with lineage-specific receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a computational framework that can integrate both classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoiesis.
Researchers have used electron cryo-tomography to study the ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus, a prototypic member of the Orthobunyavirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. This genus includes emerging viruses that pose a threat to human and animal health. The study aimed to understand the structure of orthobunyaviruses, which is essential for understanding virus assembly and entry into host cells. The researchers found that Bunyamwera virions are pleomorphic in shape and display a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes. Each spike protrudes 18 nanometers from the viral membrane and becomes disordered in an acidic environment.

Using sub-tomogram averaging, the researchers derived a three-dimensional model of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein spike to 3-nanometer resolution. The glycoprotein spike consists mainly of the putative class-II fusion glycoprotein and exhibits a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein-protein contacts between neighboring spikes occur at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike contacts at membrane-distal regions. This trimeric assembly deviates from previously observed fusion glycoprotein arrangements, suggesting a greater than anticipated repertoire of viral fusion glycoprotein oligomerization.

The study provides evidence of a pH-dependent conformational change that occurs during orthobunyaviral entry into host cells and a blueprint for the structure of this group of emerging pathogens. The researchers also found that the sequences of the Bunyamwera virus glycoproteins are conserved with those of more pathogenic relatives, indicating a high degree of structural similarity between viruses. This study provides the first detailed 3-D structural analysis of an orthobunyavirus and a model for this large group of medically important viruses.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genes associated with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), a leading cause of blindness in Asia. The study focused on anterior chamber depth (ACD), a key anatomical risk factor for PACG. A total of 5,308 individuals of Asian descent were analyzed, and a significant association was found with a variant in the ABCC5 gene (rs1401999). This variant was associated with a 13% increased risk of PACG in a separate case-control study of 4,276 cases and 18,801 controls. The association was strengthened when controls with open angles were included in the analysis. The study suggests that genetic variants influencing ACD may contribute to the risk of PACG. The ABCC5 gene is expressed in anterior segment structures relevant to PACG, such as the iris, ciliary body, and lens. The findings are consistent with the anatomical risk factors of individual susceptibility to PACG, where shallower ACD increases the risk of PACG. The study provides further clues to the genetic mechanisms underlying PACG, a major global cause of blindness. Further research is needed to identify novel potentially functional polymorphisms related to PACG pathogenesis.
Researchers have identified the first examples of developmental enhancers that are conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes, two distinct groups of animals. These enhancers, called bilaterian conserved regulatory elements (Bicores), show sequence and gene synteny conservation between the two groups. Bicores are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways and have been found to drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. The discovery of Bicores suggests that there may be a common developmental toolkit shared between deuterostomes and protostomes, consisting of conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways. However, the small number of identified Bicores implies extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between the two clades. This raises questions about the true extent of cis-regulatory sequence and function conservation underlying animal development. Further research is needed to determine the number of Bicores and what makes them unique. As more genomes are sequenced and our understanding of cis-regulatory logic improves, it is likely that additional Bicores will be discovered. The identification of Bicores offers a new avenue for exploring how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how this logic evolves.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the impact of vaccination on the diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses within individual hosts. They analyzed data from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy and used next-generation sequencing to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus. The study found that vaccination had a minimal impact on the intrahost diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses. The researchers identified 166 cases of H3N2 influenza over three seasons and obtained whole genome sequence data for 119 samples. They found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual. The level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. Phylogenetic analysis of consensus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition titers, respectively. The study suggests that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales. The findings of this study may have implications for understanding the larger evolutionary patterns of influenza virus.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of a genetically modified live attenuated Leishmania donovani parasite (LdCen-/-) in inducing a protective immune response against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in both young and aged mice. Visceral leishmaniasis is a severe disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, with age being a critical factor in determining the clinical outcome of the disease. Currently, there is no effective vaccine available against VL for any age group.

The study found that LdCen-/- parasites induced a strong innate and adaptive immune response in both young and aged mice. Analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from infected mice showed a significant enhancement of innate effector responses, which augmented CD4+ Th1 cell effector function. Additionally, parasitized splenic dendritic cells from LdCen-/- infected mice revealed the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine genes.

Immunization with LdCen-/- parasites induced higher IgG2a antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in both young and aged mice. Upon challenge with virulent L. donovani parasites, LdCen-/- immunized mice from both age groups displayed a multifunctional Th1-type CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells, resulting in a significantly reduced parasite burden in the spleen and liver compared to naive mice. However, the adaptive response in aged animals was reduced compared to young mice, correlating with less protection in old mice compared to young mice.
Researchers created viral chimeras by exchanging the capsid proteins between enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs) to investigate the underlying causes of their differences in acid sensitivity, optimal growth temperature, and tissue tropism. Enteric and respiratory EVs have distinct biophysical properties and cause a wide range of human pathologies, despite their genetic similarities. The study found that capsid proteins are necessary and sufficient to determine the acid sensitivity and restricted tropism of respiratory EVs, as well as their optimal growth temperature. In contrast, non-structural proteins modulate the innate immune response in tissues. The researchers created chimeras between EV-D68, a respiratory EV, and EV-D94, an enteric EV, and found that EV-D94 with the capsid and 2A protease or the capsid only of EV-D68 were viable. Functional assays showed that capsid proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and tissues. The study also found that capsid genes participate in determining the optimal growth temperature, as EV-D94 temperature adaptation relied on single mutations in VP1, while constructs with EV-D68 capsid could not adapt to higher temperatures. Additionally, the researchers demonstrated that EV-D68 maintains residual binding capacity after acid treatment despite a loss of infectivity. These findings provide new insights into the biophysical properties of EVs and could aid in the development of targeted therapies or vaccines.
The Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-gI acts as a transmembrane Fc receptor on the surface of infected cells and virions, binding to human immunoglobulin G (hIgG). This receptor can also facilitate antibody bipolar bridging (ABB), a process where the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of IgG bind to a viral antigen while the Fc region binds to gE-gI. Research has shown that IgG Fc binds to gE-gI at basic pH, but not acidic pH, suggesting that IgG bound to gE-gI at the cell surface would dissociate and be degraded in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed.

To investigate the fate of viral antigens associated with gE-gI-bound IgG, an in vitro model system was developed using 4-D confocal fluorescence imaging of ABB complexes with transferrin or epidermal growth factor. The study found that cells expressing gE-gI and the viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytosed anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This suggests that gE-gI can mediate the clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens to evade IgG-mediated responses, representing a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis.
Researchers studied the transcriptome profiles of the protoscoleces (PSCs) of Echinococcus granulosus, a parasite that causes cystic hydatid disease in humans and animals worldwide. They used Roche 454 sequencing technology and in silico secretome analysis to explore the potential functions of the excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite. The study generated 26,514 nonredundant sequences, of which 22,910 were mapped to the E. granulosus genome and 17,705 were distributed within coding sequence regions. The researchers identified 2,280 ESPs, including 138 involved in carbohydrate metabolism and 124 involved in protein metabolism. Eleven ESPs were found to regulate glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways, while 44 antigenic proteins, 25 molecular chaperones, and four proteases were highly represented. The study also found that many proteins were significantly enriched in development-related signaling pathways, such as the TGF-β receptor pathways and insulin pathways. These findings provide valuable information on the metabolic adaptation of the parasite to its hosts, which can be used to aid the development of novel intervention targets for hydatid treatment and control. The study adds to our understanding of the genomics of E. granulosus and deepens our knowledge of host-parasite interactions.
In the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the transcription factor NirA plays a crucial role in regulating the assimilation of nitrate, a key nitrogen source in soil. When nitrate is absent, NirA is primarily found in the cytosol and is inactive. However, when nitrate is present, NirA rapidly accumulates in the nucleus and becomes transcriptionally active. Researchers discovered that a conserved methionine residue (Met169) in NirA's nuclear export sequence (NES) is oxidized to methionine sulfoxide (Metox169) in the absence of nitrate. This oxidation is dependent on the flavin-containing monooxygenase FmoB, which specifically targets methionine and cysteine residues. The oxidation of Met169 leads to a change in NirA's conformation, exposing its activation domain and masking its NES. As a result, NirA remains in the nucleus and is transcriptionally active. Conversely, when nitrate is present, FmoB reduces Metox169 back to Met169, allowing NirA to be exported to the cytosol and become inactive. The researchers found that replacing Met169 with isoleucine, a sterically similar but non-oxidizable residue, resulted in partial loss of NirA activity and insensitivity to FmoB-mediated nuclear export. In contrast, replacing Met169 with alanine transformed NirA into a permanently nuclear and active transcription factor. These findings suggest that the oxidation status of Met169 in NirA's NES plays a critical role in regulating its subcellular distribution and transcriptional activity in response to nitrate availability.
Researchers studied the functional constraints that shape the evolution of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, which are essential for the propagation of action potentials. Mathematical models have long suggested that sodium channel properties must be tightly constrained for an action potential to propagate. The researchers analyzed data from 172 sets of measurements from 40 publications, including wild-type and mutant channels, under various conditions. They found that the excitability constraint, which requires multiple equilibria for the current evoked by a step change in membrane potential, was obeyed by all the data. In contrast, the resting potential constraint, which requires a unique value of the resting potential in steady state, was only obeyed in channels expressed in muscle tissue. The researchers identified four distinct groups of sodium channels based on their excitability properties, which are consistent with phylogenetic analysis. These findings suggest that the functional diversity of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels is bounded by physical constraints on sodium channel function. The researchers conclude that the simplest theoretical constraints on action potential propagation, including excitability and resting potential, play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of sodium channels.
Researchers have identified the endonuclease domain of the influenza virus polymerase as a promising target for developing new antiviral drugs. The polymerase is responsible for transcribing and replicating the viral RNA genome, and inhibiting this process could directly stop viral replication at an early stage. The endonuclease domain, in particular, plays a crucial role in the unique cap-snatching mechanism of viral transcription, making it an attractive target for antiviral drugs.

High-resolution X-ray co-crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) PA endonuclease domain have been obtained with a series of specific inhibitors, including four diketo compounds and a green tea catechin. These compounds chelate the two critical manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme, highlighting the potential for structure-based optimization of inhibitors. The binding modes of the different compounds and a mononucleotide phosphate have been compared, revealing how substituent groups on the metal binding scaffold can be oriented to bind in distinct sub-pockets within the active site cavity.

These findings will be important in guiding the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase. The results also demonstrate the plasticity of certain structural elements of the active site cavity, which result in induced fit binding. This information will significantly advance the goal of developing novel and efficacious influenza therapeutics that directly target viral replication.
Researchers have developed an effective immunization protocol to produce potent polyspecific antisera against three medically important vipers found in Thailand and neighboring countries: Calloselasma rhodostoma, Cryptelytrops albolabris, and Daboia siamensis. The protocol, known as the "low dose, low volume, multi-site" method, was used to immunize four horses with a mixture of the three viper venoms. The resulting antisera showed a rapid increase in ELISA titers against the three venoms and reached a plateau at around the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency of the antisera against the three venoms was significantly higher than the minimal potency limits set by the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (QSMI). The polyspecific antisera also effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephrotoxic activities of the viper venoms. This immunization protocol has the potential to produce potent polyspecific antisera against snake venoms and could be useful in the production of equine antisera against other diseases such as tetanus, diphtheria, and rabies. The study demonstrates the successful production of potent, truly polyspecific antisera against the three vipers using the low dose, low volume, multi-site immunization protocol. The resulting antivenom has been commercialized in the form of F(ab')2 and is expected to help save lives of victims of envenomation by the three and other related vipers in Southeast Asian countries.
Salmonella enterica, a bacterium that causes systemic infections, has the ability to persist in the body for long periods of time despite a strong immune response. This persistence allows infected individuals to remain asymptomatic and transmit the disease to others through fecal shedding. Researchers have identified a bacterial effector protein called SseI, which is translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system (T3SS). SseI is essential for Salmonella typhimurium to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. The protein inhibits the normal migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in vitro, a process that requires the host factor IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1). SseI binds directly to IQGAP1 and co-localizes with this factor at the cell periphery. A mutation in the C-terminal domain of SseI eliminates its function in vitro and in vivo, but not its ability to bind to IQGAP1. Infection with wild-type S. typhimurium suppressed DC migration to the spleen in an SseI-dependent manner, resulting in fewer DC and CD4+ T lymphocytes in the spleens of infected mice compared to those infected with a mutant strain lacking SseI. These findings demonstrate that SseI inhibits normal host cell migration, which counteracts the host's ability to clear systemic bacteria.
Researchers have identified a key factor contributing to the high virulence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) compared to hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). The transcription product of the psm-mec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCmec of HA-MRSA, suppresses the expression of phenol-soluble modulin α (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus, by inhibiting the translation of the agrA gene. The agrA gene encodes a positive transcription factor for the PSMα gene.

Studies found that 25% of 325 clinical MRSA isolates had a mutation in the psm-mec promoter that attenuated transcription, and 9% of the strains had no psm-mec. In most of these psm-mec-mutated or psm-mec-deleted HA-MRSAs, PSMα expression was increased compared to strains carrying intact psm-mec, and some mutated strains produced high amounts of PSMα comparable to that of CA-MRSA. Deletion of psm-mec from HA-MRSA strains carrying intact psm-mec increased the expression of AgrA protein and PSMα, and virulence in mice.

The researchers demonstrated that psm-mec RNA specifically binds to agrA mRNA and inhibits its translation. They also found that one-third of HA-MRSA isolates from the Kanto area of Japan harbored a -7T>C mutated psm-mec or did not carry psm-mec, and these strains produced high amounts of PSMα. The study suggests that the absence of psm-mec is a genetic determinant of the high virulence property of CA-MRSA, and identification of the psm-mec mutation could be a novel method for predicting the virulence properties of MRSA strains.
Researchers have investigated the phenomenon of antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in the context of dengue virus (DENV) infection. ADE occurs when maternal antibodies, which are passed from mother to child, fail to neutralize the virus and instead enhance its replication, leading to severe disease. In a previous study, a mouse model using type I and II interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice (AG129) was used to replicate this phenomenon. However, as dengue occurs in immunocompetent individuals, a new mouse model was sought to replicate ADE in a less immunocompromised background.

In this study, researchers used type I IFN receptor-deficient A129 mice born to DENV1-immune mothers to investigate ADE. The results showed that these mice succumbed to a DENV2 infection within 4 days, which was sub-lethal in mice born to naive mothers. Clinical manifestations included extensive hepatocyte vacuolation, moderate vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Treatment with anti-TNFα therapy completely protected the mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes, while blocking IL-6 did not impact the virus titers or disease outcome.

This new A129 mouse model of ADE may help elucidate the mechanisms involved in dengue pathogenesis and evaluate the efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates. The model can also be used to investigate the protective or enhancing properties of vaccination-induced maternal antibodies in infants and the possible interference of maternal antibodies on vaccination efficacy in babies and young children.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas. The study analyzed 51 studies and found that male sex was linked to visceral leishmaniasis in studies using the leishmanin skin test for diagnosis and in those where the outcome was clinical disease. In contrast, younger individuals were less frequently infected than adults but more prone to illness. The presence of dogs at home, higher dog seropositivity in nearby areas, lower socioeconomic status, and highly vegetated areas were also associated with Leishmania infantum infection. However, the presence of chickens in the house and nutritional status were not found to be associated with the disease.

The study also found that dog seropositivity was consistently associated with human visceral leishmaniasis in ecological studies, suggesting that dogs may serve as a marker for the occurrence of the disease among humans. The review highlights the need for more effective and targeted control measures, as well as further research in new areas of the continent with improved methodological quality. The study's findings cannot be generalized to other contexts due to the unique characteristics of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas, where the etiological agent is Leishmania donovani, the vector is Phlebotomus argentipes, and infected humans are the only reservoir.
Inhalation of Francisella tularensis (Ft), the causative agent of tularemia, leads to acute and fatal pneumonia in mice. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying acute pathogenesis and death in pulmonary tularemia. Researchers found that an overt innate cellular response to Ft, rather than an overwhelming bacterial burden or cytokine production, drives tissue pathology and host mortality. This response is characterized by the recruitment of large numbers of immature myeloid cells (IMC) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to the lungs, which fail to mature and die, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of pulmonary function, and host death. This process is partially dependent on immature Ly6G+ cells. In contrast, sub-lethal infection with Ft elicits a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes, which are required for protection against the bacteria. The study suggests that the nature of the myeloid cell response may be the primary determinant of host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection. The findings indicate that the inappropriate elaboration of IMC/MDSC leads to necrotizing inflammation in multiple organs, driving irreversible tissue damage, multi-organ dysfunction, and host death. The study highlights the critical role of the innate myeloid cell response in determining the outcome of pulmonary tularemia.
Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is an invasive species that poses a global concern due to its rapid spread and potential to transmit infectious diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. To understand the complex colonization pattern of this mosquito, researchers combined classical population genetics analyses and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approaches to study the demographic history of Aedes albopictus populations in Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas. The results indicate that populations in Southeast Asia, including China, Thailand, and Japan, maintain high genetic connectivity, suggesting an ancestral common origin. China appears to be the oldest population. In contrast, the invasion process in other regions, such as La Réunion, America, and the Mediterranean Basin, is characterized by a chaotic propagule distribution, resulting in high genetic diversity within adventive populations. The study suggests that independent and trans-continental introductions of Aedes albopictus may have facilitated the rapid establishment of adventive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes, leading to a significant amount of intra-population variability. This variability may extend to the genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence, potentially contributing to the efficient transmission of arboviruses and outbreak establishment. The findings provide valuable information for developing models to predict the risk of vector outbreaks and assessing the risk of arbovirus outbreaks in newly invaded areas.
A recent study investigated the factors that contribute to the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wound infections. The researchers found that clinical isolates from human wounds were often defective in virulence functions and biofilm formation, and that many genes involved in these processes were not necessary for bacterial fitness in experimental mouse wounds. In contrast, genes related to anaerobic growth, metabolic and energy pathways, and membrane integrity were critical for bacterial survival in wounds. The study also found that high-density bacterial growth conditions, rather than virulence or biofilm functions, were a key factor in bacterial fitness in wounds. This suggests that chronic wounds may be a relatively permissive environment for bacterial growth, where nutrient acquisition and growth may not depend on invasive or toxic functions. The researchers used a mouse model of diabetic wound infection, which is relevant to human wound pathogenesis, and found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibited wound healing in the model, directly linking infection to disease. The study's findings shed light on the bacterial functions needed to initiate and maintain chronic wound infections and suggest potential therapeutic targets to compromise wound infection pathogenesis. The results also raise the possibility that the predominant stresses on bacteria in wounds may be applied by the bacteria themselves, rather than the host, and that overlapping functions may counteract both bacterial and host-applied stresses.
A prospective study was conducted at the Center for Teaching, Research and Tertiary Referral for Bancroftian Filariasis (NEPAF) to evaluate the occurrence of intrascrotal lymphangiectasia, gross appearance/consistency of the testis, and the efficacy of complete excision of hydrocele sac in patients living in a bancroftian filariasis endemic area who underwent hydrocelectomy. A total of 1,128 patients with uni- or bilateral filarial hydrocele (Group-1) and a comparison group of 218 patients who had undergone hydrocele-sac-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere (Group-2) were enrolled. The study found that the hydrocele recurrence rates in Group-1 and Group-2 were 0.3% and 19.3%, respectively, with no hydrocele recurrence in Group-2. Per-surgically leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels were seen in 30.9% and 46.3% of patients in Group-1 and Group-2, respectively. The testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 18% and 35.7% of patients from Group-1 and Group-2, respectively. The study suggests that lymph fluid from ruptured dilated lymphatic vessels is an important component of chronic filarial hydrocele fluid that threatens the integrity of the testis in an adult population living in bancroftian filariasis endemic areas. The authors recommend complete excision of hydrocele sac and suture or excision of leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels to avoid hydrocele recurrence.
Researchers have identified a deubiquitinating enzyme, TsUCH37, in the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis, which causes trichinellosis, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. This enzyme is a cysteine protease that is putatively orthologous to the human protein UCH-L5. Using an activity-based probe, HA-Ub-VME, the researchers identified several potential deubiquitinating enzymes in T. spiralis larvae lysate, including TsUCH37. The predicted gene encoding TsUCH37 was cloned and recombinant protein was expressed and purified, and its deubiquitinating activity was verified by Ub-AMC assay. Co-precipitation experiments showed that TsUCH37 associates with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including the yeast Rpn13 homologue ADRM1. The UCH inhibitor LDN-57444 exhibited specific inhibition of recombinant TsUCH37 and reduced the viability of cultured L1 larvae. This suggests that UCH enzymes, including TsUCH37, play an important role in parasite biology and may be potential therapeutic targets for trichinellosis. The interaction of TsUCH37 with the proteasome has been conserved throughout evolution, highlighting the potential for the use of inhibitor compounds to elucidate the role of UCH enzymes in T. spiralis infection.
Researchers have identified three non-peptidic nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors that show anti-trypanosomal activity against the CL Brener strain of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. These compounds, based on two scaffolds associated with cathepsin K inhibition, demonstrated activity in the 0.1 μM to 1 μM range. Two of the compounds, with EC50 values of 0.12 μM and 0.25 μM, showed greater potency against the trypanosome than against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzipain. This suggests that the anti-trypanosomal activity of these compounds may not be solely due to cruzain inhibition, indicating a potential polypharmacological profile towards cysteine proteases.

The study also evaluated cathepsin K inhibitors based on a cyclohexane dicarboxamide scaffold and found that two compounds showed significantly greater anti-trypanosomal activity than expected based on their cruzain inhibitory activity. The results suggest that the anti-trypanosomal effects of the most potent compounds may be due to the inhibition of one or more cysteine proteases, including isoforms of cruzipain, that have not yet been identified as potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The study's findings imply that a putative new antichagasic target may share molecular recognition characteristics with cathepsin K, and that phenotypic screening libraries for the discovery of antichagasic agents should include potent inhibitors of this enzyme.
Researchers have created a comprehensive physical map of the maize genome, covering 93.5% of the genome and aligning 86.1% to the genetic map. This map contains 25,908 genic markers, allowing for the alignment of nearly 73% of the anchored maize genome to the rice genome. The study reveals that the maize genome has undergone significant expansion, with 1 kilobase in rice corresponding to an average of 3.2 kilobases in maize. This expansion is attributed to the recent polyploid origin of maize, resulting in most rice regions corresponding to two regions in maize. Inversions account for the majority of chromosome structural variations during the subsequent diploidization of the maize genome.

The researchers also found evidence of an ancient genome duplication predating the divergence of the progenitors of maize and rice. By reconstructing the paleoethnobotany of the maize genome, they determined that the progenitors of modern maize contained ten chromosomes. Comparative analysis with rice and sorghum revealed a whole genome duplication event, supporting the idea that the present maize genome emerged from tetraploidization of several ancient duplicated regions. The study provides new insights into the organization of the chromosomes of the progenitors contributing to maize polyploidization and the rearrangements associated with the subsequent diploidization of the maize genome.
Researchers have successfully generated infectious prions in a laboratory setting using a technique called protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA). Prions are misfolded proteins responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a group of diseases that affect the brain and nervous system. The study aimed to mimic the early stages of sporadic prion disease, which appears to arise from a rare spontaneous misfolding of the prion protein. Using PMCA, the researchers were able to generate misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) in the absence of pre-existing PrPSc in different animal species at a low and variable rate. The newly generated PrPSc was found to be infectious and caused a new disease phenotype in wild-type hamsters, characterized by unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. This finding supports the prion hypothesis, which suggests that prions are composed of a misfolded version of the prion protein that replicates in the body without the need for nucleic acids. The study also suggests that prion diversity may be greater than previously thought, and that new forms of infectious protein folding may result in novel disease phenotypes. The results provide further evidence for the prion hypothesis and offer a simple model to study the mechanism of sporadic prion disease.
A novel neurally based model, the Angular Velocity Detector Unit (AVDU), has been developed to estimate angular velocity (AV) in the bee brain. This model quantitatively reproduces experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees, including previously unaccounted for manipulations of behavior. The AVDU is fitted using electrophysiological data and tested using behavioral data. The model suggests that the AV response can be considered as an evolutionary extension to the optomotor response.

The AVDU detector is tested behaviorally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm, where bees navigate down a corridor with gratings on the walls. When combined with an existing flight control algorithm, the detector reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behavior. The summed response of the detector to a unit distance movement along the corridor is constant for a large range of grating spatial frequencies, demonstrating that the detector can be used as a visual odometer.

The AVDU model reproduces several behavioral patterns, including the deviation of the average flight path from the corridor center according to differences in spatial frequency of sinusoidal gratings on opposite walls, and the deviations of the average flight path from the corridor center for square wave and sinusoidal gratings. The model also suggests that the AV tuned neuron responses could be used to estimate distance by summing the detector output over time and over all parts of the visual field.
A long-term follow-up study of 50 human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) patients from the Ivory Coast has revealed that untreated infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the main agent of sleeping sickness, are not always fatal. The study found that 10 out of 11 patients who refused treatment despite repeated visits showed parasite clearance using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of these patients (7/10) also displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming progressively negative to trypanosome variable antigens. This suggests that alternative natural progressions of HAT may occur, including progression to an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection associated with strong long-lasting serological responses, and progression to an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection with negative results in parasitological tests and PCR. The study also found that a significant proportion of subjects displaying positive serologic test results but negative results in parasitological testing may be experiencing such infection courses. These findings demonstrate that trypanotolerance exists in humans, as is widely accepted for animals, and are a major step forward for future research in the field of HAT. The study's results are based on clinical, serological, molecular, and parasitological investigations combining field diagnostic tools and highly specific and sensitive laboratory tests, providing the most comprehensive study on the natural evolution of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection in its human host.
Researchers investigated the relationship between ionizing radiation and the development of lymphoid malignancies, focusing on the role of p53, a key tumor suppressor gene. They used mouse models to determine whether ionizing radiation selects for p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells in vivo. The study found that p53 disruption does not provide a selective advantage in an unstressed hematopoietic system or in previously irradiated bone marrow allowed to recover from irradiation. However, upon irradiation, p53 disruption confers a dramatic selective advantage, leading to the long-term expansion of p53-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. This selection is attributed to several factors, including protection from acute irradiation-induced ablation of progenitor cells, prevention of irradiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor cells, improved long-term maintenance of progenitor cell fitness, and the disabling/elimination of competing p53 wild-type progenitors. The study suggests that the carcinogenic effect of ionizing radiation can be partly explained by increased selection for cells with p53 disruption, which protects progenitor cells from immediate elimination and long-term reductions in fitness following irradiation. The findings indicate that the causal link between radiation exposure, p53 disruption, and cancers involves selection for p53 loss rather than solely irradiation-induced mutagenesis at loci encoding proliferation control genes.
Researchers investigated the role of Schistosoma mansoni SmKI-1 serine protease inhibitor in parasite development and its potential as a therapeutic molecule against inflammatory diseases. SmKI-1 was found to inhibit trypsin and neutrophil elastase (NE) activity, with the Kunitz domain being responsible for this inhibitory activity. Molecular docking studies revealed that SmKI-1 blocks the NE active site, suggesting a mechanism for its inhibitory effect. The study also demonstrated that SmKI-1 reduces schistosomula killing by elastase, potentially serving as an immune evasion mechanism for the parasite. Furthermore, SmKI-1 was shown to inhibit neutrophil function and inflammation in various murine models of inflammatory diseases, including acetaminophen-mediated liver damage and gout arthritis. In these models, SmKI-1 treatment reduced neutrophil recruitment, elastase activity, and overall pathological score. Additionally, SmKI-1 was found to inhibit early events that trigger neutrophil recruitment in pleural cavities of mice in response to carrageenan. The study suggests that SmKI-1 plays a crucial role in S. mansoni survival and has potential as a therapeutic molecule against inflammatory diseases.
Researchers have developed a novel method for accurately modeling the high-resolution structures of transmembrane helical (TMH) proteins from distant homologues. TMH proteins play crucial roles in various cellular functions, but their structures are largely uncharacterized due to the lack of close structural homologues. The new method was tested on 50 pairs of TMH protein homologues with diverse topologies, sizes, and sequence identities. The results showed that the method improved most starting templates and achieved near-atomic accuracy in predicting membrane-embedded regions. In two blind prediction contests, the method ranked first in predicting the accuracy of full-length receptor structures. The method was also able to improve most starting templates in a benchmark of 50 TMH protein homolog pairs, achieving near-atomic accuracy prediction in the TMH regions. The technique was tested on the adenosine A2AR and chemokine CXCR4 receptors, and the results suggest that it can be useful for rebuilding and refining X-ray structures of membrane receptors where functionally important loop regions have missing densities or are often deleted to facilitate crystallization. The method has the potential to aid in the design of more effective therapeutics and receptors with novel functions for systems and synthetic biology applications, which rely on atomic-resolution information.
Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that causes listeriosis, a serious foodborne disease, has been found to switch from an active, motile lifestyle to a persistent, vacuolar lifestyle in epithelial cells. This switch occurs after several days of infection in human hepatocytes or trophoblast cells, where the bacteria stop producing the actin-nucleating protein ActA and become trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles called Listeria-Containing Vacuoles (LisCVs). A subpopulation of bacteria resists degradation in these vacuoles and enters a slow, non-replicative state. The bacteria can then cycle between the vacuolar and actin-based motility stages. When ActA is absent, such as in ΔactA mutants, the bacteria enter a "viable but non-culturable" state, making them undetectable by conventional colony counting methods. Exposure to high doses of gentamicin selects for vacuolar and "viable but non-culturable" bacteria. These findings suggest that L. monocytogenes can enter a persistent state in a subset of epithelial cells, potentially leading to asymptomatic carriage, prolonged incubation periods of listeriosis, and increased survival during antibiotic therapy. This new understanding of L. monocytogenes' lifecycle may have significant implications for the development of new treatments and prevention strategies for listeriosis.
Researchers have developed a neuromechanistic model to study auditory streaming, a phenomenon where sequences of high and low frequency tones are perceived as either a single stream or separate streams. The model combines neuromechanistic modeling and psychoacoustic experiments to investigate persistent alternations between integrated and segregated percepts. Unlike previous models, this model incorporates neuronal units with sensory feature-dependent inputs that mimic the responses of primary auditory cortex (A1) to tones in the ABA-triplet pattern. The model includes mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise, as well as slow NMDA recurrent excitation for local temporal memory that enables linkage across sound gaps from one triplet to the next. Percepts in the model are identified in the firing patterns of the neuronal units. The model predicts that manipulating the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept more than those of the weaker percept. This prediction is confirmed by psychoacoustic experiments, and the behavioral data is used to further constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results. The model provides a platform that can be extended to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition. The study focuses on accurately reproducing the dynamics of alternations after the build-up phase, and its formulation is motivated by physiological studies of auditory streaming and general models of perceptual bistability.
Researchers have developed a method to assess the allergenicity of Schistosoma mansoni proteins using a humanised Rat Basophilic Leukaemia (RBL) reporter cell line. This method involves translating S. mansoni proteins in a cell-free system using wheat germ lysate and then testing their ability to activate the RBL cells. The RBL cells are engineered to respond to allergens by producing luciferase, which can be measured to determine the level of activation.

The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of this method by testing well-characterized allergens, including Par j 2, SmTAL-1, and IPSE/alpha-1. They found that SmTAL-1 was able to activate the RBL cells, while SmTAL-2, used as a negative control, did not. This suggests that the method is capable of distinguishing between allergenic and non-allergenic proteins.

The researchers also showed that the method can be used to assess the allergenicity of S. mansoni antigens using sera from infected individuals. They found that sera from individuals infected with S. mansoni were able to activate the RBL cells when challenged with SmTAL-1, but not with SmTAL-2.

This method offers a rapid and high-throughput way to assess the allergenicity of S. mansoni proteins, which could be useful for the development of safe and efficacious vaccines against helminthic parasites. The researchers suggest that this method could also be used to unravel the entire allergome of S. mansoni and other medically important parasites, leading to a better understanding of the basis of allergenicity and the relationship between parasite-specific IgE and host protection mechanisms.
Researchers investigated the effects of transposable elements (TEs) on gene and transposon expression in a hybrid dysgenic syndrome of Drosophila virilis. They found that when TEs inherited from the father are absent in the mother's genome, TEs can become activated in the progeny, causing germline damage and sterility. The study used the D. virilis syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis as a model to examine the effects of divergence in TE profile between parents on offspring. The results showed that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germline TE expression when comparing genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses. These differences are transmitted to the next generation and coincide with increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. The study also found that gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents that arise through polymorphic TE insertions. Overall, the results support a model in which early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of both TE and gene expression in the germline that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation. The study demonstrates that divergence in the TE profile is associated with diverse piRNA-mediated transgenerational effects on gene expression within populations.
Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the fragile X syndrome (FXS) gene, FMR1. The expanded CGG repeat is thought to induce toxicity as RNA, and in FXTAS patients, mRNA levels for FMR1 are significantly increased. Researchers investigated the basis for the increase in FMR1 mRNA expression and found that overexpressing histone deacetylases (HDACs) 3, 6, or 11 suppresses CGG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. This suppression results from selective transcriptional repression of the CGG repeat-containing transgene. The researchers also found that in patient-derived lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, there is increased acetylation of histones at the FMR1 locus in pre-mutation carriers compared to control or FXS-derived cell lines. This epigenetic change correlates with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression in pre-mutation cell lines. Furthermore, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors repress FMR1 mRNA expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extend lifespan in CGG repeat-expressing Drosophila. These findings suggest that the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling in cis, which in turn increases expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA. The results also provide proof of principle that HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators might be used to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus.
Host genetics play a crucial role in controlling CD8 T cell function and lethal immunopathology during chronic viral infection. Research has shown that specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles and the degree of MHC heterogeneity are associated with enhanced CD8 T cell function and viral control during human chronic infection. However, the extent to which host genetics influences the establishment of chronic viral infection remains unclear. To investigate this, researchers conducted a study using F1 crosses of B10.D2 x B6 (D2B6F1) and BALB.B x BALB/c (BCF1) mice infected with the clone-13 (Cl-13) strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The results showed that both D2B6F1 and BCF1 mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice, but D2B6F1 mice on a C57BL genetic background exhibited mortality following Cl-13 infection. CD8 T cell depletion prevented mortality in Cl-13-infected D2B6F1 mice, indicating that mortality was CD8 T-cell-dependent. D2B6F1 mice maintained more CD8 T cell effector cytokine production and exhibited reduced expression of the T cell exhaustion marker PD-1. Additionally, D2B6F1 mice induced a larger Th1 response than BCF1 mice, and Cl-13-induced mortality in D2B6F1 mice was dependent on CD4 T-cell-mediated IFN-γ production. These findings suggest that increased functionality of the CD8 T cell response allows for more rapid viral clearance at the cost of enhanced immunopathology dependent on both MHC diversity and the genetic background of the host.
A recent study analyzed the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis isolated from northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. The study found that five sublineages/subgroups of B. anthracis were detected in the region, including A. Br. 001/002, A. Br. Vollum, A. Br. Aust94, A. Br. Ames, and A. Br. 008/009. These sublineages were identified using canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) analysis and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15 markers. The geographical distribution of the B. anthracis populations exhibited different canSNP characteristics from those of the strains isolated before 1990 in China. The A. Br. Ames subgroup was found to be scattered from Inner Mongolia to other provinces, whereas it was previously only found in Xinjiang.

The study also found that all 106 strains were assigned to 36 MLVA15 genotypes, with 21 of these types being first observed in this study. The strains collected from anthrax outbreaks in the recent decade were classified as subgroups A. Br. 001/002 and A. Br. Ames and identified as genotypes MLVA15-28, MLVA15-30, MLVA15-31, MLVA15-38, MLVA15-CHN3, and MLVA15-CHN18. The study suggests that the diversification of MLVA genotypes and the geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations is gradually becoming balanced across northwestern China. This study provides preliminary survey results regarding the population diversity of B. anthracis in China, which will help promote the prevention and control of this important disease.
Researchers investigated the role of goblet cells in defending against enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and related pathogens that cause severe diarrheal disease. They found that goblet cells produce a mediator called RELM-β, which is strongly induced during infection. RELM-β was detected in the stool and serum of infected mice, but its role in host defense was unclear. To determine its function, researchers infected wildtype and RELM-β gene-deficient mice with Citrobacter rodentium, a related mouse pathogen. While both groups had similar pathogen burdens, RELM-β deficient mice suffered increased mortality and mucosal ulceration due to deeper pathogen penetration of colonic crypts. Immunostaining revealed that RELM-β deficient mice were impaired in infection-induced intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) hyper-proliferation. Further investigation showed that RELM-β acts as a CD4+ T cell chemoattractant, recruiting these immune cells to the infected colon. This recruitment led to increased production of interleukin-22 (IL-22), a cytokine that directly promotes IEC proliferation. Enema delivery of RELM-β to RELM-β deficient mice restored CD4+ T cell recruitment, increased IL-22 levels, and promoted IEC proliferation, reducing mucosal pathology. These findings demonstrate that RELM-β and goblet cells play a critical role in recruiting CD4+ T cells to the colon to protect against enteric pathogens.
Researchers have identified a crucial interaction between the norovirus protein VPg and the eIF4G protein in the host cell, which is essential for the initiation of translation of the norovirus genome. Noroviruses, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans, use an unusual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis, relying on interactions between VPg and eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) in the host cell. The study focused on the murine norovirus (MNV) and found that a 20-amino acid motif at the C-terminus of MNV VPg mediates direct and specific binding to the HEAT-1 domain within the 4GM fragment of eIF4G. This interaction is conserved in all known noroviruses. The researchers used various biochemical and biophysical assays, including pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal titration calorimetry, to map the binding site on eIF4G and define the structural details of the interaction. They found that the VPg binding site on eIF4G is non-overlapping with the binding site for eIF4A, allowing for the formation of ternary VPg-eIF4G-eIF4A complexes. The functional significance of the VPg-eIF4G interaction was demonstrated by the ability of fusion proteins containing the C-terminal peptide of MNV VPg to inhibit in vitro translation of norovirus RNA but not cap- or IRES-dependent translation. These findings provide important insights into the mechanism of norovirus translation initiation and reveal a potential target for antiviral therapy.
Researchers investigated the conditions under which gene clusters evolve in bacterial genomes. Gene clusters are groups of genes that encode proteins involved in a common pathway and are often found near each other on bacterial chromosomes. Several theories have been proposed to explain the evolution of these clusters, including natural selection, the selfish operon model, and the persistence model. The selfish operon model suggests that clustered genes are more easily transferred between species, increasing their chances of survival. The persistence model proposes that clustered genes are less likely to be disrupted by deletions or insertions of DNA.

Using computational models, the researchers studied the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve and persist. They re-examined the selfish operon model and found that it fails to explain the observation that genes in clusters are often arranged in the order of biochemical reactions. However, under certain conditions, including a low number of genes in the pathway, a high population size, and a high horizontal transfer rate, the selfish operon model can still be a viable explanation for the evolution of gene clusters.

The researchers also developed and studied a model that includes natural selection and genome inversion events. They found that gene clusters can evolve under both direct and indirect selection as long as certain conditions are met. The results suggest that the evolution of gene clusters is a complex process that depends on various factors, including the number of genes in the pathway, population size, and the rate of horizontal transfer.
Malaria, a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, poses significant health and economic burdens in tropical regions. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to severe consequences of the infection due to the specific adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a unique variant of PfEMP1, a parasite-encoded antigen, called VAR2CSA. VAR2CSA binds to chondroitin sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblasts in the intervillous space of placentas and is only expressed in the presence of a placenta.

Research has shown that the gene encoding VAR2CSA contains a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) that acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA, revealing a novel form of gene regulation in malaria parasites. This mechanism is reversible, allowing high levels of protein translation upon selection, potentially enabling parasites to upregulate expression of this variant antigen in the presence of the appropriate host tissue. The uORF is not spliced out and is present in the mRNA, indicating that VAR2CSA is encoded by a bicistronic transcript.

Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms used by malaria parasites to regulate VAR2CSA expression and protein expression in general, which will provide insights into the molecular basis of the host-parasite interactions underlying the pathogenesis of the disease.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide microarray analysis of blood samples from 34 dengue virus-infected children in Nicaragua to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the spectrum of disease outcomes. The study aimed to identify gene expression patterns associated with severe versus non-severe manifestations of dengue infection. The analysis revealed distinct transcriptional profiles between dengue patients with and without shock, particularly in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins involved in protein biosynthesis. In patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever, a subset of differentially expressed genes encoded neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides associated with innate immunity. A meta-analysis of the dataset, combined with previously published data, confirmed that dengue infection is associated with significant changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Notably, the interferon response, observed in vitro, was not consistently detected in patient samples by day 3-6 of illness, suggesting a transient interferon response in vivo. The study highlights differences in gene expression between severe and non-severe dengue manifestations, as well as commonalities in the host response to dengue infection. The findings suggest that a systems biology approach, incorporating larger datasets from multiple studies, may lead to improved prediction of disease outcomes.
Researchers studied how the herpesvirus MuHV-4 infects its host by tracking its entry into the body. They found that MuHV-4 specifically targets the olfactory neuroepithelium, a layer of cells in the nose responsible for detecting odors. The virus binds to a molecule called heparan sulfate (HS) on the surface of these cells, which is essential for its entry into the host. In contrast, the respiratory epithelium, which lines the lungs, expresses HS only on its underside and is not targeted by the virus.

The researchers observed that MuHV-4 infects both neurons and sustentacular cells, which provide support to the neurons, in the olfactory neuroepithelium. This suggests that the olfactory neuroepithelium is an important site for herpesvirus infection. The study also found that the virus's ability to bind to HS is crucial for its entry into the host, as virions that cannot bind to HS are unable to infect cells.

The researchers propose that targeting the olfactory neuroepithelium with HS-based interventions could be a potential strategy for controlling herpesvirus infections. However, they also note that other factors may contribute to the virus's ability to target this site, as some mutants of MuHV-4 that are less dependent on HS binding still infect the olfactory neuroepithelium. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of herpesvirus infection and highlights the importance of the olfactory neuroepithelium as a site of infection.
Researchers have identified a new regulatory mechanism in Salmonella enterica that involves the CRP-cAMP complex in silencing virulence genes under non-permissive conditions. These genes, located in the pathogenicity island I (SPI-1), are essential for the bacterium's ability to invade epithelial cells. The CRP-cAMP complex, a widely established metabolic regulator, was found to modulate the expression of HilD, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion, at the post-transcriptional level. This regulation occurs through a newly identified regulatory motif within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the hilD gene.

Further investigation revealed that the Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot 42 is under the transcriptional repression of CRP-cAMP. When this repression is relieved, Spot 42 exerts a positive effect on hilD expression. In vivo and in vitro assays showed that Spot 42 targets the 3'UTR of the hilD transcript through its unstructured region III.

The study found that CRP-cAMP-deficient Salmonella strains are unable to secrete SPI-1 T3SS effector proteins and are avirulent in a mouse model. This suggests that CRP-cAMP plays a crucial role in regulating Salmonella virulence by affecting the post-transcriptional regulation of hilD. The research highlights the biological relevance of the hilD 3'UTR as a hub for post-transcriptional control of Salmonella invasion gene expression. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Salmonella virulence and the role of CRP-cAMP in regulating gene expression in response to environmental changes.
Researchers investigated the relationship between CAG/CTG repeat instability, chromatin structure, and transcription in the context of Huntington's disease (HD). They used two transgenic mouse lines, R6/1 and R6/2, which express a similar transgene at different integration sites and exhibit tissue-specific instability. The study found that CAG instability rates were higher in R6/2 tissues compared to R6/1 tissues, and that high transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility correlated with increased instability. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimethylation at the HD locus were increased in R6/2 tissues, while H3K9 dimethylation was reduced. However, the levels of transgene expression and histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, two tissues with different CAG instability levels. The study also found that the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at the HD locus, but not the initiating form, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. Additionally, H3K36 trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum but not in the cerebellum. The results suggest that transcription modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo and that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability.
Researchers analyzed the genomic features of Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a highly virulent enterovirus, in an immunocompromised patient with disseminated disease. They sequenced full-length genomes from respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and blood specimens and identified three nucleotide changes that occurred within a five-day period. These changes included a non-conservative amino acid substitution in the VP1 protein's BC loop, a conservative substitution in protein 2B, and a silent mutation in protein 3D. Infectious clones were constructed with these mutations, and in vitro cell tropism and competition assays revealed that the VP1 BC loop substitution conferred a replicative advantage in neuroblastoma cells. This mutation was associated with a second non-conservative mutation in the VP1 EF loop in neuroblastoma cells. Comparative models of the EV71 VP1 variants suggested that the substitutions may alter interactions with host cell receptors. The study found that the VP1 BC loop region plays a critical role in cell tropism, independent of EV71 lineage, and may have contributed to dissemination and neurotropism in the immunocompromised patient. The findings provide insights into the molecular features that enhance EV71's ability to disseminate in humans.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of pheromone recognition and selectivity by ComR proteins in Streptococcus species, which play a crucial role in the regulation of natural transformation, or competence. This process allows bacteria to acquire new traits, such as antibiotic resistance, through the uptake of extracellular DNA. The ComRS system, a quorum sensing mechanism, involves a peptide pheromone (ComS) that is processed, secreted, and imported into the cytoplasm, where it binds and activates the transcription factor ComR. ComR then engages in a positive feedback loop to express ComS and the alternative sigma-factor SigX.

A test-bed assay was developed to measure the activity of different ComR proteins in response to cognate and heterologous XIP peptides in vivo, revealing distinct ComR classes with strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. An X-ray crystal structure of ComR from S. suis was solved to understand the interaction with XIP and identify structural features that may explain XIP recognition. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to probe the apo conformation of the XIP-binding pocket, and the results suggest that the pocket is lined by a variable and conserved face, where residues of the conserved face contribute to ligand binding and the variable face discriminates among XIP peptides.

The study provides a model for XIP recognition and specificity, allowing for the prediction of novel XIP peptides that induce ComR activity. This research lays the groundwork for further studies on the role of ComRS in species-cross communication and the regulation of natural competence in Streptococcus species.
Researchers used the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans as a model organism to study the DNA replication properties of centromeric DNA. They found that each centromere in C. albicans is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome, and that epigenetic formation of new centromeres, known as neocentromeres, is accompanied by shifts in replication timing. This means that a neocentromere becomes the first to replicate and is associated with components of the origin recognition complex (ORC). The study also showed that changing the level of the centromere-specific histone H3 isoform leads to a concomitant change in levels of ORC association with centromere regions, further supporting the idea that centromere proteins determine origin activity. Additionally, analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins. This pattern is conserved among related strains and species, in a manner independent of primary DNA sequence. The study suggests that the distinct timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position. The findings provide evidence that DNA replication timing can serve as the basis for the inheritance of functional centromeres at specific chromosomal sites, representing a novel mechanism of epigenetic inheritance.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 158,025 individuals of European ancestry identified three genetic loci associated with chronic back pain (CBP). The study, conducted by the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank, found a genome-wide significant association with the intronic variant rs12310519 in the SOX5 gene, which was replicated in an independent sample of 283,752 UK Biobank participants. This variant was associated with a 7% increased risk of CBP. Two other loci, rs7833174 between CCDC26 and GSDMC, and rs4384683 in DCC, showed suggestive associations in the discovery sample and exceeded genome-wide significance in a joint meta-analysis. The study used logistic regression models to adjust for age, sex, and study-specific covariates, and the threshold for genome-wide significance was set at p<5×10−8. The discovery sample consisted of 29,531 CBP cases and 128,494 controls, while the replication sample consisted of 50,915 cases and 232,837 controls. The study aimed to identify novel associations between genetic markers and CBP, and to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying this condition. The findings suggest that genetic factors contribute to the development of CBP, and that further research is needed to understand the underlying biology and to identify potential therapeutic targets.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to estimate the disease burden of Taenia solium cysticercosis, a zoonotic disease that affects both humans and pigs. The disease is a significant cause of epilepsy in regions where it is prevalent, but it is often underreported. The study used data on human and porcine cysticercosis in West Cameroon to calculate the impact of the disease. The estimated number of people with neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy was 50,326, representing 1.0% of the local population. The number of pigs diagnosed with cysticercosis was estimated at 15,961, which corresponds to 5.6% of the local pig population. The total annual costs due to T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon were estimated at €10,255,202, with 4.7% attributed to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% to direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis. The average number of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost was 9.0 per thousand persons per year. The study found that the cost of inactivity, influenced by salaries, plays a significant role in the monetary burden of T. solium cysticercosis. The estimated number of DALYs lost due to the disease was higher than estimates for some other neglected tropical diseases. The study suggests that knowing the salary levels and prevalence of the disease can provide a rapid indication of the total cost of T. solium cysticercosis in a country.
Researchers have identified a non-coding RNA called RsaA in Staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that can cause infections in humans. RsaA is a small RNA molecule that does not code for a protein, but instead regulates the expression of other genes. The study found that RsaA reduces the virulence of S. aureus by repressing the synthesis of the global transcriptional regulator MgrA. MgrA is a master regulator of transcription that controls the expression of many virulence factors and accessory genes in S. aureus.

RsaA achieves this repression by forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine and Dalgarno sequence and a loop-loop interaction within the coding region of the MgrA mRNA. This interaction prevents the translation of MgrA, leading to increased biofilm formation and decreased capsule synthesis in S. aureus. Biofilm formation is a process by which bacteria adhere to surfaces and form a protective matrix, while capsule synthesis is the production of a polysaccharide layer that helps bacteria evade the host immune system.

As a result of RsaA's repression of MgrA, S. aureus becomes more susceptible to opsonophagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, a type of white blood cell. In animal models, RsaA was found to attenuate the severity of acute systemic infections and enhance chronic catheter infections. The study suggests that RsaA has been positively selected through evolution to support commensalism and saprophytic interactions with the host, rather than causing disease. This is the first example of a conserved small RNA in S. aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections.
Researchers have developed a new method to visualize the process of HIV-1 uncoating, a critical step in the virus's life cycle. Uncoating occurs when the cone-shaped HIV-1 capsid disassembles in target cells, allowing the virus to establish a long-term infection. To study this process, scientists created a fluorescently tagged version of a host protein called cyclophilin A (CypA), which binds specifically to the HIV-1 capsid. This tagged protein, called CypA-DsRed, was incorporated into HIV-1 particles and allowed researchers to track the disassembly of the capsid in real-time.

Using single-virus imaging, researchers observed that CypA-DsRed remained associated with the viral core even after the viral membrane was removed, and that it was lost from the core at the same time as the capsid. The rate of CypA-DsRed loss was influenced by the stability of the viral core and was accelerated when the virus began to reverse transcribe its genetic material. The study found that most viral cores lost CypA-DsRed shortly after fusion with the host cell, while a small fraction remained intact for several hours.

The researchers also observed that uncoating occurred both in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane, and that the loss of CypA-DsRed was dependent on reverse transcription. This new imaging assay enabled the visualization of single HIV-1 uncoating in living cells and revealed the previously unknown spatio-temporal features of this process.
Researchers investigated the use of oligonucleotides in prokaryotic genomes, examining their relationship to various properties such as codon usage, DNA base-stacking energy, and DNA structural conformation. They analyzed the statistical information potential of different DNA "word-sizes" and compared oligonucleotide frequencies in coding and non-coding regions. The study found that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, suggesting that prokaryotic DNA is predominantly short-range correlated, with information encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, with most of this variation occurring in non-coding regions. Bias in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content, and coding regions were more biased than non-coding regions. Non-coding regions were found to be approximately 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average, in the 402 chromosomes examined. Pronounced DNA compositional differences were found both within and between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes, with GC-rich genomes being more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions. The differences between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes may be attributed to lifestyle, as tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea and bacteria. The study suggests that oligonucleotide sizes larger than hexanucleotides possess little additional information potential in prokaryotic DNA.
Researchers have investigated the factors that influence meiotic recombination, a process that ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity. They analyzed the transmission of allelic variants at six highly active recombination hotspots in human sperm DNA and found a novel form of biased transmission that is exclusive to noncrossover recombinants. This form of biased gene conversion arises from differences in heteroduplex formation and biased mismatch repair between crossovers and noncrossovers. The biased transmission favors strong (G/C) over weak (A/T) base pairs, which is consistent with established correlations between high GC content and recombination activity in mammalian genomes. This form of biased gene conversion is a previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive that may affect thousands of recombination hotspots throughout the human genome. The researchers observed this biased transmission at two of the six examined hotspots and suggest that it may contribute to the correlation between GC content and recombination, potentially influencing the evolution of genomic base composition. The findings indicate that factors acting downstream of recombination initiation, such as heteroduplex formation and biased mismatch repair, play a significant role in shaping the transmission of allelic variants during meiosis.
Researchers have developed a computational systems biology model to better understand the molecular mechanisms of environmental chemicals and their impact on human health. The model integrates chemical toxicology and systems biology to create a high-confidence human protein-protein association network. This network reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, allowing for the prediction of potential risk factors for human health. The model can also identify unexpected associations between chemicals and proteins.

The researchers used the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) to gather information on 2,490 unique compounds and 6,060 molecular targets involved in human disease. They selected 42,194 associations between these compounds and molecular targets. By analyzing these associations, the researchers identified new chemical-disease associations and potential molecular targets for chemicals such as di-ethylhexyl-phthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, pirinixic acid, and permethrine.

The model can be used to predict which chemicals may affect human health by analyzing clusters of associated compounds and diseases. However, it is essential to note that the network does not distinguish between positive and negative associations between a chemical and a disease. The study highlights the importance of integrating toxicogenomics data with other data types to better understand the molecular mechanisms of environmental chemicals and their impact on human health. This approach has the potential to identify new molecular targets for chemicals and link them to diseases, providing valuable information for risk assessment and disease prevention.
Researchers have developed a new approach to understanding how the brain processes sound by modeling the complex interactions between neurons in the auditory cortex. This approach, called network receptive field (NRF) modeling, reveals that primary auditory cortical neurons are sensitive to a much larger range of sound features than previously thought. Unlike traditional receptive field models, which describe the linear relationship between a neuron's response and a specific sound feature, NRF models capture the complex nonlinear interactions between neurons.

The NRF model consists of a network of 1-7 sub-receptive fields that interact nonlinearly to produce a neuron's response to sound. This model consistently outperforms traditional receptive field models in predicting neural responses to auditory stimuli. The NRF model also reveals separate excitatory and inhibitory sub-fields with distinct nonlinear properties, which give rise to important operations such as gain control and conjunctive feature detection.

Conjunctive effects, where neurons respond only when multiple specific features are present together, enable increased selectivity for complex sound structures and may play a key role in sound recognition. The NRF model provides a more accurate and interpretable representation of cortical processing, revealing the richness and nonlinearity of the auditory brain's signal processing strategies. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of how the brain processes sound and may have implications for the development of more effective treatments for hearing-related disorders.
Researchers have discovered a crucial mechanism that regulates the mammalian circadian clock, which is responsible for controlling the body's internal rhythms. The study found that a protein called casein kinase 2 (CK2) plays a pivotal role in phosphorylating the BMAL1 protein, a key component of the circadian clock. Phosphorylation of BMAL1 at a specific site, Ser90, is a critical regulatory step in the mammalian core clock oscillator.

The researchers used a novel clock-perturbing peptide to investigate the mechanism of CK2-mediated BMAL1 phosphorylation. They found that the CRY protein acts as a repressor of CK2 protein kinase activity towards BMAL1-S90. CRY proteins bind to CK2β, inhibiting its ability to phosphorylate BMAL1. This binding is mediated by the FAD binding domain of CRY1 and two C-terminal domains of BMAL1, as well as the acetylation/deacetylation of BMAL1-Lys537 by CLOCK/SIRT1.

The study proposes a dual negative-feedback model, where a CRY-dependent CK2-driven post-translational BMAL1-P-BMAL1 loop is an integral part of the core clock oscillator. This loop forms a distinct interlocked loop in the clock machinery and has integral roles in the core circadian oscillator through periodic CRY-mediated negative feedback suppression. The findings suggest that CRY proteins have a dual function, not only repressing BMAL1-CLOCK-driven transcription but also repressing CK2 protein kinase activity towards BMAL1-S90. The study provides new insights into the regulation of the mammalian circadian clock and highlights the importance of CRY proteins in controlling CK2-mediated BMAL1 phosphorylation.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Salmonella enterica adapts to survive in the presence of bile, a substance produced by the liver that has antibacterial properties. They found that sublethal concentrations of a bile salt called sodium deoxycholate (DOC) can adapt Salmonella to survive lethal concentrations of bile. This adaptation is associated with changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of the RpoS-dependent general stress response and other stress responses. The study suggests that the general stress response plays a crucial role in adaptation to bile, as RpoS mutants are more sensitive to bile.

The researchers also discovered that individual Salmonella cells can become resistant to bile without the need for adaptation by the entire population. They found that plating a non-adapted Salmonella culture on medium containing a lethal concentration of bile yields bile-resistant colonies at a frequency of 10^(-6) to 10^(-7) per cell and generation. Further analysis revealed that some of these resistant colonies are stable, indicating that bile resistance can be acquired by mutation. Full genome sequencing of bile-resistant mutants showed that alteration of the lipopolysaccharide transport machinery is a common cause of mutational bile resistance.

However, the study also found that selection on lethal concentrations of bile can provide bile-resistant isolates that are not mutants. The researchers propose that these isolates derive from rare cells whose physiological state allowed them to survive upon encountering bile. This phenomenon highlights the existence of phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal populations of bacteria and may illustrate the adaptive value of gene expression fluctuations.
Researchers have discovered that the E. coli chromosome is organized into compact, supercoiled domains through both active and passive mechanisms, such as transcription and DNA-protein association. A specific prophage, Mu, is found to be organized as a stable chromosomal domain, bounded by its termini L and R, which are 37 kilobase pairs apart on the Mu genome. This domain formation is dependent on a strong gyrase site at the center of Mu, the Mu L end, the MuB protein, and the E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, Fis, and HU. The Mu domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations tested, but prophage λ does not form an independent domain. Low-level transcription from two phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent, promotes the establishment and maintenance of the Mu domain. The domain is thought to confer transposition readiness to Mu by facilitating the topological requirements of the reaction and the proximity of Mu ends. Additionally, the potential benefits to the host cell from a subset of proteins expressed by the prophage may contribute to its long-term stability. The Mu domain is characterized by a closed-loop structure, where the synapsis of prophage ends is assisted by processive supercoiling by gyrase bound to a centrally located strong gyrase site. The formation and maintenance of the Mu domain require the presence of several Mu proteins and host nucleoid-associated proteins, including IHF, HU, and Fis.
A recent study investigated the effects of primaquine (PQ) treatment on gametocyte carriage of Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and P. falciparum (Pf) in children in Papua New Guinea. The study found that PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%, which is comparable to its effect on blood-stage infections. However, no difference was observed in the density of Pv gametocytes or the proportion of Pv infections carrying gametocytes between PQ and placebo treatment arms. The study also found that Pv and Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Mixed-species infections were found to have lower odds of gametocytes compared to single-species infections for both Pv and Pf. The study suggests that Pv relapses and new infections are associated with similar levels of gametocytaemia, highlighting the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment for efficient control of Pv. The majority of gametocyte carriers were detected in asymptomatic infections, emphasizing the need for sensitive detection and early treatment of asymptomatic and submicroscopic Plasmodium spp. infections. The study's findings support the use of PQ treatment for all Pv infections to prevent relapses and reduce gametocyte carriage.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to analyze the cycling of Rho GTPases between the plasma membrane and cytosol. Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, play a crucial role in controlling actin organization during various cellular processes such as migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. The primary mechanism of Rho GTPase regulation involves targeting to the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding. The researchers hypothesized that the details of GTPase cycling between the membrane and cytosol are key to the differential upstream regulation of these biochemical switches.

Using a modeling framework, the researchers analyzed experimental data to reveal details of GDI-mediated cycling and distinguish between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and direct association-dissociation of GTPase with membrane molecules. The analysis of Rac membrane cycling showed that the lower apparent affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacGDP can be fully explained by the faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane.

The researchers presented non-dimensional steady-state solutions for membrane fraction of GTPase in multidimensional charts, which can be used to illustrate the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities between GTPases and membrane and/or GDI on the amount of membrane-bound GTPase. The charts can also be used to assess how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios. The analysis demonstrates that Rho-GTPase cycling can access qualitatively diverse pathways in different cellular systems or through different experimental manipulations.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs for schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma mansoni, typically focus on collecting data from school-aged children (SAC) due to their high likelihood of infection and ease of sampling. However, adults are also likely to be infected, and their infection burden can significantly impact the effectiveness of treatment strategies. This study investigates how the age distribution of infection affects the recommended treatment coverage levels required to achieve World Health Organization (WHO) goals for morbidity control and elimination of schistosomiasis.

Using three different age-intensity profiles of infection with low, moderate, and high burdens of infection in adults, the study finds that treating SAC only may be sufficient to achieve WHO goals in moderate prevalence regions, regardless of adult infection burden. However, in high prevalence regions with high adult infection burden, adult treatment is necessary to meet WHO goals. The study highlights the importance of collecting prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age-range, including adults, to determine the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region.

The study emphasizes that relying solely on SAC data may lead to a large proportion of the local infection burden remaining untreated, creating a reservoir of infection within the community. It is recommended to include adults in treatment and monitoring efforts, particularly in high-risk areas, and to collect additional epidemiological data, such as individual longitudinal adherence to treatment, to inform treatment strategies.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict surgery targets in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a neurological disorder characterized by disruptive seizures. The model uses structural connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 individuals with left TLE and 39 healthy controls. The study aimed to validate the model by examining patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset time and network location. The results showed that patients tend to transition from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls, and regions in the left hemisphere, particularly within temporal and subcortical regions, are the most frequent starting points for seizures in patients. The analysis also implicated regions in the contralateral and frontal locations that may play a role in seizure spreading or surgery resistance. The model predicted that patient-specific surgery, where resection areas are chosen on an individual basis, may lead to better outcomes than the currently used routine clinical procedure. The study provides a first step towards patient-specific computational modeling of epilepsy surgery to inform treatment strategies.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) uses various strategies to evade the host's innate antiviral defenses, including the use of viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRFs) to block interferon and apoptotic signaling. One of these vIRFs, vIRF-1, has been found to target and inactivate the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, a key negative regulator of HHV-8 replication. Bim is a member of the Bcl-2 family and plays a crucial role in inducing apoptosis in response to viral infection. vIRF-1 achieves this by directly interacting with Bim and relocating it to the nucleus, where it is inactivated. This interaction is essential for vIRF-1's pro-replication and anti-apoptotic activities, as demonstrated by the generation of vIRF-1 variants that cannot bind to Bim and exhibit reduced activity. Furthermore, blocking the interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim using a cell-permeable peptide inhibited vIRF-1's pro-replication activity. The study reveals a novel mechanism by which HHV-8 controls replication-induced apoptosis and suggests that targeting the vIRF-1:Bim interaction may provide an effective antiviral strategy. This is the first report of an IRF protein interacting with a Bcl-2 family member and of nuclear sequestration of Bim as a means of inactivation.
Researchers investigated the role of the epithelial integrin αVβ6 in regulating the immune response of the lung to respiratory pathogens. They found that mice lacking the β6 integrin (β6 KO) were protected from severe lung injury and improved survival during influenza infection. This protection was associated with reduced viral spread into the alveolar spaces and decreased inflammation. The β6 KO mice had constitutively activated lung CD11b+ alveolar macrophages and elevated type I interferon (IFN) signaling activity, which was traced to the loss of β6-activated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Administration of exogenous TGF-β to β6 KO mice led to reduced numbers of CD11b+ macrophages, decreased type I IFN signaling activity, and loss of the protective phenotype during influenza infection. The researchers also found that β6 KO mice were protected from other respiratory pathogens, including Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. The study suggests that the loss of one epithelial protein, αVβ6 integrin, can alter the lung microenvironment during both homeostasis and respiratory infection, leading to reduced lung injury and improved survival.
Researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of 733 cases of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) at a reference center in Argentina from 2006 to 2015. The study aimed to assess the usefulness of the Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) as a diagnostic tool for ACL. The LST is a skin test that detects delayed type hypersensitivity responses to Leishmania antigens, used in endemic areas to complement diagnosis.

The analysis found that 65% of cases were confirmed through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 cases having a negative LST result among this group. Among smear-negative cases, 190 were also negative by LST, but 69 instances had a positive LST result. The study found that lesions older than 21 days correlated with positive results for both smear and LST, suggesting that LST can be a useful diagnostic tool for ACL, even in endemic areas.

The study's findings support the clinical use of LST as a diagnostic complement for ACL across all age groups. The correlation between LST and smear results was high, indicating that LST can be a reliable tool for diagnosing ACL. However, standardization of the LST technique and further research into its optimal preparation and utilization protocols are needed to improve its effectiveness in managing suspicious clinical cases. The study's results contribute to the management of ACL, a disease caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, which is the most common cause of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis in the Americas.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 40 loci associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study aimed to investigate how environmental lipid-induced changes in macrophages contribute to CAD. The researchers used a combination of open chromatin mapping and enhancer and transcription factor mapping in primary human macrophages before and after exposure to atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), which leads to foam cell formation. They found that oxLDL-induced foam cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of open chromatin and active enhancer sites that correlated with expression changes of nearby genes. The researchers identified several transcription factors, including C/EBP-beta, which has no previously documented role in foam cell formation, and found that oxLDL exposure up-regulated C/EBP-beta expression and increased its genomic binding events. Variants at CAD-associated loci were enriched in the subset of chromatin sites altered by oxLDL exposure, including rs72664324 at the PPAP2B locus. The researchers found that oxLDL increased C/EBP-beta binding to this site and that C/EBP-beta binding and enhancer activity were stronger with the protective A allele of rs72664324. Expression of the PPAP2B protein product LPP3 was present in foam cells in human atherosclerotic plaques and oxLDL exposure up-regulated LPP3 in macrophages, resulting in increased degradation of pro-inflammatory mediators. These findings provide a genetic mechanism contributing to CAD risk at the PPAP2B locus and highlight the value of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic environmental stimuli.
Researchers in Malawi conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of a single round of mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin in reducing the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in districts with a baseline prevalence of 5.0-9.9% in children aged 1-9 years. The World Health Organization recommends three rounds of MDA in districts with a TF prevalence of 10% or higher. However, this approach may not be practical due to the large number of endemic districts worldwide and the resources required to conduct surveys.

The Malawi Ministry of Health administered one round of azithromycin MDA to eight districts with a mean coverage of approximately 80%. Population-based trachoma surveys were conducted in 18 evaluation units of the treated districts at least six months after the MDA. The results showed that all 18 evaluation units had a TF prevalence of less than 5.0%. This suggests that a single round of azithromycin MDA with high coverage can effectively reduce TF prevalence to less than 5.0% in districts with a baseline prevalence of 5.0-9.9%.

This study provides evidence that a single round of MDA may be sufficient to eliminate active trachoma in Malawi districts with a baseline TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9%. The study's findings are consistent with a previous study in Tanzania, which found that a single round of high-coverage azithromycin completely interrupted local transmission of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis. The results of this study offer optimism that Malawi may be able to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.
Researchers have identified a key component in the immune response of plants, specifically in the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are intracellular immune sensors that recognize pathogen-encoded effectors to initiate a complex immune response. This response includes a sustained increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, transcriptional reprogramming, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and programmed cell death (PCD).

Six closely related Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) were found to mediate bifurcate immune responses activated by NLR proteins RPS2 and RPM1. The dynamics of differential CPK1/2 activation by pathogen effectors controls the onset of cell death. CPK4/5/6/11 activation directly phosphorylates a specific subgroup of WRKY transcription factors, WRKY8/28/48, to synergistically regulate transcriptional reprogramming crucial for NLR-dependent restriction of pathogen growth. In contrast, CPK1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma membrane-resident NADPH oxidases for ROS production and contribute to PCD.

Functional genomic and biochemical genetic screens identified the specific roles of CPKs in primary NLR signaling. The study provides genetic evidence that Ca2+ signaling via specific CPKs plays pivotal roles in the diverse downstream signaling and pathogen resistance mediated by distinct intracellular NLR immune sensors. This research sheds light on the complex mechanisms of plant innate immunity and highlights the importance of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases in the regulation of immune responses.
In the district of Niono, Mali, Schistosoma haematobium, a parasitic disease, has a significant impact on public health. The disease is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, where irrigation and hydro-electric projects, changes in lifestyle from nomadic to sedentary, and ineffective control programs have contributed to its spread. Despite its importance, only a small percentage of research has focused on predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of Schistosoma species, including Schistosoma haematobium.

To address this gap, researchers used a state-space forecasting method to analyze the Schistosoma haematobium time-series data from Niono, Mali, from 1996 to 2004. This approach allowed them to capture seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in the disease incidence. The results showed that the method produced reasonably accurate forecasts, with a mean absolute percentage error of around 25% for 1- to 5-month horizon forecasts.

The study's findings suggest that this state-space framework can be a useful tool for managing and assessing Schistosoma haematobium transmission and intervention impact in the district of Niono, Mali, and potentially in other areas of the Sahel region. The method can also capture non-linear interactions between disease dynamics and external factors such as climate, irrigation, and public health interventions, making it a valuable tool for public health programs in developing countries.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has evolved a mechanism to restrict its own replication in certain cell cycle phases. The viral tegument protein pp150 prevents the onset of viral gene expression in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle by binding to cyclin A. This restriction is essential for the virus's productive replication cycle. Researchers created a mutant virus with a cyclin A-binding deficient pp150 to investigate the physiological relevance of this restriction. They found that unrestricted viral gene expression in S/G2 led to a G2/M arrest, but G2-arrested cells still supported viral replication. The viral gene product pUL21a was required to maintain the virus-permissive G2-arrest by destabilizing cyclin A. A double-point mutant virus with both pp150 and pUL21a disabled in cyclin A interaction forced mitotic entry of infected cells, resulting in a severe negative impact on cell viability and virus growth. This suggests that pp150 and pUL21a functionally cooperate to build a cell cycle synchronization strategy that is essential for productive HCMV infection. The study highlights the importance of the pp150-cyclin A-dependent restriction of viral gene expression to G0/G1 and the pUL21a-cyclin A-dependent cell cycle block in protecting HCMV from fatal entry into mitosis.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the genetic causes of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons and leads to paralysis and death. Approximately 90% of ALS cases are sporadic, with the remaining 10% being familial. The study used a targeted sequencing approach to analyze 169 known and candidate ALS disease genes in 242 sporadic ALS cases and 129 matched controls. The results showed a significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases compared to controls, indicating that these variants may be linked to ALS.

The researchers used a combination of functional studies, bioinformatics tools, and rare variant analysis to assess the relevance of newly identified variants to the disease. They found that cases had a higher burden of deleterious mutations than controls, suggesting that novel or rare mutations in key genes may contribute to sporadic ALS. The study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing techniques in understanding the genetic etiology of a heterogeneous sporadic disease.

The researchers identified rare or novel variants in 144 of the 242 patients sequenced, indicating that at least 40% of cases may not have a genetic cause for ALS that could be identified with their sequencing method and set of candidate genes. The study also identified new variants in known ALS disease genes and associated genes, and found no association between several previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ALS in their population, with the exception of APOE.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus in mice. They found that IL-6 is crucial for the recall of influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells, but not CD8+ T cells. The study showed that IL-6 suppresses the activity of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are a type of immune cell that can down-modulate the immune response. This suppression of Tregs by IL-6 allows virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells to remain active, facilitating the clearance of the virus and the survival of the host.

The researchers compared the immune responses of wild-type mice and mice deficient in IL-6 (IL-6−/−) after infection with influenza virus. They found that IL-6−/− mice had impaired CD4+ T cell memory responses, but not CD8+ T cell memory responses. The study suggests that IL-6 acts by limiting the activity of virus-specific Tregs, which would otherwise suppress the activity of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells.

The researchers also found that IL-6 does not affect the survival of CD4+ T cells, as there was no difference in cell death among lymphocytes in the lungs of IL-6−/− mice compared to wild-type mice. Instead, the study suggests that the major target of IL-6 activity is the Treg population, rather than conventional CD4+ T cells. This implies that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells differ in their susceptibility to suppression by Tregs. Overall, the study highlights the critical role of IL-6 in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus.
Researchers have identified a new function of the glycolytic enzyme enolase in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Enolase is known to catalyze the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the glycolytic pathway. However, this study reveals that enolase also interacts with the cytosine-5 methyltransferase 2 (Dnmt2) protein, which is involved in DNA and tRNA methylation. The researchers used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify enolase as a Dnmt2-binding protein and found that enolase has both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in E. histolytica.

The study shows that enolase acts as an inhibitor of Dnmt2, and this inhibitory activity is antagonized by 2-phosphoglycerate, suggesting that glucose metabolism controls the non-glycolytic function of enolase. Glucose starvation drives enolase to accumulate in the nucleus, leading to the formation of a complex with the E. histolytica Dnmt2 homolog (Ehmeth) and a reduction in tRNAAsp methylation. The researchers also demonstrated the crucial role of enolase as a Dnmt2 inhibitor in E. histolytica expressing a nuclear localization signal-fused enolase.

This study establishes enolase as the first Dnmt2-interacting protein and highlights an unexpected role of a glycolytic enzyme in the modulation of Dnmt2 activity. The findings suggest a link between glucose metabolism and Dnmt2 activity and provide new insights into the regulation of tRNA methylation in E. histolytica.
Researchers have discovered microRNAs (miRNAs) in the saliva of mosquitoes, specifically in the species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which are known to transmit diseases such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are typically found inside cells, but have also been detected in human serum and saliva. This study used next-generation sequencing to identify 103 miRNAs in mosquito saliva, of which 31 were previously unknown and were designated as novel. The researchers found that some of these miRNAs are only expressed in mosquitoes infected with CHIKV, suggesting that they may play a role in the transmission and establishment of the virus in the host.

The study also found that inhibiting these miRNAs decreased viral replication, indicating that they may enhance CHIKV replication and dissemination in the host. This is the first report of exogenous miRNAs in mosquito saliva, and the findings suggest that these molecules may be involved in the complex interactions between mosquitoes and their hosts during blood feeding. The discovery of miRNAs in mosquito saliva provides new insights into the mechanisms of mosquito-borne disease transmission and may have implications for the development of new strategies to prevent or treat these diseases.
A recent study investigated the role of the RAD52 epistasis group proteins in the repair of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mitochondrial DNA encodes essential proteins for cellular respiration, and deletions in the mitochondrial genome have been linked to various diseases and disorders. The study found that the proteins Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p, which are involved in double-strand break repair (DSBR) in the nucleus, also play a crucial role in mtDNA repair. These proteins were localized to the matrix of the mitochondria, and Rad51p was found to bind directly to mitochondrial DNA.

The researchers used a targeted restriction endonuclease to introduce a double-strand break (DSB) in the mitochondrial genome, allowing them to study DSB repair in vivo. They found that the loss of Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p significantly decreased the rate of spontaneous deletion events and impaired the repair of induced mtDNA DSBs. The study also demonstrated that these proteins impact the rate of spontaneous mitochondrial DNA deletions and the repair of induced mitochondrial DSBs in yeast.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial mutagenesis and repair, particularly DSBR. The localization of Rad51p and Rad59p to the mitochondria suggests that these proteins play a direct role in mtDNA repair. Further research is needed to identify mitochondrial-specific factors that interact with these proteins and to elucidate the mitochondrial-specific repair pathways.
This systematic review aimed to investigate the association between social determinants of health and the risk of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The review included 90 studies that measured the relationship between crowding, dwelling characteristics, education, employment, income, nutrition, or socioeconomic status and the risk of GAS infection, ARF, or RHD. The majority of studies (57.1%) reported a significant association between socioeconomic determinants and the risk of GAS infection, while 50% reported a significant association with ARF/RHD. Crowding was the most frequently assessed factor, with 14 studies examining its relationship with GAS infection and 36 studies examining its relationship with ARF/RHD. The majority of studies assessing crowding, dwelling characteristics, education, and employment status of parents or cases, and nutrition reported a positive association with the risk of GAS infection, ARF, or RHD. Crowding and socioeconomic status met the criteria for a causal association. However, the literature examining the role of social determinants in GAS infection, ARF, and RHD risk lacks quality, with most studies being observational and not interventional. The review suggests that crowding is a practical target for prevention actions to reduce the risk of GAS infection and ARF/RHD.
Researchers studied the PhoQ/PhoP bacterial signaling network, a well-studied two-component system found in many bacteria. They discovered that a single point mutation in the PhoQ protein, which abolishes its phosphatase activity, results in a significant change in the network's behavior. The mutant PhoQ protein leads to a bistable response to stimuli, meaning the cells can exist in two distinct states: an "on" state and an "off" state. This is in contrast to the wild-type PhoQ protein, which responds to stimuli in a graded manner. The mutant cells in the "on" state have different morphologies than those in the "off" state, and their state is inherited over many generations. External conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the "on" state. Mathematical modeling and experiments suggest that the bistability depends on positive autoregulation of the two key proteins in the circuit, PhoP and PhoQ. However, the "on" state has a lower fitness than the "off" state, and a population of "on" cells can become epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state due to the high inheritance of the "on" state. This study demonstrates the versatility of the prototypical two-component signaling architecture and highlights the tradeoffs in the PhoQ/PhoP system.
Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare but devastating infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. Current treatment options for PAM are limited, and the high mortality rate makes it a significant public health concern. To address this issue, researchers have turned to drug repurposing, a cost-effective strategy to apply known drugs for the treatment of rare or neglected diseases. A promising approach is to target the sterol biosynthesis pathway, which is essential for the growth and survival of N. fowleri. Similar to fungi, N. fowleri requires ergosterol, a building block of plasma and cell membranes, which can be disrupted by small-molecule inhibitors. The sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51) is a key enzyme in the sterol biosynthesis pathway, and its inhibition has been shown to be effective against fungal pathogens. The N. fowleri genome encodes a CYP51 enzyme with a high degree of similarity to fungal orthologues, suggesting that anti-fungal drugs targeting CYP51 could be repurposed for the treatment of PAM. In this study, researchers systematically assessed the impact of anti-fungal azole drugs on N. fowleri and identified the endogenous CYP51 substrate. The results validated CYP51 as a potentially druggable target in N. fowleri and conazole drugs as potential candidates for the treatment of PAM.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) in maintaining and recalling protective immunity against nematode infections. Nematode parasites trigger a type 2 immune response in the host, which is mediated by IL-4Rα. However, it was unclear whether IL-4Rα is required for maintaining this response after it has been established. To address this question, the researchers used a mouse model where the IL-4Rα gene could be deleted at specific times. They found that sustained expression of IL-4Rα is necessary for maintaining type 2 immune responses and protecting against nematode infections. When IL-4Rα signaling was disrupted after the immune response had been established, the mice were unable to clear the infection. Furthermore, the researchers found that IL-4Rα signaling is also required for the recall of type 2 immune responses during secondary infections. When IL-4Rα signaling was disrupted before a secondary infection, the mice had a reduced ability to recall the immune response and clear the infection. These findings suggest that IL-4Rα plays a critical role in maintaining and recalling protective immunity against nematode infections, beyond its established role in initiating the immune response.
A global analysis of Bartonella bacteria, which cause various human infections, has revealed the impact of human activity on the distribution of these bacteria in mammals. The study analyzed the largest collection of Bartonella gltA genotypes, including 67 new genotypes, and found that the genus likely originated as an environmental bacterium and insect commensal before infecting mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or key hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. The study also found evidence of exchange of Bartonella between phylogenetically distant domestic animals and wildlife, likely due to increased contact.

The research suggests that humans, domestic animals, and wildlife should be kept separate to protect the health of all. The study's findings demonstrate that Bartonella is a valuable system for examining the effects of human activity on the spread of infectious diseases within and between species, across landscapes, and globally. Phylogenetic inferences about the origin of infections should be interpreted with caution due to the influence of available data and sampled taxa.

The study constructed large global phylogenies of Bartonella from 16s rRNA genes and citrate synthase (gltA) to determine the evolutionary history of Bartonella, patterns of host switching, and geographic constraints, as well as its spillover into humans or from human commensals into wild species. The research highlights the importance of considering a broad range of potential animal hosts and screening for a wide range of Bartonella genotypes when investigating the source of a suspected Bartonella infection.
Researchers have investigated the role of long noncoding RNA MALAT1 in regulating cell cycle progression. They found that MALAT1 is upregulated in cancer tissues and is associated with hyper-proliferation, but the underlying mechanism was not well understood. The study demonstrated that MALAT1 levels are regulated during normal cell cycle progression and modulates the expression of cell cycle genes. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed that MALAT1 is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT1 led to the activation of p53 and its target genes, indicating that p53 is a major downstream mediator of MALAT1 activity. Furthermore, MALAT1-depleted cells displayed reduced expression of B-MYB, an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2/M progression, due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MYB pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. The study suggests that MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle-regulated transcription factors. The findings provide mechanistic insights into the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation and suggest that abnormal expression of MALAT1 in specific cell types or tissues may contribute to tumor progression by leading to aberrant alternative splicing and misexpression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and/or cell death.
Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating insect growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction. While its action in repressing larval metamorphosis is well understood, the molecular basis of its role in promoting adult reproduction is not fully elucidated. Researchers have identified the methoprene-tolerant (Met) gene as the JH receptor, which mediates JH action during metamorphosis and vitellogenesis. However, the precise mechanism underlying JH's role in vitellogenesis, the process of egg yolk protein synthesis, has been lacking.

Using RNA interference (RNAi) to phenocopy a JH-deprived condition in migratory locusts, researchers found that JH stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitellogenesis. They discovered that two genes, Mcm4 and Mcm7, which are involved in the DNA replication pathway, are expressed in the presence of JH and Met. Depletion of Mcm4 or Mcm7 inhibited de novo DNA synthesis and polyploidization, resulting in reduced vitellogenin mRNA levels and impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth.

Further analysis revealed that Met directly regulates the transcription of Mcm4 and Mcm7 by binding to upstream consensus sequences with E-box or E-box-like motifs. This suggests that the JH-receptor complex acts on Mcm4 and Mcm7 to regulate DNA replication and polyploidy for vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. These findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of JH's role in promoting adult reproduction and highlight the importance of Mcm4 and Mcm7 in this process.
A randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the optimal duration of prednisolone treatment for patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI) in leprosy. The study, known as the "Treatment of Early Neuropathy in Leprosy" (TENLEP) trial, compared the effectiveness of 20-week and 32-week prednisolone courses in restoring and improving nerve function. A total of 868 patients with recent NFI (less than 6 months) were randomly assigned to either a 20-week or 32-week prednisolone treatment regimen. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function at 78 weeks. Secondary outcomes included improvements in the Reaction Severity Scale, the SALSA Scale, and the Participation Scale.

The results showed that the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups, with 78.1% in the 20-week arm and 77.5% in the 32-week arm. Similarly, there were no significant differences in secondary outcomes, except for a higher proportion of serious adverse events in the longer treatment arm. The study found that a 20-week course of prednisolone was as effective as a 32-week course in improving and restoring recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients. Therefore, 20 weeks is considered the preferred initial treatment duration for leprosy neuropathy, after which only a minority of patients may require further individualized treatment.
Researchers studied the vocalization patterns of male Rocky Mountain elk and European Red Deer to understand the relationship between sound complexity and anatomy/physiology. A finite element model of the larynx and a wave propagation model of the vocal tract were used to simulate the sound production of both species. The study found that elk produce loud and high-frequency bugles, while Red Deer produce loud and low-frequency roaring calls. The model revealed that high-frequency bugles require both large muscular effort and high lung pressure, but can achieve at least 10 dB more intensity level than low-frequency calls. The study also found that glottal efficiency, the ratio of radiated sound power to aerodynamic power at the glottis, is higher in elk, suggesting an advantage of high-pitched signaling. This advantage is due to lower airflow required for aerodynamic power and an acoustic radiation advantage at higher frequencies. The study suggests that the high-frequency bugle may signal muscular strength and endurance, while the low-frequency call relates to overall body size. The findings have implications for understanding the evolution of vocal communication in mammals and highlight the importance of glottal efficiency in sound production.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) data that incorporates reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome, known as multi-reads. Traditional ChIP-seq analysis relies on using only reads that map uniquely to a relevant reference genome, known as uni-reads, which can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads. The new approach, which allocates multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme, significantly increases sequencing depths and leads to the detection of novel peaks that are not identifiable with uni-reads alone. Using human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets, the researchers found that incorporation of multi-reads increases sequencing depths by up to 25% and identifies novel peaks that reside in highly repetitive and low mappability regions. These peaks have similar characteristics to those identified by uni-reads, except that the majority of them reside in segmental duplications. The researchers validated a number of GATA1 multi-read only peaks by independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis and identified novel target genes of GATA1. This study establishes that multi-reads can be of critical importance for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments.
Researchers estimated the economic benefits to individuals of achieving the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) targets for four neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) controlled or eliminated by innovative and intensified disease management (IDM): human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease. The study used a systematic literature review to gather data on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) related to these NTDs, which were combined with projections of the number of people affected by each disease in different countries and years. The researchers compared an ideal scenario where the 2020 targets are met with a counterfactual scenario where the situation in 1990 remained unchanged. The economic benefit was calculated as the difference between the two scenarios. The total global productivity gained for the four IDM-NTDs was estimated to be $23.1 billion (15.9-34.0 billion) in 2011-2020 and $35.9 billion (25.0-51.9 billion) in 2021-2030. The reduction in OPPs was estimated to be $14 billion ($6.7 billion) and $18 billion ($10.4 billion) for the same periods. The study found that the economic benefits of achieving the targets far exceed the necessary investments by endemic country governments and their development partners, representing good value for money in improving well-being and reducing inequity.
A widely accepted theory in neuroscience suggests that neurons with higher selectivity, or the ability to respond to a narrower range of sensory inputs, carry more information about external sensory inputs. However, a recent study in the auditory cortex challenges this notion. The study found that the amount of information encoded by a population of neurons is not dependent on their selectivity, but rather on the total number of spikes in a given time window. In the auditory cortex, neurons initially respond to a wide range of sounds and then become more selective in their responses over time. Despite this change in selectivity, the study found that the population of neurons conveys similar information about sound inputs during both the initial and sustained response epochs. The results suggest that the prevailing theory of neuronal responses in the auditory cortex, which posits that unselective onset responses encode the presence of sounds and selective sustained responses encode the identity of sounds, may not be accurate. The study's findings imply a novel principle of sensory encoding that may be shared among multiple sensory systems. The results also highlight the importance of considering the total number of spikes in a population, rather than just the selectivity of individual neurons, when evaluating the amount of information encoded.
Researchers investigated the role of OX40, a co-stimulatory molecule, in controlling persistent viral infections. They found that OX40 plays a crucial role in maintaining anti-viral T cell responses during chronic viral infections. In contrast to acute viral infections, where T cell responses are short-lived, chronic viral infections require sustained T cell activity to control viral replication and prevent spreading. The study focused on LCMV clone 13 infection, a model of persistent viral infection, and found that mice lacking the OX40 receptor failed to accumulate sufficient anti-viral T cells. As a result, these mice were unable to control the infection over time. The researchers also observed that the emergence of germinal center responses and LCMV-specific antibodies was severely impaired in OX40-deficient mice. OX40 signaling promotes long-term survival of T cells, which is essential for controlling persistent viral infections. The study highlights the importance of OX40 in sustaining cellular and humoral immunity during viral persistence and has implications for understanding T cell dysfunction in persistent viral infections in humans. The findings suggest that OX40 is a key factor in maintaining anti-viral T cell responses, particularly in the context of chronic viral infections.
Researchers have identified a remarkable example of convergent evolution in aquatic animals, where a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three different phyla. This optimal method, characterized by a specific ratio of undulation length to fin amplitude, is found in a diverse group of aquatic animals, including cuttlefish, cartilaginous and bony fish, and other invertebrates. The researchers call this optimal ratio the "optimal specific wavelength" (OSW), which maximizes the force generated by the body and, in turn, swimming speed.

The OSW is consistently around 20, regardless of the animal's morphology, suggesting a common mechanical basis for this optimality. The researchers hypothesize that the regulation of OSW, axial elongation, and fin elongation in these animals may be influenced by common genetic networks, similar to those found in the convergent evolution of the electric organ. By analyzing the OSW and the mean undulation amplitude, the researchers can predict the number of undulations that should be present along the fin of a swimming animal, cruising at any velocity.

This study highlights the convergence of swimming patterns in aquatic animals, from invertebrates to vertebrates, and provides insights into the physical principles underlying this phenomenon. The findings suggest that evolution may converge to the same result or diverge to a wide variety of solutions, depending on the physical constraints and selective pressures acting on the animals.
Researchers investigated the roles of two types of condensin complexes, condensins I and II, in neural stem cell (NSC) divisions during cerebral cortex development in mice. Condensins are evolutionarily conserved protein complexes essential for chromosome assembly and segregation in eukaryotes. The study found that both condensins I and II are crucial for NSC divisions and survival, with simultaneous depletion of both leading to severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, DNA damage, and p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condensins I and II resulted in slower loss of NSCs compared to simultaneous depletion, but displayed distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation was more prominent in NSCs depleted of condensin II, while mitotic delays were detectable only in condensin I-depleted NSCs. Notably, NSCs depleted of condensin II displayed hyperclustering of pericentric heterochromatin and nucleoli, indicating that condensin II plays a critical role in establishing interphase nuclear architecture. These defects were also observed in postmitotic neurons. The study demonstrates that condensins I and II have both overlapping and non-overlapping functions in NSCs, and provides evolutionary insight into the intricate balancing acts of the two condensin complexes.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and sexual differentiation in Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis in humans. The study analyzed the whole transcriptome of S. mansoni in a stage- and sex-comparative manner, examining five developmental stages: cercariae larvae, three in vivo schistosomulum stages, and adults. The results showed that 7,168 genes were differentially expressed between sexes in at least one developmental stage, with 4,065 of them functionally annotated. The study also analyzed H3K27me3 histone modification using ChIP-Seq before and after the appearance of phenotypic sexual dimorphism. The findings suggest that sexual differentiation in S. mansoni is accompanied by distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes of known players of the host-parasite crosstalk, genetic determinants, and epigenetic regulators. The study identified candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-biased players of the interaction with the vertebrate host, and different dynamics of the H3K27me3 histone mark between sexes as an illustration of sex-biased epigenetic landscapes. The results provide new insights into the reproductive function of S. mansoni and represent a promising source of therapeutic targets for the treatment of schistosomiasis.
Researchers have proposed an approach to model disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts. The method assigns a confidence value to each annotation, representing the posterior probability that it is correct. Two probabilistic models were developed to perform this analysis, and their performance was evaluated using computer simulations and a large dataset generated by human annotators. The dataset consisted of 10,000 sentences annotated by a group of eight experts, with a 1,000-sentence subset further annotated by five new experts. The models were able to significantly increase the probability of choosing the correct annotation, even in the worst-case scenario where all annotators disagreed. The approach is general and can be applied to most data annotation studies. A corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated according to several cardinal dimensions is made publicly available. The study aims to improve existing curation approaches by providing a holistic method to quantify certainty in individual annotations and retain the complete dataset for training and testing machine learning methods. The models for annotation reliability were validated through a second cycle of annotation, where five additional annotators annotated a subset of 1,000 sentences. The study highlights the importance of conducting small-scale annotation experiments to estimate error rates specific to the task and annotator experts, which can be used to assign confidence to data annotated by a single expert.
Researchers have developed a potential treatment for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a deadly disease caused by Andes virus (ANDV) and ANDV-like viruses in South America. The treatment involves using a DNA vaccine to produce antiviral biologics, specifically polyclonal neutralizing antibodies, in geese. The geese are vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding the ANDV envelope glycoproteins, resulting in the production of IgY and IgYΔFc antibodies in their egg yolks. These antibodies are then purified and tested for their ability to neutralize the virus.

Studies have shown that the IgY and IgYΔFc antibodies produced in the geese are highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of the ANDV envelope glycoproteins and are capable of neutralizing the virus. In a hamster model of lethal HPS, the antibodies were tested for their protective efficacy when administered post-exposure. The results showed that both the immune sera and purified IgY/IgYΔFc antibodies from the vaccinated geese protected 8 of 8 and 7 of 8 hamsters, respectively, from developing lethal HPS. In contrast, hamsters that received IgY/IgYΔFc from non-vaccinated geese or no treatment developed the disease.

These findings demonstrate the potential of the DNA vaccine/goose platform to produce a candidate antiviral biologic product capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure. The use of geese as a source of antibodies offers several advantages, including the ability to produce high concentrations of antibodies and a well-defined lineage of birds. The results of this study suggest that this platform could be a viable alternative to using human convalescent sera or mammalian antibodies, which are in short supply or have risks of reactogenicity in humans.
Research has shown that changes in DNA methylation patterns play a significant role in the development of human cancers. The Dnmt3a enzyme is essential for establishing normal methylation patterns, and mutations in Dnmt3a have been linked to leukemias. In a mouse model of lung cancer, deletion of Dnmt3a was found to promote tumor progression, suggesting that the enzyme may suppress tumor development by maintaining DNA methylation patterns. To investigate this further, researchers used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to characterize the methylomes of Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient mouse lung tumors. The results showed that Dnmt3a wildtype tumors had large hypomethylated domains corresponding to nuclear lamina-associated domains, while Dnmt3a-deficient tumors had a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Further analysis revealed that Dnmt3a is required for efficient maintenance methylation of active chromosome domains and that Dnmt3a-deficient tumors showed moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. These findings provide new insights into the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer and uncover conserved features of cancer methylomes. The study suggests that Dnmt3a acts as a tumor suppressor gene by protecting active chromosome domains against cancer-associated hypomethylation.
Researchers have identified a specific pattern of neural activity in the premotor cortex of songbirds that supports the generation of sparse sequences of neural activity. This pattern is characterized by a length scale of 100 micrometers, within which basal-ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons fire at a specific phase of a local 30 Hz network rhythm. The study used multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging to observe neural activity in the premotor cortex of singing birds. The results show that neural activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, and that a mesoscopic dynamical pattern underlies the generation of the neural sequences controlling song.

The researchers found that the relationship between time and space in the premotor cortical area HVC is neither random nor globally organized as a traveling wave, but rather clustered on a 100 μm length scale. A 30 Hz rhythm, revealed in the local field potential and correlated with inhibition, influences the timing of at least one projection neuron subtype, HVCX. This rhythm is coherent over a length scale matching that of projection neuron calcium activity.

The study suggests that the premotor cortical microcircuit is composed of multiple pools of excitatory neurons that drive local interneuron populations, with inhibitory neurons showing patterned activity throughout song and projection neurons firing sparsely. The findings raise the possibility that spatial clustering and 30 Hz rhythmic alternation of excitatory and inhibitory cells may be a recurring feature of cortical motor microcircuits and critical for the sequential organization of behavior.
Researchers investigated the role of evolutionarily conserved genes in regulating lifespan in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They screened 2,700 genes essential for the worm's development and identified 64 genes that, when inactivated post-developmentally, extended lifespan. These genes are highly conserved across species, from yeast to humans, and are involved in various cellular processes, including insulin and metabolic pathways, translation, RNA, and chromatin regulation. Many of these genes, when inactivated early in development, caused growth arrest at larval stages, and some of these arrested animals lived longer than wild-type adults. The researchers found that the transcription factor daf-16 is required for the enhanced survival of arrested larvae, suggesting that the increased longevity is a physiological response to the essential gene inactivation. This study suggests that insulin-signaling pathways play a role in regulating aging at any stage of life. The findings also highlight the importance of considering the developmental stage at which genes are inactivated when studying aging and longevity. The study's results provide new insights into the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that regulate lifespan and may have implications for understanding human aging and age-related diseases.
Researchers conducted a forward genetic screen in zebrafish to identify genes involved in fin regeneration. They found that a temperature-sensitive allele of the laminin beta 1a (lamb1a) gene impairs fin regeneration. Laminin beta 1a is a component of the extracellular matrix and is sharply induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation. This induction is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial cell layer, which in turn facilitates the expression of morphogenetic factors such as shha and lef1, patterning of new osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. The researchers found that lamb1a function is dispensable for juvenile body growth, homeostatic adult tissue maintenance, repair of split fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblasts. However, fgf20a mutations or transgenic Fgf receptor inhibition disrupt lamb1a expression, suggesting a link between Fgf signaling and epithelial maturation during regeneration. The study reveals that transient induction of lamb1a in epithelial cells is a key step in the formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis. This epidermis is critical for the localization of signaling receptors, expression of key morphogenetic signals, osteoblast patterning, and bone regeneration. The findings suggest that the regeneration epidermis is shaped by a network of growth factor-extracellular matrix regulatory interactions.
Researchers compared various methods for accounting for relatedness in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using family-based data. They evaluated six linear mixed model (LMM) approaches, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA, and MMM, and compared them to traditional family-based association tests and alternative approaches implemented in MQLS, ROADTRIPS, and MASTOR. The researchers applied these methods to a GWAS of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families, comprising 3626 individuals, and to simulated data. They found strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches, and all were successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate, except for some approaches when applied to longitudinal data with many repeated measures. The LMM approaches also showed high correlation with alternative approaches, except for transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. The study concluded that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches and are a convenient and robust method for family-based GWAS of quantitative or binary traits. The choice of LMM implementation should be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use, rather than power or type I error considerations.
Researchers have identified three heteroaromatic compounds, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, with high activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. These compounds were selected from a 2000-compound chemical library through a high-throughput screening process using a recombinant T. cruzi strain expressing β-galactosidase. The compounds showed low toxicity to host cells in vitro and inhibited the intracellular proliferation of T. cruzi amastigotes. Each compound has a distinct mechanism of action: CX1 exhibits trypanocidal activity, NT1 has a trypanostatic effect, and PCH1 affects parasite division. These compounds also demonstrated high activity against intracellular T. cruzi from the Y strain and against related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L. amazonensis. Further analysis of chemically related molecules led to the selection of two compounds, PCH6 and CX2, with IC50 values of 2 nM, approximately 100 times lower than the current medicines used to treat T. cruzi. These findings provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.
Researchers have developed a novel point-of-collection diagnostic platform, referred to as "Backpack PCR," for the rapid detection of Brugia parasites in mosquitoes. This platform combines a rapid DNA extraction method using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with a portable, battery-powered PCR (polymerase chain reaction) platform and a test strip-based DNA detection assay. The system is designed to be compact enough to fit into a small backpack, making it suitable for use in resource-limited settings.

The researchers evaluated the performance of the Backpack PCR platform by comparing it to standard silica column-based DNA extraction techniques and real-time PCR. They found that the NaOH-based DNA extraction method was rapid and effective, and the test strip-based detection assay provided sensitive and genus-specific detection of parasite DNA. The platform was also compared to conventional PCR coupled with gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR, and was found to be comparable in terms of sensitivity and specificity.

The Backpack PCR platform has the potential to greatly expand the reach of molecular xenomonitoring (MX) efforts for lymphatic filariasis, a disease caused by Brugia parasites. The system eliminates the need for expensive and bulky instrumentation, making it an attractive option for laboratories in endemic areas. The researchers also demonstrated the potential for the platform to be adapted for the detection of other mosquito-transmitted pathogens, such as Wuchereria bancrofti, which is responsible for approximately 90% of the global lymphatic filariasis burden.
Researchers conducted a theoretical study to investigate the impact of domain architecture on the self-assembly and structural integrity of elastomeric proteins. Elastomeric proteins are composed of alternating domains of elastomeric and cross-linking elements, which provide elasticity and stability to the polymer, respectively. The study used a novel simulation environment based on a model of diffusion-limited aggregation to simulate the self-assembly of rod-like particles with different domain architectures. The simulation results showed that the relative length and number of elastomeric and cross-linking domains significantly impact the morphology and structural integrity of the resultant polymeric structure. The most highly connected polymers were found to be those constructed from asymmetric rods consisting of relatively large cross-linking elements interspersed with smaller elastomeric domains. The study provides insights into the evolution of elastomeric proteins and suggests that the relative size of the domains may influence the ability of these molecules to correctly align their cross-linking domains and stabilize the resulting polymeric matrix. The findings of this study may also guide the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides with specific properties. The simulation environment developed in this study can be used to explore the complex relationships between elastomeric domains and cross-linking domains, which is essential for understanding the molecular basis for the evolution of elastomeric proteins.
Researchers investigated the role of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the Ebola virus (EBOV) genome, specifically focusing on the 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the viral polymerase (L) mRNA. They found that the EBOV 5'-UTRs do not function as internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESes), but instead regulate cap-dependent translation. The L 5'-UTR, which contains an upstream AUG (uAUG), was found to suppress translation of the primary open reading frame (pORF) in a position-dependent manner. The uAUG was sufficient to initiate translation and was surrounded by a "weak" Kozak sequence. The presence of the uORF maintained translation of the L pORF under conditions where eIF2α was phosphorylated, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress.

The researchers generated a recombinant EBOV with a mutated L uAUG and found that this mutation attenuated virus growth to titers 10-100-fold lower than wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. These findings suggest that the L uAUG plays a crucial role in regulating EBOV polymerase expression and virus replication. The study identifies novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression and provides a potential therapeutic target.
Researchers have developed a method to precisely map DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human chromosomes, revealing non-random fragmentation and hotspots of DSBs scattered along chromosomes. These hotspots delimit protected DNA domains, approximately 50-250 kilobases in size, which contain coordinately expressed genes. About 30% of these domains, referred to as "forum domains," possess genes that are actively transcribed or silenced together.

The study found that PARP1, a protein involved in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation, and HNRNPA2B1, a nuclear RNA processing factor, specifically bind to DNA sequences at the termini of forum domains. This suggests a novel type of gene regulation, where DSB hotspots and PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 binding sites coordinate the transcription or silencing of gene clusters within large chromosomal domains.

The research highlights the relationship between human chromosomal fragile sites, chromosomal organization, and gene regulation, which may be important for understanding cancer genomics and gene therapy. The study's findings also indicate that the mapped breaks could correspond to fragile sites in human chromosomes, and that the technique can be used to study fragile chromosomal sites in various types of human cells.

The binding of PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 at the forum domain termini may influence coordinated transcription within these domains, and the detection of HNRNPA2B1 binding at thousands of sites throughout the human genome may shed light on its mechanistic role in chromosomal domain function.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the presence of trypanosomatids, a group of parasites, in bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study focused on two areas with different levels of degradation: Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu (REGUA) and Estação Fiocruz Mata Atlântica (EFMA). The researchers analyzed 181 bat specimens and found that 24 individuals (13%) were infected with trypanosomatids. Molecular characterization revealed that Trypanosoma dionisii was the most frequently detected parasite, followed by Trypanosoma cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV, and Trypanosoma sp. in Neotropical phyllostomid bats. Mixed infections were also observed.

The study found no significant difference in trypanosomatid infection rates between the two areas, with 15% in REGUA and 11% in EFMA. The researchers also identified Crithidia mellificae, a parasite typically found in insects, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas for the first time. The study suggests that bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro harbor a diverse range of trypanosomatids, contributing to the maintenance of these parasites in the sylvatic environment. The findings highlight the importance of including parasites that can potentially infect humans in studies of local biodiversity, particularly in areas with high human population density, such as Rio de Janeiro.
This study investigated the prevalence of pathogens and symbionts in Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in the French Ardennes. A total of 267 female ticks were analyzed for the presence of 37 pathogens, including bacteria and parasites, and four symbionts using high-throughput real-time PCR, rRT-PCR, and nested PCR. The results showed that 45% of the ticks were co-infected with up to five different pathogens, and when including symbionts, all ticks were infected with at least one microorganism, with up to eight microorganisms identified in a single tick. The study found a strong association between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii, but no significant interactions between symbionts and pathogens. The high co-infection rates in ticks raise concerns about the potential for co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals, and the consequences for human and animal health. The study also highlights the importance of considering symbionts in the context of tick-borne diseases, as they may play a role in pathogen transmission and vector competence. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiological situation of tick-borne pathogens in the French Ardennes, and highlights the need for further research into the interactions between pathogens and symbionts in ticks.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is governed by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels, and understanding the underlying molecular circuitry is crucial for hematopoiesis and developmental systems in general. The model reveals that dynamical models based on known interactions between PU.1 and GATA-1, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a feature necessary for robust lineage determination. A new mechanism involving a cofactor regulated by one of the master genes is proposed to achieve bistability and switch-like behavior. The PU.1-GATA-1 switch interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which inherits the state of its upstream master genes and reinforces the decision through feedback loops, leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through the recruitment of cofactors. The model suggests potential reprogramming strategies by perturbing the feedback between master regulators and downstream targets. This approach provides a framework for lineage commitment studies and could aid in the search for lineage-determining genes. The study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular circuitry underlying hematopoiesis and its relevance to developmental systems in general.
Researchers investigated the role of the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (EPA) in the virulence and resistance of Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen with high resistance to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system. They used random transposon mutagenesis to identify genes involved in lysozyme resistance and found that mutations in the EPA variable region, located downstream of the conserved epaA-epaR genes, increased resistance to lysozyme. The EPA variable region is responsible for decorating the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone, and the researchers found that this decoration is essential for resistance to charged antimicrobials and virulence in a zebrafish model of infection. The decoration of the EPA polysaccharide also confers resistance to phagocytosis. The study suggests that the production of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone alone is not sufficient to promote E. faecalis infections, and that the modification of this surface polymer is crucial for enterococcal pathogenesis. The researchers identified several genes involved in the decoration of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide, which play an essential role in resistance to effectors of the innate immune system and in virulence.
Researchers have developed a new model called RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation) to analyze gene expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This model combines data from two large databases: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). TCGA provides information on genetic and epigenetic factors such as copy number variation, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression, while ENCODE offers data on transcription factor (TF) binding. RACER uses a two-stage regression framework to integrate these data and predict gene expression levels in AML.

The model first infers sample-specific regulatory activities of TFs and microRNAs, which are then used to infer specific TF/microRNA-gene interactions. This approach overcomes a common challenge in integrating data from different sources. In a case study, the researchers applied RACER to AML data from TCGA and TF binding data from ENCODE. They verified the model's accuracy through 10-fold cross-validation and demonstrated its ability to recover known regulatory interactions.

RACER also identified 18 regulators whose activities clustered consistently with cytogenetic risk groups in AML. One of these regulators, miR-548p, was found to target genes involved in leukemia-related pathways, suggesting a novel role in AML pathogenesis. Additionally, the model identified C-Fos as a potential AML prognostic marker. Overall, RACER provides a novel framework for integrating TCGA and ENCODE data to reveal AML-specific regulatory programs at a global level.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA silencing in the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum higginsianum, which causes disease in various crops worldwide. They generated knock-out mutants affecting genes for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), Dicer-like (DCL), and Argonaute (AGO) proteins to study the function of RNA silencing in this fungus. The study found that mutants lacking DCL1, DCL2, and AGO1 proteins showed severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology, but not in vegetative growth. Analysis of total RNA transcripts and small RNA populations revealed that the greatest effects were observed in the Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2, and Δago1 strains, where a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colletotrichum higginsianum non-segmented dsRNA virus 1 (ChNRV1), was derepressed. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship between ChNRV1 and members of the segmented Partitiviridae family. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs associated with AGO1 revealed abundant loading of 5’U-containing viral siRNA. The study found that the conidiation and spore morphology defects were primarily caused by ChNRV1, suggesting that RNA silencing involving ChDCL1 and ChAGO1 in C. higginsianum functions as an antiviral mechanism.
A recent study investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) MOF in meiotic expansion of H2AX phosphorylation and spermatogenesis in mice. The study found that MOF is involved in all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation expansion, which occur during meiotic prophase I. The first wave is ATM-dependent and occurs at leptonema, while the second and third waves are ATR-dependent and occur at zygonema and pachynema, respectively. The third wave of H2AX phosphorylation marks and silences unsynapsed chromosomes.

Germ cell-specific deletion of Mof in spermatocytes using Stra8-Cre resulted in global loss of H4K16ac and defective spermatogenesis. In Mof-deficient mice, γH2AX signals were observed only along the chromosomal axes in leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes, and chromatin-wide H2AX phosphorylation was lost. In early-mid pachytene spermatocytes, γH2AX and MDC1 were detected along the unsynapsed axes of the sex chromosomes, but failed to expand, leading to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) failure. Additionally, defects in double-strand break (DSB) repair and crossover formation were observed in Mof-deficient spermatocytes, indicating that MOF facilitates meiotic DSB repair after RAD51 recruitment.

The study suggests that MOF regulates male meiosis and is involved in the expansion of all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation from the leptotene to pachytene stages, initiated by ATM and ATR, respectively. The findings provide new insights into the role of MOF in meiotic prophase I and its importance in spermatogenesis.
Researchers investigated the effects of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection on human T-cell development in a "Human Immune System" (HIS) Rag2-/-γc-/- mouse model. These mice were infected with HTLV-1 at a stage when the three main subpopulations of human thymocytes were present. The study found that the HTLV-1 provirus was integrated in thymocytes in all but two inoculated mice, and the proviral load increased with the length of the infection period. In HTLV-1-infected mice, alterations in human T-cell development were observed, with mature single-positive (SP) CD4+ and CD8+ cells being most numerous at the expense of immature and double-positive (DP) thymocytes. These SP cells also accumulated in the spleen. Human lymphocytes from the thymus and spleen were activated, as shown by the expression of CD25, which was correlated with the presence of tax mRNA and increased expression of NF-kB-dependent genes such as bfl-1, an anti-apoptotic gene. The study also observed hepato-splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and lymphoma/thymoma in HTLV-1-infected mice, several months after infection. These results demonstrate the potential of the HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- animal model to elucidate the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1.
A comprehensive schistosomiasis control project was implemented in the Al Jabalain locality of White Nile State, Sudan from 2009 to 2011. The project aimed to reduce the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis, particularly Schistosoma haematobium infection, among the local population. A total of 482,902 individuals, including 78,615 primary school students, were targeted for intervention. The study found that the overall prevalence of S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections at baseline was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. After 6-9 months post-treatment, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was significantly reduced to 13.5%. The reduction in prevalence was more pronounced among girls, those with moderately infected status, and residents in rural areas compared to boys, those with high prevalence, and residents in urban areas. Health education and the construction of a drinking water facility at Al Hidaib village also contributed to the reduction in infection rates. However, no significant change was observed in the prevalence of S. mansoni infection between baseline and follow-up surveys. Approximately 200,000 individuals received either praziquantel therapy, health education, or clean water supply. The project achieved a reduction of over 50% in the prevalence of S. haematobium infection compared to the baseline rate. The study highlights the importance of integrated control measures, including health education and clean water supply, in reducing the prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis.
Researchers have discovered that the matrix protein of the Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic emerging paramyxovirus, plays a critical role in viral budding through its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking. Unlike other paramyxoviruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, the NiV matrix protein is found in the nucleus at early stages of infection before localizing to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Mutations in the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in the NiV matrix protein impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and abolished viral budding. A highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS served dual functions: it mediated nuclear import and was a potential site for monoubiquitination, which regulates nuclear export of the protein. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV matrix protein budding, while depletion of free ubiquitin in the cell blocked viral budding. Live Nipah virus budding was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, with the FDA-approved drug bortezomib reducing viral titers with an IC50 of 2.7 nM. This finding opens up the possibility of using bortezomib as a therapeutic against acute NiV infection. The study suggests that the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the NiV matrix protein and associated post-translational modification play a critical role in matrix-mediated viral budding.
Researchers have developed an imaging assay to study the early events of poliovirus (PV) infection in live cells. The study aimed to understand how PV, a nonenveloped virus, delivers its genetic material across the cellular membrane and into the cell. The researchers used a dual-labeled PV, where the viral capsid and RNA were labeled with distinct fluorophores, and combined it with biochemical assays to measure RNA release. They found that PV binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters the cell through an endocytic mechanism that is independent of clathrin, caveolin, and flotillin, but dependent on actin and tyrosine kinase. The genome release occurs rapidly and efficiently, taking place within 100-200 nm of the plasma membrane, in vesicles or tightly sealed membrane invaginations. This process does not limit the overall infectivity or infection rate of the virus. The study resolves a long-standing debate on whether PV directly breaks the plasma membrane barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell. The imaging assay used in this study is expected to be applicable to the investigation of entry mechanisms for other nonenveloped viruses. The findings provide new insights into the early events of PV infection and have implications for understanding the biology of nonenveloped viruses.
In rural Cambodia, dengue fever remains a significant public health concern, particularly among children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) relies heavily on health education to prevent and control the disease. However, a process evaluation conducted in eastern Cambodia in 2003-2004 revealed that community and school-based health education efforts are insufficient, underfunded, and irregular. Community health education is delivered through outreach activities and campaigns, but lacks systematic evaluation and follow-up. School-based education is restricted in terms of time and lacks practical activities for prevention and control. As a result, adherence to dengue prevention and control measures is partial.

The study highlights the need for sustained routine education and approaches to ensure the translation of knowledge into practice. Health education plays a crucial role in informing and encouraging people to participate in preventing and controlling dengue, but its efficacy is complicated by economic, political, and infrastructural factors in resource-poor countries like Cambodia. Local prevention and control activities, involving community members and supported through health education, offer potential to reduce dengue prevalence, but are hindered by poorly resourced and episodic health education. The study suggests that political commitment and availability of educational resources are critical factors impacting outreach activities. Existing dengue health education messages, materials, and strategies need to be redefined to be practical, applicable, and relevant, and health practitioners require training in health education techniques to effectively deliver these programs.
Researchers investigated the presence of microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes into the bloodstream of infected hosts. Filarial nematodes cause chronic and debilitating diseases in humans and animals. The study used deep sequencing and bioinformatics to identify over 200 mature miRNA sequences of potential nematode origin in Dirofilaria immitis-infected dog plasma and 21 in Onchocerca volvulus-infected human serum. Two miRNA candidates, miR-71 and miR-34, were targeted for further analysis using stem-loop RT-qPCR assays. These assays were able to discriminate between infected and uninfected samples, with miR-71 and miR-34 detected in all four samples from dogs infected with D. immitis. However, the absolute miRNA copy numbers were not significantly correlated with microfilaraemia, which may be due to the imprecision of mf counts or miRNA contributions from unknown numbers of adult worms. The study also found that parasite-derived circulating miRNAs are present in plasma or serum even for species that do not live in the bloodstream, such as Brugia pahangi, which inhabits lymphatic vessels. The findings suggest that circulating miRNAs could be used as potential biomarkers for filarial infections.
Researchers have investigated the process of Src kinase activation, a crucial step in cellular signaling. Src kinases undergo significant structural changes when transitioning from an inactive to an active state. To understand this process, a coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain was developed, incorporating experimental structures of the inactive and active states. Simulations of conformational transitions revealed two major pathways for activation. The first pathway involves a coordinated switching mechanism among the αC helix, activation-loop, and β strands in the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. In the second pathway, the conformational change is coupled to a partial unfolding of the N-lobe region. A detailed analysis of the switching mechanism for the αC helix and activation-loop was also conducted. A Markov model was used to test its ability to account for the structural kinetics in the context of Src conformational changes. The results provide a framework for understanding the main features of the conformational transition taking place upon Src activation. A multi-state model with coarse-grained molecular representations was used to characterize the dynamical process of slow conformational changes involved in Src catalytic domain activation. The model suggests that there exist two parallel pathways, one of which is coupled with local unfolding of the N-lobe of the catalytic domain, and the other involves a coordinated switch between a network of the A-loop, αC helix, and β strands in the N-lobe.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying lethality in F1 hybrids between diverged parents, specifically in interploidy crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that crosses between diploid and tetraploid individuals can result in F1 lethality, which plays a role in polyploid speciation. The team identified a single large-effect QTL, DR. STRANGELOVE 1 (DSL1), and two QTL with epistatic relationships to DSL1, which affects the rate of postzygotic lethality via expression in the maternal sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL1 in an interval encoding the maternal effect transcription factor TTG2. Maternal parents carrying loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 suppressed the F1 lethality caused by paternal excess interploidy crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was similarly affected by both natural variation and ttg2 loss-of-function mutants. The study suggests that F1 lethality in polyploids could evolve rapidly due to the simple genetic basis of the natural variation and effects of single-gene mutations. Furthermore, the role of the sporophytically active TTG2 gene in interploidy crosses indicates that the developmental programming of the mother regulates the viability of interploidy hybrid offspring. Loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 isolated from both the Ler and Col backgrounds improved interploidy crossing success, indicating that allelic variation at TTG2 could explain the DSL1 QTL.
Researchers conducted a comparative study on the co-evolutionary patterns of bacterial pathogens in bats and rodents, focusing on Bartonella and Leptospira species. The study analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. The results showed significant co-evolutionary congruence between Bartonella and both rodent and bat hosts at a global level, indicating a close evolutionary relationship between the bacteria and their hosts. In contrast, the relationship between Leptospira and their bat hosts was non-significant, suggesting a lack of evolutionary congruence.

Event-based cophylogeny analyses revealed that Bartonella exhibits significant co-evolution with minimal host switching in both bat and rodent hosts, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has a high number of host switches. The study also found that the rodent-Bartonella and bat-Bartonella associations had the least number of host switches per parasite, indicating greater evolutionary congruence over time. The results suggest that the co-evolutionary patterns and frequency of host-switching events between bacterial pathogens and their hosts can be used to predict spillover between mammal reservoirs and ultimately to humans.
Researchers have developed a new framework to understand how undulatory swimmers, such as fish and eels, move through the water. This framework, called the forced damped oscillation framework, applies to both active and passive swimming, where movement is caused by muscle contractions or forces from the surrounding fluid. The study used a chain-link model to simulate undulatory swimming and found that muscle forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the body, which in turn cause translational motion. The researchers showed that relatively simple forcing patterns can lead to complex deformation kinematics, and that the frequency of the forcing relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is crucial for the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. The study also found that the power generated from muscle work is used to create body deformations, which are then dissipated into the surrounding fluid. A closed-form expression for swimming velocity was derived from a leading-order analysis of the equations of motion. The results suggest that optimal deformation kinematics for fast swimming can be achieved with relatively simple forcing patterns. The study's findings were confirmed by fully resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The research provides a unified understanding of swimming and sheds light on the optimal value of stiffness for maximum speed.
Researchers investigated whether genetic recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals can generate new strains of the human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr), responsible for sleeping sickness (Human African Trypanosomiasis, HAT) in East Africa. They found that genetic recombination between Tbr and the animal-infective subspecies Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Tbb) can indeed create new strains of the human pathogen. A single gene, SRA, is responsible for human infectivity in Tbr and can be transferred to Tbb through sexual reproduction. The researchers demonstrated this by tracking the inheritance of SRA in crosses of Tbr and Tbb set up by co-transmitting genetically-engineered fluorescent parental trypanosome lines through tsetse flies. The results showed that SRA was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds, creating new strains of Tbr with no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility. The study suggests that new strains of the human pathogen Tbr are being generated continuously by recombination with the larger pool of animal-infective trypanosomes, posing a risk for future outbreaks of HAT. The researchers conclude that the mobility of SRA by genetic recombination explains the observed genetic variability of Tbr in East Africa.
Researchers investigated the role of gap junction coupling in the development of Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), a condition caused by dysfunction of β-cells in the islets of Langerhans, leading to disrupted insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. They used a computational model to simulate islet electrical activity and insulin secretion in the presence of ATP-insensitive KATP channels, which are associated with NDM. The model was validated against experimental measurements of calcium (Ca2+) and insulin secretion in islets expressing these channels.

The study found that gap junction coupling strongly mediates the suppression of islet Ca2+ and insulin secretion in the presence of ATP-insensitive KATP channels. However, reducing gap junction coupling allowed for increased glucose-stimulated Ca2+ and insulin secretion. The model predicted that many mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, which cause NDM, could lead to significant recoveries in Ca2+ and insulin secretion upon reductions in gap junction coupling.

The researchers also examined the role of stochastic noise and cellular heterogeneity in mediating islet dysfunction. They found that reducing gap junction coupling can recover islet function and blunt diabetes caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8. The study suggests that gap junction electrical coupling contributes to the coordinated suppression of islet Ca2+ and insulin release caused by these mutations, and that reducing gap junction coupling may be a novel therapeutic option for NDM and other monogenic forms of diabetes.
Predicting the behavior of complex biological networks from their individual components is a significant challenge in systems and synthetic biology. A major obstacle to achieving this prediction is the context-dependent behavior of network modules, which is influenced by a phenomenon called retroactivity. Retroactivity is similar to loading and affects the dynamic performance of a module when it is connected to other modules. To address this issue, researchers have developed an analysis framework for gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity. This framework involves three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which can be computed from macroscopic parameters and the modules' topology. The internal retroactivity matrix quantifies the effect of intramodular connections on an isolated module's dynamics, while the scaling and mixing retroactivity matrices establish how intermodular connections change the dynamics of connected modules. By using these matrices and the dynamics of modules in isolation, researchers can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. The study also provides a quantitative metric to evaluate the robustness of a module's dynamic behavior to interconnection with other modules, which can be used to assess the modularity of natural networks and guide the design of synthetic systems to minimize retroactivity between modules.
Researchers have investigated recombination in the human pseudoautosomal region (PAR1), a short region of homology between the X and Y chromosomes, which is essential for proper chromosome disjunction in male meiosis. The PAR1 region has an exceptionally high male crossover rate, 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average. To understand the mechanism behind this high crossover rate, researchers constructed a fine-scale genetic map using African-American pedigrees and analyzed recombination rates inferred from linkage disequilibrium in human populations. They also identified direct PRDM9 binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells.

The study found that, in contrast to mice, PRDM9 localizes peaks of recombination in the human PAR1. Recombination is a rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1, and hotspot activities differ significantly among human populations. The researchers also found evidence that PAR1 hotspot positions have changed between humans and chimpanzees, with no evidence of sharing among the hottest hotspots.

The study suggests that PRDM9 remains responsible for positioning recombination events in humans, but other factors may aid this protein in producing a high overall crossover rate. The researchers propose that a chromatin configuration in meiosis may facilitate access by PRDM9 to a high fraction of its binding sites, contributing to the high crossover rate in PAR1. The genetic maps built and validated in this work are expected to aid research on this vital and fascinating region of the genome.
Researchers have identified a new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2A/KDM4A, known as ΔN-JMJD2A, which plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle differentiation. This isoform lacks the N-terminal demethylase domain and is upregulated during the differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes. Genome-wide expression profiling and siRNA knockdown experiments revealed that ΔN-JMJD2A is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression. Furthermore, ΔN-JMJD2A promotes the conversion of NIH3T3 cells into muscle cells when induced by MyoD. ChIP-on-chip analysis showed that ΔN-JMJD2A binds to genes involved in transcriptional control and is linked to gene activation. Specifically, ΔN-JMJD2A is recruited to the Myog promoter at the onset of differentiation, where it promotes the demethylation of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. This process is essential for the transcriptional activation of the Myog gene and the initiation of muscle-specific gene expression. The study suggests that ΔN-JMJD2A acts as a transcriptional co-activator for many genes induced during skeletal muscle differentiation, and its binding to the Myog promoter regulates H3K9 methylation, allowing Myog expression and promoting myotube differentiation. Overall, the induction of the ΔN-JMJD2A isoform is crucial for muscle differentiation by directing the removal of repressive chromatin marks at the Myog promoter.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is in its final stages, with only 25 reported cases in 2016, but global eradication requires certification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the absence of transmission in all countries. An economic evaluation of the GWEP was conducted to assess its cost-effectiveness in the end game, when the number of cases is low and the cost per case is high. The study estimated the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages from 1986 to 2030 and compared the GWEP to two alternative scenarios: doing nothing and control (surveillance and outbreak response). The results showed that the GWEP cost an estimated $11 (95% uncertainty interval, $4.70-$12.49) per case averted in the period 1986-2030. The cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted by the GWEP relative to doing nothing was estimated at $222 (118-372) in 1986-2030. The GWEP was found to be more cost-effective than control by 2030, and even if economic costs were twice as high as estimated, the GWEP would still be cost-effective relative to doing nothing. The study also considered the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP in terms of years of life lived without the risk of Guinea worm disease, making a case for finishing the end game, including certification of the absence of transmission.
Researchers investigated the complement inhibitory domain of the BBK32 protein from Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease. They found that the carboxy-terminal domain of BBK32, termed BBK32-C, binds and inhibits the initiating serine protease of the human classical complement pathway, C1r. The study also examined the function of BBK32 orthologues from other Lyme disease-associated Borrelia species, including B. afzelii and B. garinii. The results showed that the B. afzelii orthologue, BAD16-C, exhibited similar activities to BBK32-C, including high-affinity binding to C1r and C1 complex, and potent inhibition of the classical complement pathway. In contrast, the B. garinii orthologue, BGD19-C, bound C1 and C1r with high-affinity but exhibited reduced in vitro complement inhibitory activities. The researchers used site-directed mutagenesis to convert BBK32-C to resemble BGD19-C and found that the resulting chimeric protein, BXK32-C, mimicked the properties of BGD19-C. The crystal structure of BBK32-C was solved to 1.7Å limiting resolution, revealing an anti-parallel four-helix bundle fold with a fifth alpha-helix protruding from the helical core. The structure showed that the three residues targeted in the BXK32-C chimera are surface-exposed, suggesting their potential relevance in C1r binding and inhibition. The study provides new insight into complement evasion mechanisms of Lyme disease spirochetes and suggests that BBK32-mediated complement evasion activity is shared across major species of Lyme disease-associated spirochetes.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, undergoes significant changes in morphology and gene expression when transitioning from a commensal to a pathogenic state. Previous studies have identified various factors involved in this transformation, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling this switch remain unclear. Researchers investigated the role of post-translational phosphorylation in morphogenetic control, focusing on the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. They identified the Fkh2 transcription factor as a regulatory target of both Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1, in a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. Fkh2 undergoes a radical shift in its phosphorylation profile upon hyphal induction, mediated by Cdc28-Ccn1/Cln3 and Cbk1-Mob2. This shift activates Fkh2 to promote the expression of genes required for pathogenic processes. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that Fkh2 is phosphorylated at sites corresponding to the full Cdc28 consensus target sites. Mutational analysis showed that substitution of these phosphorylation sites with non-phosphorylatable alanine altered the yeast phosphorylation profile and abrogated the characteristic transformation to the hyphal profile. Transcript profiling of the phosphorylation site mutant revealed that the hyphal phosphorylation profile is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. The researchers also identified that Fkh2 interacts with the chromatin modifier Pob3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity. This study reveals a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event that subverts a key component of the cell cycle machinery to a role in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity.
Trypanosoma brucei, a human pathogenic parasite, has both de novo and salvage routes for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, making it non-auxotrophic for pyrimidines. Thymidine kinase (TK) is one of several salvage enzymes thought to be redundant to the de novo pathway. However, research reveals that TK is essential for growth and infectivity in a mouse model, and a catalytically active enzyme is required for its function. Unlike humans, T. brucei lacks dCMP deaminase (DCTD), which provides an alternative route to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DCTD rescues the RNAi growth phenotype and allows for the selection of viable TK null cells. Metabolite profiling shows a buildup of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides in TK-depleted cells. Knockout of cytidine deaminase (CDA) leads to thymidine/deoxyuridine auxotrophy, suggesting the presence of an unidentified 5'-nucleotidase that converts deoxypyrimidine nucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides. Bioinformatics analysis identifies several potential candidate genes encoding 5'-nucleotidase activity, including an HD-domain protein that catalyzes dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleotide 5'-monophosphates. The study concludes that TK is essential for thymine nucleotide synthesis, regardless of whether the nucleoside precursors originate from the de novo pathway or salvage. This reliance on TK in the absence of DCTD may be a shared vulnerability among trypanosomatids, providing a unique opportunity to target a diverse group of pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes with a single drug.
Researchers investigated how translation initiation occurs in prokaryotic mRNAs that lack a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, a ribosome-binding site essential for translation initiation in most prokaryotes. They conducted genome-wide searches in various prokaryotic groups and found that mRNAs without a Shine-Dalgarno sequence are generally less structured in their translation initiation region, with a minimum of mRNA folding at the start codon. Using reporter gene constructs in bacteria, the researchers provided experimental support for the idea that local RNA unfoldedness determines start codon recognition in Shine-Dalgarno-independent translation. They found that AUG start codons reside in single-stranded regions, whereas internal AUG codons are usually in structured regions of the mRNA. Bioinformatics analyses and experimental data suggest that the local absence of RNA secondary structure is necessary and sufficient to initiate Shine-Dalgarno-independent translation. This mechanism provides a plausible explanation for how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in the absence of a ribosome-binding site. The study found that a large fraction of transcripts is translated in a Shine-Dalgarno-independent manner in all prokaryotic systems, ranging from 15% in γ-proteobacteria to 100% in mitochondrial genomes. The results indicate that RNA unfoldedness is the major requirement for efficient start codon recognition in Shine-Dalgarno-independent translation initiation.
A study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) in patients treated with 20 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Bihar, India. Between 2007 and 2012, 8749 patients received Ambisome as first-line treatment, resulting in a high initial cure rate (99.3%) and low default rate (0.3%). Of the 8311 patients completing treatment, 24 (0.3%) returned with symptoms of PKDL, diagnosed through clinical history, appearance, and slit-skin smear examination. The median time to development of PKDL was 1.2 years (interquartile range: 0.8-2.2) following treatment. Comparison of demographic and clinical characteristics between patients who developed PKDL and those who did not did not identify any significant risk factors. However, the time to developing PKDL was significantly shorter with Ambisome compared to a subset of patients presenting with PKDL following previous sodium stibogluconate treatment for VL. The study found that PKDL following treatment with Ambisome appears to be infrequent, with no predictive risk factors identified. The shorter median time to developing symptoms of PKDL compared to conventional VL treatments should be considered when counseling patients treated with regimens including Ambisome. This study highlights the importance of monitoring outcomes and educating patients about the possibility of developing PKDL following treatment for VL.
Researchers studied the re-establishment of Chagas disease vectors, specifically Triatoma infestans, in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. They used continuous- and discrete-time models to analyze the dynamics of re-infestation and found a 6-month time lag between detection of a new infestation and dispersal events. The models showed that more new bug populations became established from May to November than from November to May, coinciding with a seasonal increase in dispersal distance. The probability of new bug establishment increased with increasing time since the last detected infestation. These findings challenge current understanding of T. infestans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge.

The researchers also addressed three aspects relevant to population control of T. infestans: the establishment rate of new local populations as a function of distance from existing local populations, possible mechanisms for the observed seasonality in bug establishment, and the effect of insecticide spraying and previous infestation on establishment rates. A continuous-time model was used to estimate within-season changes in establishment dynamics and time-dependent effects of insecticide spraying, while a discrete-time model was used to estimate the contribution of each source site to bug establishment. The study suggests that understanding the seasonality of bug dispersal intensity and distance is crucial for optimizing the timing of vector control.
Researchers investigated the effects of viral microRNA (miRNA) on the pathogenesis of polyomavirus SV40 infections in Syrian golden hamsters, a commonly used animal model for studying SV40. The study aimed to understand how SV40 miRNA influences the dynamics of viral DNA levels in infected tissues. Four different variants of SV40 were inoculated into young adult hamsters, and the animals were sacrificed at various time points up to 270 days post-infection. The results showed that all SV40 strains established persistent infections and cleared slowly, with a broad tissue tropism, infecting liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain tissues. The liver and kidney contained higher viral DNA loads than other tissues, with the kidney being the preferred site for long-term persistent infection.

The study also demonstrated the expression of SV40 miRNA in infected tissues and found that microRNA-negative mutant viruses produced higher viral DNA loads than wild-type SV40 in both liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regulatory regions displayed modestly higher viral DNA loads in the kidney than those with simple regulatory regions. Early viral transcripts were detected at higher levels than late transcripts in liver and kidney, and infectious virus was detected infrequently. The study also found that wild-type and microRNA-negative mutants of SV40 showed similar rates of transformation of mouse cells in vitro and tumor induction in weanling hamsters in vivo. The results suggest that SV40 miRNA plays a role in dampening viral DNA levels in infected tissues.
Researchers conducted the most comprehensive genome-wide scan for positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset allowed for improved statistical power and the application of new lineage- and clade-specific tests. Of approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR < 0.05) according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. The identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, as well as more specific functions such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A Bayesian analysis indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and non-selection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. PSGs were found to be expressed at significantly lower levels and in a more tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs. Genes specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast were significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment of PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.
Researchers have discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure in Staphylococcus aureus biofilms that promotes their integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that these fibers are composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). PSMs are known to be involved in biofilm disassembly, but this study found that when they aggregate into amyloid-like fibers, they stabilize the biofilm instead. Mutants of S. aureus that were unable to produce PSMs were more susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix-degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. The researchers also found that soluble PSM peptides disperse biofilms, while polymerized peptides do not. This suggests that the aggregation of PSMs into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms. The discovery of these amyloid-like fibers in S. aureus biofilms is significant, as it provides new insights into the mechanisms of biofilm formation and stability. The study's findings have implications for the development of new treatments for S. aureus infections, which often involve biofilm formation. The researchers demonstrated that synthetic S. aureus PSM peptides can self-assemble into amyloid-like fibers in vitro, and these fibers exhibit characteristics similar to known amyloid proteins. This suggests that the aggregation of PSMs into amyloid fibers is a key regulatory mechanism for their activity in the biofilm microenvironment.
Researchers have developed a novel antibody surrogate biomarker, Ab3, to monitor parasite persistence in patients infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Chagas disease affects over 6 million individuals in more than 20 countries, and monitoring parasite persistence is crucial for developing and evaluating treatments to control the disease. Current methods, such as serological assays and PCR testing, have limitations, including low and fluctuating parasitic loads in circulating blood.

A multiplex serology assay was designed to evaluate antibody diversity in 1654 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. The study found that Ab3 showed a strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence, as determined by PCR positive results. High and sustained Ab3 signals were associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, while a significant decline in Ab3 signals was observed in patients who cleared parasitemia after treatment with benznidazole.

Ab3 is a new surrogate biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients. The researchers hypothesize that Ab3 is induced and maintained by incessant stimulation of the immune system by tissue-based and shed parasites that are not consistently detectable by blood-based PCR techniques. A simple immunoassay measurement of Ab3 could be beneficial for monitoring the infectious status of seropositive patients.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus that causes severe joint and muscle pain, with chronic musculoskeletal pain persisting in a significant proportion of patients for months to years after initial infection. Despite the lack of replicating virus in joint-associated tissues of patients with persistent arthritis, viral RNA is detected months after acute infection. To identify the cells contributing to chronic disease, researchers developed a recombinant CHIKV that expresses Cre recombinase (CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre). This virus replicated in myoblasts and fibroblasts, inducing arthritis during the acute phase in mice and chronic disease, including persistent viral RNA and chronic myositis and synovitis, similar to wild-type virus. Using a tdTomato reporter mouse system, researchers identified a population of tdTomato+ cells that persisted for at least 112 days, predominantly consisting of myofibers and dermal and muscle fibroblasts. Treatment with an antibody against Mxra8, a host receptor for CHIKV, reduced the number of tdTomato+ cells and diminished chronic viral RNA levels, implicating these cells as the reservoir of chronic viral RNA. Isolation and flow cytometry-based sorting of tdTomato+ fibroblasts revealed that they harbor most of the persistent CHIKV RNA at chronic time points. This CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre and tdTomato reporter mouse system identifies the cells that survive CHIKV infection in vivo and are enriched for persistent CHIKV RNA, providing a useful tool for studying CHIKV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease.
Researchers applied dimensionality reduction methods to understand how neural population activity relates to brain function. However, it was unclear how these results generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials, or how they relate to the underlying network structure. To address this, the study applied factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models that mimic irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. The researchers compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction - shared dimensionality and percent shared variance - with neuron and trial count. They found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. The study also found that recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure. The results suggest that factor analysis provides a more nuanced characterization of single-trial population activity than principal component analysis.
Researchers have discovered that the quorum sensing molecule 2-amino acetophenone (2-AA), produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, modulates host immune responses in a way that increases the host's ability to cope with the pathogen. When mice were treated with 2-AA before infection, they had a 90% survival rate compared to 10% in non-treated infected mice. The study found that 2-AA activates key innate immune response pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, it also attenuates immune response activation upon pretreatment, likely by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. The researchers observed a transcriptionally regulated block of c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-κB activation, with relatively preserved activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. This led to the activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (c/EBPβ) and the formation of the c/EBPβ-p65 complex, which prevents NF-κB activation. The study suggests that 2-AA's ability to dampen inflammatory processes while increasing host survival and pathogen persistence is consistent with its role in signaling bacteria to switch to a chronic infection mode. The findings reveal a quorum sensing immunomodulatory signal that promotes original aspects of interkingdom communication, facilitating pathogen persistence while enabling host tolerance to infection.
Researchers have investigated the origin and evolution of the L1TD1 gene, which is derived from a LINE-1 (L1) retroelement and plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency in humans. The study found that L1TD1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, approximately 106 million years ago, and has since been lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. Despite this, L1TD1 has evolved under positive selection in primates and mice, suggesting that it has been recurrently selected for functional novelty. The researchers propose that L1TD1 may have originally evolved for genome defense against L1 elements, and later became incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. The study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology, and demonstrates that domesticated genes can adopt different functions in different lineages. The researchers also found that L1TD1 has been replenished with a more recent L1 ORF1 from the prosimian genome, and that its loss is associated with L1 extinction in several megabat lineages, but not in sigmodontine rodents. This suggests that L1TD1 may have a dual role in genome defense and pluripotency maintenance, and that its function can vary across different mammalian lineages. Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolution and function of the L1TD1 gene, and highlights the importance of retroelement gene domestication in shaping mammalian biology.
A highly conserved bacterial protein, YbeY, has been found to be essential for the pathogen Vibrio cholerae, playing critical roles in virulence, stress regulation, RNA processing, and ribosome quality control. Unlike in Escherichia coli, where YbeY is not essential, its loss in V. cholerae severely impairs the bacterium's ability to colonize mice, form biofilms, produce cholera toxin, and regulate virulence-associated small RNAs. YbeY is an endoribonuclease that processes the 3' end of 16S rRNA and is crucial for its assembly into 70S ribosomes. Depletion of YbeY in V. cholerae leads to the accumulation of 16S rRNA precursors and free ribosomal subunits, demonstrating its importance in ribosome quality control. The study also found that YbeY is part of a core set of RNases essential in most representative pathogens, highlighting its conserved function across species. Furthermore, the ybeY genes of several distantly related pathogens can complement an E. coli ΔybeY strain under various stress conditions, underscoring the high conservation of YbeY's activity in stress regulation. Overall, this research provides a comprehensive understanding of YbeY's physiological role in a human pathogen and its conserved function in essential cellular processes.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the structure of human transcription factor networks (TFNs) and the robustness of their gene expression phenotypes to genetic and environmental perturbations. They found that all 41 human cell and tissue-specific TFNs share a common assortativity signature, which is a measure of the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect. This signature confers phenotypic robustness to model TFNs. The researchers used publicly available DNaseI-seq data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types. They determined the extent to which each of the four components of the assortativity signature contributes to this robustness. The study suggests that degree assortativity provides an additional structural source of robustness in biological networks. Theoretical work has shown that TFN models with increased assortativity exhibit increased robustness to both mutation in cis-regulatory sites and to gene duplication. This occurs because increased assortativity may either shrink the average size of nested subgraphs within the network or increase the average number of regulatory links that separate TFs, both of which tend to dampen the phenotypic effects of mutations.
Researchers investigated how populations of inhibitory (INH) and excitatory (EXC) neurons in the rat somatosensory barrel cortex process stimulus-related information. They used large-scale multi-electrode arrays to record the activity of up to 74 neurons in anesthetized adult rats in response to whisker stimuli varying in location and frequency. The study found that individual INH neurons were better at discriminating between different stimuli than EXC neurons in granular and infra-granular layers. Additionally, ensembles of INH cells provided as much information about the stimuli as comparable ensembles containing the most informative EXC neurons, but with less redundancy. This suggests that INH neurons play a crucial role in processing sensory activity in the neocortical network. The results indicate that INH cells are more sharply tuned to different stimuli than EXC cells, with higher precision and lower adaptation at higher frequency stimulation. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the inhibitory system in orchestrating cortical activity and processing sensory information. The findings suggest that INH neurons dominate the information conveyed to the neocortical network, efficiently processing incoming sensory activity.
Researchers have engineered a living cell to perform a fundamental arithmetic operation, binary addition, using a novel approach based on riboregulation. This achievement demonstrates the potential of regulatory RNAs as key players in synthetic biology and paves the way for more complex RNA-based biocomputers. The system exploits post-transcriptional control to switch on tightly silenced genes with small RNAs and allosteric transcription factors to sense molecular signals. A genetic half adder was engineered in Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria, to sum two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations of IPTG and aTc. The result of the computation is reported as fluorescence amplitudes, with red fluorescence indicating the sum and green fluorescence indicating the carry. This design is more organized and scalable compared to previous genetic half adders, with a reduced genetic footprint due to the use of regulatory RNAs. The system is based on riboregulators of translation initiation, which are more versatile and designable than traditional transcription factors. This work builds on previous advances in RNA synthetic biology, including combinatorial logic gates, serial cascades, and feed-forward loops. The use of regulatory RNAs offers an alternative to protein-based regulation, which is limited by the number of available proteins and their propensity for composability and orthogonality with the host machinery.
Researchers investigated the inhibition of cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II) by ribonucleoside 5′-monophosphate analogues. cN-II plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular nucleotide pools by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5′-monophosphates. High levels of cN-II expression have been linked to poor patient outcomes in cancer treatment with cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. To understand its role in resistance to cancer therapy, researchers screened a class of chemical compounds called ribonucleoside phosphonates, which have a stable phosphorus-carbon linkage instead of the regular phosphoester bond. Six compounds were identified as better ligands than the natural substrate, inosine 5′-monophosphate (IMP). The binding strength of these compounds was analyzed in silico, revealing an impressive number of van der Waals contacts with three key cN-II residues: Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210. Experimental measurements confirmed that the three best phosphonate analogues induced a total inhibition of cN-II activity at 2 mM. This study highlights the importance of the non-hydrolysable phosphonate bond in designing new competitive cN-II inhibitors and the crucial role of hydrophobic stacking promoted by the three protein residues. The results suggest that nucleoside phosphonate derivatives can efficiently mimic nucleoside 5′-monophosphates and inhibit cN-II activity, making them potential candidates for cancer treatment.
A recent study has found evidence of prion infectivity in milk and colostrum from sheep incubating natural scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) disease. Contrary to previous assumptions that milk from TSE-affected ruminants is safe, the study detected consistent levels of infectivity in colostrum and milk from scrapie-affected ewes several months prior to clinical onset. Abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) was also detected in lacteal ducts and mammary acini of these ewes.

The study found that prion infectivity was present in milk and colostrum, not only from ewes with lymphoproliferative chronic mastitis, but also from those with lesion-free mammary glands. Bioassay revealed that infectivity could be recovered in the cellular, cream, and casein-whey fractions of milk and colostrum. The highest infectious titre measured in milk and colostrum was equivalent to that contained in 6 micrograms of a posterior brain stem from a terminally scrapie-affected ewe.

These findings suggest that both colostrum and milk from small ruminants incubating TSE could contribute to the animal TSE transmission process, either directly or through the presence of milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs. The study also raises concerns about the risk to humans of TSE exposure associated with milk products from ovine and other TSE-susceptible dairy species.
During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia from April 2014 to March 2015, a total of 16,370 laboratory samples were tested, resulting in the identification of 10,536 individuals, of whom 3,897 were confirmed cases of EVD. The study found significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola virus RNA. Young children and the elderly, as well as individuals from rural areas, were found to be at higher risk of death due to the disease. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period.

Data collection and management were challenging during the outbreak due to malfunctioning surveillance and reporting systems, resulting in missing and duplicate data. However, EVD diagnostic laboratories were able to systematically register basic demographic and clinical information of patients. The study's findings may contribute to a fuller understanding of the outbreak in Liberia and inform future investigations. The data were collected as part of the Ebola public health response in Liberia and were not anonymized, as they were not collected for research purposes.
Researchers have investigated the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase, a copper-containing enzyme that converts phenol to its corresponding ortho-quinone. Tyrosinase forms a complex with a "caddie" protein, which facilitates the transport of copper ions into the enzyme's active center. A specific residue, Tyr98, in the caddie protein is converted to a reactive quinone through the formation of μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper(II) and Cu(II)-dopasemiquinone intermediates. Despite extensive studies, the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase had not been clearly understood at an atomic level until now.

High-resolution cryo-trapped crystal structures of tyrosinase were determined, revealing a crucial step in the reaction mechanism: the movement of CuA, which induces a syn-to-anti rearrangement of copper ligands after the formation of μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper(II) core. This rearrangement places the hydroxyl group of the substrate in an equatorial position, allowing electrophilic attack by the Cu2O2 oxidant. UV-vis and resonance Raman spectroscopic analyses confirmed the conversion of Tyr98 to a reactive quinone through the formation of these intermediates.

The researchers propose a catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase toward the caddie Tyr98 residue, which involves the coordination preference determined by the oxidation state of copper and the protonation state triggering the generation of reaction intermediates. The binding position of the caddie Tyr98 residue may differ from that of a genuine substrate. This study provides new insights into the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase, a type 3 copper protein family that includes catechol oxidase and hemocyanin.
Researchers investigated the early stages of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, specifically the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit precursor. They focused on the first pre-60S particle, which contains 30 assembly factors, including 8 RNA helicases. One of these helicases, Dbp6p, is essential for the normal accumulation of the first pre-60S pre-ribosomal particle in yeast. The study found that Dbp6p associates with a complex of four assembly factors, Npa1p, Npa2p, Nop8p, and Rsa3p, prior to their incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosomal particles. Tandem affinity purifications revealed that Npa1p forms the backbone of this complex. The researchers demonstrated that Npa1p and Npa2p directly bind Dbp6p and that Npa1p is essential for the insertion of the Dbp6p helicase within 90S pre-ribosomal particles. In vivo cross-linking analysis mapped Npa1p binding sites on 25S rRNA, suggesting that Npa1p and Dbp6p function in the formation and/or clustering of root helices of large subunit rRNAs, which creates the core of the large ribosomal subunit RNA structure. The study also found that Npa1p cross-links to snoRNAs involved in decoding center and peptidyl transferase center modifications and in the immediate vicinity of the binding sites of these snoRNAs on 25S rRNA. These findings suggest that the Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex play key roles in the compaction of the central core of 25S rRNA and the control of snoRNA-pre-rRNA interactions.
Researchers investigated the role of catecholamines, specifically norepinephrine and dopamine, in regulating learning rate in a dynamic environment. They used a predictive-inference task to measure prediction error and learning rate in 32 participants. The study found that the P3 component of the EEG, an electrophysiological index of phasic catecholamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of prediction-error magnitude on learning rate. This suggests that the phasic catecholamine response following surprising outcomes drives subsequent increases in learning rate. The study also found that P3 amplitude mediated the effects of unexpectedness of an outcome and uncertainty of a preexisting belief on learning rate. Furthermore, a pharmacological manipulation of catecholamine activity affected learning rate following unanticipated task changes, in a way that depended on participants' baseline learning rate. These findings provide converging evidence for a causal role of the human catecholamine systems in learning-rate regulation as a function of environmental change. The study's results support a role of the catecholamine systems in incorporating new unexpected observations into beliefs about the causal structure of the environment.
A syndromic surveillance system called EPIMIC was implemented in two rural villages in Senegal to monitor infectious diseases. The system uses data from Point-of-Care (POC) laboratories to detect abnormal epidemiological events. From 2010 to 2016, two POC laboratories were established in the Saloum region of Senegal, and EPIMIC was implemented to analyze data from these laboratories. Over five years, 2,577 patients were tested, and 739 were found to be positive for at least one of the 15 pathogens being monitored. The retrospective analysis of the data generated 443 alarms, indicating potential outbreaks or unusual disease patterns. The system was also implemented in a third POC laboratory in the Niakhar region, where 316 patients were tested, and 56 were found to be positive for at least one pathogen, generating 14 alarms. The results show that EPIMIC can be successfully implemented in rural areas of Senegal using data from POC laboratories. The system's ability to detect true epidemiological events with minimal human and economic resources makes it a valuable tool for infectious disease surveillance. The implementation of EPIMIC in Senegal demonstrates the potential for syndromic surveillance systems to improve global knowledge of infectious diseases, particularly in resource-limited settings. Further improvements are needed to enhance the system's capabilities, but the results suggest that EPIMIC can be an effective tool for monitoring infectious diseases in rural areas.
Researchers investigated the role of cellular architecture in collective calcium signaling and cell contractility in endothelial cells. They used a combination of computational modeling and plasma lithography micropatterning to study how the arrangement of endothelial cells affects their response to histamine, a chemical stimulus. The study found that endothelial cells in self-assembled and microengineered networks, but not individual cells or monolayers, exhibited calcium oscillations in response to histamine. This calcium oscillation was found to depend on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junctional intercellular communication, providing a mechanistic basis for the architecture-dependent calcium signaling.

The researchers also found that the calcium oscillation attenuated the histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction, resulting in differential cell responses in an architecture-dependent manner. This suggests that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of intercellular cell signaling and its functional implications in diverse vascular structures. The results suggest that the structural arrangement of endothelial cells plays a crucial role in determining their response to chemical stimuli, and that this response is mediated by collective calcium signaling.
Researchers investigated the role of antigenic sites in the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) G attachment protein outside of the central conserved and cysteine noose domains in eliciting protective immunity against RSV. They used recombinant E. coli-expressed G ectodomain (REG), CCD-deleted G ectodomain (REG ΔCCD), N- and C-terminal G subdomains, and antigenic site peptides to evaluate immunogenicity, neutralization, and protective efficacy in rabbits and mice. The results showed that REG ΔCCD, N- and C-terminal subdomains, and peptides generated antibody titers that bound to fully glycosylated recombinant mammalian-expressed G ectodomain (RMG) and intact RSV virion particles, but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared to the intact G ectodomain. Vaccinated mice challenged with RSV-A2 Line 19F showed significantly reduced viral replication in the nasal cavity and lungs compared to unimmunized controls. The control of viral loads post-RSV challenge correlated with serum antibody binding to the virus particles, and very low Th2/Th1 cytokine ratios were found in the lungs of REG ΔCCD vaccinated mice after challenge. These findings demonstrate the presence of multiple protective sites in RSV G protein outside of the central conserved and cysteine noose domains that could contribute to the development of a bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein as a safe and protective vaccine against RSV disease.
Researchers investigated the role of the splicing component brr2 in the specification of Drosophila neuropeptidergic neurons, specifically the Tv4 neurons in the ventral nerve cord. They found that brr2 plays a crucial role in controlling the expression of the FMRFa neuropeptide in these neurons. This control is achieved through two independent mechanisms: proper axonal pathfinding to the target tissue to receive the BMP ligand and proper RNA splicing of two genes in the BMP pathway, tkv and Medea. The researchers discovered that brr2 is involved in three steps necessary for Tv4 neuron specification: axon pathfinding, Dimm expression, and activation of the BMP signaling pathway. The Tv4 neuron requires a target-derived retrograde signal, mediated by BMP ligand Glass bottom boat (Gbb), to terminally differentiate and activate the FMRFa gene. The study highlights the importance of RNA processing in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system. The findings suggest that brr2 and Prp8, components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, play a cell-specific role in controlling the specification of the neuropeptidergic identity of the Tv4 neuron. This research provides new insights into the molecular genetic aspects of retrograde instructive signals during nervous system development.
Researchers have identified a previously unknown pathway for regulating the abundance of F-box proteins, which are crucial components of the SCF ubiquitin ligases. These ligases play a significant role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and are often misregulated in diseases such as cancer. The newly discovered pathway targets F-box proteins that are not bound to Skp1, a central component of the SCF complex, and involves the cullin component Cdc53/Cul1. This pathway is independent of Skp1 and relies on the SCF core components Cdc53, Rbx1, and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34.

The study focused on the yeast protein Met30, which is a substrate adaptor for the SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase. The researchers found that Met30 is unstable in the absence of Skp1, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase responsible for degrading Skp1-free Met30 recognizes a specific domain adjacent to the F-box domain. This domain, known as the R-motif, is not accessible when Skp1 is bound to the F-box protein.

The discovery of this Skp1-independent pathway provides new insights into the regulation of F-box protein abundance and suggests that Cdc53/Cul1 has a function independent of its association with Skp1. This pathway is critical for maintaining chromosome stability and defending against heavy metal stress. The study highlights the complexity of the SCF ubiquitin ligase family and the importance of understanding the regulation of F-box protein abundance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
Kinesin-3 motors, such as KIF1A, play a crucial role in transporting synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. Previous models suggested that these motors are monomeric in their inactive state and become activated through cargo-induced dimerization. However, a recent study has challenged this model, finding that both native and expressed KIF1A proteins are dimeric in their inactive state. This means that cargo-induced dimerization is not a valid mechanism for activating KIF1A motors.

Instead, the study reveals that KIF1A motors are autoinhibited by two distinct mechanisms, suggesting a new model for their activation. The study also shows that only dimeric KIF1A motors undergo processive, ATP-dependent motility along microtubules, while monomeric motors exhibit one-dimensional diffusion. This processive motility is characterized by smooth, unidirectional movement with an average velocity comparable to that of vesicles moving in vivo.

The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of how kinesin motors are regulated to transport cargo to the correct cellular destination at the right time. The study suggests that KIF1A motors may use both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells. The results also highlight the importance of understanding the regulation of kinesin motors, as loss of KIF1A or Unc104 function has been linked to decreased synaptic vesicles in axonal growth cones and early death.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the regulation of seed metabolism in a collection of 76 tomato introgression lines (ILs) grown in two consecutive harvest seasons. Metabolite profiling and network analysis revealed 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL), indicating significant genetic variation in seed metabolism. Amino acid contents showed high variability across the population, while sugar levels exhibited seasonal fluctuations. The study found that the genetic background of the ILs had a greater impact on metabolic polymorphism than environmental factors or tissue type.

Analysis of the coefficient of variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in the ILs compared to the M82 tomato cultivar. Heritability estimates suggested that the mode of inheritance of metabolite traits in the seed differed from that in the fruit. Correlation-based metabolic network analysis revealed a tight interdependence of metabolic processes in the seed network, with amino acids playing a central hub-like role. Six amino acids (Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro) were identified as highly co-regulated, with strong interdependence confirmed by mQTL mapping.

The study highlights the importance of integrating metabolic network analysis with mQTL mapping to understand the regulation of seed metabolism. The results demonstrate the extensive redundancy of regulation underlying seed metabolism and the tight coordination of seed metabolism with respect to fruit metabolism. The study also emphasizes the centrality of the amino acid module in the seed metabolic network, providing new insights into the regulation of seed metabolism and its relationship with fruit and plant development.
Researchers have investigated the structure and function of GbpA, a protein produced by the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae that enables the bacteria to colonize the chitinous exoskeletons of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract. The study reveals that GbpA has an unusual, elongated four-domain structure, with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin-binding domains. These domains are responsible for binding to chitin, a key component of zooplankton exoskeletons, as well as to mucin, a glycoprotein found in the human intestinal tract. In contrast, domains 2 and 3 of GbpA bind to the surface of Vibrio cholerae itself, facilitating the formation of a stable host-pathogen interface. The study also shows that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization of the intestinal tract. A glycan screen revealed that GbpA binds to GlcNAc oligosaccharides, and structure-guided truncation mutants confirmed that domains 1 and 4 interact with chitin in vitro, while domain 1 is crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization in vivo. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the interactions between Vibrio cholerae and its hosts, and highlight the modular structure of GbpA as a key factor in its ability to bind to different host surfaces.
Researchers have identified a specific subset of immune cells, known as HLA-DR+CD4+ effector memory T cells, that are resistant to suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs) in individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). These cells, which are characterized by their expression of the HLA-DR protein, are found in higher numbers in people with TB and are resistant to the suppressive effects of Tregs. This resistance is linked to the expression of certain cytokines and chemokines, including IFNG, IL17A, IL22, PD-L1, and β-chemokines CCL3L3 and CCL4.

The study found that the presence of HLA-DR+CD4+ effector memory T cells compromises the function of Tregs, leading to a loss of immune homeostasis in TB patients. The researchers also discovered that these cells are resistant to suppression mediated by the CCR5 and PD-L1 pathways, which are known to promote Treg suppression. Furthermore, the HLA-DR+CD4+ effector memory T cells expressed higher levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines, which can negatively regulate Treg function.

The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying chronic immune activation in TB and suggest that the expansion of HLA-DR+CD4+ effector memory T cells may contribute to disease-associated inflammation. The identification of this subset of immune cells as a potential functional marker of disease has implications for disease monitoring and response to therapy.
Researchers investigated the propagation of RML prions in mice that express a version of the prion protein (PrPC) without a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. These mice, known as tgGPI- mice, are susceptible to prion infection but accumulate anchorless PrPSc outside of cells. The study aimed to determine whether tgGPI- mice could faithfully propagate prion strains despite the deviant structure and location of anchorless PrPSc.

The results showed that RML and ME7 prions, but not 22L prions, propagated in tgGPI- mice developed novel cell tropisms, as determined by the Cell Panel Assay (CPA). Surprisingly, the levels of proteinase K-resistant PrPSc (PrPres) in RML- or ME7-infected tgGPI- brain were 25-50 times higher than in wild-type brain. When returned to wild-type brain, ME7 prions recovered their original properties, but RML prions gave rise to a novel prion strain, designated SFL, which remained unchanged even after three passages in wild-type mice.

The study suggests that the two conformations of RML PrPSc and SFL PrPSc are separated by a high activation energy barrier, which is abrogated in tgGPI- mice. The results also indicate that the stability of extracellular PrPres is greater than intracellular PrPres, leading to unusually high levels of PrPres in tgGPI- mice.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway in the development of the dorsal ectoderm in Drosophila embryos. The BMP pathway plays a crucial role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning, and its activity is opposed by the EGF signaling pathway. Using a combination of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, the study identified multiple new BMP target genes, including both positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. The researchers found that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription, indicating a self-regulating property of the BMP gene network. This balance between BMP and EGF signaling is essential for correct patterning of the dorsal ectoderm.

The study also identified key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the expression domain of BMP-dependent transcription. Insulator proteins, such as BEAF-32, were found to bind to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions, influencing transcription. The absence of BEAF-32 resulted in reduced transcription of a peak BMP target gene and a decrease in the number of amnioserosa cells, which are specified by peak BMP signaling. The findings were incorporated into a model for Mad-dependent activation, providing insights into BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates. Overall, the study sheds light on the transcriptional network underlying dorsal ectoderm differentiation in response to BMP signaling in Drosophila embryos.
In Tunisia, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major have been increasing and spreading from the south-west to new areas in the center. To better understand the evolution and population dynamics of L. major, researchers conducted a multi-locus microsatellite typing of human isolates from three endemic governorates: Gafsa, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid. The study analyzed isolates collected in Sidi Bouzid over two periods: 1991-1992 and 2008-2012. The results showed that over two decades, L. major populations in the same area evolved by generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of 2008-2012 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L. major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia, suggesting that human activities may be the source of the disease expansion. The study also found previous and current flows of genotypes between governorates and districts, which could be explained by human activities, reservoir dynamics, and environmental changes. The findings provide new insights into the evolution and spread of L. major in Tunisia, which may improve our understanding of the parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of anthelmintic chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in reducing helminth infections among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. A cohort study was nested within a randomized trial of empiric deworming, and helminth infections were diagnosed using semi-quantitative real-time PCR. The study found that repeated treatment with albendazole and praziquantel significantly reduced the odds of infection with any soil-transmitted helminth (STH) species, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.20, p < 0.001). Access to safe flooring was found to offer additional protection against STH infections, with an aOR of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.56, p < 0.001). For schistosomiasis, only treatment with praziquantel was protective, with an aOR of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.60, p = 0.001). Among individuals not treated with albendazole or praziquantel, the most protective intervention package included safe flooring and latrine access. The study found no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthelmintic chemotherapy and WASH resources. The results suggest that deworming is effective in reducing helminth infections among HIV-infected adults, and while WASH offers minimal additional benefit, it may significantly reduce infection prevalence in adults without access to chemotherapy.
Researchers have identified a group of bacterial proteins, known as lectin-like bacteriotoxins, which selectively kill closely related species, including several phytopathogens. The crystal structure of LlpABW, a prototype lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomonas putida, reveals an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MMBL) domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. The C-terminal MMBL domain contains a binding site for mannose and oligomannosides, and mutational analysis indicates that an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. In contrast, the N-terminal MMBL domain lacks a functional mannose-binding site and is structurally more divergent. Engineered N/C-domain chimeras derived from two LlpA homologues with different killing spectra showed that the N-domain determines target specificity. This suggests that the bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity. LlpABW is the first prokaryotic member of the MMBL lectin family, which is typically composed of two MMBL domains and is involved in general defense mechanisms. The N-domain appears to play a major role in target selection, and the bacteriocin's activity is not impaired by the presence of excess mannose. The amino acid sequence of LlpA suggests the presence of two related domains belonging to the MMBL family, and the Xanthomonas LlpA precursor is proteolytically processed by removal of a characteristic Type II secretion signal peptide.
Researchers have discovered a novel secretion apparatus in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis that plays a crucial role in maintaining spore integrity and developmental gene expression during sporulation. The apparatus is composed of eight mother-cell proteins encoded in the spoIIIA operon and the forespore protein SpoIIQ, which form a multimeric complex that spans the two membranes surrounding the forespore. This complex is essential for maintaining the integrity of the forespore, as its absence leads to the development of large invaginations and collapse of the forespore. Notably, the maintenance of forespore integrity does not require the activity of the transcription factor σG, which regulates the late program of forespore gene expression.

The researchers found that one of the SpoIIIA proteins, SpoIIIAA, shares similarity with ATPases found in type II and type IV secretion systems, and that the conserved ATPase motifs in SpoIIIAA are required for σG activity and spore formation. The SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex is thought to form a novel secretion apparatus that links the mother cell and forespore, allowing the mother cell to nurture the forespore and maintain its physiology during spore maturation. This discovery provides new insights into the complex process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis and highlights the importance of the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex in maintaining spore integrity and developmental gene expression.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder (BD), a highly heritable psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population. The study analyzed genotype data from 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls, but did not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci. However, the study found a significant association between the power to detect effects calculated from a previous genome-wide association study and evidence for replication (P=1.5×10−7). This suggests that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (±10 kb) that could be identified in larger studies.

The researchers also analyzed replication rates in a large meta-analysis of height and found that, in a large enough study, associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. This indicates that larger studies may be able to identify genetic variants associated with BD near exons. The study provides a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies. The findings have implications for the identification of genetic loci associated with BD and may lead to a better understanding of the genetic basis of the disorder.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis to understand the mechanisms of cell proliferation in cancerous and non-cancerous cells. They used a novel approach, assigning a Cancer Proliferation Index (cPI) to each gene based on its expression levels and growth rate measurements across 60 cancer cell lines. The study found that genes essential for cancer growth had positive cPI values, while tumor suppressors had negative cPI values. The analysis revealed that cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production processes are positively associated with cancer proliferation, while cellular migration is negatively associated with it.

A parallel analysis of non-cancerous proliferation indices (nPI) across 224 lymphoblastoid cell lines showed marked differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation. The study identified genes in the translation and spliceosome machineries as selective cancer proliferation-associated proteins. A cross-species comparison revealed that cancer proliferation resembles that of microorganisms, while non-cancerous proliferation does not. Combining cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation signatures led to enhanced prediction of patient outcome and gene essentiality in cancer.

The study also found that genes involved in translation and spliceosome machineries are enriched in cancer proliferation, consistent with previous studies suggesting these processes as targets in cancer therapy. The analysis of tumor suppressor genes and genes with loss of function mutations in various tumors showed that these genes have lower and negative cPI values, indicating that their decreased functionality may enhance cellular proliferation. Overall, the study provides insights into the inherent differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation determinants, which may contribute to the development of novel cancer-specific anti-proliferative drugs.
A retrospective case series of 11 patients with cardiac and/or endovascular cystic echinococcosis (CE) was conducted over a 15-year period (1995-2009). The main clinical manifestations included thoracic pain or dyspnea, with two patients being asymptomatic. Cysts were primarily located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Nine patients had previously been diagnosed with disseminated CE. Echocardiography was the primary diagnostic method, supplemented by serology, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, and histology.

Nine patients underwent cardiac surgery, and nine received long-term antiparasitic treatment for a median duration of 25 months. One patient died intra-operatively due to cyst rupture and endovascular dissemination. Two patients died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure, respectively. One patient was lost to follow-up. Patients with isolated cardiac involvement did not experience complications after surgery and were considered cured, with only one recurrence requiring a second operation. In contrast, patients with vena cava involvement developed pulmonary embolisms and presented multiple complications.

Cardiovascular CE is associated with a high risk of potentially lethal complications, and clinical manifestations and complications vary according to cyst location. Isolated cardiac CE may be cured after surgery, while endovascular extracardiac involvement is associated with severe chronic complications. CE should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in patients from endemic areas.
Researchers investigated the role of TirS, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) mimic in Staphylococcus aureus, in modulating virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility. They found that ectopic expression of TirS in eukaryotic cells inhibited TLR signaling, downregulating the NF-kB pathway through inhibition of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9. In a mouse model of S. aureus skin infection, skin lesions induced by a tirS mutant strain increased compared to wild-type and restored strains, despite similar bacterial loads. This suggests that TirS plays a central role in virulence attenuation through local inflammatory responses. TirS was also associated with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity. Furthermore, TirS localized within staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes (SCC) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance, and sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid increased tirS expression. Epidemiological studies found no link between TirS and clinical presentation, but showed a selective advantage with a SCCmec element carrying SCC fusC/tirS. The study suggests that TirS modulates an inflammatory response at the site of infection through the MyD88 adaptor protein, and that its expression may confer a selective advantage to S. aureus.
Researchers analyzed gene expression data from fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) embryos to identify differences in embryonic patterning mechanisms. They found that most orthologous gene pairs exhibit similar temporal profiles of expression, but a subset of genes showed discordant expression patterns. By clustering these discordant genes, the researchers identified a group of genes specifically expressed in the mosquito serosa, a structure not present in fruit flies. This cluster was also found to be re-engaged later in development during cuticle synthesis. Additionally, the study revealed a striking difference in the temporal expression of maternal genes between the two species. In fruit flies, maternal transcripts are sharply reduced at the maternal-zygotic transition, whereas in mosquitoes, these transcripts are sustained. The researchers propose that this approach can be used to identify gene batteries underlying morphological diversity. The study provides a framework for cross-organismal temporal alignments and comparisons of species-specific transcriptional datasets, revealing distinctive patterning properties in Dipteran embryos, including the organization of extra-embryonic tissues and the maternal-zygotic transition. The findings suggest that gene clustering by local temporal discordance can be a useful tool for identifying functional gene sets from comparative datasets.
Researchers conducted a study in rural villages of Papua New Guinea to investigate the presence of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue DNA in asymptomatic individuals, flies, and household linens. The study found that 21% of 78 asymptomatic participants had detectable H. ducreyi DNA on their skin, while 1% had detectable T. p. pertenue DNA. Notably, the presence of H. ducreyi DNA did not differ significantly between participants exposed or not exposed to a case of H. ducreyi ulcer in the household.

The study also found that 90% of 10 flies tested had H. ducreyi DNA, and 50% had T. p. pertenue DNA. Additionally, 33% of 6 bed sheets sampled had H. ducreyi DNA, and 17% had T. p. pertenue DNA. This is the first time that H. ducreyi DNA and colonization has been demonstrated on the skin of asymptomatic children and that H. ducreyi DNA and T. p. pertenue DNA has been identified in flies and on fomites.

The study suggests that the ubiquity of H. ducreyi in the environment is a contributing factor to the spread of the organism. The researchers also found that people from households without an ulcer case had positivity rates similar to those with an H. ducreyi ulcer case in the household. Furthermore, participants who were PCR-positive were more likely to change bed linens less than once per week than those without detectable bacterial DNA.
The International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force has developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training needs and curricula across various user personas and training programs. The competencies were initially developed through surveys of employers and training programs, and have since been refined through a multi-year process of community engagement. These core competencies aim to assist educators in sharing experiences and identifying best practices for bioinformatics education, despite divergent needs and expectations.

The competencies have been applied in various training contexts, as illustrated by a series of use cases presented in the report. These use cases demonstrate how the competencies can be used to define, refine, or assess bioinformatics training mechanisms, highlighting diverse training needs, user personas, types of training programs, and educational settings. The core competencies provide a basis for bioinformatics educators to draw upon their common experiences in designing, refining, and evaluating their own training programs.

The competencies are not intended to be a prescription for a specific set of curricula or curricular standards, but rather a framework for guiding the development of bioinformatics education and training programs. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans for the continued refinement and application of the bioinformatics core competencies.
Researchers studied the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, which infects over one billion people worldwide, to understand the mechanisms behind its developmentally arrested third-stage larva (L3i). Unlike other parasitic nematodes, S. stercoralis has a unique life cycle that includes both parasitic and free-living forms, allowing for the investigation of L3i arrest and activation. The researchers compared S. stercoralis to the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has a similar developmentally arrested larval form called the dauer. They hypothesized that homologous pathways in S. stercoralis would have similar developmental regulation and be involved in L3i arrest and activation.

Using deep-sequencing, the researchers generated over 2.3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages of S. stercoralis. They constructed developmental expression profiles for S. stercoralis homologs of C. elegans dauer genes and found that genes encoding cGMP pathway components were coordinately up-regulated in L3i. In contrast, S. stercoralis has a paucity of genes encoding insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) ligands, which are involved in L3i development. The researchers also identified seven S. stercoralis genes encoding homologs of the single C. elegans dauer regulatory TGFβ ligand, three of which are only expressed in L3i. However, putative DA biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated in L3i development. The study suggests that while dauer pathway genes are present in S. stercoralis and may play a role in L3i development, there are significant differences between the two species. Understanding the mechanisms governing L3i development may lead to novel treatment and control strategies.
Researchers investigated the effects of bacterial genotoxins, specifically Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT) and colibactin, on nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival. These toxins are secreted by pathogenic bacteria and have been linked to digestive cancers. The study used various models, including infected mice, coculture experiments, and xenograft mouse-derived models, to assess nuclear remodeling in vitro and in vivo.

The results showed that CDT and colibactin induced the formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of giant cells, which correspond to nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The core of the NR was found to concentrate ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and the main components of the complex mCRD involved in mRNA turnover. These structures are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with a high degree of ploidy, and involve MAPK and calcium signaling.

The study found that these structures are dynamic, transient, and protect the cell until the genotoxic stress is relieved. Bacterial genotoxins-induced NR would be a privileged gateway for selected mRNA to be preferably transported therein for local translation. These findings offer new insights into the context of NR formation, a common feature of many cancers, which not only appears in response to therapies-induced DNA damage but also earlier in response to genotoxic bacteria. The study suggests that these structures may contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapies and some chemotherapies inducing DNA damage.
Researchers used three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) to evaluate maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy. The study aimed to provide a more objective and quantitative assessment of maxillary changes in patients with leprosy, as previous evaluations were based on subjective visual grading. Ten former patients with leprosy and five control subjects were included in the study. Three-dimensional images of the maxilla were reconstructed using multiplanar reconstruction methods, and the anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA-P) was measured. The results showed that three patients with lepromatous leprosy had marked atrophy of the maxilla, which was consistent with paleopathological findings of excavated skeletal remains. The study also found that the precise bone defects of the maxilla could be individually calculated, allowing for accurate reconstructive surgery. The use of 3D-CT enabled easier qualitative evaluation of maxillary deformities and provided a tool for reconstructive surgery of maxillary defects caused by leprosy. The study's methodology represents a promising approach for the quantitative evaluation of maxillary deformities associated with leprosy and other maxillary lesions. This approach may contribute to novel surgical treatments for facial deformity and help eliminate social segregation and prejudice attributed to leprosy.
Researchers investigated how the auditory system constructs noise-invariant representations of sound in the presence of background noise. They measured neuronal responses to complex sounds in the inferior colliculus and primary fields of the auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets, and compared these responses with a model of the auditory nerve. The study found that the strength of adaptation to the mean and contrast of auditory stimulation increases as one ascends the auditory pathway. This adaptation is thought to contribute to the construction of noise-invariant sound representations.

The researchers presented complex, natural sounds embedded in stationary noise and used a decoding approach to assess the noise tolerance of the neuronal population code. They found that the code for complex sounds in the periphery is affected more by the addition of noise than the cortical code. The study also found that noise tolerance is correlated with adaptation to stimulus statistics, suggesting that the increase in adaptation to sound statistics from auditory nerve to midbrain to cortex is an important stage in the construction of noise-invariant sound representations.

The results indicate that as one progresses through the auditory pathway, neural responses become progressively more independent of the level of background noise. By the level of the cortex, neural populations represent the signal in a more noise-tolerant fashion, responding to sound features that are common between clean and noisy conditions. The study suggests that adaptation to stimulus statistics is a neural mechanism that drives the construction of noise-tolerant representations of sound.
Researchers used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism to investigate how the protein-protein interaction network (interactome) changes in response to heat shock, a well-characterized form of cellular stress. They analyzed the changes in interaction weights of the yeast interactome by comparing mRNA expression levels before and after heat shock. The study found that heat shock led to a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections of yeast interactome modules. This resulted in a 4.9-fold increase in the weighted diameter of the yeast interactome, indicating a shift from a globally connected organization to a more multifocal structure. Key proteins involved in the heat shock response became centers of local communities and bridges connecting modules after heat shock. The changes in the interactome resembled a "stratus-cumulus" transition, where the unstressed interactome had a globally connected organization, similar to stratus clouds, and the heat-shocked interactome had a multifocal organization, similar to cumulus clouds. The study suggests that heat shock induces a partial disintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome, which may be a general adaptation mechanism to environmental changes. This finding may also apply to other complex systems, such as single proteins, social networks, and ecosystems, which may experience a decrease in inter-modular links and develop more compact modules in response to stress.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of amiodarone in treating ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a chronic condition caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, prevalent in Latin America, which can lead to cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication, has been widely used to treat ventricular arrhythmias in these patients. The review included 9 studies, 2 of which provided individual patient data for analysis. The results showed that amiodarone significantly reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes, ventricular premature beats, and ventricular couplets in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. The incidence of adverse side effects, such as corneal microdeposits, gastrointestinal events, sinus bradycardia, dermatological events, and drug discontinuation, was also reported. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. While amiodarone appears to be effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias, there is no direct evidence for its effect on hard endpoints, such as sudden death or hospitalization. The review highlights the importance of balancing the potential benefits and harms of amiodarone use in individual patients with Chagas disease.
Researchers analyzed medical records from 2009 to 2016 of patients diagnosed with dengue fever at two hospitals in rural Ecuador to understand seasonal patterns of the disease. The study found that dengue fever cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and less likely to be diagnosed on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays were not significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses, except for an increase in diagnoses on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. The study also examined the effect of climate on dengue fever diagnoses and found that monthly total precipitation, interaction between total precipitation and monthly absolute minimum temperature, interaction between total precipitation and monthly precipitation days, and a three-way interaction between minimum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation days were important climate variables. This study is one of the first to report long-term dengue fever seasonality in Ecuador and provides valuable information for local disease prevention efforts, public health planning, and global and regional models of dengue fever trends.
Researchers have discovered a novel way to activate the innate immune system to provide broad-spectrum antiviral protection without the need for antigen-specific recognition or a priori knowledge of the causative agent. By expressing a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) in mice, they found that the innate immune system is profoundly reconfigured, leading to the upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and a significant resistance to lethal viral challenge. This mechanism operates independently of the adaptive immune system and is mediated by the MDA5 and MAVS pathways. The researchers also demonstrated that human cell models exhibit a similar response, with the RdRP inducing an analogous ISG network and blocking HIV-1 infection. Importantly, the RdRP-transgenic mice showed no signs of autoimmunity or chronic inflammation, despite lifelong ISG elevations, and had normal longevity. This study provides a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection. The findings suggest that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration, offering a potential solution for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases where definitive solutions via sterilizing adaptive immunity may take years or decades to develop.
Researchers investigated the effective population size (Ne) of a plant RNA virus, Tobacco etch virus (TEV), and found that it is dose-dependent. Ne is a key factor in viral evolution, determining the strength of genetic drift and the frequency of co-infection by multiple genotypes. The independent action hypothesis (IAH) states that each virion has a probability of infection, and that virions act independently of one another during the infection process. A corollary of IAH is that Ne must be dose-dependent.

The study used TEV variants carrying fluorescent markers to infect Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum plants at different doses. The number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose, and was similar to a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary infection foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency. The probability that a genotype that infected the inoculated leaf would systemically infect the plant was near 1, although in rare cases genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf by being physically surrounded by the other genotype.

The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted from the mean number of primary infection foci using the independent-action model. Independent action appears to hold for TEV, and Ne is therefore dose-dependent for this plant RNA virus. The mean number of virions causing systemic infection can be very small, and approaches 1 at low doses. Dose-dependency in TEV suggests that comparison of Ne estimates for different viruses are not very meaningful unless dose effects are taken into consideration.
Researchers have developed a new statistical approach to study the genetic control of gene expression across multiple tissues in the body. This approach, called Sparse Bayesian Regression, allows for the analysis of gene expression data from multiple tissues simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic regulation of gene expression. The method was tested on a set of 2,000 genes in four tissues and was found to be more powerful than traditional approaches in revealing the true complexity of the genetic control of gene expression.

The new approach was able to identify a two-eQTL model for the Hopx gene that was not detected by conventional methods and was experimentally validated. Additionally, the method showed that approximately 27% of transcripts have common genetic regulation across the four tissues, resulting in a greater than five-fold increase in eQTL detection compared to single-tissue analyses. This suggests that the genetic regulation of gene expression is more complex and widespread than previously thought.

The method also allows for the identification of polygenic regulation of gene expression, where multiple genetic variants contribute to the regulation of a single gene. This is in contrast to traditional methods that focus on single genetic variants. The approach uses an efficient computational algorithm, called Evolutionary Stochastic Search, to analyze the large amounts of data generated by the simultaneous analysis of multiple tissues and genetic variants. The results of this study provide new insights into the genetic control of gene expression and have the potential to be applied to the analysis of multiple intermediate and whole-body phenotypes.
Researchers have studied the process of extrinsic apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death triggered by external signals such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TRAIL. They found that cells exposed to these signals enter a prolonged period of variable duration, during which only certain enzymes called initiator caspases are active. This is followed by a sudden transition to the activation of downstream effector caspases, which rapidly dismantle the cell. A mathematical model was developed to understand the underlying mechanisms of this process. The model was trained using experimental data from live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells with altered protein levels. The model accurately reproduced the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, allowing researchers to study the switching mechanisms in detail. Analysis of the model revealed that the duration of the delay before effector caspase activation is determined by the activity of initiator caspase-8 and the rates of subsequent reactions. The sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved through the permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and the relocalization of proteins such as Smac. The interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the formation of pores are critical for the snap-action control of apoptosis.
Listeria monocytogenes, a food-borne pathogen, has evolved mechanisms to breach the placental barrier and infect the fetus. The protein Internalin P (InlP) plays a critical role in this process. Researchers have identified afadin, a protein associated with cell-cell junctions, as a binding partner for InlP. The interaction between InlP and afadin enhances the ability of Listeria monocytogenes to cross the basal face of epithelial monolayers, a necessary step in placental infection. The crystal structure of InlP reveals a unique feature, an extended leucine-rich repeat domain with a Ca2+-binding site, which is essential for its interaction with afadin. Listeria monocytogenes mutants lacking InlP or with a disrupted InlP-afadin interaction are deficient in their ability to form actin-rich protrusions and cross the epithelial monolayer. The study suggests that InlP targets cytosolic afadin to promote Listeria monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of epithelial monolayers, which may contribute to the crossing of the basement membrane during placental infection. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of Listeria monocytogenes infection at the maternal-fetal interface and highlight the importance of InlP-afadin interactions in the pathogenesis of placental infections.
Researchers have characterized the proteome of Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis, using complementary mass spectrometry techniques. A total of 6033 peptides were detected, corresponding to 557 unique proteins, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the global T. pallidum proteome to date. The study used multidimensional peptide separation and protein identification via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and electrospray ionization (ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap) tandem mass spectrometry to analyze T. pallidum ssp. pallidum DAL-1 strain bacteria isolated from rabbits. The detected proteins were characterized according to their predicted biological function and localization, with half allocated into a wide range of functional categories. Proteins annotated as potential membrane proteins and those with unclear functional annotations were subjected to additional bioinformatics pipeline analysis to facilitate further characterization. A total of 116 potential membrane proteins were identified, of which 16 have evidence supporting outer membrane localization. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free spectral counting methods, revealing a low correlation between previous microarray signal data and protein abundance. The study provides valuable insights into in vivo T. pallidum protein expression, paving the way for improved understanding of the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism.
Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a key receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotic cells. cAMP binds to two tandem cAMP-binding domains (CBD-A and -B) within the regulatory subunit of PKA (R), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). Research has shown that CBD-A is required for both PKA inhibition and activation, while CBD-B acts as a "gatekeeper" domain that modulates the control exerted by CBD-A.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of the two-domain construct RIα (91-379) in its apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms revealed a double conformational selection model. This model suggests that each apo CBD dynamically samples both active and inactive states independently of the adjacent CBD within a nearly degenerate free energy landscape. The binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy, selectively stabilizing the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts, which require both cAMP and W260.

The inter-CBD interface is dispensable for intra-CBD conformational selection but is indispensable for full activation of PKA, as it occludes C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A. The two structurally homologous cAMP-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in their residual dynamics profiles, supporting the notion that conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics. These findings provide new insights into the cAMP-dependent activation of PKA and the role of CBD-B in modulating the control exerted by CBD-A.
The study investigated the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in regulating mitochondrial function in macrophages following vaccinia virus (VACV) infection. Researchers compared the proteomes of ISG15-deficient (ISG15-/-) and ISG15-sufficient (ISG15+/+) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) after VACV infection. The results showed that ISG15 plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial function, particularly in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitophagy. ISG15-/- BMDM exhibited impaired mitochondrial respiration, reduced ATP production, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production compared to ISG15+/+ BMDM following interferon (IFN) treatment. Additionally, ISG15-/- macrophages showed altered macrophage polarization, characterized by a pro-inflammatory cytokine expression pattern typical of an M1 phenotype, but with reduced nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase-1 activation. As a result, ISG15-/- macrophages were permissive for VACV replication following IFN treatment. In contrast, ISG15+/+ macrophages exhibited higher NO release and lower viral titers. The study demonstrates that ISG15 governs the dynamic functionality of mitochondria, which is essential for cellular homeostasis and antiviral immunity. The findings suggest that ISG15 plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial OXPHOS, mitophagy, and macrophage polarization, highlighting its importance in antiviral defense mechanisms.
The HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) plays a crucial role in the replication of the virus by degrading its cellular receptor CD4 and enhancing the release of viral particles. Vpu achieves this by binding to the βTrCP subunit of the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex through its constitutively phosphorylated DS52GXXS56 motif. However, Vpu escapes degradation while inhibiting the degradation of βTrCP's natural targets, such as β-catenin and IκBα. Researchers have identified a novel phosphorylation site in Vpu, serine 61, which lies adjacent to the βTrCP-binding motif. Phosphorylation of this site triggers Vpu degradation through a βTrCP-independent process. Mutation of Vpu S61 in the HIV-1 provirus extends the half-life of the protein and significantly increases the release of HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells. The S61 determinant of regulated Vpu turnover is highly conserved within HIV-1 isolates, suggesting a role in overall HIV-1 fitness. The study highlights a mechanism where differential phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate as an adaptor or substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases.
Researchers investigated how the development of individual tissues, specifically the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae, is coordinated with whole-body development to ensure robustness against environmental and physiological perturbations. They proposed two hypotheses: that tissue patterning is tightly coordinated with whole-body development over time, and that tissue patterning aligns at developmental milestones. To test these hypotheses, the researchers developed a staging scheme for wing imaginal discs based on the expression of canonical patterning genes and linked it to three whole-body developmental events: moulting, larval wandering, and pupariation.

The study found that the expression pattern in the wing disc always aligned at moulting and pupariation, indicating that these events represent developmental milestones. However, between these milestones, the progression of pattern showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. The researchers also found that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage, suggesting that wandering does not appear to be a developmental milestone.

The study's findings reveal that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones. The research provides new insights into how the development of individual tissues is coordinated with the body as a whole, and highlights the importance of developmental milestones in ensuring the robustness of the adult phenotype.
The ESCRT regulator Did2 plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between long-distance endosomal transport and endocytic trafficking in highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae. In these cells, early endosomes function in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of various cargo, including mRNA and protein complexes. Research has shown that loss of Did2 results in defective vacuolar targeting, reduced processive long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. This is accompanied by increased shuttling of the late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease Prc1 on these aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Furthermore, molecular motors fail to attach efficiently, leading to disturbed processive movement. Additionally, the endosomal mRNP linker protein Upa1 is hardly present on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport. The study demonstrates that Did2 coordinates precise maturation of endosomes and provides the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport. This is essential for undisturbed unipolar growth of hyphae, suggesting a functional role in microtubule-dependent transport. The research highlights the importance of the ESCRT regulator Did2 in maintaining the balance between endosomal transport and endocytic trafficking in highly polarized cells.
Researchers conducted a comparative study on two types of adenine riboswitches found in bacteria, one from Bacillus subtilis and the other from Vibrio vulnificus. These riboswitches regulate gene expression by binding to adenine, but they differ in how they control gene expression. The Bacillus subtilis riboswitch controls transcription, while the Vibrio vulnificus riboswitch controls translation. The study found that the two riboswitches have different ligand binding properties and operate under different regulation regimes. The Bacillus subtilis riboswitch requires co-transcriptional binding of adenine to function, whereas the Vibrio vulnificus riboswitch can bind to adenine after transcription is completed and still regulate translation. The study also found that the rate of transcription is critical for the Bacillus subtilis riboswitch to function efficiently, supporting a co-transcriptional regulation mechanism. In contrast, the Vibrio vulnificus riboswitch operates under a thermodynamic model, where ligand binding and regulation can occur post-transcriptionally. The results suggest that the nature of gene regulation control, whether transcriptional or translational, plays a significant role in riboswitch regulatory mechanisms. Overall, the study reveals key differences in the regulatory mechanisms of transcriptionally- and translationally-acting adenine riboswitches.
Researchers have investigated the process of primer-dependent transcription initiation (PDI) in Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae, a pathogenic bacterium. PDI involves the use of a short oligoribonucleotide primer to initiate transcription. The study found that PDI is a regulatory mechanism that modulates biofilm formation in E. coli and is also present in V. cholerae. A comparative analysis of PDI in both organisms revealed a striking similarity in the pattern of PDI, which is detected in stationary phase and not in exponential phase. PDI is preferentially apparent at promoters carrying specific DNA sequences, T−1A+1 and G−1G+1.

High-throughput sequencing of RNA 5' ends (5' RNA-seq) was used to detect PDI in both E. coli and V. cholerae. The results showed that PDI produces full-length transcripts that carry a 5' hydroxyl and begin with the sequences 5'-UA and 5'-GG, respectively. A growth phase-dependent process that preferentially generates 5'-UA and 5'-GG oligoribonucleotides is proposed to occur in both E. coli and V. cholerae. The study suggests that PDI may be widespread among Gammaproteobacteria and that its extent relative to de novo initiation fluctuates as a function of growth state. Approximately 1% of transcripts generated from a given start site region in V. cholerae and 7% of transcripts generated from a given start site region in E. coli are found to be the result of PDI.
Researchers investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis, a plant species. Imprinted genes are genes that are expressed by a single parental allele, and their expression is often regulated by DNA methylation or histone methylation. The study aimed to test the parental conflict theory, which proposes that parental genome imbalances are directly mirrored by antagonistic regulations of imprinted genes encoding maternal growth inhibitors and paternal growth enhancers.

The study found that genome dosage imbalance deregulated the expression of two imprinted genes, FIS2 and PHE1, in an antagonistic manner. An increased dosage of maternal genomes repressed the expression of FIS2, while an increased dosage of paternal genomes had the opposite effect. However, the changes in PHE1 expression could not be fully accounted for by the corresponding fluctuations of FIS2 expression. The study also found that increased dosage of inactive alleles caused a loss of imprinting of FIS2 and MEA, another imprinted gene.

The results suggest that parental genome dosage imbalance deregulates imprinting using mechanisms that are independent from known regulators of imprinting. The complexity of the network of regulations between expressed and silenced alleles of imprinted genes activated in response to parental dosage imbalance does not support simple models derived from the parental conflict hypothesis. The study provides experimental evidence for the parental conflict theory in plants and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of imprinted genes in response to parental genome imbalance.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the biophysical mechanisms underlying brain rhythms, but the functional role of these oscillations remains unclear. This study focuses on what brain rhythms reveal about functional brain connectivity, rather than how they emerge or whether they are necessary for neural function. The researchers used mathematical techniques to reverse-engineer network architectures that generate characteristic dynamics of actual brains, including spindles and sharp waves, which appear in the power spectrum as frequency bands superimposed on a non-oscillatory background dominated by low frequencies. The reconstructed networks display similar topological features and dynamics, suggesting that brain rhythms convey significant information about the functional connectivity of the brain.

The researchers also reverse-engineered putative diseased brains, including those with epilepsy and schizophrenia, and found consistent alterations of functional connectivity and dynamics. The complexity of the network, quantified as proposed by Tononi, Sporns, and Edelman, was found to be a good indicator of brain fitness, with virtual brains modeling diseased states displaying lower complexity than virtual brains modeling normal neural function. These findings have implications for the neurobiology of health and disease. The study demonstrates that the power spectrum of neural recordings conveys significant information about the functional, though not necessarily anatomical, connectivity of the brain.
Researchers conducted a population structure analysis of 1,374 unrelated Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) using approximately 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected for minimal linkage disequilibrium. The study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity and substructure within the Hispanic population in the United States. The participants were self-identified as coming from Central America, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South America. By projecting principal components of ancestry onto samples from the HapMap phase III and the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP), the researchers identified the first two principal components as quantifying Caucasian, African, and Native American origins. The third and fourth principal components revealed an axis aligning with the known South-to-North geographic location of HGDP Native American samples and further separated MESA Mexican versus Central/South American samples. Using k-means clustering, the researchers defined four subgroups of the MESA Hispanic cohort that showed close agreement with self-identification, labeling the clusters as primarily Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican. The study demonstrated the importance of considering population substructure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic association studies performed in the United States Hispanic population. The researchers also conducted pooled and stratified association analysis of triglycerides for selected SNPs in the LPL and TRIB1 gene regions, reporting statistically significant evidence for genetic association in both genes.
The Elongator complex, a six-subunit histone acetyltransferase, interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to regulate transcriptional silencing and genome stability in yeast cells. The Elongator complex, specifically its catalytic subunit Elp3, plays a crucial role in maintaining the silencing of reporter genes at the chromosome VIIL telomere and the HMR locus. Cells lacking Elp3 are sensitive to DNA replication inhibitors, such as hydroxyurea (HU), and DNA damaging agents, such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Mutations in Elp3 that compromise the formation of the Elongator complex also result in loss of silencing and increased sensitivity to HU and MMS.

The Elongator complex interacts with PCNA, a protein involved in DNA replication and repair, and this interaction is essential for its function. Epistasis analysis reveals that the Elongator complex and PCNA work together to maintain genome stability. The Elongator complex also interacts with histone chaperones, such as Asf1 and CAF-1, which are involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. The Elongator complex is required for S-phase progression in the presence of HU, indicating its role in DNA replication.

These findings suggest that the Elongator complex plays a novel role in transcriptional silencing and genome stability through its interaction with PCNA and histone chaperones. The Elongator complex is involved in multiple cellular processes, including DNA replication, DNA repair, and gene transcription, highlighting its importance in maintaining genome integrity.
Researchers have proposed a machine-learning assisted triage method to improve the efficiency of manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications. The traditional query-based method of retrieving relevant publications from PubMed often results in unsatisfactory precision and recall. To address this, the researchers trained deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using previously curated publications from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog. The trained models were then used to classify and rank new publications for curation. The method was evaluated on the real-world manual curation process of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, demonstrating that it outperformed the current query-based triage methods. The machine-assisted triage method achieved a precision 1.81 and 2.99 times higher than the current query-based triage methods of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. The method also retrieved many additional relevant publications that the query-based method of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot could not find. The results show that the machine learning-based method can make the triage process more efficient, allowing human curators to focus on more challenging tasks to improve the quality of knowledge bases.
This study investigated the link between gain-of-function mutations in the KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 channels and atrial arrhythmogenesis in short QT syndrome (SQT3), a condition associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). The researchers used biophysically-detailed human atria computer models to examine the effects of heterozygous and homozygous forms of the D172N and E299V Kir2.1 mutations on atrial electrophysiology. The models were modified to recapitulate the functional changes in the inward rectifier potassium current (IK1) caused by the mutations. The results showed that both mutations shortened the action potential duration (APD) and reduced the effective refractory period (ERP) and conduction velocity (CV), making the atria more susceptible to re-entry. The D172N and E299V mutations had distinct effects on IK1 and APD shortening, which influenced re-entry dynamics in 2D and 3D tissue models. The study found that combined block of IK1 and IKr was effective in terminating re-entry associated with heterozygous D172N conditions, while IKr block alone may be a safer alternative for the E299V mutation. Additionally, combined inhibition of IKr and IKur produced a synergistic anti-arrhythmic effect in both forms of SQT3. These findings provide mechanistic insights into atrial pro-arrhythmia with SQT3 Kir2.1 mutations and highlight possible pharmacological strategies for managing SQT3-linked AF.
Researchers investigated whether adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) can alter the course of Chagas disease, a complex disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy. Chagas disease is endemic in Central and South America and has been increasing in non-vectorial forms of transmission in developed countries. The study found that injecting ASC into mice infected with T. cruzi at 3 days post-infection resulted in a significant reduction in blood parasitemia, cardiac tissue inflammation, parasitism, and fibrosis at 30 days post-infection. This was accompanied by an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals, as indicated by cytokine release in cells isolated from the heart and exposed to T. cruzi antigens. In contrast, splenocytes from the ASC group released higher levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. At 60 days post-infection, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that right ventricular dilation was prevented in ASC-treated mice. The study suggests that the injection of ASC early after T. cruzi infection prevents right ventricular remodeling through the modulation of immune responses, protecting the heart from damage. The results indicate that ASC can interact with the immune system and contribute to the control of myocardial damage in Chagas disease.
Researchers have investigated the effectiveness of structurally optimized analogs of Retro-2cycl, a compound that inhibits the retrograde trafficking pathway, in limiting Leishmania infections. Leishmania parasites reside within parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs) in infected mammalian cells. Previous studies have shown that Retro-2, a retrograde pathway inhibitor, reduces LPV sizes and parasite numbers during Leishmania mexicana infections. The current study aimed to determine if analogs of Retro-2cycl, which have been reported to have superior potency in inhibiting retrograde pathway-dependent phenomena, are more effective than the parent compound in controlling Leishmania infections. Two optimized analogs, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1, were found to be more effective than Retro-2cycl in limiting Leishmania amazonensis infection in macrophages, with EC50 values of 13.63+/-2.58μM and 10.57+/-2.66μM, respectively. Additionally, these analogs caused a reversal of Leishmania-induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Furthermore, unlike Retro-2cycl, which is Leishmania-static, the analogs can kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures, a desirable attribute for a drug to treat Leishmania infections. These findings validate and extend the published structure-activity relationship analyses of Retro-2cycl.
Researchers have developed a computational method to predict which transcription factors are sensitive to nucleosome regulation, and applied it to the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1a (AML-1a) transcription factor. AML-1a is involved in regulating immune gene expression, including the Ly49 gene family. The study found that AML-1a binding sites are preferentially depleted of nucleosomes in expressed Ly49 genes compared to silent Ly49 genes. This suggests that nucleosome positioning may play a role in regulating Ly49 gene expression. The researchers used a cell line that naturally expresses Ly49 to confirm this finding, showing that AML-1a binding sites are depleted of nucleosomes in the promoter/enhancer regions of expressed Ly49 genes.

The study also found that many other transcription factors, in addition to AML-1a, may be sensitive to nucleosome regulation on a genome-wide scale. However, the accuracy of this prediction is limited, as it only accounts for genomic affinity for nucleosome binding and does not consider the action of chromatin remodeling factors. The researchers propose that their method could aid in understanding the regulatory role of nucleosomes in gene expression. Further study is needed to determine whether AML-1a's sensitivity to nucleosome regulation is specific to the Ly49 gene family or a more general phenomenon.
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a crucial role in orchestrating cell cycle progression, including genome duplication. The activation of CDKs depends on the phosphorylation of their T-loop by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, the only known CAK for CDK2 and CDK1 is cyclin H-CDK7, which is constitutively active. However, the activation of CDK4, a master integrator of mitogenic/oncogenic signaling cascades, is determined by the highly regulated T-loop phosphorylation at T172.

Research has shown that CDK7 inhibition prevents activating phosphorylations of CDK4/6, but this effect is partly dependent on CDK4's binding to p21cip1. In response to CDK7 inhibition, p21-binding to CDK4 increases concomitantly with the disappearance of the most abundant phosphorylation of p21, which is localized at S130 and catalyzed by both CDK4 and CDK2. The S130A mutation of p21 prevents the activating CDK4 phosphorylation, and inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 impairs phosphorylations of both p21 and p21-bound CDK4.

The study reveals a crucial but partly indirect CDK7 involvement in phosphorylation/activation of CDK4 and CDK6, the existence of CDK4-activating kinases other than CDK7, and novel CDK7-dependent positive feedbacks mediated by p21 phosphorylation by CDK4 and CDK2 to sustain CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUET/MMD1 that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during male meiosis in Arabidopsis plants. Meiosis is a critical process that produces haploid cells essential for sexual reproduction. In Arabidopsis, DUET/MMD1 acts as a transcriptional regulator, controlling the expression of specific genes involved in meiosis. The study found that DUET/MMD1 binds to a histone modification called H3K4me2, which is essential for its function during meiosis.

DUET/MMD1 is specifically expressed during the diplotene stage of prophase I and is required for proper microtubule organization during meiosis II. The researchers identified two genes, TDM1 and JAS, as targets of DUET/MMD1, with TDM1 being a direct target. TDM1 is involved in cell cycle transitions and spindle organization during male meiosis, while JAS is required for meiosis II spindle organization. The study found that DUET/MMD1 is necessary for the proper expression of a subset of meiotic genes, with about 12% of known meiosis-preferred genes showing reduced expression in the duet mutant.

The results suggest that DUET/MMD1 functions as a direct transcriptional activator of the meiotic gene TDM1 and plays a critical role in regulating microtubule organization and cell cycle transitions during male meiosis. This study provides new insights into the regulation of meiotic gene expression in plants and highlights the importance of DUET/MMD1 in specifying distinct male and female meiotic programs.
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by fragile X premutation rCGG repeats. Research has shown that these repeats can lead to neurodegeneration and that proteins such as Pur α and hnRNP A2/B1 can modulate this process. To further investigate the role of Pur α, a proteomic approach was used to identify over 100 proteins that interact with it. One protein of particular interest was Rm62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 RNA helicase, which can modulate rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration.

Studies found that fragile X premutation rCGG repeats decrease the expression of Rm62 post-transcriptionally, leading to the nuclear accumulation of Hsp70 transcript and other mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. This suggests that the abnormal nuclear accumulation of these mRNAs, likely due to impaired nuclear export, may contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis. The expression of fragile X premutation rCGG repeats significantly reduced the viability of heterozygous Rm62 mutant flies, indicating a strong genetic interaction between Rm62 and rCGG repeat-mediated neuronal cell death.

The nuclear accumulation of specific mRNAs caused by fragile X premutation rCGG repeats indicates a potential deficit in the nuclear export of these mRNAs, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of FXTAS. The decreased levels of Rm62 seen upon fragile X premutation rCGG expression may lead to impaired nuclear export of selective transcripts, such as Hsp70 mRNA, interfering with the neurons' ability to produce sufficient proteins to respond to cellular stress.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that forms environmentally and clinically relevant biofilms, has been studied to understand the development of its biofilm matrix. The extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of P. aeruginosa biofilms is a complex mixture of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. Researchers have directly visualized the product of the polysaccharide synthesis locus (Psl exopolysaccharide) at different stages of biofilm development. During attachment, Psl is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and assembly of a matrix that holds bacteria in the biofilm and on the surface. Chemical dissociation of Psl from the bacterial surface disrupted the Psl matrix and the biofilm structure.

During biofilm maturation, Psl accumulates on the periphery of 3-D-structured microcolonies, resulting in a Psl matrix-free cavity in the microcolony center. At the dispersion stage, swimming cells appear in this matrix cavity, and dead cells and extracellular DNA (eDNA) are concentrated in the Psl matrix-free area. Deletion of genes that control cell death and autolysis affects the formation of the matrix cavity and microcolony dispersion. These findings provide a mechanism for how P. aeruginosa builds a matrix and subsequently a cavity to free a portion of cells for seeding dispersal. The study reveals that Psl is a key scaffolding matrix component and opens up avenues for therapeutics of biofilm-related complications.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive study to assess the genetic similarity between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors and two types of preclinical models: patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO). The study analyzed 16 pairs of PDAC tumors and their matched PDX models, as well as a unique set of 5 "trios" consisting of primary tumors, PDX, and PDO. The researchers used whole-genome sequencing to compare the genetic profiles of the tumors and models, focusing on mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations.

The study found that PDX and PDO models successfully recapitulated the primary and metastatic disease at the level of simple somatic mutations in driver genes, but not across the greater expanse of annotated mutations. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events revealed previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes with clustered SV events. However, polyploidy presented a challenge when assessing copy number changes, but ploidy-corrected copy number states showed good agreement between donor-model pairs.

The study highlights the potential of PDX and PDO models as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC. However, these models may be more suitable for selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity. The findings suggest that PDX and PDO models can serve as valuable tools for identifying new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC, but their limitations should be considered when interpreting results. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic similarity between PDAC tumors and preclinical models, which can inform the development of more effective treatments for this aggressive form of cancer.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer in East-Asian women. The study included 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese descent. The researchers analyzed 690,947 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and identified a novel susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372, located near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene on chromosome 6q25.1. This SNP showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages of the study, with a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. The adjusted odds ratios for the A/G and A/A genotypes were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86), respectively, compared to the G/G genotype. Two other SNPs, rs9383951 and rs7107217, located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively, also showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk in each of the four stages. These findings provide strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372 and identify two possible susceptibility loci in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3. This study contributes to the understanding of the genetic factors underlying breast cancer risk in East-Asian women and highlights the importance of further research to identify additional susceptibility loci.
A study of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa found high levels of genetic diversity among the isolates, with 50 distinct sequence types identified. The isolates were grouped into three main molecular types: VNI, VNII, and VNB, with 72% of isolates belonging to one of seven "high frequency" sequence types. Analysis of the isolates' genotypes and clinical outcomes revealed a relationship between genetic lineage and clinical outcome, with patients infected with the VNB lineage having significantly worse survival rates. This association was maintained even after adjusting for known prognostic indicators and treatment regimen. The study also found evidence of lineage-associated virulence phenotypes, with the VNII lineage displaying increased laccase activity and ex vivo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) survival. These findings suggest that Cryptococcus neoformans is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen, and that genetic lineage plays a significant role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection. The study's results highlight the importance of understanding the genetic diversity of Cn in Southern Africa, which may help assess the risks posed by different ecotypes to infection. The study's findings have implications for the development of targeted treatments and prevention strategies for cryptococcal meningitis, a major cause of mortality in the developing world.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of the newly evolved signal transduction pathway that regulates the pheromone response of the white cell phenotype in Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen. This discovery provides a comprehensive description of the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of C. albicans and sheds light on how new signal transduction pathways may evolve. The pathway appears to have been derived from three different ancestral programs still functional in C. albicans, including the upstream portion from the opaque pheromone response pathway of the mating process, the transcription factor Tec1 from a filamentation pathway, and the white-specific downstream target genes from an ancestral biofilm process. The evolution of this pheromone response pathway in C. albicans may serve as a paradigm for how such signal transduction pathways evolve. The researchers used an overexpression library of 107 transcription factors and mutational analyses to identify Tec1 as the target transcription factor in the white cell pheromone response pathway. This study provides a unique perspective on the evolution of new signal transduction pathways and highlights the importance of identifying and interpreting the origins of components in young signal transduction pathways.
Researchers investigated the variation in genomic GC-content among 149 bacterial species, which ranges from less than 20% to over 70%. They examined patterns of synonymous polymorphism to test the hypothesis that this variation is due to differences in mutation patterns. The study found a significant excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations in GC-rich bacteria, but not in AT-rich bacteria. This excess is not consistent with mutation bias, as it would imply that GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content, which is unsustainable. The researchers also ruled out translational selection and biased gene conversion as explanations, as optimal codons tend to be AT-rich and the excess of GC→AT SNPs is observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. Therefore, the study concludes that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated with genomic GC-content, the researchers further conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria. The study's findings suggest that the variation in genomic GC-content among bacteria is not solely due to mutation bias, but rather is influenced by selective pressures.
Researchers have developed a new approach to map the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in Kenya, using data from 945 cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1974 and 2009. The study aimed to identify areas where the combined prevalence of hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura exceeded 20%, the threshold for intervention. Bayesian space-time geostatistical models were used to estimate the probability of infection prevalence exceeding 20% across the country for 1989 and 2009. The models were developed using ecological and climatic covariates extracted from high-resolution satellite data and matched to survey locations.

The results show that in most areas of Kenya, the endemicity of STH infections was below the 20% threshold in 2009, with areas of high prevalence located around Lake Victoria and the coast. Comparison of the predicted distributions for 1989 and 2009 indicates a gradual decrease in observed STH prevalence over time. The model estimated that approximately 2.8 million school-age children live in districts that warrant mass treatment. The study suggests that a quarter of Kenya's school-aged children live in areas of high prevalence and require mass treatment.

The researchers used Bayesian space-time geostatistical models to reliably estimate the combined observed prevalence of STH and provide decision-makers with accurate information to prioritize districts for targeted control programs among school-aged children. The study's findings can be used to refine decision-making in helminth control as control efforts are successful in reducing infection levels.
Researchers investigated the role of innate immune cells, specifically invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. They established an in vitro system to study the interaction between Mtb-infected macrophages and splenocytes from uninfected mice. The results showed that splenocytes produced interferon-γ (IFN-γ) when cultured with Mtb-infected macrophages, leading to suppressed bacterial replication. This innate control of bacterial replication was dependent on CD1d-restricted iNKT cells, which required CD1d expression by infected macrophages and the presence of IL-12 and IL-18.

The study found that iNKT cells, even in small quantities, were sufficient to restrict Mtb replication. Adoptive transfer of primary splenic iNKT cells from uninfected mice into mice infected with virulent Mtb significantly reduced the bacterial burden in the lungs. This suggests that iNKT cells have a direct bactericidal effect, even in the absence of synthetic ligands such as α-galactosylceramide. The study provides the first evidence that CD1d-restricted NKT cells mediate protection against Mtb in vivo.

The researchers also investigated the role of other innate lymphocytes, such as NK cells, in controlling Mtb infection. They found that NK cells became activated and produced IFN-γ early after Mtb infection, which is critical for activating macrophages. Blockade of IL-12 or IL-18 abrogated control of bacterial replication, indicating that iNKT cell activation and control of bacterial replication depend on both IL-12 p40 and IL-18.
Bacillus subtilis endospores are highly resilient due to their complex protein coat, which is stabilized by covalent bonds formed by a transglutaminase called Tgl. Unlike other transglutaminases, Tgl is produced in an active form, raising questions about how its activity is controlled during spore coat assembly. Research has shown that substrates assembled onto the spore coat prior to Tgl production govern its localization to the surface of the developing spore. The interaction between Tgl and its substrates is crucial for its localization, with the glutamyl (Q) side of Tgl being more important than the lysil (K) side. The first step in the reaction cycle, the interaction with Q-substrates and formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate, is also the determinant step in the localization of Tgl. Tgl becomes part of the cross-linked products during the reaction, suggesting that it exerts a "spotwelding" activity, cross-linking pre-formed assemblies. The dependency of Tgl on its substrates is used to accurately control the time, location, and extent of its activity, ensuring the covalent fortification of pre-assembled complexes at the surface of the developing spore. This substrate-dependent localization may be the primary mechanism to ensure proper temporal and spatial control of spore coat protein cross-linking, and may also control the activity of Tgl orthologues in other spore-forming bacteria.
A study was conducted to investigate the spatial distribution and risk factors of Opisthorchis viverrini infection in southern Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Opisthorchis viverrini is a food-borne trematode species that can cause biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma. The study aimed to map the distribution of O. viverrini in Champasack province, identify underlying risk factors, and predict the prevalence of O. viverrini at non-surveyed locations. A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was conducted in 51 villages in Champasack province in 2007. Data on demography, socioeconomic status, water supply, sanitation, and behavior were combined with remotely sensed environmental data and fed into a geographical information system. Bayesian geostatistical models were employed to identify risk factors and investigate the spatial pattern of O. viverrini infection. The prevalence of O. viverrini among 3,371 study participants was 61.1%. The study found that age, Lao Loum ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation, and unsafe drinking water source were risk factors for infection, while history of praziquantel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater bodies were protective factors. Spatial patterns of O. viverrini were mainly governed by environmental factors, with predictive modeling identifying two different risk profiles: low risk in the mountains and high risk in the Mekong corridor. The study presents the first risk map of O. viverrini infection in Champasack province, which is essential for spatial targeting of control efforts.
In the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the urban drain network plays a significant role in the larval development of mosquitoes that transmit lymphatic filariasis and malaria. A study analyzed data from the Urban Malaria Control Program and a special drain survey conducted in 2006 to understand the importance of drains as larval habitats. The results showed that over 70% of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam are human-made, with drains being the most common type, accounting for 42% of all aquatic habitats. Drains with stagnant water were found to have a higher presence of Anopheles and Culex larvae compared to those with flowing water, with odds of 8.8 and 6.3 times larger, respectively. Vegetation was also found to be positively associated with the presence of mosquito larvae. Spatial analysis revealed a correlation between the proportion of habitats with mosquito larvae. The study suggests that restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam has the potential to eliminate over 40% of all potential mosquito larval habitats that are currently treated with larvicides by the Urban Malaria Control Program. The findings highlight the importance of human-made larval habitats for both lymphatic filariasis and malaria vectors, underscoring the need for a synergy between ongoing control efforts for these diseases.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection has been found to up-regulate the activity of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a key enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, through the impairment of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. This up-regulation of HMGCR leads to an increase in cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is necessary for the formation and maintenance of DENV replicative complexes. The study used enzymatic assays, ELISA, and Western blotting to demonstrate that DENV infection results in a significant increase in HMGCR activity, which is associated with the inactivation of AMPK. The activation of AMPK by metformin was found to decrease HMGCR activity, suggesting that AMPK inactivation mediates the enhanced activity of HMGCR. Furthermore, the study found that HMGCR and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, indicating a role for HMGCR and AMPK activity in the formation of DENV replicative complexes. The use of metformin and lovastatin, an HMGCR inhibitor, disrupted this co-localization and replicative complexes formation, supporting the idea that active HMGCR is required for replicative complexes formation. Additionally, metformin was found to have a significant dose-dependent antiviral effect, while compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, augmented viral genome copies and the percentage of infected cells. These findings suggest that DENV infection increases HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complexes formation. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism during DENV replication and identifies new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication.
Researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to study the process of tRNA translocation on the ribosome, a crucial step in protein synthesis. The study aimed to bridge the gap between kinetic measurements and the underlying energy landscape of the process. By analyzing the dynamics of an intact ribosome, the researchers identified collective reaction coordinates that capture essential motions during tRNA translocation, including 30S-body rotation, 30S-head swivel, and tRNA displacements. These motions are critical for protein elongation in the cell.

The researchers used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 70S ribosome to estimate the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates. This allowed them to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape, providing an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation. The study found that many residues undergo coordinated displacements, reminiscent of rigid body movement, and that the ribosome functions as a "thermal ratchet machine," where random energetic fluctuations lead to large-scale diffusive configurational rearrangements.

The study establishes a quantitative framework for understanding and interpreting data related to tRNA translocation. This framework can be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions of other biological processes, including those with multiple intermediates and transition states. The findings provide new insights into the dynamics of the ribosome and the process of tRNA translocation, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying protein synthesis.
Researchers have investigated the genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a rare malignancy that accounts for up to 3-5% of thyroid cancers. They analyzed 84 MTC tissue samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues using a comprehensive genetic testing panel. The study identified 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes, with the most common mutation occurring in the RET proto-oncogene, found in 47 cases. Other frequently mutated genes included those encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threonine kinase 11, and v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog.

The researchers also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement using immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH, and further analysis revealed two distinct ALK fusions: GFPT1-ALK and EML4-ALK. The EML4-ALK fusion was found in a metastatic MTC case that showed a dramatic response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. This suggests that the EML4-ALK fusion may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target for ALK inhibitors. The GFPT1-ALK fusion may also be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy. The study's findings provide new insights into the genetic landscape of MTC and highlight the potential for targeted therapies in the treatment of this disease.
In a study conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India, researchers investigated the role of asymptomatic leishmaniasis in the spread of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) in a region with a high prevalence of these diseases. A total of 2,603 individuals from eight tribal villages were screened for antileishmanial antibodies using rapid diagnostic kits, and 185 were found to be positive. Of these, 96 had a history of VL/PKDL, while 89 did not. Seventy-nine individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis cases, and 10 were diagnosed with active VL. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was 7.9:1.

During a three-year follow-up period, 8 out of 77 asymptomatic cases (10.39%) developed symptoms of VL or PKDL, while 62 (80.52%) showed sero-conversion. Seven individuals (9.09%) remained seropositive after three years. The study found that asymptomatic individuals can progress to clinical disease at any time up to three years after the initial survey. The researchers emphasize that the presence of asymptomatic cases does not necessarily mean that an area is free from leishmaniasis, as symptomatic cases can appear even after three years. Therefore, asymptomatic infected individuals require attention in the VL elimination program initiated by three neighboring endemic countries. The study highlights the importance of monitoring asymptomatic cases to prevent future epidemics.
Researchers used a technique called Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze genome rearrangements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of yeast, caused by the presence of a repetitive retrotransposon called Ty912. They found that the distribution of translocations induced by Ty912 was nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes, despite the presence of 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S. cerevisiae genome. The majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination, but a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements were also observed. These RAD52-independent translocations did not require the Rad51 or Rad59 homologous pairing proteins or the Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease complex that processes branched DNAs during recombination. The researchers also found that defects in ASF1-RTT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 (H3K56) resulted in increased accumulation of both genome rearrangements and whole-chromosome duplications, leading to aneuploidy that tended to occur simultaneously with genome rearrangements. The study demonstrated that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of genome rearrangements and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote genome rearrangements and aneuploidy.
Researchers have developed a new method for predicting how two proteins interact with each other, a process known as protein docking. This method, called Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation (SDU), uses a mathematical approach to find the most energetically favorable positions and orientations of two proteins. The method is based on the idea that the interaction between two proteins is driven by a "free energy funnel," a concept similar to the folding of a single protein. SDU uses a general quadratic function to underestimate the energy of local minima and then uses this underestimator to bias further sampling. However, applying SDU directly to the space of rotations and translations is challenging due to its geometry. To overcome this, the researchers introduced a strategy that separates the search space into three independent variables: side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance, and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules. This approach vastly improves the efficiency of the search and allows the method to explore the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima. The results show that SDU can generate docking predictions with high accuracy, achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods. The successful application of SDU to protein docking further validates the assumption that the free energy landscape of the complex is a funnel in some neighborhood of the native state.
